[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Brian Applegarth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the founder and the executive director
of the CCTA.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were established in 2017, and we work
to promote the development of safe and
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible cannabis tourism, unify the
cannabis and the travel industries,
[SPEAKER_00]: advocate for enabling regulatory
environments, and promote best practices
[SPEAKER_00]: in the space with a unified cannabis
tourism voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our three core pillars are advocacy,
education, and networking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanted to start out really talking
about cannabis tourism markets that
[SPEAKER_00]: currently already exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took a look at Amsterdam as well as
Colorado, and we wanted to share three
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of data points that we collected.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as Amsterdam, you can take a second
and kind of review these and read through
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and I'm going to speak to them here
while we do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Dutch Tourist Information Office
reported that essentially one in four
[SPEAKER_00]: people that visit Amsterdam actually visit
a cannabis coffee shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as part of the destination experience
and part of the visitor draw for that
[SPEAKER_00]: market, 10% of those travelers actually
willingly cite that visiting a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee shop in Amsterdam was a primary
reason for their visitation to the
[SPEAKER_00]: destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at Colorado recently did some
research in the last two or three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we look at Colorado, they looked
at it kind of seasonally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They looked at both the winter season and
the summer season travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And across both, it pretty much averaged
out between 15 and 16% of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: interested travelers that came to Colorado
visited a marijuana dispensary store while
[SPEAKER_00]: visiting, 15 to 16% of visitors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they did a demographic shift in the
cannabis motivated audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they noticed that that audience spends
more and stays longer in destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what we're looking at
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is cannabis tourism?
[SPEAKER_00]: We really wanted to pause kind of up front
here and let us all get in the right kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of mind space and start imagining what
cannabis tourism is currently,
[SPEAKER_00]: where it came from to now, and what it's
going to be like going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to really understand cannabis tourism
in California, you have to start with
[SPEAKER_00]: medical leaders.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started legalization in 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 1996, Proposition 215 passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was the first time we saw the
medical traveler really start arriving in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now cannabis played a vital role on the
front lines of the AIDS epidemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then other research came out about
glaucoma and even helping with nausea and
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of underground medical
traveler started arriving in California to
[SPEAKER_00]: access cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a gray market, kind of quasi-legal
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the first we saw kind of
medical travelers showing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then between 1996 and 2018,
you had this market that was the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana market of California called the
Compassionate Use Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compassionate Use, you may have heard that
term recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're using that term with COVID-19
right now in creating medications to
[SPEAKER_00]: address the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the same thing during the AIDS
epidemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Compassionate Use Act really
positioned cannabis as what it has been
[SPEAKER_00]: for generations, which is a medical
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that drew visitors to our state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now between 1996 and 2018 in this
quasi-legal market, you had people started
[SPEAKER_00]: arriving as well that were
business-minded.
[SPEAKER_00]: They saw that cannabis was on a trajectory
to eventually go legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people started showing up and wanting
to learn more about the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2007, in Oakland, California,
actually, Oakster Dam University started,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is kind of the most well-known
cannabis college just right here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this kind of business traveler
or even cannabis enthusiast that relocated
[SPEAKER_00]: to California to get involved in the
medical marijuana market between 1996 and
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you hit 2018, you have the
adult use medical legalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: or excuse me, the adult use market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is essentially the recreational
cannabis market some refer to as.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where anyone 21 and up is able
to legally purchase and consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has regulations, testing standards,
and it really starts attracting more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: leisure traveler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now another interesting pivot that
happened in 2018 directly ties into the
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacious testing standard of the
regulated cannabis industry we have today,
[SPEAKER_00]: which essentially is a tier of the supply
chain that ensures that the products that
[SPEAKER_00]: you buy from a licensed dispensary in
California is tested for parts per
[SPEAKER_00]: billion, which is a very severe testing
standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they know the medicine is clean,
that there's no kind of pollutants in it
[SPEAKER_00]: or things that are bad for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even now, the medical tourism draw does
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fully recognized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know leisure is a lot of the focus,
but this medical draw as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially with the testing standards of
the legal cannabis adult use market,
[SPEAKER_00]: continues to speak to the medical
traveler.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was important to just kind of go
through that process from 96 to now to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that there's a medical
traveler, a business traveler,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a leisure traveler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this list of cannabis tourism is just
some of the current offerings that exist
[SPEAKER_00]: in our state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously agritourism, cannabis is a
plant, it is a crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis largely leans into wellness,
which is why that is highlighted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is used as a tool to promote
well-being.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as the dosing is correct and it's
grown the right way and it's clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: it is very much in line with wellness.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's guided tours that are operated
daily from San Diego up to Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a handful of members that are in
that space at the CCTA.
[SPEAKER_00]: A real exciting evolution is the
California Cannabis Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of great work done by
the CDFA, the Mendocino Appalachians
[SPEAKER_00]: Project, the International Cannabis
Farmers Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's groups that are working on
building the cannabis Appalachians of
[SPEAKER_00]: California, and right now they're building
out kind of the regulatory framework of
[SPEAKER_00]: what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have CBD Massage and Spa
Services.
[SPEAKER_00]: A really cool product we have in
California is the Prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: Storytelling, just like the tunnels to the
liquor and the beer smuggling that happens
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have infused dining experiences where
people have curated dinners and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: walked through not only the food and how
cannabis is used in the food, but where it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from and which Appalachian or which
part of the state that the flower is grown
[SPEAKER_00]: and who grows it and how they grow it,
and also how they cure it, which we'll get
[SPEAKER_00]: to later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have cannabis lounges popping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some that are down in Palm
Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one that is open outside Santa
Barbara.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have these kind of communal
consumption spaces that are emerging,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as a cafe that popped up in West
Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are just at the beginning and really
frankly need to move quicker with creating
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption areas for people and
communicating around what that means and
[SPEAKER_00]: where people can use cannabis confidently
and know it's safe and legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously with cannabis, you have guided
pairings and tastings.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have creative kind of endeavors like
puff and paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visiting a cannabis shop, just like the
Amsterdam data point showed, people are
[SPEAKER_00]: curious to actually go into a legal retail
experience and see what that feels like
[SPEAKER_00]: and know and understand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immersive edutainment, you know,
in this early phase, a lot of people are
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on education and wanting more
information around cannabis hemp and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So being kind of over investing on
education for people is is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also have the connoisseur,
which goes into a whole line of
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates and other kind of products
with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get really geeky about kind of what
type of concentrate it is, how it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sourced.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's what is the efficacy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it single source?
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis, one reason it's so
complicated is because it really tentacles
[SPEAKER_00]: out and do a lot of different products and
different and it speaks to a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different audiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, too, we have the cannabis
movement that happened right here for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical legalization, which really,
you know, we already have that tourism
[SPEAKER_00]: asset, which is the hate Ashbury in San
Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that talks about that cannabis story.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's not told is the story of the back
to the land movement and the migration up
[SPEAKER_00]: north and living off the land and
communities off the grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's as compelling and interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you start learning about,
you know, the movement of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: including what happened in San Francisco
with the epidemic, which was the platform
[SPEAKER_00]: that allowed it to be medical legalized,
you start kind of seeing this California
[SPEAKER_00]: story emerge of marginalized groups and
cannabis is threaded throughout.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also kind of dates back to the beat
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an opportunity to breathe some
new life into that storytelling as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we all know how important storytelling
is to to for marketing, to bring people
[SPEAKER_00]: here and want to experience something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, that ties into culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And last but not least is events.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the Emerald Cup, which is one of
the if not the premier cannabis event in
[SPEAKER_00]: California in in December, will draw will
bring in about 17 to 20 million dollars in
[SPEAKER_00]: direct spending to Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a big opportunity for
cannabis events to be an economic driver
[SPEAKER_00]: for destinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This slide is just more inspirational kind
of photographs, really kind of showing you
[SPEAKER_00]: the diversity that cannabis and CBD
tourism has.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, upper left corner there,
you have Dennis Perrone and Brownie Mary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a that's a story in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's but that's part of the culture and
the historical movement and storytelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, obviously, yoga, meditation,
mindfulness, spa treatment, CBD infused
[SPEAKER_00]: massages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the two gentlemen taking a selfie
in a in a cannabis cultivation area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the photo on the
right with a group enjoying kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: family style fine dining course meal
that's probably cannabis infused or CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: infused, where you have the chef as well
as a sommelier there to walk them through
[SPEAKER_00]: the experience and make sure they
understand the dosing and the effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And use it kind of as as edutainment,
an educational tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be inhalation or non
inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll get to that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a lot of different types of
products and ways to curate.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sure most of us have heard of the
Emerald Triangle region of northern
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Emerald Triangle is a three county
region up in its north of Sonoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's Humboldt, Mendocino and Trinity
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really famous for world class
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a region where small farmers have
been perfecting their cannabis craft for
[SPEAKER_00]: generations, not only underground,
but many of them off the grid and really
[SPEAKER_00]: people that value low impact on the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's really interesting methods of
agriculture and farming that have come out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the underground cannabis community that
they're extremely excited to build into
[SPEAKER_00]: the tourist experience, get people's hands
in the dirt and teach them how to create
[SPEAKER_00]: these ecosystems that are built on
biodiversity and regenerative agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: and these other terms that are part of the
cannabis cultivation culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to thank Flo Khanna.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flo Khanna is the largest distributor in
California, and they support these legacy
[SPEAKER_00]: small farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I'm going to move on to the next
slide, which is cannabis consumption and
[SPEAKER_00]: dosing cannabis 2.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has come a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really, cannabis 2.0 goes beyond the
inhalation style of consumption,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is still a core part of the cannabis
industry and the cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this new evolution, there's all
kinds of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a simple slide showing that,
you know, for tourism for tourists and
[SPEAKER_00]: visitors to our state, you know,
there's going to be many options of how
[SPEAKER_00]: they're able to consume cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's drinkables.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's topicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's transdermal patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's intimacy products.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's sleep chocolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all certain there's all different
kinds of products that are largely based
[SPEAKER_00]: in a effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what really makes cannabis
interesting, is it's an effect based
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, comparable not necessarily
to the buzz of wine, but it cannabis has
[SPEAKER_00]: its own quote unquote buzz that has a
different feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can really lean into creativity or
intimacy or other effects, feelings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's really about getting the
dosing correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every day we're getting better and
better on the dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is largely with the THC molecule
that that's a little more controversial
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's a psychoactive component of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's many different dosing options.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's different kinds of products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also the packaging is going
mainstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you see in this photo, there's all
sorts of packages and brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have brands like Francis Ford Coppola,
like Lagunitas beer that are now rolling
[SPEAKER_00]: out their cannabis lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sophistication is increasing and
it's going to make it more accessible
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's relatable to the new
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a simple slide is Globetrender,
which essentially does travel trend
[SPEAKER_00]: forecasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just shows that there's been quite
a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been quite a bit of media coverage
the past kind of 12 months to two years
[SPEAKER_00]: around cannabis and CBD tourism and how
it's becoming a more sophisticated kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: destination product that's appealing to
luxury leaning travelers as well as budget
[SPEAKER_00]: travelers speaks to a lot of different
audiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: They rank number nine for the 2020 travel
trend forecasts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also seen cannabis tourism be
covered in Forbes, wine enthusiasts,
[SPEAKER_00]: the travel channel and other mainstream
outlets that just shows that it's that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's becoming further and further
normalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that we should look at
with more attention as we are in our third
[SPEAKER_00]: year of legalization here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also a close up of a cannabis
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis is actually a flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of different kinds of
cultivars or varietals of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's high CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ones that are kind of more
balanced, like 10 percent, 10 percent CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: to THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's ones that go through the
roof up to 30 plus percent of THC count.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet again, these cultivars,
just like varietals of wine, have like
[SPEAKER_00]: different balanced taste, mouthfeel.
[SPEAKER_00]: These cultivars of cannabis, which is the
kind of the the the word for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars like synonym to wine varietal,
is it really leans into different kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: effects as well as smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a really complex plant
and really fun to curate those experiences
[SPEAKER_00]: in tourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the CCTA really we live at the
intersection of the tourism industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really work to build bridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we started in 2017, the goal is
to really get a seat at the table with the
[SPEAKER_00]: travel industry of the state and start
educating and normalizing and just working
[SPEAKER_00]: toward cannabis being understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So different destinations and states and
stakeholders could figure out how cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp or CBD could fit into their
destination and speak to an audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is two kind of high level
definitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tourism industry is travel for
pleasure or business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the practice of touring and the
business of attracting, accommodating and
[SPEAKER_00]: entertaining visitors, travelers and
tourists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabis industry refers to all
activities and professionals that are
[SPEAKER_00]: involved directly or an ancillary role to
the legal production transport,
[SPEAKER_00]: say sale and consumption of cannabis or
hemp, as well as the product, services and
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences derived from or centered
around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the convergence of these two industries
is where the CCTA lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We engage consistently with the California
Hotel and Lodging Association,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cal Travel Association, Visit California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I consider those three groups to
really kind of carry the torch for
[SPEAKER_00]: California tourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are a resource to them as well as
our members in helping build bridges and
[SPEAKER_00]: creating opportunities and educating so we
can so we can understand what we have with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in California as a California
destination asset for market to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to speak a little bit more to
the difference between Cal Travel and
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit California and the California Hotel
and Lodging Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the California Hotel and Lodging
Association basically helps address the
[SPEAKER_00]: diverse needs of the hotel and hospitality
industry in the state of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit California is the marketing
organization that works to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: visitation to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically kind of an economic
development vehicle with tourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the California Travel Association
is the united voice of the California's
[SPEAKER_00]: travel and tourism industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And their mission is to protect and
advance the travel and tourism industry's
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of advocacy that happens
under Cal Travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for example, last year, we actually
were in Sacramento as part of the lobby
[SPEAKER_00]: day or the advocacy day with Cal Travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the year before that, the CCTA
actually showed up independently and took
[SPEAKER_00]: meetings to make people aware that we were
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what our mission was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we have a few more data points
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really focused around California's
tourism industry and how important it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, nearly $145 billion in travel
related spending in 2019 in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, another important data point
here is the fourth one down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that six out of every $10
spent in visitor destinations was
[SPEAKER_00]: attributable to out of state or
international visitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, this shows the case that
tourism is an economic driver and
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly relevant for the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now here's California's cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why this is relevant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a couple other data points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Retail sales grew from 2.5 to 3.1 billion
in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the traditional market sold an
estimated 8.1 billion in 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that statistic is interesting because
the traditional market is essentially the
[SPEAKER_00]: black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's sensitivity around the use
of that word.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that shows the gap and kind of the
battle that's upon the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: To really try to capture more consumers
and bring them into licensed retail shops,
[SPEAKER_00]: buying safe tested medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the CCTA really works to steward that
as well and support the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another data point here is the cannabis
industry impact could be nearly 10 billion
[SPEAKER_00]: by 2022.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis and hemp derived CBD products
combined could reach 20 billion in sales
[SPEAKER_00]: by 2024.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of the fastest growing
segments.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this just shows the economic relevance
of the cannabis and the CBD and hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I want to point out that CBD is an
interesting term because it really
[SPEAKER_00]: overlaps between the hemp and the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have different types of CBD
products from full spectrum to broad
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum to isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've even heard live spectrum is a new
category that's growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the cannabis industry and
the hemp industry, along with the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: craze, continues to trend up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having that merge in with California
cannabis tourism, again, is our mission
[SPEAKER_00]: and something worth discussing and moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, this slide, I really wanted
just to acknowledge that tourism in
[SPEAKER_00]: California and travel, there's really an
ecosystem that is established from market
[SPEAKER_00]: to market, including throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have hotels, attractions, restaurants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have, you know, everything from
Airbnbs, bed and breakfast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have different types of museums and
there's certain markets and certain
[SPEAKER_00]: operators or businesses within those
markets where speaking to the visitation
[SPEAKER_00]: and the tourists to their market is a core
part of their business model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're in a phase right now where
cannabis operators that understand this
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity can build bridges and educate
and reach out and find their spot within
[SPEAKER_00]: that tourism ecosystem, which is already
in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice to the right of the slide,
you know, there's a there's a kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: portion that shows the DMOs, which is the
destination, the destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: DMO stands for Destination Marketing
Organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And essentially each destination from San
Francisco to Palm Springs, to San Diego,
[SPEAKER_00]: to Oxnard has their destination pillars of
kind of what they how they position as a
[SPEAKER_00]: destination for travelers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question is, how is cannabis and
CBD and hemp going to exist market by
[SPEAKER_00]: market throughout the state?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the DMO is largely similar to
what Visit California does for the state
[SPEAKER_00]: of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DMOs in each market or the CBDs,
they try to attract visitation by
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing within their pillars of their
destination to get people to visit and
[SPEAKER_00]: spend money and experience the culture and
come visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanted to lay that out and
really paint the picture that with
[SPEAKER_00]: lounges, deliveries, as well as cannabis
shops and, of course, tour companies and
[SPEAKER_00]: infused dinners and the list we had prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of ways to plug in
for people who are interested in being
[SPEAKER_00]: part of this cannabis tourism evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to dive now into the core
pillar of the CCTA is advocacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an advocacy update.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the last three kind of initiatives
that we worked on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most recent one is we signed on to a
funding request that was spearheaded by
[SPEAKER_00]: Cal Travel, which is basically requesting
45 million allocation for Visit California
[SPEAKER_00]: to run a marketing campaign as the state
reopens and gets Californians back
[SPEAKER_00]: traveling and back to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that was actually submitted
yesterday or today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the CCTA is right there alongside the
other kind of tourism stakeholders
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few months back, prior to COVID,
we we put some energy into trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: breathe some new life into SB 625.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, SB 625 originally was a bill that
would permit cannabis charter party
[SPEAKER_00]: carriers provided that the vehicle was
equipped with appropriate ventilation
[SPEAKER_00]: standards to assure that the drivers are
not exposed to secondhand smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was an effort to allow the
inhalation component of the of of tours,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis tourism to exist on a vehicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are tour companies that were
kind of first movers in the market that
[SPEAKER_00]: invested in retrofitting or building out
their vehicles to accommodate this as it
[SPEAKER_00]: was written.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which now it's on shaky ground and all but
off the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to pick that back up once
we're past COVID.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we see an opportunity here to have
some of the operators who are members of
[SPEAKER_00]: the CCTA to potentially put forth an
option of having them grandfathered in in
[SPEAKER_00]: a certain limited number of people who are
operating prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also opening up the conversation
of, you know, what about drinkables?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about edibles?
[SPEAKER_00]: What about these other consumption methods
that aren't inhalation based?
[SPEAKER_00]: And being able to use those on carriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are that's SB 625 speaks to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also recently, the CCTA submitted comments
around the proposed Appalachians,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the CDFA put those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went through a comment period.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had three comments that we submitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: One was a tour based system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, we recommended reconsidering,
creating a structure that was more deeply
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Including the unique impact of the earth,
sun and air and the differentiating
[SPEAKER_00]: factors and cannabis cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second point was labeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we recommended that an Appalachian and
a county of origin be prominently
[SPEAKER_00]: displayed on a label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Working toward marketing and really
thinking of the international market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does that sound like when people
want to buy the best California bud or pot
[SPEAKER_00]: or cannabis from Humboldt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Mancino or Trinity County?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the third comment we submitted
was about the cost of petition and the
[SPEAKER_00]: amendment fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, it was twenty thousand plus
dollars for the petition, the Appalachian
[SPEAKER_00]: petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was ten thousand plus dollars
to simply make an amendment every single
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we came in and basically stated that we
feel the fees were excessive, that they've
[SPEAKER_00]: created unfair financial barriers
essentially for the small legacy cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers and that we recommended that the
fees be lowered or reconsidered depending
[SPEAKER_00]: on kind of a sliding scale on how big the
outfit was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I'll get to this later, but we have
set up a new Slack channel that you're all
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be invited to that has these
comments and a lot of the other documents
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'll be walking through where you can
look at them in greater detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second pillar is networking of the
CCTA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, we try to foster an
environment where our members can network
[SPEAKER_00]: together and they can network with,
you know, with with other organizations,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first envisioned the CCTA,
it was 50 percent membership from the
[SPEAKER_00]: travel tourism industry, 50 percent
membership kind of from the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and trying to have a blend so we
could have really great conversations and
[SPEAKER_00]: have different points of view and be
educating each other in a very reciprocal
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to welcome Amanda Ryman as our
featured guest today, also on the board of
[SPEAKER_00]: the CCTA.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's the VP of Community Development at
Flocona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, welcome, welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for being our special guest
today, Amanda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's my pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm happy to be here and thanks everyone
for joining.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to say watching who's all in the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like so many people that I love from
the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm so glad that you all are here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Amanda, will you just kind of give
some background?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been in the movement a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just love you to give this
audience is largely from the travel
[SPEAKER_00]: industry as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you could just kind of give some
context of who you are and your role in
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of the cannabis movement to now
and then what you do for Flocona,
[SPEAKER_00]: that'd be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a public health researcher and
social worker by training.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started studying the cannabis
industry and movement when I was getting
[SPEAKER_01]: my PhD at Berkeley in social welfare back
in 2005.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I did my doctoral dissertation on how
medical cannabis dispensaries were
[SPEAKER_01]: operating as community health service
providers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's important because
folks who don't remember or weren't really
[SPEAKER_01]: involved back then, the dispensaries
really played a huge role in community
[SPEAKER_01]: connection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's important when we
talk about tourism now, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really what is at the heart of California
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that that was something that I
noticed early on was very, very unique
[SPEAKER_01]: about the California cannabis atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after I graduated, I continued to
teach at Berkeley, but I started working
[SPEAKER_01]: for Berkeley Patients Group as their head
of research and patient services to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to do research looking at things
like cannabis substitution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they got shut down by the federal
government in 2002.
[SPEAKER_01]: 2012, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I left there and I went to
work for the Drug Policy Alliance as their
[SPEAKER_01]: manager of marijuana law and policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my focus has always been the
relationship between cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really the relationships that I'm
most interested in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after legalization, I had an
opportunity to move up to the Emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: Triangle to Mendocino County to work with
Flocona on creating centralized
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution for small, independently
owned cannabis farms up in this region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the community aspect was really
taking front and center, which is my jam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what I love to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I came up here to work in community
development.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you know, not just the
cannabis, but the cannabis and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's why the tourism is so
interesting to me, because it's really an
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to bridge cannabis with so
many other wonderful things about
[SPEAKER_01]: California that I think can really be a
unique draw for folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Amanda.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, the Emerald Triangle region
of Northern California is often spoke
[SPEAKER_00]: about like it's the Bordeaux, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bordeaux of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a world-class producing region.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a place of source.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what role do you feel like this region
will play in the California tourism
[SPEAKER_00]: landscape in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that there's kind of a
two-stage outcome there.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first is what we could do when
California can only produce and consume
[SPEAKER_01]: weed in California, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's definitely a barrier to
realizing the full potential of the
[SPEAKER_01]: Emerald Triangle and the Appalachian
systems until we can ship it outside of
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that, you know, step one is the
development relations, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're working on, and then it's really
thinking about the brand of the Emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: Triangle as a region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thinking about not just the individual
counties, but the ethos of the area and
[SPEAKER_01]: how we turn that into a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think, you know, putting that
brand out there and marketing that brand
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to want to come here to
experience what's so unique about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: production in the Emerald Triangle,
along with everything else the Emerald
[SPEAKER_01]: Triangle has to offer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is so unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a potential there,
but I think, you know, until we can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually share the product with people in
Michigan and with people in Nebraska and
[SPEAKER_01]: with people in Virginia, we're only going
to be able to capitalize on a small
[SPEAKER_01]: portion of the full potential of the
Emerald Triangle region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is the culture and history of the
California cannabis movement important to
[SPEAKER_00]: include as part of the visitor experience
for people interested in experiencing
[SPEAKER_00]: California cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yes, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the culture and the history of
cannabis in California is a cornerstone of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis tourism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And without it, honestly, I feel like the
tourism experience would be pretty much an
[SPEAKER_01]: empty shell.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a couple of reasons for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, we owe it to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We owe it to the folks who stuck their
necks out and got arrested and put
[SPEAKER_01]: everything on the line for us to have a
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a discussion about cannabis in
California without including them in their
[SPEAKER_01]: stories, I would never, I mean,
that would be very disrespectful to people
[SPEAKER_01]: who have worked so hard to make this
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also think that from a consumer
point of view, connection and story is
[SPEAKER_01]: what makes something real for someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I grew up in Chicago and I grew up
going to museums there, the Museum of
[SPEAKER_01]: Science and Industry and the Field Museum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what really brought those museums to
life were experiential opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So opportunities to have visceral context
and visceral experiences that really
[SPEAKER_01]: brought the history to life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it connected with you on a very
personal way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like in here in California,
what we have that a lot of states don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have when it comes to cannabis history is
that really big emotional connection to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant and what it has meant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to have a tourism industry in
California that doesn't include
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities to learn about the past,
isn't, again, doing a service to what it
[SPEAKER_01]: means to be involved in cannabis in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also losing out on a really big
opportunity to change hearts and minds
[SPEAKER_01]: about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the opportunities I've always
seen for cannabis tourism in California is
[SPEAKER_01]: to invite people from prohibition states
to come here and experience cannabis in a
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful, spiritual, highly connected,
safe way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that the cannabis tourism industry in
California was almost a gatekeeper to that
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that folks could come here and they
could just eat, you know, a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams of THC and have a Marine Dowd
experience and be in their hotel room
[SPEAKER_01]: freaking out and go back to Iowa and talk
about how legalization was the worst thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that's ever happened any place.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they could come and go to a beautiful
farm and get to put their hands in the
[SPEAKER_01]: dirt and get to have a lightly infused
meal and get to tour some lounges and
[SPEAKER_01]: really learn about cannabis and go back to
wherever they're from and talk about what
[SPEAKER_01]: a wonderful experience it was and question
why they have prohibition in their state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a really powerful tool when
people feel it inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what sharing the culture of
cannabis in California will do with
[SPEAKER_01]: tourism if we do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how many stories I've
heard of people just coming and
[SPEAKER_00]: accidentally taking too much because the
communication and the kind of information
[SPEAKER_00]: campaigns just aren't there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really hoping that we can move that
forward here in 2020 and 2021 to give
[SPEAKER_00]: visitors the information they need to be
able to have that right dose and that
[SPEAKER_00]: right experience here if they decide to
use THC and go beyond the CBD massage that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're already doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about Flocona, you know, you guys have
a great property in South Mendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the gateway to this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious what the vision is for the
future of tourism according to Flocona and
[SPEAKER_00]: how they intend to reach visitors that are
coming to our state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as we're going to talk about in the
next section around COVID, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely some reimagining that's
happening when we think about what the
[SPEAKER_01]: future of tourism is going to be,
at least in the short to medium term,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what kind of experiences people are
going to want to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And before I talk more about Flocona's
vision, one of the things I've been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: recently is doing interviews with tourism
operators in the space to get a better
[SPEAKER_01]: sense of how they're pivoting during COVID
and what they see for the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though finance is definitely a
concern and a barrier moving forward,
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm hearing is almost a bigger
barrier is the psychology around travel
[SPEAKER_01]: and what people are going to be
comfortable with and what they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be comfortable with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a big conversation to be
had.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about the future of tourism,
about what is going to feed into people's
[SPEAKER_01]: fears and what is going to make them feel
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things we have going for
us in the Emerald Triangle, of course,
[SPEAKER_01]: are these beautiful wide open spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not a congested area.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of room for people to hike
and for people to camp and still maintain
[SPEAKER_01]: safe social distancing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of that being said, when we think
about the future of tourism and what
[SPEAKER_01]: Flocona would like to see, I think we are
of the mindset, come for the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: stay for the regenerative agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see this as an opportunity to hook
people in with an interest in cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: in seeing cannabis farms, but then using
that as an opportunity to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable and environmentally sound
cultivation of food in general and of
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino County banned GMOs a long time
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the first place to take that
step.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that they have capped their farms
at 10,000 square feet, although that might
[SPEAKER_01]: change, has shown what they view as
special about the way people farm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, you know, of course,
with the solar living center property that
[SPEAKER_01]: you were referring to in Hopland,
it's an opportunity to have a
[SPEAKER_01]: demonstration garden and to have gardening
classes and to allow people to come up,
[SPEAKER_01]: get their hands on the soil, learn about
regenerative farming practices,
[SPEAKER_01]: take those practices back to where they're
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: More people are growing food than ever
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're starting to see victory gardens pop
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are looking for opportunities to
learn sustainable food production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the Emerald Triangle is
one of the most amazing places to learn
[SPEAKER_01]: about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and it also happens to have some of
the best cannabis in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think Flo Khanna would really like to
see the marrying of those two,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, interest groups, especially
given that the farmers we work with,
[SPEAKER_01]: so many of them, if not most or all of
them, are growing food in addition to
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and are using regenerative
methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's so much that folks can
learn just because of their interest in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can come away learning about
integrated pest management and good soil
[SPEAKER_01]: health and water reclamation, which is
something that they may have come up never
[SPEAKER_01]: expecting to learn about and thinking that
they were just going to go tour a really
[SPEAKER_01]: cool cannabis farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I'm going to take this
opportunity as well to talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: product makers and the alchemists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like there's the communities that
rally around not just the cultivation,
[SPEAKER_00]: but all the different kind of disciplines
and specific craft that that has evolved
[SPEAKER_00]: because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's also an incredibly unmind
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it comes to a traveler wanting to
experience that, I will also say as
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who's traveled myself that when I
go up to Mendocino and humble,
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly have that aesthetic as if I
visited a foreign country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is absolutely a compliment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really unique culture with an
immense.
[SPEAKER_00]: The presence of nature is really intense
and the way people think and talk and act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it really kind of scratches that
ish as the international traveler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's amazing that we have,
you know, this region that offers that
[SPEAKER_00]: that happens to also grow world class
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it all goes back to when you start
watching the kind of the movement from the
[SPEAKER_00]: hippie movement to the back to the land
and understanding kind of the solar and
[SPEAKER_00]: all those things that tie into living off
the grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a really fascinating
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a tour operator from Brazil and
who would like to know what's the best way
[SPEAKER_00]: to convince regular tourists what's the
best way you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to translate this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the best way to draw tourists from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because obviously this is a great question
because it speaks to multi markets and
[SPEAKER_00]: their role in tourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question essentially is how do we
speak to tourists that arrive in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: or S.F.
[SPEAKER_00]: and draw them up to the Emerald Triangle
and work collaboratively with these kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of gateway cities?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think that, you know, again,
it's not just the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of things that folks are
looking to do nowadays when they travel.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to necessarily go to one
location and just sit there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking to have different
experiences.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think putting packages together that
include Emerald Triangle related
[SPEAKER_01]: experiences like white, you know,
river rafting and hiking and biking and
[SPEAKER_01]: camping and, you know, stargazing and
foraging and, you know, mushroom hunting
[SPEAKER_01]: mushroom hunting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting things that are really great
at the Emerald Triangle and you pair that
[SPEAKER_01]: with a cannabis experience, then you're
you're kind of a step above all the other
[SPEAKER_01]: tour companies that are doing the cannabis
experiences and that are just packaging
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things we did last November
pre-COVID, which seems like a million
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago, but we had a mushroom feast at
Solar Living Center and we did some CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: and mushroom cocktails, not psychedelic
mushrooms yet, cocktails.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did a infused dinner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Emerald Farm Tours brought up a group
and it made it part of a Mendocino
[SPEAKER_01]: weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there was a craft beer
festival going on that weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was the tours of the Redwoods that
were available.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they stayed at a great location
that was in the middle of the forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went to the coast, which is like a
whole other world than inland and
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's about not just focusing on
one particular experience, but trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: create a package that speaks to a grand
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the pull to the Emerald Triangle is
that it's just a very unique place
[SPEAKER_01]: geographically, visually.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you said, it feels like you're in
another country.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm looking out my window right
now and I kid you not, there is a gigantic
[SPEAKER_01]: rainbow that's stretching across the
entire valley as I sit here and talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's like a daily occurrence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is something really special about
being up here that will appeal to folks
[SPEAKER_01]: who want to experience all sides of
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, Amanda, one more question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had come in asking about tour companies
specifically and what can they expect when
[SPEAKER_00]: engaging with farms that are also
enthusiastic about tourism?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are maybe three to five tips you have
on how to facilitate those kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: partnerships for tour companies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so a couple things for tour
companies that I found that were a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit confusing in the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis is a seasonal plant and it's
an annual.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not like grapevines where even
when the plant isn't fruiting,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still in the ground and looking like
cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I would have tour companies
that would want to go visit farms in like
[SPEAKER_01]: January or February.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just, people are going to be
disappointed because you have,
[SPEAKER_01]: so you want to manage expectations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and folks who come up to see
farms want to see gigantic eight foot
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's what they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what that's like the money shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thinking about whether farms that
you're working with have that to offer and
[SPEAKER_01]: what do they have to offer from a visual
perspective?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they have to offer that's unique?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, I'll call out Johnny
Casale because I saw him on here at
[SPEAKER_01]: Huckleberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are a fish friendly farm,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have this big pond.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a bunch of fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like that's a unique aspect to their
farm that is a selling point for for tour
[SPEAKER_01]: companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say, you know, be really clear
with the farmer about what they've got
[SPEAKER_01]: going on and what are the expectations of
your group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, be very respectful
about what the farmers protocols are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you might say, hey, they're asking us
to do X.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the law doesn't require that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do it anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is their farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're under huge, huge stress to bring a
clean product to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that clean product is going to be
worth way more to them than your one tour
[SPEAKER_01]: person who decided that they want to touch
all the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just be very respectful and recognize
that the farmer really needs to lead and
[SPEAKER_01]: the tour company is there to kind of be a
observer of the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally, think about what else
there is around the farm and how easy it
[SPEAKER_01]: is to get to farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, some farms are beautiful,
but they are a 20 minute drive on a gravel
[SPEAKER_01]: road up the side of a mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as a tour company, think about
who's your client tell, how comfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: are they going to be with getting out and
walking around in the dirt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or would they rather visit a place,
you know, that is a little bit less
[SPEAKER_01]: gritty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really matching who your clientele is
with what the farm experience is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it really all starts and ends
with the farmer and what they feel
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable with and how they would like
to showcase their farm to the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much, Amanda, for the
insight.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the one other thing I want to
mention while we're on this topic is I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: very excited for the curing process to
become as compelling and people become
[SPEAKER_00]: more aware of all the really unique,
you know, farmer to farmer craft of how
[SPEAKER_00]: you harvest and actually cure cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going to pay to trim weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking about this earlier today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks, they pay to stomp grapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will absolutely pay to trim bud and
take it with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that whole, you know,
pick your own, trim your own model is I
[SPEAKER_01]: see it as a being a very, very lucrative
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Amanda.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to move on to the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate you being here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next slide is about the impact of
Covid-19, which we all know has had an
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely devastating effect on the
tourism and travel industry for the
[SPEAKER_00]: nation, not just California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice that some of these data
points are from the national lens,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's because it is an all hands on
deck situation from hotels to airlines to
[SPEAKER_00]: D.M.Os.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom has dropped out and I also want
to take this opportunity to acknowledge
[SPEAKER_00]: the amazing work and be in witnessing the
work that U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Travel Destinations International,
Civitas, MMGY, California, Cal Travel,
[SPEAKER_00]: Visit California, the California Hotel and
Lodging Association have been relentless
[SPEAKER_00]: in coming together and providing amazing
information and insights that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: week by week on all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this slide, though, obviously shows
that it has been devastating for the
[SPEAKER_00]: travel industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five hundred and nineteen billion decline
in spending in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: this year with a total economic loss of
one point two trillion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it shows the gravity of the
situation at hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, I'll move to the next slide
so we can talk about the next phase we're
[SPEAKER_00]: moving into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this next slide talks about the most
recent research for the tourism and travel
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the data shows that, you know,
people are looking at road trips,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're looking to travel to destinations
closer to home and will likely be wanting
[SPEAKER_00]: to drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be at least two,
three and most of four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking at the drive market or
drive in visitation for the tourism and
[SPEAKER_00]: travel industry here in California,
as well as nationwide and probably around
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: In recent polls, 79 percent of travelers
say that they will change their travel
[SPEAKER_00]: plans over the next six months,
probably shifting a lot of that away from
[SPEAKER_00]: airlines, even more so toward toward
drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And 55 percent say the pandemic will
greatly impacted travel currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the good news on the last data point is
the week ending in May 2nd, the travel
[SPEAKER_00]: economy witnessed its first expansion in
nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still registered pretty low compared
to last year, but it shows that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully starting to turn in the right
direction and kind of correct course.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so now we're at the education
pillar for the CTA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, we're going to focus in now on
traveling in the age of covid-19.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do two or three slides that
are dedicated to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in short, those who adapt will survive
and eventually thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Health and safety is top of mind for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the quote necessity is the
mother of of invention or innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, the need is to be safe and
feel safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we all need to be highly
focused and adapting right now for this
[SPEAKER_00]: next phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, technology is going to become
more of an amenity than it was prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: covid-19.
[SPEAKER_00]: The less human interaction is going to be
perceived as a better guest experience in
[SPEAKER_00]: the short term, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the long term is to be
determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So travelers are expecting high touch,
high tech protocols, health related
[SPEAKER_00]: products and procedures, hand sanitizers,
disinfectants, face masks, health checks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things need to be adapted and evolve
into something that is low touch,
[SPEAKER_00]: that embraces the social distancing model
and really is a prevention plan for
[SPEAKER_00]: covid-19.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nearly two and three travelers say that if
travel economy doesn't take health
[SPEAKER_00]: considerations seriously, they are likely
to withhold future purchases.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, that communicates to any
business at the intersection of travel and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or the travel industry in general
that adopting and adapting right now is
[SPEAKER_00]: incredibly important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to point out the travel in the new
normal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This document is one of the I think one of
the most thorough, well put together
[SPEAKER_00]: publications I've seen come out from U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is also going to be in the Slack
channel that you will all be invited to
[SPEAKER_00]: join if you would like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that goes into much more detail of
kind of what businesses can do to adapt to
[SPEAKER_00]: the current landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so health and safety, develop and
promote a gold standard, covid-19
[SPEAKER_00]: prevention plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one is create transmission barriers
to adopt, adapt operations, modify
[SPEAKER_00]: employee practices and redesign public
spaces to help protect employees and
[SPEAKER_00]: customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two is enhance your sanitation,
travel business should adopt and implement
[SPEAKER_00]: enhanced sanitation procedures
specifically designed to combat the
[SPEAKER_00]: transmission of covid-19 and also promote
health screening measures for employees,
[SPEAKER_00]: isolate them if they feel sick,
symptoms and be able to provide health
[SPEAKER_00]: resources to your employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of the bullet points on the right
hand side speak to screening process for
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature or doing an onboarding kind of
brief three question Q&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you feeling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been around somebody with
covid-19 in the last 24 hours,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw an interesting suggestion of safety
as an amenity where actually creating an
[SPEAKER_00]: amenity bag that includes gloves,
hand sanitizer and face masks that let's
[SPEAKER_00]: say it is a tour company or a hotel guest
that they are provided upon arrival that
[SPEAKER_00]: is part of the service that they get
engaging with your business and also
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding what your third party
suppliers are doing and what their safety
[SPEAKER_00]: measures are currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can really look at your supply
chain and know that it's a thoughtful kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of new model that speaks to the pandemic
that we're in the midst of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, this is the marketing and
communication front.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you have your SOPs and your
standards recalibrated, it's really being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to communicate that gold standard for
safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Communicate it to your employees,
communicate it to your customers and let
[SPEAKER_00]: them know that you are taking the
appropriate measures to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they are safe and they feel safe and they
are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be sensitive in your
communication and be not sure to overstep.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to build trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, data suggests that travelers are
ready to hear about travel now that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have hopefully bottomed out and now
they're ready to start slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: considering what the next trip is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to approach them in a thoughtful and
empathetic way is kind of a good messaging
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy for now with a call to action
that needs to be conveyed very carefully
[SPEAKER_00]: but can't exist at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're past crisis mode, as the data is
showing, so having a careful call to
[SPEAKER_00]: action built into your messaging is now
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But being able to communicate your gold
standards of what procedures you've
[SPEAKER_00]: implemented, your amenity bag,
use that in your marketing and
[SPEAKER_00]: communication going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you know, the data consistently
shows that drive market visitors are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be at this phase one, which is not
shocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people are going to want to stay
close to home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen a few different kind of mileage
recommendations throughout all the
[SPEAKER_00]: webinars I've been on in the past eight to
nine weeks and they average out to about
[SPEAKER_00]: 125 miles from your place of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as targeted marketing,
that would be who you want to be looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at and trying to reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this slide is about B2B talking points.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cannabis hemp and CBD being as
confusing and exciting as it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's really four talking points here
that I want to communicate to everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: about why cannabis is a tourism asset.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is cannabis is essential and
this was recently designated here in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a lot of the conversation right now
in the travel and tourism industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: around being open to rethinking the
framework of the funding of the
[SPEAKER_00]: destination marketing organizations and
how the ecosystem helps to fund the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing for any destination,
whether it's Mendocino, San Diego or LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis being an essential service is
an interesting evolution because that
[SPEAKER_00]: means that as far as a funding source
through an assessment, that cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: arguably a bit more stable than other
businesses that have not been deemed
[SPEAKER_00]: essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the fact that cannabis is essential is
a new, is possibly something to consider
[SPEAKER_00]: as we develop the new marketing funding
framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being inclusive of essential
businesses like cannabis to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the first talking point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second talking point is travelers are
interested from cannabis with THC to the
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD infused topical massage from that's
hemp derived.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's new and it's exciting and
it's a growth markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's continuing to trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the data shows that economically and
with consumer interest and it promotes
[SPEAKER_00]: well-being, which was one of kind of the
key trends that was here even prior to
[SPEAKER_00]: COVID-19 in the travel and tourism
industry, is this sense of wellness and
[SPEAKER_00]: being a conscious traveler and having low
impact on when you travel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis ticks a lot of those boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a medicine and being something that
promotes well-being, cannabis can really
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of find its place in the California
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's a CBD infused massage for
a destination or for your business,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you could speak to whatever
consumer you're trying to reach the
[SPEAKER_00]: audiences are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third talking point is cannabis is
collaborative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cannabis tourism is a tide that
lifts all boats in the tourism ecosystem
[SPEAKER_00]: of a destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why is because cannabis is
effects based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having cannabis, you know, at the right
dose, 30 minutes or an hour, or even 20
[SPEAKER_00]: minutes, if you're inhaling it prior to a
dining experience is going to amplify and
[SPEAKER_00]: enhance that experience to make it more
memorable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing with creative pursuits,
museums, art exhibits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis has this ability to really
have amazing collaborative partners in
[SPEAKER_00]: their destination and create bundled
packages in ways that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemental to breathing life and
increased spending in other businesses
[SPEAKER_00]: that are part of that tourism ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or for example, on this slide,
I put, you know, a live music show with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is different than without.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it comes down to dosage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, making sure you're dosing and
making sure you dose it correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like with alcohol, you don't have too
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have the right amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fourth talking point is cannabis is a
tourism asset.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's new and exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these cannabis related products,
services, and experiences are not
[SPEAKER_00]: maximized and they're economic drivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So between those four talking points,
I urge you to engage with your local
[SPEAKER_00]: community, um, with your local government,
and to start communicating the value of
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD hemp and cannabis tourism and start
identifying assets or develop an asset
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself, or continue to polish your
cannabis business to be a valued asset as
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the tourism ecosystem of your
destination.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So three key takeaways.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to have to distill this down
into three key takeaways, number one is
[SPEAKER_00]: drive market visitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So adopt your model to really target the
drive in visitor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two is health and safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to recalibrate from employees to
customers and communicate that extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively, um, in your marketing
communications, which leads to number
[SPEAKER_00]: three to engage and educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you have your new health and
safety kind of COVID-19 landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, operations implemented, um,
to be able to educate and engage through
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing or through advocacy to your
local government or to your potential
[SPEAKER_00]: customers, what you have done to respond
as a business to be able to continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: function in a safe way, um, in today's,
uh, today's, today's landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this touches a bit back on resources
that I've mentioned, um, in the Slack
[SPEAKER_00]: channel that we've created, uh,
that everybody is going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: access.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this is the CCTA open resource Slack
channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're starting to kind of file things
under hashtags, financial research,
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing, and advocacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yet again, I want to thank all the
logos that are on this slide and beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's been such an amazing thing to
witness the travel industry come together
[SPEAKER_00]: at, from the national level to the state
level, um, to provide quality information
[SPEAKER_00]: and real time data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as we navigate this very strange time,
um, there's publications that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: selected and uploaded to that Slack
channel from different organizations that
[SPEAKER_00]: we felt really spoke to our membership
base.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so you can find that on the Slack
channel if you decide to join.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will continue adding to that as we,
as we further go into this rebound and
[SPEAKER_00]: recovery phase of the travel industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, the CCTA does have a bi-monthly
newsletter, which you will all be getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could easily opt out of it if you
would not like to receive it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The newsletter will be going out in,
uh, June, August, October, and December.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically the off months from the
virtual events, you'll be getting a CCTA
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, in that newsletter, you will see what
the July date is for the next virtual
[SPEAKER_00]: event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also I want to take this opportunity
to talk about a new initiative that's
[SPEAKER_00]: coming together this year for the CCTA,
which is the first annual, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: California cannabis tourism report,
uh, published by the CCTA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have a couple of contributing,
different contributing organizations and
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that are going to be part of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we also are conducting our own
research, which Amanda alluded to earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we do plan on publishing this in
August, um, and it's going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehensive overview of the state of
cannabis tourism in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look forward to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we're going to cross our fingers and
shoot for July so we can include those
[SPEAKER_00]: insights.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be a big part of our next
virtual event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but we've set it for no later than
August and you'll get updates in the
[SPEAKER_00]: newsletter and on the Slack channel about
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the, um, second to last slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really it's just a recap of five kind
of key points that we covered through this
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one is through the end of 2020,
most of our services and virtual events
[SPEAKER_00]: are available to anybody interested in
cannabis tourism and the CCTA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please feel free to share this with your
network and invite anybody that you think
[SPEAKER_00]: would find this interesting or valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mentioned that it's in mid July,
Jared Kyla will be on our next,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, virtual event.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'll be featured as Amanda was today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I mentioned that you are going to be
receiving the bi-monthly newsletter and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can opt out if you want, if you'd like
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will also be receiving an invite,
an invite to join that Slack channel that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kept referring to, referring to
throughout this presentation called the
[SPEAKER_00]: open resource Slack channel of the CCTA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, that will include all kinds of
resources and information and research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And final reminder that the CCTA cannabis
tourism summit will take place on November
[SPEAKER_00]: 19th in San Francisco at Hotel Zeppelin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please mark your calendars and we hope
to see you all there in person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and hopefully you get a break from the
virtual event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and with that, we can move on to the
last slide and possibly take a couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have about 12 to 13 minutes left here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, before we do that, I want to,
you know, thank Yvonne Brown and Event
[SPEAKER_00]: High.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, this presentation would not have
happened without either of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, Yvonne's company is LCA travel and
events.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend it.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a pro.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's organized and it's been an honor
working with you on this Yvonne.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also Event High for providing the
platform and working with someone like me
[SPEAKER_00]: who's technologically challenged to try to
coach me to be able to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, thank you both for your effort and
hard work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really, really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CCTA board really appreciates it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have any questions, you can email
me brian at cannabistourismca.org or hit
[SPEAKER_00]: me up in the Slack channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also one final thank you to all the
different travel organizations that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been providing these webinars and these
white papers and this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last nine weeks, it's been really
eye-opening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, really understanding how seeing the
community come together, the travel
[SPEAKER_00]: industry come together and support each
other through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that note, I'm going to take a look
and see if we have any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One question is, does anyone have any idea
on how to monetize virtual cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: travel?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a great question, especially right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if there's anybody, any brands,
any companies that are sitting on digital
[SPEAKER_00]: content, that hasn't been maximized.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that's part of reaching your
customer and folding in your COVID-19
[SPEAKER_00]: messaging strategy, um, in tandem with
this content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, one of the recent kind of,
uh, audiences that I spoke to the
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiasm of seeing a cannabis grow and
experiencing what a tour would be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, was a very high interest and brought a
lot of smiles to people's faces in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think having bite-sized video or
photographs with storytellers telling
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps, uh, you know, getting on a,
on an interview, maybe you interview one
[SPEAKER_00]: of your past passengers so they could
storytell about the experience as you show
[SPEAKER_00]: photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, and can you monetize it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, I mean, I, again, technologically
challenged.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand fully the ad space and
things like that, but I know that there's,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you get the right amount of traffic,
you can through, through advertising and
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, also just straight entry fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a 30 minute experience with a
Q and a, with a cultivator, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps people are willing to pitch up
five bucks to be able to access that,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially if it's somebody who is well
recognized or an influencer in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis space or is doing something very
unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when I was speaking over in Europe
last year, there's definitely California
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators and breeders that are
well-known internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, a lot of them are right up here from
Northern California, Swami select Frenchy
[SPEAKER_00]: cannoli.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you know, uh, there's, um,
uh, Kevin Jodri.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was a handful of people that
kept getting asked about when I was over
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would look at people in cannabis who
are the thought leaders of their
[SPEAKER_00]: respective craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And potentially there's a collaboration
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, this next question is, can you share
your thoughts about cannabis Appalachians
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis tourism?
[SPEAKER_00]: I look at cannabis Appalachians as one of
the key pieces of infrastructure for the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of California, for California
cannabis tourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think that Appalachians are going to
give us that foundation to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: market from and be able to give these
small legacy farmers a platform to speak
[SPEAKER_00]: to their craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's, and they're small batch kind
of Northern California grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Appalachians is going to be an all
tides rise kind of play as that comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and that's going to become a key
tourism asset for the state of California
[SPEAKER_00]: to draw visitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt and Mendocino both already have
brand equity internationally as the best
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation spots or growers, um,
in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's how do we build off of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we take the brand equity of the
Emerald triangle of humble of Mendocino?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we fold it into a way where it
really fits into the California brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do it in a way that's based in
wellness, in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that allows for storage
storytelling about Californians and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we did it and why we did it and
all the values that kind of go along with
[SPEAKER_00]: that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so I think the Appalachians is an
incredible platform for obviously place of
[SPEAKER_00]: origin, but also a platform to tell about
life under prohibition, just like the
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnels in Chicago or in new Braunfels,
Texas, where they used to smuggle alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: from, you know, bar to bar restaurant to
restaurant when, when alcohol was illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a lot of interesting
storytelling to mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the Appalachians first and
foremost will be about terroir and
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start listening to the
stories of the people that are the fabric
[SPEAKER_00]: of the culture up there, um, it's just a
well of, of incredible storytelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one is how can I become involved
as a volunteer support CCTA as an
[SPEAKER_00]: individual, not a business?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, please email me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are forming committees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we are constantly growing this model
and looking for people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiastic about the cannabis tourism
opportunity for our state and for your
[SPEAKER_00]: local market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, we have discussed kind of having,
uh, other, you know, sub associations,
[SPEAKER_00]: around the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if you have an interest,
please email me directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me more about yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know what your interest is and what
you're passionate about as an individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of ways to get involved from
content to support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a 501 C six nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we work hard as an organization to
really help steward this evolution of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis tourism in California,
the more hands on deck, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come in, come with passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll find a spot and, uh, and if you are
a business, our membership typically,
[SPEAKER_00]: of course it's open to everybody through
year end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our, most of our membership
services are open to, to anyone through
[SPEAKER_00]: year end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple that will not be,
um, but in a typical year, the membership
[SPEAKER_00]: start at $250 for your membership.
[SPEAKER_00]: First businesses with 25 employees or less
for those with 25 employees or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously it's $5,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want brands that really value,
the tourism opportunity and then are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to engage with the travel industry of the
state and become models and examples of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of how cannabis tourism will evolve and is
evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we're really excited to get as
many people involved as are willing and
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this together where we can all have
really healthy communication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can make this everything that it
should be, uh, for California as a,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a tourism asset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, let's see, I think we have time for
one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one was, do you provide education
on how to start a tourism association to
[SPEAKER_00]: other states?
[SPEAKER_00]: The answer is currently no, but we have
been contacted by kind of tourism,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis tourism thought leaders in other
countries, as well as other states that
[SPEAKER_00]: are very interested in what we're doing
and wanting to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so if you're interested in discussing
that and perhaps helping steward that we
[SPEAKER_00]: do have a model that we've been working on
since November, 2017 when we started and
[SPEAKER_00]: we had a lot of learnings in that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of great information in that
time, um, that we've banked and it would
[SPEAKER_00]: be a great initiative to start thinking
about how do we expand?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get this into other states and
how do we support each other and trade
[SPEAKER_00]: information?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last question I'm going to answer
is if the social distancing goes on for a
[SPEAKER_00]: year, how can we bring people into our
venues?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is the social distancing model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's a place for it,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that there's certain travelers
that are ready to have a bit more space
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and have it be in less crowded areas
and to have these exclusive experiences,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's in a retail shop or whether,
you know, it's having tables space,
[SPEAKER_00]: six to eight feet apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, or whether it's, you know,
in nature experience, like Amanda spoke
[SPEAKER_00]: about, um, where there's plenty of wide
open spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: In nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's really getting creative
and understanding that social distancing
[SPEAKER_00]: model and, and traveling in the age of
COVID-19 is, is a very unique landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's, it also opens up opportunities
to innovate and differentiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as you're willing to adapt and
really dream about your model in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I think it's all about that kind of
ingenuity and creativity and then being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to adequately market and message
about that, uh, to your customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, I'll say, you know,
cannabis tourism is very new.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it includes CBD and includes
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hemp can replace plastics and
paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD is non-psychoactive and it's pretty
much every spa now has a CBD infused
[SPEAKER_00]: massage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course you have the cannabis,
the licensed regulated cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: with THC consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very new space and we all
have the responsibility to educate each
[SPEAKER_00]: other on the travel industry side,
as well as the cannabis side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's through healthy conversation
and discussion that we can really steward
[SPEAKER_00]: this forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's models where you don't have to
have inhalation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to have high THC products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you're a hotel.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a hotel in Sacramento contact me
about eight months ago that simply wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand how they could implement
hemp into their hotel to raise the level
[SPEAKER_00]: of sustainability that they're currently
operating at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very exciting space with a lot
of different conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just encourage all of you to engage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and finally, just thanks again for
being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: What a great turnout.
[SPEAKER_00]: We look forward to hopefully seeing all of
you in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, you'll be getting those emails,
newsletters, the invites to the Slack
[SPEAKER_00]: channel, and thank you all so much for
showing up and being interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look forward to next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Okay.
