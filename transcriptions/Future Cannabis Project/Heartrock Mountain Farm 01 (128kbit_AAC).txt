[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Daniel Morford, and we're at
Heart Rock Mountain Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I grew up.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I was actually born.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just going to be doing some
filming this season to kind of introduce
[SPEAKER_00]: you to different stages of the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with Future Cannabis Project
and Pride of the Lions Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's beginning April now, and the
cover crop is blooming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our nursery is going along,
and we're just going to do a little
[SPEAKER_00]: walkthrough of our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to start over here with
some nice hugelkulturs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right behind me we have, hidden
somewhere in the mustard and radish,
[SPEAKER_00]: 280 feet of hugelkulturs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we buried logs two foot deep and three
foot trenches and piled up logs and
[SPEAKER_00]: branches five feet high and covered them
with soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are three years old this year,
and it's an exciting year because year
[SPEAKER_00]: three, you get a nice terpene spike.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, since we've gone no till,
everything's been increasing in terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess that goes along, since we got
our Dragonfly Earth Medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: certification, the same strains every year
have been going up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of our stuff testing around 3%
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to see if those trends keep climbing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have artichokes, we have comfrey,
we have a variety of cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some fava beans here,
a nitrogen fixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just going to find a little
place here and take a peek.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's been so dry, it's hardly
rained too much the past couple months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, soil so dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing the mustard's kind of carried
on here, but it will be chopping and
[SPEAKER_00]: dropping and composting right after to fix
as much of those nutrients as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the honeybees are really going
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some nice poppies coming up in the
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go plum tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got some little rosemary bushes planted in
front of here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this side of our farm here we call
plum tree path.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gets like the late season sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is where we'll probably be growing
the original haze this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where we grow like the Swazi gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we might be growing some of the
healer one-to-one from Dragonfly Earth
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this
[SPEAKER_00]: is our big field here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are on 15-foot centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see the stalks of the
sunflowers from last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are kind of marking our flower
belts that we will be seeding with flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: and veggies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we'll grow the big
girls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's one of the potatoes we planted a
few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We seeded the whole farm this year with
potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next couple of years we'll have
hundreds of pounds of potatoes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if there's a rodent, they'll go
for a potato over cannabis roots or
[SPEAKER_00]: stalks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just an easy companion plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this climate, when you harvest the
potatoes, you can just scatter them right
[SPEAKER_00]: there in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to wait till after the
winter because it doesn't get cold enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a yellow dock.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It brings up high-end trace minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's native here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is hollyhock behind it,
which is a good pollinator-friendly plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: like beneficial native pollinators and
honeybees like the hollyhocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always like to see what flowers are
attracting, what pollinators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And trying to grow a diversity of flowers
and stuff that'll bloom more or less
[SPEAKER_00]: year-round and seeing what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, my dad bought this place in 1976
or 77, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost hard to see the shape of the
farm with how high the cover crop is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this road we plant wraps all the way
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are terraces here that we built.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which was really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a log deck up there and just cut
and rolled logs down a couple of us and
[SPEAKER_00]: got them in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely have some videos of some of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another set of terraces.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are probably some of the smaller
spacing on the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think these are like six foot spacing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most things 10 to 12 foot spacing just to
give us the room for airflow for the
[SPEAKER_00]: polyculture potential around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here we got the two-centinel dug
fir trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watching over the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Sunset Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is more of a spiral garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Starting here on Kwan Yin, it does like
two spirals of cannabis planting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of diversity that's hidden
under this cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some grapes, a lot of different
varieties of flowers and yarrows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have some young guava trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and here's a nice pollinator.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see these blue flowers that are
opening up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although there's like eight plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Nickname Bee's friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget this actual name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're a wildflower that we sowed
that just keeps coming back, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a nice little patch of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see some beneficial insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see hoverflies, honeybees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's at least three different types of
pollinators on these right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are crossing the threshold of the
expansion that I've done to the original
[SPEAKER_00]: Heart Rock Orchard founded, or as my dad
calls it, the Homestead Orchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my dad planted that Jonathan tree and
those two fig trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the road used to come up through here
where the apple tree is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The younger fruit trees are mostly planted
by me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here under the cover crop,
there's about 40 plots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we'll be doing the autoflower
hybrid seed production here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're successful, we'll be making 120
new flavors of autoflower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this yellow delicious also has all
kinds of, there's some beetles on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple types of winged insects,
honeybees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That literally looks nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, there's a bumblebee too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a celestial fig tree over
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually some of my older brother's
ashes are buried under that celestial fig
[SPEAKER_00]: tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and then wild elderberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a raspberry here behind us and an
apple tree behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: More apple trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, this is not as open as it
was when like my father was farming here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like here where these fruit trees are and
the raspberries and the apple trees was
[SPEAKER_00]: all kind of coyote brushed with a little
bit of raspberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And up where those nursery hoops are,
it's more, that was also kind of brushed
[SPEAKER_00]: and thinly open space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that before we converted this
upper part of it to a nursery,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the original homestead garden,
you know, could affect like 75 well spaced
[SPEAKER_00]: big plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's our main propagation hoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just the style that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start in four inch pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: These over here, we'll get up potted into
one gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have begun the phase to a pot from one
gallons into five gallons, five gallons
[SPEAKER_00]: into the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's those original haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at the very thin leaves on those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at our elevation here, we are in a
slight banana belt for the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you go up 500 feet or down
500 feet, you have to deal with like
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier frosts in the fall, later frost in
the spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we should be able to pull those
November hazes in no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a hoop house full of one
gallons to go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, now we can do a little
loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, we can show it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we got the ones getting into five
gallons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to point out that where that
apple tree is behind me is approximately
[SPEAKER_00]: where my mom's water broke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was born just up there in the old
cabin site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this slope is going to be fun to watch
unfold this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've grown auto flowers here in the past,
but we've decided that this is just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a pollinator garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, every two foot on this
hillside behind me are plots that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been sowed with flower seeds and they are
starting to come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be fun to watch this
unfold.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little section here we called,
you know, Middle Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I originally put in this flat to build a
barn, but we added it into the square
[SPEAKER_00]: footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to put a barn in a shady
spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here we have some parsnips growing from
Golden Fig's garden in Covell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gave us the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a few of them scattered
throughout the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another really easy plant to
propagate that's like just a good food
[SPEAKER_00]: bank to like bank the farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually one of the more tasty root
vegetables like baked or fried parsnips
[SPEAKER_00]: are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the road down below us here with
we have I think 13 or 14 varieties of
[SPEAKER_00]: apple trees that we will grow ganja where
the mustard is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have our auto flower slopes that
are being prepped to be planted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get a shot there of the auto
slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that road wraps around to the
front where we started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we'll start making some pathways
here before the snakes come out hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then here we are back there's the
hugelkulturs is the main field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have another garden down below
the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we start at like 2300 feet and go all
the way up to like 2400 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: A high garden up there is a nursery pad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll be filming up there later when
there's something to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just mustard right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the best things about
this office space.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the sound of the wind and the
trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thanks for joining me today on a
little farm tour and look forward to
[SPEAKER_00]: showing you guys the season as it
progresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so Future Cannabis Project is
carrying our genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Planters of the trees is carrying our
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific North roots is carrying our
genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seed seller is carrying our genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's all the ones that are
listed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you follow us Heart Rock Mountain
Farm on Instagram, Pride of the Light and
[SPEAKER_00]: Seeds on Instagram, or send us an email,
either one of those at Gmail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, Heart Rock Mountain Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you cultivate love, love grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where love grows, so does everything
else.
