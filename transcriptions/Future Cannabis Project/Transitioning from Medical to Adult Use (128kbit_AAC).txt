[SPEAKER_01]: The topic that I spent some time
discussing with folks is what happens to a
[SPEAKER_01]: market that was medical only when adult
use rolls out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we've seen, which I find very,
very interesting, is when all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety or chronic pain or lack of
appetite doesn't become a qualifying
[SPEAKER_01]: condition and you actually have to prove a
need for a medical card, that the product
[SPEAKER_01]: landscape changes completely, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because all the taxes are being made on
the adult use side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where you see all the super
high-potency flour goes, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what you find in the medical side
is a lot more topical applications,
[SPEAKER_01]: is a lot more maybe inhalers, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something you've seen as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: California, I think, is a good example on
how that switched.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it switched from the medical,
where everybody was like, medical,
[SPEAKER_00]: medical, medical, and now it's
recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's like, well, now I don't have
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can go back to just recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without having a medical excuse.
[SPEAKER_00]: My only concern with something like that
is taxation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taxation will actually drive people either
back to the medical or back to the black
[SPEAKER_00]: market was even worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've totally seen exactly that
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, everyone, the taxation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado, we saw that the gap between
what taxes are being paid for medical and
[SPEAKER_01]: what taxes are being paid for adult use.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually pretty good because what
happened was you're finding people who
[SPEAKER_01]: don't need that card willing to pay the
taxes to go into a adult use shop and find
[SPEAKER_01]: a product they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the state is incentivized to make sure
they do so because they make more tax
[SPEAKER_01]: revenue on those individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those who really need help are able to
go into their medical provider and
[SPEAKER_01]: honestly see a product line that's much
more tailored for them and what they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know we talked about the CBD being
the entry point for non-cancer cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see the medical market being the same as
CBD at the state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical is a way for a state to start and
like very indirectly get into the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then transition over to recreational.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's basically it's it's proof to the
public that the sky is not going to fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: The minute we legalize.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we're going to be able to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, wake up tomorrow and
everything's going to be fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your neighbors aren't going to be like all
walking around stone all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, look, we've all had those
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you go out?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe have a drink or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's always that one friend that
potentially has one too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it becomes hell at the end of the
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for those people that think like,
oh, cannabis, cannabis, it's a simple
[SPEAKER_00]: question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like at the end of the night and we take
two segments, one friend that drinks too
[SPEAKER_00]: much and one friend that consumes too much
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which one do you want to deal with at the
end of the night?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd much rather deal with the guy who's
too high.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going to he's going to raid your
fridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eat your Twinkies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe, you know, ask you for you to take
him a Jack in the Box or even better,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe he's just going to order through
DoorDash apps and get his food and then
[SPEAKER_01]: pass out on your couch, pass out on your
couch.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to wake up feeling good the
next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unlike the other friend is going to be in
hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's I think that's that's a big
thing to understand from a consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective that people misunderstand
about cannabis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, I think a lot of it
is you mentioned this earlier that the
[SPEAKER_01]: average individual will not fess up to
being a consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: When confronted with a stranger asking
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, I've always tried to do
everything I can to be very forward and
[SPEAKER_01]: open about my consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: With my family, with my friends,
with other professionals in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think we're guys like us who
have been professionals for a very long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the first ones through the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the first ones to be in this
industry and say, hey, guys, this really
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really isn't a big deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've consumed together at
events and it's like, hey, we can still
[SPEAKER_01]: function again.
[SPEAKER_01]: We consume responsibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's no different than having a drink at
the end of a day of a conference or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more people see and I see this
with my parents as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love to use my parents as an example,
you know, immigrants, from Costa Rica,
[SPEAKER_01]: very wary of legal guidelines,
you know, don't want to be on the wrong
[SPEAKER_01]: side of the law for anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a fun conversation to tell them
when I first got into the industry.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, I've always been the
problem child.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they figured I was going to be the one
hand doing that sort of thing anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it started with me and they were
like, well, yeah, he would try anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then my sister started asking me for
advice on on what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started giving her some
recommendations and it helped her with
[SPEAKER_01]: some conditions that she had.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think between my sister and myself,
both openly consuming and my parents
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing this and just being around it more
and realizing, hey, this really isn't a
[SPEAKER_01]: big deal.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's allows people to get let
their guard down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they see somebody who they trust
consuming and then realizing, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, he's not going crazy right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this is something there's something
to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's, you know, that's a step in
the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we'll get more and more
people to be on on the right side of this
[SPEAKER_01]: topic.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I don't disagree with you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I don't agree with you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't I don't agree with you.
