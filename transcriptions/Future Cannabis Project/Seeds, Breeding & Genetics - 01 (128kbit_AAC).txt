[SPEAKER_02]: We got all kinds of stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing a collaboration, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adam and I have the Dumb Out
collaboration, and that's going through
[SPEAKER_02]: seats here now in the very near future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Amazingly, we have all of them on stage
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should probably start off with
explaining who we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, everybody knows one of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited, I'd hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's start with you first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so my name's James Loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been breeding for over 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working with the plant for over
25 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started a company called Loud Seeds in
the Netherlands and in Spain in 2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm writing a book on breeding,
and currently I'm breeding everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: regs, fems, auto flower genetics,
and I'm working on a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: different projects, stabilizing genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: For the longest time, I was breeding a lot
of F1s, like everybody, because of the
[SPEAKER_02]: demand, and now I'm gearing towards ag
product that can be sold to big ag.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name's Adam Dunn, and I've been growing
since around 93, sort of seriously,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that was in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started a seed company back when it was
more because I wanted to bring American
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics to Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of my goal at the time,
because I felt it was a little stagnant,
[SPEAKER_03]: and lo and behold, here we are 25 years
later, and it's like the Europeans are
[SPEAKER_03]: looking towards America again,
because of the... I feel like the heart
[SPEAKER_03]: and soul of cannabis is sort of here,
here in California, here in America,
[SPEAKER_03]: where I live in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's spots all over the states,
but the passion's always been here,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I've kind of followed that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, when I went to Amsterdam,
I was 19 years old, didn't realize I was
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna be working for Sensei Seeds,
which I did for about three years,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then start my own seed company,
and it was all based on just seeing that
[SPEAKER_03]: all the customers were American,
so here I am, an American living in
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam, and every guy who walks through
the door is living in some small town,
[SPEAKER_03]: and got some seeds from Neville a few
years ago, and now they came back,
[SPEAKER_03]: and Neville's nowhere to be found,
and we filled the void.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was kind of like those special
times make it easy now to kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: interject into the industry, as far as
it's all cycles.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a grower, you realize that five
years ago, people had a different taste,
[SPEAKER_03]: and right now, the gaps are getting kind
of tighter and tighter, because less
[SPEAKER_03]: people know what's going on, so it's good
to be on stage and hanging out with these
[SPEAKER_03]: guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I met James back in Amsterdam when he came
over there, and he was also like another
[SPEAKER_03]: wave, because it's like every few years,
a new wave of American growers goes over
[SPEAKER_03]: there, and they all have the same sort of
thing where they see it, because it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: a sea of genetics over there, and you kind
of get lost in the shuffle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're here to kind of clear that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm James Bean.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm CEO of SeedCheerNow.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run what I believe to be one of the
largest seed banks in the States,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with 52 breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a breeder hunter, if you will,
but one thing about working with all these
[SPEAKER_00]: different breeders is all the breeders I
work with, I'll work with a different
[SPEAKER_00]: male.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I'm concerned, that's your only
way to really separate who's doing work,
[SPEAKER_00]: who's not doing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, if you bred with an MK Ultra
and crossed it with a Girl Scout Cootie,
[SPEAKER_00]: I really can't represent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't do any work here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took somebody else's cookie,
who will say St. George.
[SPEAKER_00]: St. George is the cookie, I can believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took somebody else's cookie and took
the MK Ultra across to put them together
[SPEAKER_00]: and made MK cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to represent that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's not getting paid off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to represent the guy who did the
thing in the first place, a lot of the old
[SPEAKER_00]: timers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to do a lot of sleuthing,
if you will, to figure out the history of
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make sure the stories all collide and
make sure they all make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's been my thing, and I've worked
with 52 all-American breeders right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm pretty happy about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to add on breeding with males,
I feel like the second you sell seeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've sold lots of different varieties over
the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the second you sell those seeds,
if you have males in there, I'm totally
[SPEAKER_02]: happy with people using my males.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I feel like there's integrity
involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're going to use them to start a
seed line, that's different than if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: using them to create other strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's just sort of like it comes
down to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do whatever you want with it,
but the minute you start making money,
[SPEAKER_03]: it starts to become a little bit tense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's very much like music.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always try to put it out like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, look, we create something that's
sort of a vibe, and it's a thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's actually work behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I sell you seed, yes, you own it to
a point.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I feel like when you start to make
seeds from those seeds and sell those
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Self-preservation, not for profit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of either have to either just
work with the person and get their
[SPEAKER_03]: blessing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to, but it feels like it
gives a better vibe to the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'd be great if it kicked down,
but that never happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could be living off bubble gum for the
rest of my life just on the amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: people that have used it in crosses,
but I've never seen a dime.
[SPEAKER_03]: I talked to Bog about it at one point,
and he didn't even know where it came
[SPEAKER_03]: from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was kind of like, well, you do
realize that the guy that you got it from
[SPEAKER_03]: got it from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that still doesn't, it wasn't that
long ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he had no clue.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the end of the day, I think if you
work with other people's stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's nice to have some arrangement,
whether it be verbal or just doing a
[SPEAKER_03]: collab like we're doing with the Don Loud
series.
[SPEAKER_03]: He selected Sage and Sour Mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three out of 500, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, well, out of 50 mails.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's 50 mails that I selected from.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over from the total seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the total seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had 50 mails, and then I went in and I
took mails that represented OG Kush that
[SPEAKER_02]: were more shorter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I took some that were more on the haze
side, and then there was one that was
[SPEAKER_02]: really sourish with the stem rub.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I figured using that, because
breeding F1s, the more variety you have,
[SPEAKER_02]: the more diversity you have, the more
options you'll have to select from.
[SPEAKER_02]: From the progeny.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and so that was about a year ago or
a little less.
[SPEAKER_02]: I harvested the seeds over a year ago,
and they've been tested.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're about to go online here shortly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it was one of those like,
yeah, sure, that's the whole point of
[SPEAKER_03]: putting out regular seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I saw the market change,
and the idea for feminized seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: which were totally started there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dutch Passion Seed Company was kind of the
first guy who really put it out
[SPEAKER_03]: commercially.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know, just somehow,
right out of the gate, I just didn't like
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I was really against the idea of
sort of pigeonholing your work,
[SPEAKER_03]: or kind of like giving it a dead end,
it felt like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if everybody starts to work with
only feminized, and this is also,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in a place where everything's
about money in Holland, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's just money, money,
money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Dutch are notoriously lazy,
and the Spanish are notoriously lazy
[SPEAKER_03]: growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of them want to do selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just want it to work, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't like F1s.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't like things that have any kind
of variables.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in a way, I feel like when you buy
seeds, whether it's F1, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: times, F1 is where all the magic's
happening anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're actually doing better than
letting a guy screw it all up and get it
[SPEAKER_03]: to like F3 and have terrible selections.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just somehow miss the mark,
and now you're the victim of their
[SPEAKER_03]: terrible selection, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And whereas with F1, it's like you have,
if it's a true F1, which is almost
[SPEAKER_03]: impossible these days, because whether or
not you know it, most stuff is
[SPEAKER_03]: interrelated in some way, shape,
or form, and closer to than you think a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of times, where you're like,
oh, actually, those are cousins,
[SPEAKER_03]: and these are cousins.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what do you think is gonna happen is
you're gonna end up, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you always have shining examples in the
trailer park, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But it doesn't mean that the genetics are
strong, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like one of those situations where
you're gonna have one or two pop up,
[SPEAKER_03]: wow, this is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're looking for stability,
that's when you really want to run down a
[SPEAKER_03]: line and get it to F2, F3, F4.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thing is, we don't actually want
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You now are an industry that wants that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because once you're in agriculture,
they don't want to have any variables,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They want it to be exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but the biggest problem that we're
running into, like stabilizing stuff to an
[SPEAKER_02]: F7, and that's where you take it and back
cross it, with an inbred line to seven
[SPEAKER_02]: generations where you can stabilize it,
is heterosis, the lack of vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have this lack of vigor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you either need to breed parallel
lines and cross those together,
[SPEAKER_02]: or you need to back cross it to the
original F1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thing is, is with that,
you want to breed, when you're breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: that inbred line, you want to breed stuff
that's very similar so you have less
[SPEAKER_02]: phenotypical variation when you make that
back cross.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, like I think a lot of us,
you know, unless you aren't growing on a
[SPEAKER_03]: scale, and with a price point that's so
important and you can't have any variables
[SPEAKER_03]: and you want to grow that way,
yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the average guy, and especially
for what you're going to get when you get
[SPEAKER_03]: a selection of seeds that still have that
hybrid vigor based on the fact that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's still some, there's like an
actual, you know, hopefully they're not
[SPEAKER_03]: too interrelated, but at the same time,
even with that, you can sometimes get
[SPEAKER_03]: shining examples coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, I think a lot of times now,
it's separating yourself from all the
[SPEAKER_03]: other guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people finally got to the point where,
you know, they've seen these clone-onlys
[SPEAKER_03]: that have been around for 20 plus years
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're more trouble than they're worth,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because at the end of the day,
they either have viruses or problems and
[SPEAKER_03]: or they're just, you know, been worked way
too hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like sometimes nice when you see a
whole tray of new fresh genetics and then
[SPEAKER_03]: that's like literally again where the
magic's happening and then it comes
[SPEAKER_03]: strictly down to the selection and that's
where people can either make or break.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Adam Dunn Show.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, and it's really
interesting because I see a lot of work
[SPEAKER_02]: being done by a lot of breeders out there
and I don't see a lot of novel genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one of the things that's kind of
sticking us up right now is people are
[SPEAKER_02]: buying based on THC levels and
dispensaries, especially on the rec market
[SPEAKER_02]: because they go on the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dispensaries are buying on THC levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first thing they do is they go in
and they're going to buy the highest THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And well, you know, I understand that,
but we've smoked a lot of different
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivars, different strains that are 14%
like sour diesel that'll knock your socks
[SPEAKER_02]: off compared to some of those that tested
30%.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really down to like, I mean,
how many times have you gone to some place
[SPEAKER_03]: and had got some really shitty looking
weed that you were like, this is
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely not going to get me high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then somehow you're like, in your
hotel room all fucking, whoa, dude,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I never got that high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been smoking all this Cam D and
all these, all their strains, but you're
[SPEAKER_03]: just so used to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in just tickling those other spots
doesn't maybe last very long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And after the second joint, you're like,
I don't know how that did it, but it
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking got me super baked.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Green crack.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that could be like a 9% or,
you know, super low, even lower,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's just because it's the right pro,
you know, cannabinoid profile at that
[SPEAKER_03]: point for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And changing it up a lot is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny because some of the shittiest
looking weed back in the day was the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had cat piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of my all time favorite
strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I haven't seen it in 20 years,
the real cat piss.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we've been, I've been
talking to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I talked to JJ when we were at lunch a
couple of weeks ago and he was saying it's
[SPEAKER_02]: probably from an A5 lineage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I was told originally it was an NL5
Hayes cross, but that really doesn't make
[SPEAKER_02]: sense with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that strain was lost 20 years ago at a
big gun fight in California with the HAs
[SPEAKER_02]: and the Sheriff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know, yeah, that's going to say
like the, the victim of your own success
[SPEAKER_03]: was probably the biggest problem back in
the day is that all, like everyone's
[SPEAKER_03]: always like looking, you know,
where's that old skunk and where's that
[SPEAKER_03]: old skunk?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, the reality is it's because
those old skunk smelled like fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: skunks that they got people arrested and,
you know, they're walking into their local
[SPEAKER_03]: shop and they're stink like a skunk and
they tell the cop and the cop would follow
[SPEAKER_03]: them to their house, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those people got caught.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why, like, there was a point in
time where, you know, people would come to
[SPEAKER_03]: Holland and ask you like, do you have
anything that doesn't have any smell to
[SPEAKER_03]: it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and you'd be like, you know,
there's things that don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: smell, but that's usually an indicator of
good weed, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also the fact that that's the
reason why a lot of people probably lost
[SPEAKER_03]: those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like Cactus had that lingering
fucking.
[SPEAKER_02]: A tenth of a gram would make your whole
house smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pre-carb filter days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and then that was like from the
early nineties, maybe 93 to 2001.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it smelled, it had the strong ammonia
smell with skunk and it was like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was after that dry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it was after it dried.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it like some of the like the A5 haze
has that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that really accurate almost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it burns your nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then with the skunk along with it,
it would just like literally a tenth of a
[SPEAKER_02]: gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had it in your shirt pocket,
you'd be looking for the bud, like for,
[SPEAKER_02]: for hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's it's been gone for a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of those old school smells,
I mean, I think they've evolved,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I haven't seen a handful of them in
many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the other funny thing too,
is that like back in the day, everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: was drying in these like dank little nasty
spots and growing and drying in the same
[SPEAKER_03]: room all the time, because that's all they
had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like the only place that had
ventilation was the grow room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just wrote, dried it in the grow
room and they'd still have the pots in the
[SPEAKER_03]: corner and the things kind of breathe.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some decomposing going on and it
would all end up in the bud too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you know how it was, you'd be like,
it kind of smells like a basement like
[SPEAKER_03]: it's got.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that was the thing about that
particular weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: It never really dried very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't a very easy drying thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was very leafy and very, but had that
very heavy oil coat on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, you know, the oilier bud would
just not dry particularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was greasy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think a lot of those strains,
I mean, it's funny because the ones that
[SPEAKER_03]: are the most difficult back in the day at
that moment, they were kind of difficult
[SPEAKER_03]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not very great yielding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only reason you kept it around is
because of that particular funk that it
[SPEAKER_03]: had or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, that's a lot to do with,
I think the success and failure of a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of strains because people now are so,
not only as a THC, but you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: as a grower, when you have to grow a plant
that needs support by 15 stakes,
[SPEAKER_03]: or it just grows like a soldier,
you know, theoretically be doing way
[SPEAKER_03]: better if you grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why strains like, yeah,
like blue dream become popular because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, you can pretty much shit in the
reservoir and then you'll yield at least
[SPEAKER_02]: two pounds per thousand watt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really hate some blue dream.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think the success of blue dream is
based on the fact that it's stored really
[SPEAKER_03]: well compared to other weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's a lot of strains that are
great when you first harvest them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're lucky enough to be that guy
who's the, you know, got it within a
[SPEAKER_03]: certain timeframe, it's still got that pop
to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then after a little while it dies off
and blue dream is the opposite where if
[SPEAKER_03]: you store that shit and sit on it for a
year or two years and pop it out,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like, that actually still smells
pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost gets better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it gets better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it ages really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was a bonus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So limonene, I believe limonene makes the
weed deteriorate a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: It definitely like shortens the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this is a story that I was told by
somebody in this room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe he can confirm if it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: But back in the day when they would put
rubber bands around bags of haze,
[SPEAKER_03]: it would eat through the rubber band.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that true?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mysterious man in the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the fact that it would eat through
rubber bands kind of tells you that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: got a different sort of reaction than
other sort of, because if you could put
[SPEAKER_03]: that same rubber band around some other
plant and nothing would happen to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's something going on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no, no, around a bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just like eat like literally through
everything, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just like into the tops of the
seals of the things right on the tops of
[SPEAKER_03]: the of the mason jars and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would get sort of eating up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to imagine that there's some
chemical reaction without anything
[SPEAKER_03]: happening going on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that means shit's working on your
brain, probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something's going down.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I digress.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as like we can definitely talk
about Europe and how they kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: homogenized all the strains and also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Naming was evil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Naming conventions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dutchies.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Dutch.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just read for haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I mean, the thing is, it was really
like it goes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis has these waves and like things
don't change for, say, six or seven years
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes in these little waves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden there's a massive
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's usually based on just exposure
from wherever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Holland had that thing where,
you know, those those people that brought
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics there in the beginning,
you know, blew people's minds because they
[SPEAKER_03]: were trying to grow a bunch of literally
of like bird seed and shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were like they were not they were not
doing their selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and all of a sudden it took the
outsiders to come there, wake them up,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the problem is that they also had a
business running, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They had a business model that they're
trying to keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was totally illegal, yet legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so at the end of the day, now the
people here figure out that that's
[SPEAKER_03]: actually really hard when you have
customers coming in every single day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Demanding the same quality weed,
like which, as you know, as a grower,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's really hard to deliver year round and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that they were the first
ones to take that model and try to work
[SPEAKER_03]: with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so from a breeder's point of view,
I feel like they did a great job of
[SPEAKER_03]: keeping it alive for everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: On a creative side, they just didn't quite
have that creative thing going.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't care about weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the people that cared about weed there
were Americans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and they were breeding for different
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were breeding in Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like the traits they were breeding
for was vigor and yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, and smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not really smell, because look what
happened with OG Kush over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So OG Kush, which is amazing, came from
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second it hit the- How'd it get there,
though?
[SPEAKER_02]: How'd it get here?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great story.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should probably have Mohamed come up
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Moe, you want to come up?
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to clear that up, Moe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so OG Kush, I feel like the
seeds, I bought seeds of OG Kush in
[SPEAKER_02]: probably 2009.
[SPEAKER_03]: But where did you buy seeds of OG Kush?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no, that was OG Kush times White
Widow, and maybe back crossed to OG Kush
[SPEAKER_02]: or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it definitely wasn't a very good
representation of OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was feminized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realized- It sounds like all the
wrong things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You went for literally the wrong
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Give me that feminized OG Kush something
from Europe that really, oh my god,
[SPEAKER_03]: it must have been the amount of fuckery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going on in that is terrible, I can say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it could have not even been OG Kush.
[SPEAKER_03]: 98% chance it wasn't, I'd say.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just White Widow, probably.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would guess to me, yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a White Widow male that people use
over there for sure that's been out and
[SPEAKER_02]: abused like no other.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the big seed companies used it back in
the day for their feminizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that kind of goes into what James was
talking about earlier about giving credit
[SPEAKER_02]: to where credit's due.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of the... And I'm totally
guilty of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I released AJ's Sour Diesel pack a long
time ago, but it wasn't AJ's Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was AJ's Sour Diesel crossed with White
Widow.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were working with some guys over there,
and then they put that back on the AJ's
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour Diesel cut that I had.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we called it AJ's Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: But moving forward, I feel like we were
doing the wrong thing back then,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we didn't really know it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a Chem 23 the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, what the hell is a Chem 23?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's getting to that point now where
people have already forgotten... The thing
[SPEAKER_03]: about the OG in Europe was when it first
arrived there, of course, people who
[SPEAKER_03]: smoked a lot of weed were like,
well, this is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of the people over there,
they don't even like really strong weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you give it, oh, it's too strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody wants it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the exact opposite of reason why
we are growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was part of the thing was figuring
out the packaging of this product.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as the buds were a certain weight
and size, it was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to think about it too
much.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted to put it on the scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: You come in there with a big, giant bud,
and it was like, no, this is not
[SPEAKER_03]: happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: People looking crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything had to be toned down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the first thing you learned as an
American grower over there was probably
[SPEAKER_03]: should tone it down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's just a hard place to grow in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's got to be one of the worst places
for a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, from a breeder's point of view,
though, the one thing that I did find
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting was that a lot of the seeds
that we would grow there, if you imagine
[SPEAKER_03]: where they're growing, it's like dank and
nasty, and it's not like California or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you get those seeds and somebody
magically flies home with them wherever
[SPEAKER_03]: they took them, and then unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those plants just fucking loved life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas when you grow in a beautiful
climate and then those seeds end up going
[SPEAKER_03]: back to Holland or somewhere shitty like
that, I bet that they're not so happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not as stoked when they come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: But I came from California.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to go home.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's memories and epigenetics with
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you grow for the right reasons and
you seed a plant at the right time and
[SPEAKER_03]: everything comes, all the things are
working, as you're handing those seeds to
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody, you just know, guaranteed,
those are going to be so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it was all good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas if you have a situation where,
yeah, they were in a room and then the
[SPEAKER_03]: lights went out because the power went out
for three days and then the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: suffered a little bit and the seeds still
came through.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like you're going to not sell any
of them, but at the same time,
[SPEAKER_03]: you do know that there was a little stress
involved on that particular run.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it's epigenetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like something where we, as breeders,
try to put something into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem with Holland was that a lot of
those guys, it was all fat.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was without even them, none of them
cared.
[SPEAKER_03]: They smoked shaggies and tobacco and some
hash in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, but you grow weed all day
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half of those guys didn't even breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half of them, they just buy seeds from
other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like that was the biggest thing
over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sad, but part of the thing is every
time you see a mislabeled seed sold or a
[SPEAKER_03]: clone going out with the wrong name on it,
you know it's just causing endless
[SPEAKER_03]: problems down the road.
[SPEAKER_03]: So many people are going to say,
oh, I've smoked this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was either shitty or it was great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it could be the opposite either way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or no credit is given where it should be
done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from a grower's point or from a
breeder's point of view, I kind of feel
[SPEAKER_03]: like if you're in the perfect place,
it's sometimes not the perfect place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was the one thing they had going
for them is that anything that came out of
[SPEAKER_03]: there seemed to thrive when it got out of
that bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks to James B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought all my seeds off him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Allegedly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
I appreciate everything you do.
I bought everything off your site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Allegedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything I popped died instantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I emailed you at bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: You brought me a new pack.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I used two mails out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give out seeds to everybody here
tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate both of you guys for
being real on Instagram.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one more thing, James, where's all the
food at?
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it all in your posts.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a food guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see it's all right here.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A billion pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, I consult.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I consult for a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I travel a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's always good food.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to be a chef as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I graduated La Cordon Bleu Top in my
class a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great to be able to get people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if people come out of their
comfort zone to come to a thing like this,
[SPEAKER_03]: they got a little bit of heart and
dedication to what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's also part of this industry is
kind of a lot of camaraderie between
[SPEAKER_03]: people, which is also nice, like our
collab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Customer service is big, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of people are losing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just expected customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the things we're big on
is customer service.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a situation with a pack,
you email us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You tell us what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to send you a free pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: No questions asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can ask you how you germinate on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my way is not always the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because I do it one way doesn't mean
you do it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way we work, you're not supposed
to germinate them any ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get them wet or dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a situation with them,
the best thing to do is just replace that
[SPEAKER_00]: pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're happy and you go again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then have happy customers like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate you coming out and sharing
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think everybody should
definitely grow, but definitely grow from
[SPEAKER_00]: a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big difference between buying a
clone and taking it home and putting it in
[SPEAKER_00]: some dirt and being like, oh, I got a
clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or taking a little seedling and actually
watching it pop and growing it and knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: it has a tap root and the potential it
could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're all going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drinks and seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seeds for looking at your seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's got seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's also the cool part.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you see, giving away from such a small
thing compared to clones, you're kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: working with other people's selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not going to be able.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chances of you growing a better version of
the guy who gave you the clones is pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: slim.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be a better grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you might get a fraction of a bit
better.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you grow from seed, there's a
rolling dice every time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just might nail it, where you're
just like, oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only is it bigger, faster,
tastier, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the things you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the best part is a lot of things is
like, I used to always joke that the best
[SPEAKER_03]: thing about the cannabis industry is the
fact that there's so much testing involved
[SPEAKER_03]: and work involved in trying to figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that never felt like work, sitting and
doing a phenol hunt and having all these
[SPEAKER_03]: different strains or these different
cultivars at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And narrowing it down to one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And tough work.
[SPEAKER_02]: The breeders don't even have the best cuts
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guys that are selling their seeds to
seeds here now, half the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: the best phenotype is probably out with
the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've actually been at the booth where
someone come up with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, I think that's the true
representation of a good breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's trying to improve the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should come back with something better
than he has.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't, you should be disappointed
if you don't have a keeper, if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: get something better than he has.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a good representation of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I like breeders, when they bring
me seeds or when they bring me gear,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have flour with it, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that lets me know that they grew
them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They tested them and passed all their
checks to all their boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that's really big when you
guys go for buying and selecting genes is
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure whoever you're buying them from
tested them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look for pictures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they give you data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Make sure they give you info.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if a real breeder did it or if
they meant to do it, for one, they'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: the mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that shoots a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of things were accidents.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't have the mail, they didn't
do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a lot of guys like JJ doesn't
keep his mails.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody kind of has their own style,
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the other funny thing about
breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like we're all doing the same thing,
but we have kind of our own style.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like making hash, same sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all kind of trying to do the same
thing, but somehow somebody does it better
[SPEAKER_03]: than the other guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just because they have better
patience or their timing or their
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature sort of knowledge of being on
point is a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually it's a lazy factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of those anything that's hard to
do, like making... You're calling JJ lazy?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I'm not saying he's lazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got his own style, though,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: He doesn't keep mails.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just kind of moves on, keeps on moving
on, which is good if you really are good
[SPEAKER_03]: at seeing what's coming up around the
corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do try to keep mails as long as I
can.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of one of those, if I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's so difficult keeping mail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody wants to hold them for you,
that's for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no one wants to hold them for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've lost most of my mails, but now I have
a handful that I'm keeping in a nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now with the rec market, we're able to
kind of move forward with keeping things
[SPEAKER_02]: alive a lot longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tissue culture, I think, is gonna be a
good solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, I don't think it's ideal,
but I think putting plants through... It's
not practical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not practical yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's great for keeping it... If
you're in house, being able to clean
[SPEAKER_03]: things up, that's kind of where we're at
now, in just Maristamp propagation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, now that we can recognize viroids
and viruses and all these things,
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can actually clean up and then put
through tissue culture, get a new start of
[SPEAKER_02]: that plant that is clean and healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's so many old plants that
need to go through tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think that's the only way that
people on large scale production are gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to do it anyway, just because they
need to have... Clean, fresh, healthy
starts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Clean from the start and be able to look
back and put a date on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you can just imagine how many
facilities got ruined by taking in...
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, that's the problem with clones in
general, is there's pathogen problems,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's viroids, and there's... Powdered
mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have any kind of medium going
with it, it's all that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did Europe get powdered mildew?
[SPEAKER_03]: How did Europe... Oh, no, I definitely
brought that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was 100% verified.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd never seen it before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was super proud because I had OG and
Sour D and I was all stoked and had my
[SPEAKER_03]: friends from Minnesota come into town.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first time they said is,
oh, dude, you got PM.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: I literally did not even see it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just at that stage where it was
just coming in enough that once you see
[SPEAKER_03]: it, you can't unsee it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden, you're like,
oh, my God, it's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it wasn't bad yet, but it was just
coming on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, they're from Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're used to seeing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get some Tyvek suits, get to work on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I didn't have them come through,
I would have just completely wiped out my
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's because I brought those cuts
from here, literally from Cali and
[SPEAKER_03]: straight to Amsterdam and just like,
yep, there you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those cuts I gave you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got powdered mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there was no Eagle 20 over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used sulfur.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went for sulfur early on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was also burners.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the burners were kind of a bitch
because they get everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I realize I would never use
burners.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd only use micronized sulfur because
that way you can apply it directly to
[SPEAKER_03]: where you want to apply it and not just
like, I'm going to nuke the entire
[SPEAKER_03]: facility because we can never get it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: That stuff is like fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: You feel like you're in a firecracker
factory.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, OK, this is not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's micronized or because it's in
the burners, it's going up and getting
[SPEAKER_03]: like sulfur.
[SPEAKER_03]: My problem is I was using a lot of light
movers at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was so slick that it made my wheels
on the light movers just spin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd come in the room and be like,
god damn, sulfur burners.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I stopped using them for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then I realized later, I just didn't
like the way that it was applied.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it worked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it definitely got rid of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a product called MicroThyled
Dispersed and it has two S's on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's micronized.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to use the brown bags of micronized
sulfur and then put a wetting agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has it all in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like $50 for 50 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can order it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You type it in Google.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's perfect in every way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for russet mites.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good for powdery mildew if you have
to use it, if you have to use a sulfur
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe it's armory certified.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's amazing when you, because of
the bad taste of my mouth literally from
[SPEAKER_03]: the burners, I just never really got.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, ah, no, sulfur did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then about a year ago, somebody,
again, same problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody gave me some clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was like, oh, you
motherfuckers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to get into the scope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, ah, nuke them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hit them with, I was like,
this, I got to do them.
[SPEAKER_03]: This time I got to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to just go straight to try to
use something chemical because it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you got to, you got to, the only way to do
proper organic is to start organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And work it all the way through you
because it's pretty much, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So use sulfur.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was amazed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, wow, this worked better than
all the other things I've been using and
[SPEAKER_03]: cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we used to think powdery mildew was
systemic.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I learned that you can outgrow
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not systemic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, it's well, it's just one of those
things where it latches, it gets into the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant technically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it feels like it's systemic,
but it's not, it's, it's not permanent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be, it can be beat.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I think, I think just it's a
lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not easier when you're growing plants
that don't get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like, Hey, look, this plant
doesn't get powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was like, if I can just grow that,
like if that's possible and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: somehow, you know, get rid of that sour D
or that cut that you actually are just so
[SPEAKER_03]: attached to that always gets it,
you know, which is always a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's certain plants that just do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cushes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cushes are really susceptible typically to
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just in Europe, it was HP 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the worst.
[SPEAKER_03]: That plant came around and just anybody
who got that cut, especially a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: Dutch growers didn't recognize what it
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were all proud when they handed
it to you and you're like, Whoa,
[SPEAKER_03]: what's all that?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all trichomes or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, no, that is powder fucking
mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they once they, once they figured
it out, it was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude, well that's on everything I have
then, because that's exactly what all my
[SPEAKER_03]: plants look like back home.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it definitely, like that particular cut
was a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Soma sold a lot of that and a lot of
people that was just around for a short
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was long enough to really infect a lot
of people's garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but that wasn't me technically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was somebody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have brought it at one point,
but that one seemed to be inherent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was an old plant from New York
and Hawaii and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That plant, which is another one of those
weird thing about strains is that you'll
[SPEAKER_03]: notice that there's a lot of drama based
around a lot of these strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, there are certain ones like
HP 13, especially because it was a Hawaii,
[SPEAKER_03]: New York kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Drama.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like unbelievable amounts, people,
a lot of groups broke up over it,
[SPEAKER_03]: fights, you know, infighting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sour Diesel, it got his name from being,
causing people to become sour from,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, lack of get access, you know
what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was just like, and you know,
obviously OG has its own history and it
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't necessarily as, as brutal as some
of the other ones, but I've seen other
[SPEAKER_03]: strains causing all sorts of drama.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's because I think it's just
because, well, back in the day it was
[SPEAKER_03]: power struggle more or less.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's the same power struggles just
in a, in a legal way, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is worse, of course, way worse.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's way different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The white market and the black market is
way different with that, but traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: market, traditional market, traditional
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The traditional market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, it used to be more honor
code, let's say, or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's, you know, we worked on
handshakes back in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, it was handshakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't sign papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like, you work with people that you
trust, you get burned occasionally and you
[SPEAKER_02]: grow and you learn who you can work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you work with those people and then
the shit heads you get rid of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's like, you got to sign papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, there's a lot of, lots of
contracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of lunches now is what you
get.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a lot of lunches, everybody gets a
fuckload of lunches, a couple dinners.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then usually at that point they've
done the brain drain.
[SPEAKER_03]: To enough to like, there's somebody in the
back just with a sketch pad.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the thing about this industry
is like, it's very much, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: saturated in many ways, but in a weird way
reinventing itself all the time too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think if you can kind of stay
slightly ahead of the curb and,
[SPEAKER_03]: or just sort of figure out your,
your position within this industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, it sucks to try to
be on that front end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of what's going on because things are,
until it goes federally legal,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's just no point of even investing a
ton of money and trying to put all your
[SPEAKER_03]: energy into it because you know you're
going to get your ass handed to you the
[SPEAKER_03]: minute it goes into that zone.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you kind of almost want to either had
to have already been doing it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: And taking that risk early on because now
the, the to get involved is kind of a bit
[SPEAKER_03]: much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on a breeding point of view,
it's nice because it's a hobby.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be like a hobby style side thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could, you could go full steam.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, you're going to see,
it's going to get less and less
[SPEAKER_03]: interesting the higher up you go up the
ladder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you're going to be like,
wow, your hands are tied once again,
[SPEAKER_03]: because you're now limited to these
particular strains that may have already
[SPEAKER_03]: been put through the system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's like, well, how am I going to
do anything with that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that has nothing to do with what I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So well, then even trademarks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had the trademark for loud for the
longest time, me and my partners with loud
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got to a point where it just
wouldn't be enforceable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone wanted a loud company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were the first, we were the first.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no other louds before us.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then like 2014 people started hearing
there's loud farms and in Kansas now and,
[SPEAKER_02]: or Oklahoma, not Kansas, but like,
and there's, there's another loud company
[SPEAKER_02]: in Seattle, but there's probably a hundred
different loud companies now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it gets to a point because it's not
federally legal to where, how do you
[SPEAKER_02]: enforce it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how much money do you really want to
spend enforcing something like a
[SPEAKER_02]: trademark?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's, it's, it's unenforceable at
this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like anybody who goes down that sort of
rabbit hole is either well funded and they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't care about losing money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that's about the only people that
you could really do it or, or they're just
[SPEAKER_03]: don't quite get how the system works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because once you get, there's no way to
take it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause the next level is going to laugh at
you and say, well, it's not legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can only do it at a state level,
which doesn't make it nationwide anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you be, you can't be nationwide if
you're doing it at a state level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's you, you kind of get,
yeah, you're, you're, you're stuck at
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look at like Runts, Gorilla Glue,
Skittles, these names, these guys have had
[SPEAKER_02]: uphill battles because of their names.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a dumb idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, I think the fact that people
can't think outside the box and put
[SPEAKER_03]: something at least sort of original.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I mean, it's like, if it's not
Lucasfilm or Disney or, or Nestle or,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, one of these big, like who,
who really thinks that they're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to take that anywhere federally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once it gets to the federal level,
they're going to get, they're going to get
[SPEAKER_03]: creamed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause there's going to be like 50 lawyers
laughing at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you really put all your money into
naming everything after Star Wars?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, come on dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, you know, we've got to get a little
more original.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, and that's the problem is that
the cannabis industry is kind of like
[SPEAKER_03]: always worked off of, like we get it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all love puns and we all love to rip
off logos.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we all think it's funny when you come
up with something that looks like
[SPEAKER_03]: something, but you're really got to think
like, okay, if I'm going to put too much
[SPEAKER_03]: energy into this, I might get my ass
handed to me, just like a hit man with his
[SPEAKER_03]: Dabbuccinos.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like you, you, you copied
it a little too close.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it was a pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not a, you know, copyright
infringement in any way, shape or form,
[SPEAKER_03]: except for the fact that it was called the
Dabbuccino and it looked like their thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Starbucks, you know, they won.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just a matter of time before those
people get caught up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think when they, you know, put too much
energy into that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think with the, trademarks,
you either got to be dedicated because
[SPEAKER_03]: we've, I've, I've trademarked as many
strains as I could.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of stuff I couldn't trademark,
like I couldn't trademark bubble gum,
[SPEAKER_03]: but then somehow Simon from serious seeds
got into, I was like, wait a minute,
[SPEAKER_03]: how did you do that?
[SPEAKER_03]: They told me I wouldn't have that because
it was too general.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's, you know, but they did give
me MK ultra edge, which I thought was
[SPEAKER_03]: funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm like, oh, so I got the trademark
for MK ultra.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got that here over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got the here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and so it's like, I'm like,
oh, so I can get government experiments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And trademark their names, but I can't
trademark the word bubble gum for seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's what we call it is like
surrounding the wagon right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically you just cover your ass and
trademark everything around the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you legally can do the product,
when you're in a state like California,
[SPEAKER_03]: you do it, but it costs a fuckload of
money, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we've spent tens, if not hundreds of
thousands over the last 15 years on just
[SPEAKER_03]: trademarks that we never, ever,
ever, ever used in any way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trademarks and website names.
[SPEAKER_03]: Except having that little TM and knowing
it's real, you know, it has something
[SPEAKER_03]: behind it, but it's rough, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're all over this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Son of a bitch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've got 52 growers who are all like
have no clue half of them or what they're
[SPEAKER_03]: even doing when it comes to business,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I can only imagine.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't tell them that though.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but I know, cause I'm one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, how are we doing this?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is part of the industry is like,
we got to make it up as we go along.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause when it comes to seeds, well,
seeds are always weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause seeds are like one of those things
where it's either the most benign thing
[SPEAKER_03]: because you can't get high from it,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just sitting like, you can have a
thousand pounds of seeds in the room and
[SPEAKER_03]: we couldn't get high from it unless we
found some weed that was mixed in between
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you grow that thousand pounds,
you can take up the whole town.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get the whole town, you know,
you can get everybody high for miles,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like the most dangerous thing in
the world in one way to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's the most benign because if you
get the right guy, he's just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh yeah, nobody can explain.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's not more than 0.3% THC in that
entire bag of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're kind of in a weird zone where
theoretically we should be able to sell
[SPEAKER_03]: those things in every 7-Eleven and
everywhere in town because they are just
[SPEAKER_03]: like any other CBD product out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're 0.3.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, they follow all those
things, but we haven't quite got there
[SPEAKER_03]: yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when's that coming?
[SPEAKER_03]: When's the 7-Eleven deal going down?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Farm Bill passed, the 2018 Farm Bill
passed, which stated anything below 0.03%
[SPEAKER_00]: THC was considered hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was to be removed from the Consolidated
Substances Act, which legally made seeds
[SPEAKER_00]: legal because they have, if you take 10
seeds, you take 100 seeds, you take 10,000
[SPEAKER_00]: seeds, squish them all up, you're not
going to get out of 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no cannabinoid to the embryo of a
seed whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really hard to, you have to
explain your case to MasterCard and Visa
[SPEAKER_00]: and tell them why they're different when
they shut you down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they actually listen to you,
though?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, they listened to lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They listened to lawyers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, so we're in this weird zone
where it's like theoretically we should be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to conduct business like anybody else
and sell our stuff to anybody,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we have to be, that's why,
I mean, I only have, he's my only
[SPEAKER_03]: distributor because of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of, I don't trust having it,
because I feel like we're still kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like overstepping still by the fact that
we're crossing state lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things are getting weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: The whole seed game is definitely one of
those things where it's kind of like the
[SPEAKER_03]: Wild West still out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, but it's also the best part of the
industry because of the fact that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: changing and evolving and getting genetics
spread out throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was one of our mottos of our company
was always drop seeds, not bombs,
[SPEAKER_03]: because we felt like every time somebody
bought a pack of seeds, they were going to
[SPEAKER_03]: their neighborhood and just like pook,
you know, like they were bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm pretty sure DNA trademarked that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're 10 years behind on everything they
do, my friend, so it's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Soma used it too for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soma would go out there and go,
hey, what I always said, drop seeds,
[SPEAKER_03]: not bombs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, are you kidding?
[SPEAKER_03]: We had t-shirts, posters, stickers,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, we don't really care.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want more people to use the motto
because the idea is it's real,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you see neighborhoods change
because somebody grew some fireweed,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like, especially back in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, of course, it's kind of people are
spoiled as usual, but there was times when
[SPEAKER_03]: people would come to the shop in Amsterdam
and tell me how like by buying a pack of
[SPEAKER_03]: chocolate chunk seeds or whatever they
bought at that time, they went back to
[SPEAKER_03]: their place and grew it really well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like now all of a sudden people are like
finally knew what good we was,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and that's a good feeling as a
grower because that's like, with clones
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't get that because there's no
trap, you know, very, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you might want to, you might go here
to there and, but it's always like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like clones make people weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're very horny.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of hoarding going on and a
lot of- That goes to the Catsoup Bluebird
[SPEAKER_00]: cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys are familiar with that,
Catsoup Bluebird online, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: has a genetics out, but he bought the,
he bought the Bubba Kush cut in 2001 when
[SPEAKER_00]: he said he had a little too much money and
not more money than he had since.
[SPEAKER_00]: He bought the cut for 500 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: After he got it, he got a small tree,
great licking plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guy called him said you can't give
away cuts, you can't sell clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, hey, that wasn't,
that wasn't part of the fucking deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for about four years online,
if you emailed him, he'd send you a cut
[SPEAKER_00]: only the only coveted being you have to
give away five cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you were anybody and you mailed
him, he'd mail you that clone and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: how Bubba got out everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, if you can imagine like you're
in Illinois, you're on the forums,
[SPEAKER_00]: you email this guy, he mailed you the
Bubba cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're now like the king of your fucking
block.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, you've got the fire-ish thing
on the block.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody loves you.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're blowing up your phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cigar tubes, cigar tubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pack it in the cigar and then you'd
cut the top off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get some tobacco mosaic virus with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have that, have that along with your cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would, you would get the, you know,
the small plugs, not the standard Rockwell
[SPEAKER_02]: Cubs.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plugs with the small similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would do opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would cut fresh and I would stick a
whole bunch into like one piece of
[SPEAKER_03]: Rockwell and then wrap that in plastic and
then put that into a poster tube and then
[SPEAKER_03]: wedge it in there so that you could flip
it over either way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that would go through no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and the thing is if you do them when
they're fresh and you don't have any
[SPEAKER_03]: roots, there's no stress, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when your plant has roots and you
bounce it all around and you take,
[SPEAKER_03]: it gets cold and hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all that, there's, there's again,
that's the same problem that we were
[SPEAKER_03]: saying earlier, where you're kind of like,
eh, you've kind of, it's like you dropped
[SPEAKER_03]: the babe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you dropped the baby.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, it's going to be fine,
honey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like third grade, you're all,
ah, I think I dropped it pretty hard,
[SPEAKER_03]: dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was like, that was, that was a
problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the, and with these plants,
you, you know, you see that quicker
[SPEAKER_03]: because you'll see one plant, you'll track
one plant through and you'll realize like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh, that's the one that I fucked the root
ball up on or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you will see that that plant does not
succeed as well as the other ones because
[SPEAKER_03]: it had trauma at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I feel like when you take the cuts
fresh, it's like a ER thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you're, as long as you get it
within a certain timeframe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the beginning, this is pre nine 11,
but I used to, we put a little,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, LED light on the top of the tube and
thinking like, oh, it's going to keep the
[SPEAKER_03]: photo period.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then later on, I realized they sell
those.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then nowadays you get clone tubes.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can get the whole clone box and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still feel like to send it with roots is
unless you're going to do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you're going to transport it in a
cooler and bring it to your friend's house
[SPEAKER_03]: and all that is cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing you put into a mailbox,
that guy just goes, okay, thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And throws it behind them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that things on a rough ride.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had clones shipped to my friend's mom's
house back in the day and he forgot to
[SPEAKER_02]: pick them up and it was two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, so do you have those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they, are they growing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, oh, I forgot to get them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm like, fuck, they're probably
dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he went over and got them and they were
still alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were in the dark for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then you want roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: At that point you want roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've had, I've had, I've had clones
arrive that like didn't go on a direct
[SPEAKER_03]: shipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like got stuck for three or four days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's just like, thanks for the
box of, for a dehydrated or just basically
[SPEAKER_03]: spinach that's defrosted.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's like, you're like,
well, that didn't work out so well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think it's funny because people
think it's so crazy moving cuts around
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, back in the day,
it was just like, you got to do what you
[SPEAKER_03]: got to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it made a huge difference when they
did, when it's such a good feeling when
[SPEAKER_03]: you get a clone from thousands of miles
away and you get it to root and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: like, all right, you know, now it's
fucking on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause and plus when it starts fresh there
and it's got no stress, it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's all on you at that point.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: James.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You stopped talking so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all he wanted.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all he wanted was the breeder
drama.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh good.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got some.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feed us feed me.
[SPEAKER_03]: See more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Jesus.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha females.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it alpha females?
[SPEAKER_03]: Alpha herm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: So tell us what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got the insane, the banana hammock,
the crescendo, the, some other cross that
[SPEAKER_01]: he gave me as a freebie, all femme.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't, I just couldn't get it to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was wondering what you guys thought
of his femme crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you grown any of them out?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you say they didn't go,
what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they either dutted, they didn't
germinate or they germinated like to like
[SPEAKER_01]: where they showed a little bit out of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like dampening off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like showed itself and then either died.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ones that I did get to go,
they were fire and I've been following him
[SPEAKER_01]: for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, hermaphrodite issues you said too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the insane half of them hermed.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other two I kept and I braided,
I hit him with a male, but like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that's just how fucking shit
goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you're breeding these crazy ass
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All plants will show intersex traits,
but they shouldn't show that.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but one thing that I think breeders
aren't doing right now, and this is
[SPEAKER_02]: something that I've been doing in the last
year, especially, especially with all the
[SPEAKER_02]: feminized work, um, is stress testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to stress this shit out of the
plants you're breeding with, because if
[SPEAKER_02]: you stress test, test them, then when you
breed with them, you're less likely
[SPEAKER_02]: because those, I was talking to Rob Clark
and Mojave.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't even know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know who they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're talking about monicious versus
diecious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So monicious plants basically are the
plants that hermaphrodite, they have both
[SPEAKER_02]: male and female organs on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do you feel about that as his
feminized line?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you seeing that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like, you know, I haven't seen
it personally, so I can't comment on that,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I just feel like a lot of breeders
aren't properly stress testing their
[SPEAKER_02]: plants if they're trying to breed stuff
that doesn't have hermaphrodite traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the biggest problem is that a lot
of people, um, you know, you can stand
[SPEAKER_03]: behind feminization and all you want,
but the reality is that these plants are
[SPEAKER_03]: just so fucking sneaky.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're not going to wait around
for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not listening to rules.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put it that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're like, it's impossible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, no, it is not.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen it happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing is, especially when we're now
talking about millions and millions and
[SPEAKER_03]: millions of seeds at a time that are
actually getting grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause before there wasn't that many places
that you could get to see somebody put
[SPEAKER_03]: down 4 million seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But now it's happening because of the hemp
crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people are seeing 4 million seeds and
they're going like, okay, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: 275,000 of those 4 million are,
like auto flowering and the other 275,000
[SPEAKER_03]: are doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, you know, so there, these are
real, like true numbers that are coming
[SPEAKER_03]: out that are like, okay, now we're going
to get some real data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I'm not trying to like bash on
the guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he has great stuff, but I just,
from the problem is that he's so cocky
[SPEAKER_03]: that like he, he, he, I don't think he'll,
he will probably replace this.
[SPEAKER_01]: He replaced everything I had plus some.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's no beef with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just saying like with all this
feminized stuff and especially with the
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp that's coming online.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say the hemp industry,
all the working hemp companies that are
[SPEAKER_02]: like, so the hemp industry there,
some of the companies, I feel like that's
[SPEAKER_02]: a scaling issue that we're seeing with
hemp right now is cause what happened is
[SPEAKER_02]: we need all these hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause everybody's coming online to grow
hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so everyone's growing all those hemp
seed outdoors and we're getting cross
[SPEAKER_02]: pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when these companies first started,
they had like intersexual creates of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: 0.02%, which is like one in 5,000 male or
hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact is that if you're growing
seeds outdoors, you're more than likely
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get cross pollinated by other
stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether it's regs from, you know,
THC or whether it's other hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to get that cross
pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like the government's going to
start regulating it and make people either
[SPEAKER_02]: grow in greenhouses that are, are
basically with wet walls that prevent
[SPEAKER_02]: cross pollination or indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can't even sell hemp seeds to
Germany right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like hemp seeds, unless you have
phytosanitary certification, and I believe
[SPEAKER_02]: you need a CGMP certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the most anal place in the
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course, of course they're going to
make you fuck it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want leather.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to let you come through
easy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and the, it's, but it's cool to see
that because we're, we're, we're figuring
[SPEAKER_03]: out quickly also that as far as the hemp
game goes that the, the window for all the
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD guys is closing real fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're going to be some sore people
this year when they realize that what they
[SPEAKER_03]: thought was going to be $30 million worth
of something is going to be worth 300,000
[SPEAKER_03]: or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they, if they can get it even to
process, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's the issue that we're
running into.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of bottles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's so much hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And imagine what, imagine like he was
saying with the cross pollination,
[SPEAKER_03]: imagine what's going to happen in both
directions, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's going to be a whole bunch of
shitty, weed being grown because people
[SPEAKER_03]: are going to be like, Oh, I got this fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and they're growing and making seeds
from seed rather than using clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like if you really want to do breeding,
I feel like it's more ideal to use a clone
[SPEAKER_02]: for your receiver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, it's like with your
donor as well, selecting that donor that
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, that's tried and true with when
you're making your seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a lot of people aren't even testing
their seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just selling bulk seed,
you know, at a dollar a piece,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're selling a hundred thousand,
200,000, a million seeds to some of these
[SPEAKER_02]: companies and they're not even testing
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we saw stuff that was 13% THC that
was supposed to be hemp and zero percent
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was like, well, that was a good test.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, fuck, I think we're fucked.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you have nothing to harvest at all
there, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and we haven't figured out cannabis,
whether it's hemp or whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't figured out like the tomato
industry has figured it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's all cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're swearing on stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the funny thing though.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have waved in their face so hard with
this smokeable hemp right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: like to the point where it's like,
like I know I'm not smoking a smokeable
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp, but a shitload of people are out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's weird because like we,
the whole point of us getting it legal was
[SPEAKER_03]: to say, Hey, we're not, it's not really,
we're going to smoke it or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all of a sudden it's like,
that's all we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just high cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Low THC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's pretty much, and that's why the
people that are growing good are getting,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, 300 bucks a pound, let's say for
their smokeable hemp, but that market's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to drop soon too, because there's so
many.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to see all the smokeable hemp
that's super fire though.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's coming out for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's not as much, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's there technically, but it's not
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's producing it in large greenhouses
that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in quantity, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not in quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there going to be a drought 2.0?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: No?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like the beginning of the year where
shit went up to like 20 something?
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is that everybody saw that
happening and our reactions are so slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're quick and yet slow at the same
time because we're stoners, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like our reactions are like,
we're all thinking the same thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: but no one's really getting up to do it
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden it's like one day
no one shows up and they're all out doing
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they all come back online.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, oh shit, now we're all
cashing in at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those markets, I feel like there's
always going to be a shortage of good
[SPEAKER_03]: weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always a shortage of good weed,
but there's going to be way too much weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Way too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the black market's really changed too,
because metrics aren't in place in
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have all these licensed companies
that who knows where it's coming from.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be coming from those licensed
companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because the black market's got those
guys up in Humboldt and in Sonoma and in
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those guys got hit hard this year,
but there's still a lot of black market
[SPEAKER_02]: pot out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: No idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: No idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shoot the moon.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's interesting how like I saw it
maybe about five years ago or maybe even
[SPEAKER_03]: longer, maybe seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody in New York was telling me about
like $1,500 packs of sour diesel,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was all from out here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like, that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's the same price on both coasts,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what is there to be said anymore?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was, like I said, seven years ago
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the saturation points are getting,
like Oregon's a good example.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to Oregon and see what,
like they have six years worth of weed in
[SPEAKER_03]: storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Six years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's all just rotting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like nothing's getting better.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, it's going to be the state
of CBN for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just the fact that like that's one,
that's because they can grow pretty good
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like NorCal has become Southern Oregon
really when it comes to the, even the way
[SPEAKER_03]: the weather is moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's all kind of moving up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the sweet spots are all up there and
they just can grow too good, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and I think once it goes national,
then central California will control the
[SPEAKER_03]: market as they do with all the other
agriculture too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once interstate sales go online,
that's going to be big time game changer
[SPEAKER_02]: for Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they're the one, I mean,
they actually pushed and for to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: sell out of state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sitting on six years with the pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a, it's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they can, if they can pull that off,
then that's really like the beginning of
[SPEAKER_03]: the end of the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's when it starts to crumble
because it'll just set precedents for
[SPEAKER_03]: other states to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well now a lot of Oregon shops are doing
is they're switching over to hemp licenses
[SPEAKER_00]: because the hemp licenses are cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have to deal with all the
headache and all the bullshit and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: hoops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're just paying 500 bucks,
getting a hemp license and switching over.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was there a few weeks ago and it was,
it was pretty amazing to drive,
[SPEAKER_03]: like to drive to the one farm that I had
to go to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just passed probably 15 or 20 farms and
didn't see a single person out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was kind of like eerie because it
was like, wow, there's a lot of harvesting
[SPEAKER_03]: to be done here and a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't see a single person out there
doing any prep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like no one's kind of felt like they were
ready for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is, this is a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was before the, the, that,
that kind of snap came through.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we had it in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had one day, like we had just like all
of a sudden out of nowhere, we had one day
[SPEAKER_03]: that dropped down to love of 20 and the
high of 38 and snow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the day before it was 70 degrees
and the day after, or it was 87 degrees
[SPEAKER_03]: the day before and 78 degrees the day
after.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was just this weird, like one day
snap, but there's a lot of hemp farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: losing money.
[SPEAKER_02]: They scale too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I've heard about two farmers in
Oregon committing suicide.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if you guys heard about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was that real?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, but it seemed way.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lesson for everybody, you know,
that even if it's not real, it seemed very
[SPEAKER_03]: orchestrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of those stories where you're
like, okay, maybe it seems very dramatic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you lose a bunch of someone's
money like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you picked the right one.
[SPEAKER_03]: You definitely picked the right plant for
hanging yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's what she wants.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to do it with your own,
with your own hard earned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I paid money to the go fund me
page.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was really.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I'm kidding.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I saw that story and I was a little
bit like skeptical because it was almost
[SPEAKER_03]: like it was one of those deals where
you're like, I was standing in line and
[SPEAKER_03]: the girl turned around and you read the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you realize this is just a
trolley thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what the hell?
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so what else?
[SPEAKER_03]: What grinds your gears?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, thank you.
Thank you.
