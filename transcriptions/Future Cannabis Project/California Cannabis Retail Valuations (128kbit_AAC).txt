[SPEAKER_00]: Here in California, is there an
acquisition spree in terms of rolling up,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, retail?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's starting to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you're starting to see players
that are saying, we want to have 15,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20, 30 stores, which people talked about a
couple of years ago, but there weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: really that many people that are
practically speaking able to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the standpoint of what the multiples
are, there is no magic formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way California operates is much
different than most states.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have it where it's municipal by
municipal legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance, in Los Angeles,
you essentially had 135 pre-ICO retailers
[SPEAKER_00]: that were here that were licensed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you had 500 other rogue operators
that were spread across the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now those 135 should have some sort of
insulation attached to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the state and the city are certainly
making an effort to try to find the rogue
[SPEAKER_00]: operators and shut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have one of those 135,
those licenses are valuable because not
[SPEAKER_00]: only do you have the ability to operate
where the state should grant you your
[SPEAKER_00]: annual license when the annual licenses
really start getting doled out in a faster
[SPEAKER_00]: pace, but you also should theoretically
have first bite at the apple if Garcetti
[SPEAKER_00]: decides that he wants to expand the
program or Cat Packer decides that they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to expand the program in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you look at a city like San Diego,
they've already made their determination
[SPEAKER_00]: on how many they're going to give out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't see any additional legislation
coming forward to expand it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those licenses are a bit more valuable
because it's so finite and we don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: there's any path to issue new ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big X factor right now is what new
towns come to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: In San Diego, does Carlsbad or Oceanside
or Solana Beach or Delmar, do they start
[SPEAKER_00]: opening up and does it become valuable?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it does, then it dilutes the
market share away from the city from the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of licenses that are already out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same thing is true in the Bay
Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone was talking about the conference
today that Oakland had such an advantage
[SPEAKER_00]: for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that advantage was largely squandered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they didn't move forward with
legislation that was still appealing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as an investor or someone that's
looking to buy an asset like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to look at A, the addressable
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: B, you have to look at how easy is it
going to be to expand that market.
[SPEAKER_00]: C, you've got to look at who's going to
come in and attack that market from the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: D, you need to look at how big the state
market is and can you actually start
[SPEAKER_00]: selling away from it, whether it's through
delivery services or other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got to weigh all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you also need to weigh whether or
not the company was profitable in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to say, OK, well, we're going to
call it a three times revenue multiple.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to pay for an asset.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if that company is losing money,
then you have to decide whether or not you
[SPEAKER_00]: can actually bring it to profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's even a multiple to be paid
to those companies or whether it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: better to let them die and start fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm seeing as far as standard
metrics on retails is probably one to one
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half times revenue on an annual
basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, well, I'm going to call it a three
times revenue multiple.
So what I'm seeing as far as standard
metrics on retails is probably one to one.
