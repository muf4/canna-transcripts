[SPEAKER_01]: You were at span of this so one maybe talk
about like What you're seeing in Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: like if you're seeing any differences in
the European or specifically the the
[SPEAKER_01]: Barcelona market?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then like NorCal and then kind of
trends you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a trip because I'm gonna go
back a little bit in time, but I learned
[SPEAKER_00]: from Europeans originally how to make
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned from Mila back in the early
2000s I traveled to Europe and Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_00]: and learned from Mila and Nowadays me and
Mila travel the world teaching and Mila
[SPEAKER_00]: will say things like oh nicotine taught me
about fresh frozen and taught Europe about
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh frozen and so You know, I think a
lot of the American market learned from
[SPEAKER_00]: Europe originally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now since given a lot of tips and
trends to the European market and we've
[SPEAKER_00]: now Just been trading a lot of tech back
and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done live demonstrations in Europe
for over 10 years now from Amsterdam to
[SPEAKER_00]: now Barcelona and Teaching a lot of
technique in that realm doing live
[SPEAKER_00]: demonstrations But also receiving a lot of
information and learning every single day
[SPEAKER_00]: that I go out there You know the power
systems different in Europe than it is in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States just even converters for
the harvest right freeze dryers You know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's There's some cool things happening
in Europe cool trends One of the coolest
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I see is Europe has the
opportunity to do a lot more large-scale
[SPEAKER_00]: Fino hunting so they're able to do pop a
million seeds in in Morocco and places
[SPEAKER_00]: like that Fino hunt in Morocco and bring
back those keepers to Spain and I've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: Fino hunts on a larger scale than what
I've seen in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've seen a lot of Hash strains,
you know, they're seeing really cool
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers and terpene profiles From the
strains that they're Fino hunting for
[SPEAKER_00]: making hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to big up people like La Colada In
Barcelona people like HQ slight over there
[SPEAKER_00]: at the HQ lab people like La Sagrada farm
Terps army just crushing it out there in
[SPEAKER_00]: the solventless world and it's really cool
to see because they're piping that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: Mechanical separated side of things the
solvent side a lot more than the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States Europe has grown up smoking hash So
it's really cool to see them bringing this
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of hash that we're seeing this in
the United States that same high-end
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of our live rosin Things like that
and taking it to another level as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna mention La Colada again because
they've gotten Even further than the US
[SPEAKER_00]: with our rosin coins La Colada is now
laser etching their rosin coins with logos
[SPEAKER_00]: and people's images So they made me one
with my essential extracts image on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just some cool artistic Factions to
the solventless world out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you mentioned solventless Do you do
you personally operate within all like
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent and solventless?
[SPEAKER_00]: So since day one I've really promoted and
stood behind solventless back in the early
[SPEAKER_00]: 2000s when we started making hash There
wasn't a lot of information out there on
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrocarbons butane specifically and the
heavy metals and things left behind We
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have all the purge technology We
didn't even have closed loops back then in
[SPEAKER_00]: the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after you know 15, excuse me 15 years
or so I've learned so much when it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to the hydrocarbon side and Solvent side
of things that we now are working on some
[SPEAKER_00]: products that we're utilizing hydrocarbons
and ethanol and other chemical solvents
[SPEAKER_00]: because in reality in a solventless Lab
that I've been operating in for the last
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 to 15 years, you know making water hash
and dry sieve and mechanical separated
[SPEAKER_00]: products We've noticed that a lot of the
strains a lot of material I get are just
[SPEAKER_00]: not viable in that mechanical world But
they may be extremely viable in the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrocarbon world we may actually be able
to pull a lot more of those viable
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and The oils via different
chemical solvents that pull different
[SPEAKER_00]: parts of the plant basically so a good
Example and this is an old-school example,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I like to use it blue dream in
solventless that original cut clone only
[SPEAKER_00]: blue dream yields maybe between One and
five percent, but when we run it via
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrocarbons We're actually able to retain
a lot of those terpenes and we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 to 24 percent yields that same strain
So it's a viability thing and it's also a
[SPEAKER_00]: quality thing, you know when we run it
mechanically or solventlessly we retain a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more though that Waxy cuticle on the
outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the hydrocarbons are rupturing it
and they're able to separate it a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: easier I think it's a great thing because
it's Created a market for that strain and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's other strains now like that that
have a similar trichome structure So I
[SPEAKER_00]: just use blue dream as example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there's a lot of hate these
days on blue dream It kind of got played
[SPEAKER_00]: out, you know, like a lot of other things
in this world where people just over
[SPEAKER_00]: consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They like it a lot In the beginning it
yields well for the hydrocarbon side.
[SPEAKER_00]: It yields well on the flower side And then
it's just kind of overplayed out people
[SPEAKER_00]: sell it, you know, and it just gets Hyped
out of the circle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, so so for your own personal
production process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see a Scenario where maybe you do
like a first press Solventless to get like
[SPEAKER_01]: all the best stuff and then take
everything that's left over and do a
[SPEAKER_00]: second There's there's ways to create
Viability with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes For you know, that's how we like to
test things once you find out that the
[SPEAKER_00]: blue dream is not gonna be good in
solventless We're not gonna run it in
[SPEAKER_00]: solventless However, when we find a strain
like my chem DOG that does amazing in
[SPEAKER_00]: solventless Say, you know, I'm yielding
over 28 30 percent each and every time no
[SPEAKER_00]: matter who grows that strain I Run it I
yield that much there's still some
[SPEAKER_00]: byproduct left in that Material that we've
ran that you can do other, you know make
[SPEAKER_01]: other products with for sure And why do
you think that yields more in the
[SPEAKER_01]: solventless scenario than the blue dream?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a trichome structure the chem DOG has
a lot bigger of a trichome head a thinner
[SPEAKER_00]: cuticle it breaks the head off a lot
easier on that chem DOG compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: breaking the head and the stocks and some
plant material on that blue dream because
[SPEAKER_00]: the trichomes a lot More fragile on the
blue dream The chem D has just a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: sturdier of a trichome head that breaks
off a lot easier Plus the biggest thing
[SPEAKER_00]: with it after scoping it and running it
and processing it to rosin afterwards
[SPEAKER_00]: We've noticed that that chem D and other
strains, you know similar in nature and
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome structure have a thinner waxy
cuticle to the amount of oils inside so
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of oils inside are a lot more
80 90 percent oils compared to about you
[SPEAKER_00]: know a 10 percent waxy cuticle if not less
to be completely Honest compared to
[SPEAKER_00]: something like blue dream, which almost
has 80 percent wax and about 20 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: oil in the center of it It's just how that
trichome grows and there's other things
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can do to affect that waxy
cuticle Not using as many salts not not
[SPEAKER_00]: using as much sugar in the end process
Flushing better will actually grow more
[SPEAKER_00]: oil compared to wax So flushing that and
turning those sugars into oils in that end
[SPEAKER_00]: process of the flowering plant will
definitely have Help reduce your wax to
[SPEAKER_00]: oil ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as an extraction artist, you're
definitely reliant on Cultivators who are
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the cultivators that you love
working with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah You know, there's a lot and I've
operated out in Colorado for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked with You know some close family
dank by pink was one of our main producers
[SPEAKER_00]: in Colorado along with the 14er the farm
We had a few greenhouse grows down in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pueblo that crushed out for us as well
Coming to the California market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've looked at farm after farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done a few collaborations There's a
few out there on the shelves right now as
[SPEAKER_00]: we speak Some of my favorite farms to run
fresh frozen so far been Cali kosher That
[SPEAKER_00]: farm is crushing out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their greenhouses are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strains are proper and where it is
They're out in the Central Valley
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, they're they're really paying
attention to running strains that are good
[SPEAKER_00]: for hash yielding finding those phenotypes
and Growing them properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually kosher certified You know
as we move into a more regulated market,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're able to see more things of that
nature certifications Clean green
[SPEAKER_00]: certifications things of that nature And I
look for those certifications.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want people to be testing the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want them to be testing their soil
Flower as much as possible aside from the
[SPEAKER_00]: COAs that are regulated to actually enter
the market So yeah proactivity is key for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are some of the strains?
[SPEAKER_01]: That they're growing that you're sort of
currently excited about it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know we did some trials for the fresh
frozen of this for this hash cone this
[SPEAKER_00]: full malt hash cone collaboration and I
really really really like the frittles
[SPEAKER_00]: Forbidden fruit times skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one's going into play for this
collaboration I also really like this
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon bean, which is a lemon tree times og
Eddie lep It's one of the first lemon
[SPEAKER_00]: strains that really has that lemon rind
That still produces and solventless
[SPEAKER_00]: because after years and years of testing
the lemon G the lemon tree A lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: lemon strains out there just don't yield
for mechanical separations or solventless
[SPEAKER_00]: extractions But this lemon bean did work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So So you mentioned fresh frozen and I
feel like fresh frozen kind of came on the
[SPEAKER_01]: scene a couple years ago and farmers You
know, like I remember talking to Craig
[SPEAKER_01]: from talking trees farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, good friend of mine You know,
what percent of my farm am I gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: allocate to fresh frozen?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, okay and allocate 25% and
then I would assume this year based on how
[SPEAKER_01]: last year went he's gonna allocate either
more or less, so It's a big side of what
[SPEAKER_00]: we do is the consulting on that You know
helping farmers go from doing dry drying
[SPEAKER_00]: They actually you know one of the big
selling points for me coming in is I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: able to take a whole dry room Convert that
into a mom stable or another flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're producing more Stability in your
in your farm with a mom room or producing
[SPEAKER_00]: higher numbers and bigger margins If
you're gonna turn a dry room into another
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering room You're cutting down on your
staff and the amount of employees that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know coming into your field facility
via trim staff, etc because you're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: buck fresh frozen plants big leaf them and
Freeze them without having a trim staff
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting there over a table trimming the
material so we can get rid of that cost
[SPEAKER_00]: and that security issue and Yeah,
just freeing up the space freeing up the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost Going straight into a freezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coming in with freezer trucks able
to pick up this fresh frozen material I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it just helps the fluidity of a farm
of a farm turning over Well now let's talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about you're under the equation What do
you like more about getting fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_01]: material versus what like five years ago?
[SPEAKER_01]: You probably weren't getting anything
fresh frozen, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been running fresh frozen for about
ten years now So let's talk about ten
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago The day before you ever first in
your first fresh frozen to the day after
[SPEAKER_01]: and like what was the mind blowing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is game-changing the oil and the
terpene retention You know when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about dry material that's been
handled especially if we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: trim and the bottom of the bag and things
like that a lot of the trichome heads have
[SPEAKER_00]: already broken off without me breaking
them off and When they are broken off with
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of agitation in the bottom of a
turkey bag you're grabbing a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material and you're grabbing a lot
more of the Stuff that you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: waxes plant material things of that nature
when I get fresh frozen material I'm able
[SPEAKER_00]: to really control that variable and break
off the trichome heads properly if we can
[SPEAKER_00]: keep our environment cold the water and
ice mixture cold before that fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_00]: material hits I'm able to really just
break off the trichome heads and Because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're frozen straight from harvest It's
retaining a lot more of those air volatile
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes the terpenes that just want to
escape into the air Just naturally so
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's fresh frozen We're able to
retain a lot more of those and just a
[SPEAKER_00]: quality control thing the less hands on
that material The less it's been touched
[SPEAKER_00]: and agitated the higher quality and
product we can retain so now talk live
[SPEAKER_01]: resin Live resin compared to live rosin or
just in general because I feel like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of newish To the scene like live
resin really hit the the commercial market
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time Fresh-frozen hit so about
10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, really around this one Colorado for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like I think the California market
on Concentrates was behind it was lagging
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crazy to say that, you know,
I'm I'm California, you know, I'm from
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that a lot of Californians,
you know would Probably agree but be
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised, you know that that Colorado
really pushed forward with that
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate market But in reality I think
one of the reasons we were in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: able to push forward with concentrate
market and create this higher echelon of
[SPEAKER_00]: products is Because we came with
regulation first Colorado was the first to
[SPEAKER_00]: implement the these new laws of regulation
recreational tightening down on all the
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance side of things and You know,
we were able to write things down first in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado I moved back to Colorado to
operate essential extracts in 2009 Because
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado was the first place to allow me
to pay taxes on hashish California
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't let me yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Colorado really gave me the opportunity
to study and to write these things down
[SPEAKER_00]: and to replicate our processes so It's
crazy to say but I think that Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: really stepped up game when it came to
concentrates and did Exceed California for
[SPEAKER_00]: a minute now, California is you know
pushing back with the regulatory system
[SPEAKER_00]: that's come into place here New
recreational cannabis just keep pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: that echelon You know only the strong will
survive right now Yeah Well, so this is
[SPEAKER_00]: this Is a interesting story.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had first started running fresh frozen
when I was working with a company called
[SPEAKER_00]: pink house in Colorado and this is 2010 so
almost ten years ago is when we really
[SPEAKER_00]: started running fresh frozen the
commercial market and It's funny because
[SPEAKER_00]: this this gentleman and I'm not even name
his name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm spacing his name right now,
but Kind of a negative person in our
[SPEAKER_00]: industry kept coming at me being like you
don't know what you're doing You're not
[SPEAKER_00]: running live material I thought about it
and this is you know, ten years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like live into what's this guy talking
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a little kooky, but he might have
something with that term And so we
[SPEAKER_00]: actually pulled down this Skywalker
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we had a row of six lights of
Skywalker Where my partner at pink house
[SPEAKER_00]: was like have at it try it live try it
fresh And so at this point we didn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: freeze that material.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was straight bucking down a whole
plant Chucking off the big leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: chucking off the Buds into a fresh frozen
bucket and we are hand paddling this
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket Ten years ago and we came out with
this amazing live oil is what we were
[SPEAKER_00]: calling it live solventless oil And it was
a lot more oily than the dry material
[SPEAKER_00]: running a lot more terpene heavy Just
potent this stuff was crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Skywalker back then was og times mazar
It wasn't the Skywalker og that we know
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was an older Skywalker Fino that was
Mazar times blueberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I said og but mazar times mazar
ice Sharif times blueberry and it had this
[SPEAKER_00]: halitosis Funk to it and when we ran it
live.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was even that much more intense the
room smelled like death in a good way and
[SPEAKER_00]: From there we really started promoting
that term that live term because then we
[SPEAKER_00]: started playing with freezing that
material and running it in our solventless
[SPEAKER_00]: situation and we were doing collaborations
and Working with friends of ours in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry one of those friends and one of
those companies back then Got together and
[SPEAKER_00]: a few of the heads got together in the
same room And I might not be explaining
[SPEAKER_00]: the story how they explain it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is exactly how I remember it we were
all at Giddyups lab and It was kind Bill
[SPEAKER_00]: and Ry Pritchard and a few of the other
friends over there At Giddyups lab and we
[SPEAKER_00]: started talking about how the solventless
guys were doing this live material and
[SPEAKER_00]: they wanted to try Fresh frozen live
material in the hydrocarbon setup and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where live rosin came from later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dubbed Live or sorry, that's where live
resin came from later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We dubbed the term live rosin for fresh
frozen hash that we then pressed into
[SPEAKER_00]: rosin So live resin came first before the
term live rosin but the idea of fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen and running live material actually
came from the solventless world Live resin
[SPEAKER_00]: is via hydrocarbon butane extraction fresh
frozen butane extraction is live resin
[SPEAKER_00]: Live rosin is fresh frozen mechanical
separation or fresh frozen solventless
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So live rosin we're running fresh frozen
material into live water hash and Then we
[SPEAKER_00]: press that water hash into rosin that's
live rosin and on the other side of things
[SPEAKER_00]: are using a closed-loop system with
jacketing and running at sub temperatures.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot there's a lot of really cool
Extract artists out there just pushing the
[SPEAKER_00]: boundaries of what a solventless
extraction, you know really means I got
[SPEAKER_00]: friends like Rackham solventless that's
crushing it and that Mechanically
[SPEAKER_00]: separated side soil grown solventless is
doing really good work Man there's so many
[SPEAKER_01]: like what are the nuances of some of their
technique?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm sure you guys talk technique and
like how'd you like this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what'd you do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, this is what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's clever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what what are some?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if people are pushing the
boundaries, my assumption is that's that's
[SPEAKER_01]: a technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know innovation compared to
making bubble hash In my uncle's hot barn
[SPEAKER_00]: in Mendocino, you know 20 years ago in an
uncontrolled environment Uncontrolled
[SPEAKER_00]: starting material we were making kind of
brown pliable mildewy smelling bubble hash
[SPEAKER_00]: for years and things have changed a lot
since then we've really promoted the
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment aspect of making
water hash so people are using walk-in
[SPEAKER_00]: freezers and it's one of the first things
I promoted on a John Doe radio show back
[SPEAKER_00]: in 2009 2010 Was I make my hash in a
walk-in freezer?
[SPEAKER_00]: So after taking a look at all these
different labs via collaborations in
[SPEAKER_00]: California seeing the different nuances
and differences between different extract
[SPEAKER_00]: artists You know, it's really cool to see
what we came from from making hash in a
[SPEAKER_00]: hot barn to now all of these extraction
artists are working in walk-in freezers
[SPEAKER_00]: and really really controlling their
environment, which is cool to see And just
[SPEAKER_00]: the slight differences are really cool to
see as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I promote Creating an ice water bath that
you have full temperature control before
[SPEAKER_00]: you even put your material in there I've
seen some of these extract artists put
[SPEAKER_00]: their material in the bottom of a bucket
with ice in it and then start adding room
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature water and I think it's cool
that I'm able to see some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: differences and come in and you know
change some of their SOPs and learn from
[SPEAKER_00]: them as well So, you know, it's really
cool to see all these changes happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: our industry and people sharing freely
because it's pushing Boundaries of what we
[SPEAKER_00]: can do and it's creating a higher echelon
for the products we're making out here So
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about you just mentioned SOPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are some of the common things when
you walk into someone's operation that You
[SPEAKER_01]: know by talk to people who consult with
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like they pick a couple of things
that they're noticing Yeah, one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I've been trying to change as
I go into facilities is now that a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people have gone that walk-in freezer
route it's rad and they're working the
[SPEAKER_00]: walk-in freezer in the Retaining those
terpenes and the stability of the product
[SPEAKER_00]: But the second they walk out of their
walk-in freezer oftentimes these walk-in
[SPEAKER_00]: freezers are placed in cultivations In
other facilities that aren't completely
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature humidity controlled throughout
the entire facility so I've been coming in
[SPEAKER_00]: and helping people design the actual flow
of these laboratories and Controlling the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and humidity in the entire
square foot of the building through the
[SPEAKER_00]: walkways, etc It's creating a lot more
shelf stability is what I'm seeing because
[SPEAKER_00]: when you go from your walk-in cooler to a
75 degree 50 percent humidity and humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're almost mitigating You know the fact
that you're using that control in the
[SPEAKER_00]: walk-in freezer by coming out into that
environment So I've been helping
[SPEAKER_00]: Facilities with not only their launch,
but they're built out at this point It's
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the cool things that I've learned
just coming from a psychology background
[SPEAKER_00]: and a hash making background I've now to
you know learn to design and sketch up and
[SPEAKER_00]: convert that into CAD and help these
companies come online with a proper
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure and actually building So,
have fun!
You
