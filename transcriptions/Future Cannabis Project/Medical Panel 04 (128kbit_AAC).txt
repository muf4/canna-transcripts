[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking about how things have proven to
be helpful but you still have that stigma
[SPEAKER_00]: of people not wanting to, like I've seen a
lot of advertising when they were trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to legalize them to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still that stigma about what it's
going to do to the community and that
[SPEAKER_00]: group of people who still don't believe
that it is actually helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say that you still face them
trying to help children hold on to this
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that is still giving them a good
life?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question was, do we still face a
stigma as cannabis and is it helpful
[SPEAKER_04]: versus harmful, essentially?
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, education is our biggest
boulder.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just a real lack of, everyone has
a strong opinion these days and not a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of information.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the less information they have,
the stronger their opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Dunning-Pruder effect of the
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, it's really difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just, I don't know, I could talk
for an hour just on that alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I'm sure you've experienced that
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing is going on with vaccines.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of disinformation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm doing exemptions and I'm just
getting fought.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're like, oh, vaccines are safe and
effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the end of the story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, same thing with this.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you really research cannabis,
you'll find out that it's very safe and
[SPEAKER_03]: effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we keep running into the stuff
like it's not legal and forced to get
[SPEAKER_03]: blocked because Governor Brown wants his
taxes and all that kind of craziness.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about these kids?
[SPEAKER_04]: I will say also, though, that that's why
charities and the passion work is so
[SPEAKER_04]: important because that all changes when
your loved one gets sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've had people from the sheriff's
department who yelled at me at one meeting
[SPEAKER_04]: and called me two months later when their
nephew started seizing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we help them secretly because they're
afraid.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had families from Beale Air Force
Base call me, terrified they're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: get fired but scared for their loved one's
life.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had families from the fire
department, churches where they're afraid
[SPEAKER_04]: they're church group.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a cultural thing that really
shelters, they shelter themselves against
[SPEAKER_04]: being educated about it, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when they come to us, we help them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any child.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say no to, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I will say is as that happens,
their paradigm shifts immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: When they start to see results,
even if, you know, cannabis isn't magic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't save every life.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it improves every quality of life,
especially to those with terminal illness.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the kids who can smile again,
ease their suffering, even though they're
[SPEAKER_04]: not going to make it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some brain cancers, very low success rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the difference in those days is just
as powerful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not all about if it's not going to
save you, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's something special to be said for
just easing suffering in our communities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you experience that firsthand,
all that silliness goes out the window.
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is the people with the
strongest opinions and who end up harming
[SPEAKER_04]: the most people with those misinformed
opinions, they haven't had those
[SPEAKER_04]: experiences, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very difficult to teach that
without that firsthand experience,
[SPEAKER_04]: especially when they're unwilling to
listen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we out of time or what do we got?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, so, hi camera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're shut down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't, I can't accept donations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with that being said, you can't give
away cannabis in products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And California and what we have to do,
and I'm still a father whose son needs
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know a lot of families who do need
medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that legally we can absolutely
connect donations with where they need to
[SPEAKER_04]: go.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just extremely cumbersome because we
can't function as the middle man for that
[SPEAKER_04]: to help facilitate that process.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what I would say to people who want to
donate cannabis, there's always someone
[SPEAKER_04]: who could benefit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that working with cannabis,
that's in rooted in the spirit of working
[SPEAKER_04]: with cannabis, whether it's kids,
you know, what's your passion,
[SPEAKER_04]: whether it's veterans, whether it's
seniors, whether it's hospice care,
[SPEAKER_04]: right, whether it's mental health,
there's somewhere that you could take that
[SPEAKER_04]: work and a portion of that can benefit and
uplift your community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just connecting with the
patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have things that you'd like to
get with the families of kids who need it,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we could connect you in a way
where we could do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Legally and responsibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would like to make a comment and see if
you guys are both comfortable with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that I think is really
good about this being the first panel or
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the first discussions of this day
is the medical use of cannabis really is
[SPEAKER_01]: at the heart of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The legalization efforts that's happened
in California over the last 20 some years,
[SPEAKER_01]: started because of the medical benefit of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: People's direct experience showed them
that the prohibitionist propaganda was
[SPEAKER_01]: bullshit, pardon my language.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we moved the conversation a lot,
not just here in our local jurisdiction,
[SPEAKER_01]: but across the state and across the world
for that matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's medical that's helping to change
that story.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all appreciate, I appreciate the,
as it's called, recreational or
[SPEAKER_01]: inspirational aspects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the real movement on this question
around prohibition had to do with
[SPEAKER_01]: legitimate medical use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the real tragedies of
California legalization is despite 20 some
[SPEAKER_01]: years of actual practical experience of
seeing cannabis work as medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: state law has basically dismantled all
that mechanism that was created across our
[SPEAKER_01]: state.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you as individuals can reach out to
your elected officials, both locally and
[SPEAKER_01]: at the state level, and make them aware of
this problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, the need did not go away just
because the rules changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are supposed to listen to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are our representatives that you need
to stand up and speak for some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: families, some of our children who need
this as medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And pardon my little rant there,
but one last thing I want to say is in the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation about CBD I wanted to pop up
and just say, I tend to think of CBD and
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been playing with it for a number of
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is the part of cannabis that helps
me and others feel good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing wrong with feeling good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually a good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's way too many things in our
life that want us to feel bad and scared
[SPEAKER_01]: and driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this plant is in fact truly a healing
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's, I guess, all I got on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would ask if either you want to say
anything else before we wrap up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are we out of time or interest or where
are we at this point?
[SPEAKER_03]: Technically late.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me just try to wrap up with some
thoughts.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is that cannabis can treat darn near
anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially if you know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The research is coming along slowly but
surely.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of it's overseas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Israel is a real hub of good research.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got some good research on the effects
of cannabis in autism and in dementia and
[SPEAKER_03]: in a whole lot of other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really looking good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got all these new cannabinoids being
discovered as we go along.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the things that needs to
happen is that these plants need to be
[SPEAKER_03]: bred for higher whatever it is,
CBG as an example, higher mercine,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is one of the terpenes and all that,
so that they're more effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD plants are way more effective than the
ones that didn't have any CBD in them for
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what about CBG purposes or all that
stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the terpenes and all that?
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, I'm looking for those of you
that are interested in this to keep
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at this and go, okay, what's the
next CBD and how do I breed it and grow it
[SPEAKER_03]: and make it available at a decent price
because you will benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so will the patient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we could have better pain relieving
cannabis, better anxiety relieving
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, a lot better sleep cannabis than
we have, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys with me on this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looks like they're in agreement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't go way out too far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, that's where we need to go and
I'd say if you're in the game,
[SPEAKER_03]: study some of the science about this and
see, okay, yeah, and if you need resources
[SPEAKER_03]: on that, talk to me or Forrest or Wade and
there's some pretty good stuff out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
Thank you.
