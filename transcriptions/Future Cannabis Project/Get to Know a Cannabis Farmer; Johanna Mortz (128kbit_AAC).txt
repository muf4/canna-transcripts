[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a small farmer in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have applied for the 5,000 square foot
permit but probably only have 2,500 square
[SPEAKER_00]: feet in cultivation currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been farming in Mendocino for the
last five years and we are in the Willets
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachian of Mendocino County and I
think what makes us or our small tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: little 5,000 square feet farm unique is
that we are at 2,500 feet elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of afternoon shade so we're
not in full sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have really warm days but it never gets
over 100 and we have cooler nights with a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice breeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having cultivated in different counties
around Northern California I've found
[SPEAKER_00]: there's something very special about that
combination for where we are that produces
[SPEAKER_00]: a really high quality resin content and a
really nice looking sun-grown flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not as much dust in the air for me
so it stays cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the first few years we have been
really into testing genetics so we tested
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of different varietals and a lot of
different genetics and I have really kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of started enjoying the orange varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have a really lovely terpene
profile and something in that area makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it very clean tasting so you really get
the orange flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been pretty good at pest and
mold resistance especially in that area
[SPEAKER_00]: because we do get some moisture coming in
from the coast so something that's mold
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant and not a really super large
flower but still dense nugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I find that some of the more OGs or larger
denser nug profiles tend to not do as well
[SPEAKER_00]: although I'm really excited this year we
are testing some from a friend who has a
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic company on the coast who's been
doing mixes and has kind of acclimatized
[SPEAKER_00]: to the wetter areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: His name is Jesse Dodd with BioVortex and
he's an amazing cultivator and
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative farmer so yeah really excited
to see how those genetics do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we grow all of our plants in the ground
and soil and living soil I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming more it's becoming more popular
it's coming back in my mind growing
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoors in the ground because I think
that's how it originated that's how a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant grows but I think because of
prohibition and moving inside people took
[SPEAKER_00]: to growing in pots and then when they
could go back outside they just kept the
[SPEAKER_00]: pots so I think that it's unique to us but
not just to us it's not a Mendocino thing
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's becoming more popular
especially with the terroir and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachians becoming a point of focus
people I think in order to really know how
[SPEAKER_00]: your terroir affects your cannabis you
have to be in the ground you have to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: your terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: For people that are not growing in the
native soil in pots they're not really
[SPEAKER_00]: experiencing the full terroir or their
full Appalachians so I would go as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: to say they can't really classify
themselves in any terroir because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: only like halfway there they're only
getting the outside elements as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in the ground and what's in the
ground is so important because it's what's
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding the plant so we do all compost
teas we actually my partner is the mad
[SPEAKER_00]: scientist behind our compost teas he's who
I've learned everything from he's been on
[SPEAKER_00]: this Beyond Organic growing practices for
the past five years seven years so I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know that compost tea recipes but
I know that we basically feed our soil
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff for the bugs that's in the soil and
then the bugs are what's feeding the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't use any liquid nutrients or
fertilizer we actually don't use any
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides or fungicides we actually have
a full integrated pest management program
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've been working on for the last two
years and I've really found really awesome
[SPEAKER_00]: success with I think it's not about like
not having anything out there it's about
[SPEAKER_00]: maintaining and knowing your ecosystem and
so I with the testing regulations and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything going on right now our biggest
battle is microbiological but it feels
[SPEAKER_00]: good to not ever have to worry about the
pesticides well we have a 50 gallon brewer
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have a 1500 gallon brewer that we
only have five acres and when we got that
[SPEAKER_00]: one my partner's intent was to do like all
of our other vegetation as well because it
[SPEAKER_00]: 1500 gallons of tea is a lot of tea it's
been a really interesting and amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: learning journey for sure learning every
day I think if you're not learning you're
[SPEAKER_00]: not doing it right well we use ladybugs so
pretty constantly we use I just released
[SPEAKER_00]: our last release of Cocumerus mites and
California kiss I like the slow release
[SPEAKER_00]: sachets of the Cocumerus because seems
like they like to stick around we also use
[SPEAKER_00]: green lace wings we've used Trica dirt
some some of the names I'm a little but
[SPEAKER_00]: for for moths for caterpillars we use the
Andersonian Swarovski I don't know there's
[SPEAKER_00]: there's kind of an array depending on what
you're trying to combat and for me I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of have a steady supply of a good
few of them so yeah I'm still learning I
[SPEAKER_00]: think it's super fascinating and we've
been working with a beneficial insectary
[SPEAKER_00]: in Redding and I've been really excited to
learn from them and Kelly Bance that's who
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been working with yeah you
