[SPEAKER_00]: Cat Packer.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people in the room know Cat
Packer?
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cat Packer, come on up.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the Drug Policy Alliance,
she is going to quickly talk to you as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple things I want to let folks know
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: First and foremost, this Friday at 10 a
.m., there's going to be a cannabis town
[SPEAKER_00]: hall that Assemblymember Reggie
Jones-Sawyer is putting out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a flyer here, so if anyone is
interested in coming to the town hall,
[SPEAKER_00]: there are going to be representatives from
the Governor's Office of Business and
[SPEAKER_00]: Workforce Development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, Lori Ajax, the Chief of the Bureau,
is going to be there as well, so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be one of the first and more
recent times that we're going to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: hear from statewide stakeholders about
what's happening in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tonight, as folks are talking about what
it means to give back and to do the right
[SPEAKER_00]: thing, I kind of just want to share a
quick story and just read something to you
[SPEAKER_00]: real quick because when folks are having
these conversations, it gets really
[SPEAKER_00]: upsetting to me because we often don't
talk about the things that actually matter
[SPEAKER_00]: in these spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the times, we're just focused on
money, and so I really appreciate Jackie
[SPEAKER_00]: Yu pulling this conversation together
because it's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wanted to read to you all was just
some text that had come out of a recent
[SPEAKER_00]: news article that had came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been circling and been on my mind for
a while now, but last year around this
[SPEAKER_00]: time, there was a young African-American
male who was driving in his car with his
[SPEAKER_00]: girlfriend and a young five-year-old in
the back seat, and he was shot by a police
[SPEAKER_00]: officer, and we recently just got dash cam
footage to figure out what was going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: that particular situation, and the police
officer basically said that he feared for
[SPEAKER_00]: his life because this young
African-American man, there was evidence
[SPEAKER_00]: that he had been smoking in front of the
passenger, in front of this five-year-old
[SPEAKER_00]: child, and that smoke itself made the
officer fear for his life so much that he
[SPEAKER_00]: shot this young man seven times,
and it was just kind of outrageous that
[SPEAKER_00]: the marijuana smoke is what caused him to
fear for his life, and yet this police
[SPEAKER_00]: officer shot seven times into a vehicle
with a five-year-old child right there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I didn't hear anything from the
marijuana industry about it, and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: upsetting because if you all are the folks
who are going to be carrying this plant as
[SPEAKER_00]: your brand, you need to be able to stand
up for other community members.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an old poem that was written
about, I guess it was written about Nazis
[SPEAKER_00]: at the time, but they said, first they
came for the socialists, and I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: speak out because I was not a socialist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they came for the trade unionists,
and I did not speak out because I was not
[SPEAKER_00]: a trade unionist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they came for the Jews, and I did not
speak out because I was not a Jew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they came for me, and there was no
one left to speak for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about Jeff Sessions and
how he likes to use drug war rhetoric to
[SPEAKER_00]: escalate situations, we know that that
language is racial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's used to bolster up racial tensions,
and it's directed, and it's very much
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted towards low-income communities
and communities of color, but you just
[SPEAKER_00]: wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you sit there and you stay silent,
they're going to be coming for your door.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might get seven shots, or maybe it's
your child who gets seven shots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keep that in mind as we're moving
this conversation forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drug war is alive and well,
and it's not going to go away unless we
[SPEAKER_00]: stand together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time there's an issue, regardless of
if it's a black person, a white person,
[SPEAKER_00]: a child, a patient, we have to stand
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to stand with you and fight for
the right things, and I hope that you all
[SPEAKER_00]: are here to fight with me for the right
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
