[SPEAKER_01]: We're sitting in your 5,000 square foot
row in Pacoima, California in the Black
[SPEAKER_01]: Haze Room.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a unique way of doing your indoor
grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Explain that to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I don't know if it's so much unique
as much as it's just an old way of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way that used to be referred to as
Dutch trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm correct on it, it was really more
popular kind of in the 90s and the
[SPEAKER_00]: primitive use of it was with kind of rain
gutters and the water was fed to the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and it would recirculate into a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just the way that we've grown for
13 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really like the way the herb comes out
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a good smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every grower thinks they have greater,
but our, I think the consensus,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of patients, it does very well at
shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically what the system is that we
have are six inch PVC pipes with five inch
[SPEAKER_00]: net pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We drill holes into the net pots and the
roots sit suspended in the pipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water circulates over the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called NFT or a nutrient film
technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it washes over the roots and
recirculates into the reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it energy or resource efficient?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very efficient for water because the
water circulates.
[SPEAKER_00]: This room has 210 gallons of water in it
and it gets changed once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't use soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you use in place of soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: We use rock wool with hydroton.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could just use straight rock wool like
a lot of people do, but what I've found is
[SPEAKER_00]: a hydroton repels algae better.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the grow down cubes of the rock
wool algae just seems to have an easy time
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go to a lot of grows,
you'll notice, well, everybody uses a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of flora flex now, so it blocks the light
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But before those days, those are the caps
that it's a brand name for the caps that
[SPEAKER_00]: people put on top of the large rock wool
cubes, which is the common way people do
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponic these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, do you use any nutrients or
fertilizers or any chemicals at all?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes, we use we use 10 different
nutrients from four different companies in
[SPEAKER_00]: our formula that we mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just use a lot of the classic
companies, general hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_00]: botanic care, Super Thrive, a couple of
things from the company, Canadian Express.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also use a product from Mills.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're really hitting a lot of companies
across what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've just found the things that work and
we've pieced it together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk a little bit about your harvesting,
your cultivation practice, how many
[SPEAKER_01]: strains you have running at any point in
time and how many harvests you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to run more strains than we do
now, and a lot of that is because testing
[SPEAKER_00]: has gotten very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't make much sense to run three
or four varieties in a room because the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing really starts to eat into your
profit margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since we are a boutique craft scale
grow operation, we're a specialty size,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is up to five thousand square feet
of canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our real canopy size is about twenty two
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start eating up a lot of that and
testing, it basically kills our
[SPEAKER_00]: profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've had to scale down to just one
or two varieties per room so that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing a maximum of two tests for the
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although then we do the pre rolls,
which is a couple more tests as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, before we get to the pre rolls,
which is a new product you're putting out
[SPEAKER_01]: on the market, you raise sort of the issue
of margins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how tight are the margins in a in this
marketplace?
[SPEAKER_01]: And in a grow of this size?
[SPEAKER_00]: Margins are tight for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of cultivation, if you're
profitable, I think that's a feat in
[SPEAKER_00]: itself right now, because I do I
personally believe that a lot of large
[SPEAKER_00]: operations and small operations are not
profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are searching for the right niche
for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until that happens, it's it's just the
nature of the beast.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also a huge investment bubble in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of people that don't
subscribe to regular market fundamentals
[SPEAKER_00]: such as profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more interested in market share
than profitability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's kind of created a bit of a
distortion on the production side that you
[SPEAKER_00]: just have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if a fund comes in and they're
putting down 20 million on a grow and they
[SPEAKER_00]: can afford to lose money month after month
while they establish their market share,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just a reality you have to compete
against for us as a small craft or we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to make money to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so finding that niche and that place
that we can achieve profitability is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically if we do, we survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't, we don't survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in other words, in addition to the the
testing costs for additional strains,
[SPEAKER_01]: if a strains out on the market and it
isn't moving, that's not really working
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fair to say if you can't sell your
weed at the price you need to sell it for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to be in trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go into a shop and you're
distributed by Refinery Distro,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Refinery does my distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known I've gone way back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I've been in the industry since
05 and back in the days where we used to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a lot of civil disobedience and
protests and we used to lay down and block
[SPEAKER_00]: DEA cars when they would raid shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Bush years were exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the people I know I've known
from back in those days when it was very
[SPEAKER_00]: antagonistic between the federal
government and even the local government
[SPEAKER_00]: and the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Refinery does my distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known them over there for over a
decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: As with most of the shops I deal with and
have always dealt with are the people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are here pre-07.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of my personal relationships go
way back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wasn't the Cultivations Alliance,
didn't that fold into a group or did it
[SPEAKER_01]: stay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's basically folded into the
Southern California Coalition.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Cultivators Alliance still exists as
an entity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, that was kind of a
conduit along with some other groups such
[SPEAKER_00]: as the California Minority Alliance and
GLACA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Delivery Alliance as well now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of rolled into a larger group to
try to encompass as much of the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: as we could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from the very beginning, you've been
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been out there representing Los
Angeles Cultivators for years and years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about that journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why did you step up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're pretty visible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been a leader in that role.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: That happened because when I first started
here in 2000, 2005, I had the great
[SPEAKER_00]: fortune of going to work for Don Duncan,
who is one of the founders of Americans
[SPEAKER_00]: for Safe Access and has really been the
leader in pushing positive legislation for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of those, what I had mentioned
before about protests and civil
[SPEAKER_00]: disobedience, that was all tactics that
had to be used in those days to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: shops to be allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so going from that and having Don as
my mentor, I saw how he organized the
[SPEAKER_00]: shops back in those days to push back and
to get the licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I first got my warehouse up here,
I looked at this and thought, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no permit process for me yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't really rely on somebody else
to come do it for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw how it happened with the shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just decided it was time to try
to find like-minded cultivation people
[SPEAKER_00]: that had their own and wanted to come and
push for a regulated industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we organized, found those like-minded
people, and we formed the group.
[SPEAKER_01]: How have the politics of the city changed?
[SPEAKER_01]: How different are they now?
[SPEAKER_00]: The politics is one issue and then the
economics is the other issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let me put it to you this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the LA growers that you've known over
the years, how many of them are not going
[SPEAKER_01]: for licenses?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the two pressures I think that
every grower has had over the last three
[SPEAKER_00]: years is one, meeting the regulatory
challenges and process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other one is the economics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as cultivation of cannabis has gotten
more prevalent and up north has dealt with
[SPEAKER_00]: this as well, prices have collapsed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prices are about, you know, a third to
half of what they were 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a lot of cases, less than a third.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think people who weren't efficient
struggled to get through that even before
[SPEAKER_00]: the permitting had started, which presents
a whole nother set of challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coming through, and I think at the end of
the day, people who are growing are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at it as, how am I supporting my
livelihood?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them just looked at the path
towards regulation and said, this isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if I'm just gonna be honest about
why, I would say 90% of the growers I know
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't went for license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be fair, a lot of those 90%,
they hung it up a year and a half ago
[SPEAKER_00]: anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the number of growers I know who
are still growing and are gung-ho black
[SPEAKER_00]: market, I don't even know if I know
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them just, they've kind of washed
out and have moved on to other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them, interestingly, are
consultants for a lot of the big companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that come in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think those who have been pretty
successful at growing and who have been
[SPEAKER_00]: able to differentiate, and as I said
before, find their niche, are continuing
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with us, we're lucky that we kind of
have found our niche, which you've
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered yourself in shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the question for me is,
at the end of the day, will the Los
[SPEAKER_01]: Angeles cultivator community be a fraction
of what it previously was?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll just be much smaller, but more
dedicated?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is that what we're looking at?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or will new people come in and try and
take up the slack?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's plenty of new people who are
already here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a different type of person than
the grower before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody has a different idea of
where their place is and how they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think with a lot of people, have looked
at it as everybody wants to scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you scale correctly,
I think, is the one that I'm not sure
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody's really nailed yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times, people scale up and the
quality suffers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just working out those issues,
is a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of cannabis out there,
at least the feedback I hear, a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality out there isn't as good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've heard people talk about a race to the
bottom on it, and it very well could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also know that those who can produce
a quality that will differentiate itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: will differentiate itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our company here, Legacy Strains,
we're not carried in very many shops
[SPEAKER_00]: because we don't produce that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the nine shops that we are carried in,
they buy up all of our inventory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I had more inventory, we could open
more shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you breaking even?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you profitable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you sustain yourself, your business
model, currently?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are OK right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if in the future we can,
which is a whole other dilemma.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dilemma is the real estate prices and
the rental prices for cannabis facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go back five, eight, nine years
ago, industrial was renting for $0.75 a
[SPEAKER_00]: square foot, $0.80 a square foot,
sometimes even $0.65 a square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're doing cannabis,
you're lucky if you're under $1.50.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of brand new turnkey places,
they come at you with $3 a square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't think that that is realistic
long term because I think prices will
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to face a downward pressure as
scaling does ramp up and people do start
[SPEAKER_00]: to become successful at scaling really
well quality wise.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mean pricing of product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wholesale pound price will,
I think, continue to fall a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think will happen with with
craft or artisan boutique products such as
[SPEAKER_01]: yours?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think prices will be maintained?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see the marketplace?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you see out there in the
marketplace?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is something I ask all the
time, like the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the consumer just want the cheapest or
or do you think there's connoisseurs out
[SPEAKER_01]: there who will pay for quality and
continue to?
[SPEAKER_00]: This comes from my I was a budtender for
nine years while I moonlighted learning
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing a lot of people I think
forget and especially I think a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside people outside the cannabis
industry getting into it is they look at
[SPEAKER_00]: this large untapped consumer base.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality of it is it has always
been is that 20 percent of cannabis users
[SPEAKER_00]: consume 80 percent of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can try to target people that are
in that other 80 percent that consumes 20
[SPEAKER_00]: percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is an untapped market.
[SPEAKER_00]: How big that is is anybody's guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do think that the core constituency
still is that 20 percent of cannabis users
[SPEAKER_00]: and they generally care about really good
quality cannabis or else they want the
[SPEAKER_00]: cheapest cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are kind of the two everywhere
in the middle is kind of a no man's land.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for myself, as long as the consumer
will pay is willing to pay fifty dollars,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe up to fifty five dollars for an
eighth of some of the nicest herb they can
[SPEAKER_00]: see on the shelf, I will be OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the day comes when the consumer will no
longer pay fifty dollars for the nicest
[SPEAKER_00]: herb in the shelf, then what I am doing
needs to change because that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if if the ceiling becomes thirty five
dollars, then this business model is
[SPEAKER_00]: unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But but if it stays at 50 and a lot of
people, they they come in and they want
[SPEAKER_00]: the nicest jar there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bud tenders pick ours out and say
this is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's and the price point is around there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that small price points make a huge
difference in markets in these markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, the retailers five dollar
price point is less than a five dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: change on the wholesale side as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But speaking of of of your product in
particular, it will go for 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also 50, like a mile and a half from
Greg's place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's selling for 50 and eight at actually
at Buds and Roses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, and actually that's not that
far away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there are some differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're basically in the 40 or the 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think I think to be fair,
you have to look at the the demographics
[SPEAKER_00]: in the area that Aaron is with Buds and
Roses in the area Greg's at with refinery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just they're dealing with
different clientels altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aaron is kind of in the creme de la creme
of the studio city, you know, getting
[SPEAKER_00]: close to Sherman Oaks area on Ventura.
[SPEAKER_01]: No doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just sort of noting the different price
points around the city and how it changes,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I would imagine Aaron,
I would imagine Buds and Roses is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: paying more per square foot on their shop
than Greg is playing over over on Oxnard
[SPEAKER_00]: and Kester.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my my concerns, number one,
personally, is taxes are definitely tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a lot easier, I think,
a lot of us initially to have the taxes
[SPEAKER_00]: start to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulations are really crazy to deal
with as a small cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have had to pay my entire savings,
life savings into hiring consultants and
[SPEAKER_00]: attorneys try to get me through this
application process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just for being a small kind of
self-funded person, it's pretty brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we the other side of it is as far
as what would I like to see a larger
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people such as myself
who've been around a long time and have
[SPEAKER_00]: been part of cannabis kind of as a culture
in this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as the commodification of it
starts to happen, some of those cultural
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects are going to be lost, which is
really more of a nostalgic thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, I think it would be a shame as
a lot of the small independent growers are
[SPEAKER_00]: just unable to to do the heavy lifting of
the regulatory process or even just being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to hire the professionals that will
help them through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just that you need to hire so many
professionals through the application
[SPEAKER_00]: process is an other thing that's going to
be very hard to stop new people from
[SPEAKER_00]: entering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one concern going forward is with too
much regulations is going to stop small
[SPEAKER_00]: new entrepreneurs from coming in and
trying to do something new and different
[SPEAKER_00]: and potentially better.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll benefit the entire industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more hurdles you put in place up
front, the harder it is for that person to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to take a chance and see if
they're going to hack it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, where are you in your application
process right now or in your licensing
[SPEAKER_01]: process?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're about to submit our permanent state
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our temporary from the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our temporary from the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and actually, right after this
interview, we will be putting the final
[SPEAKER_00]: touches on our state application and
getting that off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And compliance wise, how do you how do you
feel about things?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my appointment on coming up to go
down to City Hall and give the city my my
[SPEAKER_00]: first tax payment since I've been
authorized here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what about like bills like the bill
planning?
[SPEAKER_01]: Department, all that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city agencies I've worked with through
the DCR have been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely could not complain.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been very helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been very supportive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the DCR is really, really doing
the best job they can with the resources
[SPEAKER_00]: they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I I'm very, very happy with the effort
they've been putting forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing's been perfect and smooth,
but I none of none of the fault I would
[SPEAKER_00]: put in the DCR.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think they've been doing a
phenomenal job.
[SPEAKER_00]: With what they've had to do and have been
very supportive of of trying to really
[SPEAKER_00]: make this industry happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be really pleased that your
legacy strained product is moving off the
[SPEAKER_01]: shelves the way it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call around and you know people are
waiting, especially the blackheads,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to get it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants please grow quickly because it's
needed on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is your is like let's come back to just
briefly about about scaling because we
[SPEAKER_01]: want to see an industry with with with
product that is that is that has the
[SPEAKER_01]: attention has been brought to it that you
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're a dedicated grower and
have been for many years and it would be a
[SPEAKER_01]: shame if you had to go off and do
something else, you know, or work for some
[SPEAKER_01]: big company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do you scale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what is your plan?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that biggest challenge finding
another space at the cost in real estate
[SPEAKER_01]: or will you have to pick up and move to a
cheaper part of the state if push comes to
[SPEAKER_01]: shove?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if push comes to shove, I will
definitely have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to stay in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: The big problem is just more the real
estate speculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that I could expand tomorrow
if I could find a 40,000 square foot
[SPEAKER_00]: building that the landlord would give me a
buck fifty or less in rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that happened, I could be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have the funding for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could make it happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I have a couple of brokers
looking at it and I hear things like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, talk to a building owner in a
compliant area.
[SPEAKER_00]: This particular was in El Monte,
which has is permitting very supportive
[SPEAKER_00]: city.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the zoning, they only have 15 to 20
locations that are suitable for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: under their zoning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and one of the owners who had
where it's actually open said until it's
[SPEAKER_00]: three bucks a square foot, don't call me
back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's pretty much the issue
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing was looking at desert
properties and it's three dollars a square
[SPEAKER_00]: foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just I mean that I would scale up
and have a worse overhead than I have at
[SPEAKER_00]: my five thousand square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be less profitable than my
smaller facility like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at some point, for example,
one of the desert I heard have been on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market for a long time, almost two years
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at some point, these owners are going
to realize that the money in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is like it is for everything
else.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, in some ways we have smaller
margins than other manufacturing sectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until that realization comes and those
buildings have sat there for long enough
[SPEAKER_00]: and nobody's paying the three dollars a
square foot, they're going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, then then the then the rent will
eventually come down when they figure
[SPEAKER_00]: they're sick of paying property taxes on a
vacant building.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually it'll come down to the
where people like myself will want to
[SPEAKER_00]: occupy it and we see opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But are there owners out there who are
open to other arrangements like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll rent it to you for two bucks a square
foot and you give me 15 percent of your
[SPEAKER_00]: equity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's there's that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, it's I think a lot of
small, smaller people, even larger people
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be careful that they're not just
making money for a landlord.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think profitability is going to become
an issue here probably in the next year or
[SPEAKER_00]: two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're going to see an emphasis in
the industry on profitability,
[SPEAKER_00]: like real profitability, not not just,
you know, being funny with your books.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that does matter, it's it's going
to it's going to have to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that when that happens,
it might there might be an advantage to
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller operators who've managed to stay
independent and efficient and quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: If that, you know, that that dynamic might
be more prevalent in the large publicly
[SPEAKER_01]: traded or the large companies that are
acquiring now where they have to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow their business models.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're failing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each one of those brands that they've
acquired will need to perform.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I think the emphasis a lot in the
industry from, you know, particular people
[SPEAKER_00]: outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't mean to beat up on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's nothing nothing
against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like people see value in
acquiring brands more than they see the
[SPEAKER_00]: value of the brand performances
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when when it comes down to that,
you know, it's I have 20 companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have 30 companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I have 40 companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what are those companies doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the question nobody's
really stopped to look at yet because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're just more concerned about
acquiring more and more companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you think the day of reckoning is
maybe a couple of years away or sooner?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's who really knows when that
day of reckoning is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I all I I I feel like the day of reckoning
will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, what do I know?
[SPEAKER_00]: It may never happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speculation may just continue and people
might just continue to invest money in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, last question for you,
your pre-rolls, they're coming on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: When are they when are they when can we
see them on the market and what are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be strain specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one rolling out is the black
haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are hoping to have them on the
shelves right around 420 maybe a little
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're packs of seven packs of seven
half gram joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: They taste just like the strain they're
supposed to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are your so you're moving into
pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have high hopes for the pre-roll
market for pre-roll sales?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pre-roll market is pretty competitive
and I know that quality is an issue in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-roll market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I really just hope we take our same
attention to detail that we've taken with
[SPEAKER_00]: our packaged flour and that the pre-rolls
will speak for themselves as it is for
[SPEAKER_00]: legacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do zero marketing like all our
marketing has been word of mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that we're going to try to grow the
pre-rolls the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who already get legacy are
probably going to be the first ones to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they like them, they're going to
tell their friends how great they are and
[SPEAKER_00]: their friends are going to check them out
and they're going to become repeat
[SPEAKER_00]: customers as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that begs the question,
you know, I mean, legacy up in the Bay
[SPEAKER_01]: Area expanding your footprint.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you can't do it now, but I'll bet
you sure would like to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to when the day comes where I
can find a reasonable rate on a 40,000
[SPEAKER_00]: square foot warehouse and that gets
cranking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should probably have the bandwidth to
start releasing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have shops in the Bay that want to carry
us already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, just unable to make it
happen right now because I'm too busy
[SPEAKER_00]: filling the orders.
[SPEAKER_00]: My existing shops.
Thank you very much.
