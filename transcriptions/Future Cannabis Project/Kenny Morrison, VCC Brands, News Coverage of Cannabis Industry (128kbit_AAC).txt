[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm watching, you know, a news channel
and there's a doctor who wants to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: discredit cannabis as medicine,
you know, often you'll hear them use the
[SPEAKER_00]: term, well, a lot of people just use it to
get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the journalist or the host of the show
or whatever goes, oh, right, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is the doctor and that journalist even
sharing the same definition of what
[SPEAKER_00]: getting high means?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they have completely different ideas of
how to define getting high and they just
[SPEAKER_00]: nod their head and agree on it without
really having any sort of discourse to
[SPEAKER_00]: define what getting high means.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, when I hear people use the term,
you know, getting high, I always like to
[SPEAKER_00]: say, what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and I think it would be
interesting to get a huge different
[SPEAKER_00]: cross-section of people and ask them,
what does that term mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: To some people, getting high means up to
no good.
[SPEAKER_00]: To other people, getting high means
temporarily forgetting about your problems
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, relieve stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: To other people, getting high means to
avoid your problems, which is a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people getting high means,
you know, those people who dodge the draft
[SPEAKER_00]: and aren't patriots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or there's just so much tied up in what
getting high, to some people getting high
[SPEAKER_00]: means I'm a rebel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or getting high means, you know,
I think for myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: To other people getting high means,
you know, I disagree with my parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, there's no real clear-cut
understood definition of what getting high
[SPEAKER_00]: means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's a really dangerous kind of
irresponsible term to use, especially if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a medical professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I just think, you know, our word
choice, it's like, it's real easy to come
[SPEAKER_00]: up with a term that can mean so many
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's, to me, that's an interesting
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whenever someone uses the term getting
high and I say, what's that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always get a completely different answer
from everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the big things we hear against
people who are against the use of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is that, well, a lot of people just want
to use it to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hear doctors use this term a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, people use it to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's such a non-medical
term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're talking about cannabis in
terms of, you know, wellness and medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: use, I would like to know, I would like to
hear what a thousand different people
[SPEAKER_00]: thought or think the word getting high
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think it means something
different to almost everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think a bunch of people
attribute whatever negative thing they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to the term getting high.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people think of getting high as a
positive thing, but what does it mean to
[SPEAKER_00]: get high?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think another thing that would be
interesting to have journalists explore is
[SPEAKER_00]: due to the rise of these CBD only laws in
certain states, where, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, because it's been on CNN and Sanjay
Gupta has heralded it and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: non-psychoactive, it's getting a lot of
good press right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's kind of this misunderstanding
that's being formed and perpetuated in
[SPEAKER_00]: Congress and other places where CBD is the
medicinal component of marijuana and THC
[SPEAKER_00]: is the recreational component of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both very therapeutic,
you know, molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the two of them together when combined
are more effective than either one used
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think one of the things that,
one of the conversations that cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: also starts is the rise of whole plant
medicine or maybe the notion that
[SPEAKER_00]: something beyond a single molecule
medicine can be more effective,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the whole reason Whole Foods called
their supermarket Whole Foods is because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, why take vitamins from a pill
when you can get your vitamins from Whole
[SPEAKER_00]: Foods, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a carrot or a beet or, you know,
different foods, they have a whole litany
[SPEAKER_00]: of different nutrients in them rather than
just a single molecule, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than a single nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's another aspect of how cannabis
is pushing a conversation forward is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, plant-based medicine,
the popularity of, you know, medicines
[SPEAKER_00]: that aren't just single molecule medicines
that can have, you know, a multitude of
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, we've all heard of
the term the entourage effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: so.
Thank you.
