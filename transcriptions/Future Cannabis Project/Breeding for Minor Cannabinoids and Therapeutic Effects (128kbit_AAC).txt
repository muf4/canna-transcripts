[SPEAKER_02]: So I was talking about breeding cannabis
for therapeutic benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's been kind of my go-to speech.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been speaking with Cannegro,
I guess kind of before there was a
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannegro.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did the science of cannabis in Mesa,
Arizona four years ago, I think it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I've spoken at pretty much every
one of their events ever since.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like I like that it's kind of a
non-advertisement based speaking
[SPEAKER_02]: engagement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do some other speaking stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, like I went to Spannabis
this year and spoke and the people that
[SPEAKER_02]: were speaking with me, it was like a sales
pitch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just there to educate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like coming to these kind of
conferences where it's kind of expressly
[SPEAKER_02]: forbidden to advertise and and do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's why every time I do these
things, I'm like, please don't pitch your
[SPEAKER_04]: products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like people just tune right out.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd rather hear that you're smart on a
topic and be like, I'm more curious about
[SPEAKER_04]: this person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then they'll come up and ask you
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I get a card?
[SPEAKER_04]: But what were you speaking on,
Chris?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I did the Cannabis Cultivation 101.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the subtitle was Foundations of a
Successful Grow Operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just went over the went over the
basics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we scale up to the 202 and 303
advanced level courses and talk about the
[SPEAKER_04]: more advanced level stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and you're you both you're a team like
you grow together.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're both exploring like we talked
about before, kind of more minor
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids and things that aren't being
bred for now to see what therapeutic
[SPEAKER_04]: benefit they may have.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started with CBD was the big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was kind of pre goop,
pre all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we started with our CBD work quite some
time ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the what are the brothers in the
Stanley Brothers?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do we think of the Stanley Brothers
since they get all the they're like the
[SPEAKER_04]: poster child?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard enough like it's one of those
things like when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: lights, like I don't want to defame
anybody or put anybody down.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you're answering the question without
actually answering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't say anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's just stories that you
hear within the community about how
[SPEAKER_02]: certain people treat other people and like
where things are sourced from,
[SPEAKER_02]: where genetics come from and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you just kind of I don't know them
personally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and I've never seen their operation or
worked with them personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you were exploring CBD,
like because not many people were like in
[SPEAKER_04]: tune with there's this thing, you like
growers, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were wondering why we were doing it
because you can't make money off of it
[SPEAKER_02]: because nobody's getting high.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys were like, we're going to stay
the course.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so where are we like, like,
OK, we know this thing, CBD, we want to
[SPEAKER_04]: breathe for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are you sourcing the genetics from
the start?
[SPEAKER_02]: All over the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember where we could find something
to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back then, you were looking at it that you
were like.
[SPEAKER_02]: There really wasn't, you know,
at that time is kind of when Kanatonic was
[SPEAKER_02]: hitting the scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that was the other like
real major thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you had two who's TSK out of
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was doing his like Miggs County
Railroad hemp crosses with some O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cush kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's your your woo and your are for
kind of that's where that came from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like these little little lights
started lighting up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is probably I mean, at that
time, there was probably four people in
[SPEAKER_02]: the world outside of Israel that were
really working on anything CBD centric.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it wasn't it's not like you could just
go and buy CBD genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to look for it in different
places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the issue with that is the only way
you're going to know beyond a shadow of a
[SPEAKER_02]: doubt whether a CBD in it or not or lab
tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so labs, analytical testing labs in
Oregon weren't really like popping up,
[SPEAKER_02]: weren't really a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they had very limited.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the only like sunrise for the
longest time?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're talking like 10 years ago,
seven years ago.
Five.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, five years ago when we started
getting really good data back on our
[SPEAKER_02]: plants, that's when like the labs really
got their shit figured out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up until that point, it was just kind of
going based off effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of cannabis in the world and
not very much of it gets tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Find CBD in places you don't expect to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where a lot of it's come from.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what like what are you exploring
now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like CBD was the first.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously now it's like this this two
star cannabinoids is John and Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's George and Ringo of the cannabinoid
world?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all important and they all have
and there's unknowns undiscovered.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I got to talk about in
my speech is the first time my company's
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed me to share data like raw data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're finding everything from,
you know, CBC is something we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: working really heavily on.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're showing great expression in CBC.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBC is a neuro protector and also has been
shown to reverse some damage caused by
[SPEAKER_02]: neurodegenerative diseases.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that one's been really primary for us
looking into based on some family
[SPEAKER_02]: histories and grandparents with all
Alzheimer's and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's an important one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mean, as far as that one goes,
I feel like we've got that pretty,
[SPEAKER_02]: if not nailed down right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: THCV for people with diabetes,
dietary supplements, things like that is
[SPEAKER_02]: something we're looking into.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's interesting is we're doing
these HPLC studies and looking at the
[SPEAKER_02]: things we're coming up with a lot of
spikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there's commercial commercially
available standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is kind of the the notebook of
what they say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's the cannabinoids that are in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if they haven't been able to say that
this cannabinoid is this and they haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: done molecular analysis on it and like
gotten a reading on it and have been able
[SPEAKER_02]: to reverse engineer it and turning into a
standard, then it just kind of gets swept
[SPEAKER_02]: under the rug.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far we found nine unidentified
spikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cannabinoids that don't have a standard
for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So nobody really knows what they are and
limit bottom limit to the testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if there's, you know, an
infinitesimally small amount of some
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid in there, it's typical testing
equipment can't even find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why would they make a standard for it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's going to buy it has to be
commercially viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we start talking about
therapeutic doses of things, a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: times those things, especially in
conjunction with each other, do create a
[SPEAKER_02]: therapeutic dose and what you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: So us and with the company that we're
working with, we have a partnership
[SPEAKER_02]: agreement with the Texas Arlington
Shimatsu Laboratory there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're looking at compounds down to the
quadrillion from the plant so we can look
[SPEAKER_02]: at it really deep.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we're sending stuff to them to use
kind of equipment that's next generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of seven.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of seven labs in the world that's
able to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're going to quantify what these
are, where they work, do some studies,
[SPEAKER_02]: see how they affect the human body and try
to figure out what they do and why they're
[SPEAKER_02]: important in the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard to say, you know,
I want to breed for this specific
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid when this cannabinoid doesn't
have a name, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the ones that we do know what they do,
CBDVA, THCVA and CBC and CBCL and CBCT
[SPEAKER_02]: work doing very well on breeding high
concentrations of those into plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also doing a very good job of
breeding unknown cannabinoids into plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're seeing considerable spikes like
a pretty good surface area in the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: that is this cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, the way, the way you can
really tell whether it's just a booger on
[SPEAKER_02]: the machine or a cannabinoid is through
decarboxylation experiments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can decarboxylate them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll watch the acid fall off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll move positions and it's telling us,
you know, this is a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's acting like a cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need to have them reverse
engineered.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're learning a lot, but we're kind of
pushing the envelope on what there is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's not just... So basically
part of this is there is an equipment
[SPEAKER_04]: innovation or access to equipment that you
didn't have even a year ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past few months, five months,
we've accomplished more with breeding than
[SPEAKER_02]: we have probably in our entire careers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just because of the amount of information
and data we have, we can go through a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred, 200 plants a day and get data on
that many plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can just run just huge seed pops and
run through everything and only pick out
[SPEAKER_02]: the interesting stuff and only work with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas before maybe we had 20,
a hundred seeds of something.
[SPEAKER_02]: We pop it all out and you just roll the
dice and hope the one that you pick was
[SPEAKER_02]: the one you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, the jump in technology is huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it really just streamlines our ability
to just tear through plants and find
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get pretty good readings on plants
as soon as leaves get to maturity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So about seven sets of leaves,
we can get a really good idea of where the
[SPEAKER_02]: synthases are dumping into the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I can call by then so I can just
cycle plants through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why she's so awesome to me is because she
can park genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: She can put a genetic in a state where it
can sit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that particular phenotype of that
genotype I can put into a genetic storage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just because I don't need it right
now, it doesn't mean that I don't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: hold on to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the issue is, is space.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't have 50,000 plants just sitting
there that we're not growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I can put it in a small little
container and have it sit inside of a
[SPEAKER_02]: case, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I can start to justify that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have tons of data stored, so we might
as well have the genetics stored as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's something that doesn't look
important now, but how many times has it
[SPEAKER_03]: happened to either one of us that we don't
have a genetic around anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for some reason down the road,
you find there's something unique or
[SPEAKER_03]: desirable about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gone.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also it's really important to,
you know, cannabinoids are cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: THC is THC and CBD is CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the effects and the medical value
you're really getting from a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants may not even lie in cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're learning so much new about
the flavonoids that exist in cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and the anthocyanins.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking to someone like flavonoids
get like no love compared to the carbenes
[SPEAKER_02]: and flavonoids.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's 10,000 naturally, 10,000 plus
naturally existing flavonoids in the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis has quite a few of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is also unique in that it has
three flavonoids, canaflavin A,
[SPEAKER_02]: canaflavin B, and probably soon to be
named canaflavin C, that are unique to the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ask somebody, what are the medical
benefits of canaflavin A?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like an ethyl alcohol?
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethylene?
[SPEAKER_04]: Would that make sense that that's?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have done some terpene tests where we
have, what's it?
[SPEAKER_02]: French show something, ethylene show up in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In plant ethylene's hormone.
[SPEAKER_03]: That might be what he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Frenchy just got back to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Phenol, which makes up half the trichome
head, is what he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then terpenes the same way,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Terpenes have been a lot more researched.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can go to PubMed and look up a
terpene and see what its medical benefits
[SPEAKER_02]: are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But finding unique terpene and flavonoid
combinations in plants for specific
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that and the cannabinoids that
people aren't looking at are really what
[SPEAKER_02]: defines what a strain is and what it can
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think until people truly
understand that part of it, you're just
[SPEAKER_02]: still going to be on this, well,
I want the stuff that tests 30% THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: or I want the highest testing CBD plant
there is when that's just a therapeutic
[SPEAKER_02]: dose of that's going to be a therapeutic
dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter how much percentage is
in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It matters what's with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really important for us to find
those molecules, figure out what they do,
[SPEAKER_02]: trace them through the human body.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do they react with us?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it doing for us?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that can help us with selective
breeding processes to know that,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, we want to build, we want to breed a
plant that's high in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with hope, with the ability to store
plants, maybe there's something I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: missing in a bunch of these plants and I
don't want to throw them away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because who knows when I want to go back
to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a lot easier to save it when you
have it than try to refine it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because a lot of times it's like a needle
in 10 haystacks, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys are, you're breeding,
but you're also flowering out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a brand?
[SPEAKER_02]: We work for Zet Therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're a research and development
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we do genetic breeding and then
looking at all of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Chris does a lot of the heavy
lifting as far as like growing them out
[SPEAKER_02]: for phenotypical expression and finding
what kind of lighting and conditions and
[SPEAKER_02]: how they grow best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Chris and I have been working
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you talk about some of that stuff,
like certain cultivars or I've noticed
[SPEAKER_04]: that they're better in this climate or
with these lights or?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have, you know, most of my experience
has been with THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've grown thousands and thousands of
different THC cultivars.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've definitely learned how they act in
different lighting and heating
[SPEAKER_03]: environments and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're using some of those THC
cultivars to cross in with the CBD to
[SPEAKER_03]: create hemp strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we're going to be looking at is
using different light spectrums to compare
[SPEAKER_03]: the test results to see what cannabinoid
production we get using different
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrums.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are some of the current hypotheses?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we know that UV is responsible for
the creation of cannabinoids in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like specifically UVB, when put onto a
plant in a higher concentration that is
[SPEAKER_02]: normal, will increase your THCA production
in the plant because THCA protects the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant from UVB.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be one example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So applications of UV at different
frequencies or different intensities at
[SPEAKER_03]: different times would be one thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll experiment with,
we want to experiment with more full
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum light that's outside the PAR
range.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blue light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Green light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, actually the Israeli guy who is two
booths down from you guys, I was talking
[SPEAKER_04]: to him and I was like, what's kind of some
more modern research, the new research,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is like green, like, cause people
always say like green doesn't do anything,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was kind of like, actually it does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what do you, what do you think
green does?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I don't know, but I want to find out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know that a lot of the LEDs were,
have been missing the green.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spectrum in the past and they've come a
long ways now, but no, we need some
[SPEAKER_03]: analytical data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it'll be exciting to find out
something we've been wanting to do for a
[SPEAKER_02]: long time.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and not just lighting, you know,
feeding, like what concentrations of
[SPEAKER_02]: different nutrients are you giving the
plants?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've always preferred soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think soil as far as growing a smokable
plant grows the highest quality plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, as far as- You can't beat the
interactions that are happening with the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same way you can't beat the light that
comes from the sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's the plant has evolved to live
in earth, earth's environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the closer we come to mimicking
that- So your preference is to grow
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoors in soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be your- Well, with sunlight in
soil, but nobody wants to grow outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm sure some people probably do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you got to think of things,
there's going to be interactions that are
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be missed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So flavonoids play a role in communicating
between microorganisms and the root biome
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can have a flavonoid that talks to
these microorganisms and tells them we
[SPEAKER_02]: need more nitrogen and it'll increase
nitrogen uptake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, how do you do that in a hydroponic
system that doesn't have the microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: creating that web?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just feel like you miss out on a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you can grow some real good hydro
smoke, but I think you're missing out on a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of the things that people aren't
paying attention to that really give the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant it's like well-rounded, amazing
effects and beyond.
[SPEAKER_02]: That therapeutic and medical effects and
benefits.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one of the things I asked the light
scientist guy, like I was working at a
[SPEAKER_04]: nursery for a while in Carpinteria and we
wanted to test supplemental.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was greenhouse, but we wanted to
test supplemental lighting on the monstock
[SPEAKER_04]: and then kind of experimenting with like
our, with different parts of the color
[SPEAKER_04]: spectrum be conducive to like,
you know, let's say you get 25 clippings a
[SPEAKER_04]: week from a mom, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you, could you increase it to 30,
30, but like how much could you increase
[SPEAKER_04]: the number you could clip each week based
on something with light?
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you done any kind of research on
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, when you're talking about things
like flavonoids and anthocyanins,
[SPEAKER_02]: they, they're responsible for the nodular
growth of plants, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're doing something that is
setting off that, that chain reaction,
[SPEAKER_02]: of flavonoids in the plant that's creating
nodular growth and you can do that using
[SPEAKER_02]: light manipulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could find the light spectrum that
works with that, but like that's all,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's all a possibility, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And until we really get into it and start
looking at these different molecules,
[SPEAKER_02]: what reactions are causing them to appear
and what functions they're serving in the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be hard to say, but it's all
of these things we're talking about don't
[SPEAKER_02]: exist in the plant for human beings.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: THC, CBD, all the way down to the small
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all a function of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's doing something to help the
plant grow or help the plant repel pests
[SPEAKER_02]: or help the plant bring animals in to eat
them, to spread the seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's all part of the plant's
processes to live.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just turns out that they have
great, the side effect is they have great
[SPEAKER_02]: benefit to humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's putting the two pieces
together of synergistically, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: if we can do this to the plant,
we can manipulate it with this kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients or these kind of lights to make
an extra expression of this or that in the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can really kind of dial in grows to
specifically highlight and pull out higher
[SPEAKER_02]: levels of those, you know, terpenes and
flavonoids and even cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're also going to do some
experiments with introducing different
[SPEAKER_03]: microbes to the root zone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you targeting specific microbes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we want to explore more... Well,
yes, but there's a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, yeah, there's just a lot of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pseudomonas and... Is it beef up and
nematodes?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's people on the market saying right
now that certain microbes are,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're strepto.
[SPEAKER_03]: I forget which one.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're saying that they, yeah,
streptomyces, that's the one, increases
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD production and decreases THC
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's something we definitely want to
play with and see it in our own hands
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're claiming pretty outrageous
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are outrageous claims, but it's very
possible, you know, until... There's
[SPEAKER_03]: probably a basis to the claim.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so basically that would throttle one
and almost put the gas on the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, THC, like I said, has to... Like
this is a problem that we're having with
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp legislation, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that THCA has to exist in the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: THCA is a UVB protector and 3% of all
light from the sun is UVB.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without that protector, the sun will cook
the plant and it will die.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea of, well, I've got a plant
that tests non-detectable THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me, because it has to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, as like a human being,
you couldn't just be like, I don't like my
[SPEAKER_02]: white blood cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get rid of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, good luck with that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to talk to them about,
well, yeah, if your concentrations of all
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids are very low, yes,
maybe it'll come up non-detectable,
[SPEAKER_02]: but as, you know, maybe you need 10 times
more plant material to make the same
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of oil as this very high testing
plant in CBD with a little bit more THC,
[SPEAKER_02]: but your oil is all going to come out
around the same concentration of THCA or
[SPEAKER_02]: THC delta 9.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's just the way that it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't exist without it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody tell the USDA not to make
testing, hemp testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now they're talking about making
hemp testing after decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'd be looking at all of the THCA
that's not being considered THC by the
[SPEAKER_03]: government right now will be converted
into delta 9 and then tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's going to make the 0.3 threshold
unattainable for a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, a lot of genetics and maybe all
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's either going to come down to
techniques like streptomyces, if that's
[SPEAKER_03]: what works, or nitrogen deficiency,
if that's what works, or everybody calling
[SPEAKER_03]: and emailing the USDA and telling them not
to make this decision, or what they really
[SPEAKER_03]: should do is test decarboxylated,
but raise the threshold from 0.3 to 1% or
[SPEAKER_03]: 0.7 or something that makes sense
genetically.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think 1% is a real solid number.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's an achievable number by
anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: So labs in Oregon that are ISO certified,
like the highest level of certification to
[SPEAKER_02]: get for a lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think they're to continue that
certification?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think that their error,
their error ranges, like percentage wise,
[SPEAKER_02]: how much of an error can they have and
still be considered an accurate test?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would assume under 10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus minus 10%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 5%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Only 5%, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, 10% window.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about 0.3%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're telling me that the labs out
there that have a 10% window of inaccuracy
[SPEAKER_02]: are going to be able to tell you that,
oh, this is 0.3% on the nose?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, it's just, it's a ridiculous law to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_02]: The idea of segregating a plant out,
cannabis, it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're segregating it out and calling
it hemp with a completely random number
[SPEAKER_02]: that somebody came up with that said,
well, this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's different in Europe and different
in other countries.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the European threshold?
[SPEAKER_03]: 0.2 is the European Union's.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's, well, I haven't actually read
the law.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we're being told is that's total
THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't think they discriminate between
the THC molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have an even lower threshold.
[SPEAKER_03]: But up until not that long ago,
it was 1%.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they just changed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they went in the wrong direction.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, I think I think it should be
like where they're going.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it should be done by ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: If a plant, let's say, is 20 to 1,
20 parts CBD to 1 part THC and above hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because why are you going to fault
somebody for growing a plant better?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's punishing people who grow plants
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, if I grow my plant better
and I get higher test results,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going to take me outside of the
range of legality.
[SPEAKER_02]: But somebody else can grow the same plant
fucking crappy and get low test scores.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's it's a messed up system.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's something that you guys have
figured about recently?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fox farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's what's the topic specific to?
[SPEAKER_03]: Adam loves Fox farm soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for parking plants and getting them
green and lush again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's like cheater things,
right, that you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is the path of least resistance to
getting a plant back to health is just
[SPEAKER_02]: throw it in some ocean forest and give it
four weeks and it looks beautiful again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is a testament to Fox farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not begging.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not begging Fox farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that it's like there's other
ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm very busy and I don't have time to
mix all the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we want to bicker about it,
as soon as he gets down to mixing up all
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil and making it right, then I won't
have to use Fox.
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris and I don't really bicker about much
about anything.
No.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're very symbiotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are non confrontational.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're no drama people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've been together for a long time
as partners, you know, and when we first
[SPEAKER_02]: got together, I think we kind of set
passionate intellectual discussions are
[SPEAKER_04]: healthy and good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but we're just always kind of on the
same page about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it sounds weird and I'm not trying
to be like things are perfect in our
[SPEAKER_02]: world, but like generally we try to go too
many directions at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard to like really focus on
something, but it's rare that Chris and I
[SPEAKER_02]: even do much working together in the same
space because we have so many projects
[SPEAKER_02]: going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so it's like, Adam, you handle
this and I'm going to handle this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, you know, his responsibility to
do that part.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my responsibility to do this part.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as long as neither of us fucking drops
the ball like and we haven't, there's
[SPEAKER_02]: really nothing to bitch each other about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we're great friends and,
you know, we've been friends for a long
[SPEAKER_02]: time now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it's it's really our
relationship is as good as it sounds like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just, I could not have a better
partner or person to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: He grounds me in so many ways and keeps my
feet on the ground and keeps me calm when
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm freaking out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a super anxious person and,
you know, totally kind of the yin to my
[SPEAKER_02]: yang or whatever, you know, like it's a
really, it's also a symbiotic
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure Adam goes and does all the
social stuff, like talking on video and
[SPEAKER_03]: pressing palms and getting our names out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And but now and then I get to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now I have to do too much of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've drug him into it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I make him go to the speaking
engagements and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, as far as like THC breeders,
Sonny Chiba, Odi Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's Sonny Chiba's Shane Yocum did
like Purple Doja, Black Cherry Soda,
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Odi Diesel's Raymond Bowser, Homegrown
Natural Wonders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like Mickey Cook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bush, Doctor Who, things of those
varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those two guys really kind of like brought
me into the fold of like like
[SPEAKER_02]: contemporaries, breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just amazing dudes too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as like plug a seed into the soil
and grow hot fire, Colin Gordon from Ethos
[SPEAKER_02]: has been killing it lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like his shit's super poly hybrid whatever
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've never grown an easier plant from
seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just feminized comes up and it's
fucking chronic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like as newer kind of breeders go,
like he's a rad guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Kyle Cushman or Adam Ornstein from
High Times, Cushman's Cough, really kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of like before I knew a bunch of people in
the industry like really reached out and
[SPEAKER_02]: was like he's now a close personal friend
of mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's interesting is because he's
all indoor hydro, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: He uses Vegematrix, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is vegan plant food.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, I believe that he grows in a
neutral medium.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the first time I met the guy,
right, we were in San Diego for a can of
[SPEAKER_02]: grow and we're on the beach and it's the
first time I've met the guy and like so he
[SPEAKER_02]: comes up in his Kyle Cushman way and he's
like, you grow with Vegematrix and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like, nah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, well, why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, there's no bone meal in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like, well, yeah, it's vegan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, yeah, I like bone meal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I kind of like shit talk him,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he liked that, like,
you know, that like I just wasn't like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, Kyle Cushman.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like, you know, like,
did things like invited me to his 50th
[SPEAKER_02]: birthday party and so Kyle went and hung
with all the High Times guys and just he's
[SPEAKER_02]: a really nice guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think he gets a little bit of hate
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like as a person, he's just an
absolutely wonderful person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the the spannibus crew for like
kind of inviting me to spannibus to speak
[SPEAKER_02]: and like just going to spannibus was like
a bucket list item to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I was invited to speak at
spannibus, you want this year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just like melted me like I was just
like, oh, my God, it's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, those are the be the people that
like really that I respect and have much
[SPEAKER_02]: love for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout out to two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two is going to hate me now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, two or T.S.K.
[SPEAKER_02]: He is one of the seed company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, G.C.B.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders in the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you should record him sometime and ask
him about the Charlotte's Web story and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, because there's a lot of a lot of
information there to dissect and look
[SPEAKER_02]: through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but he is he is an amazing individual
who really helped us with our path with C
[SPEAKER_02]: .B.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: and our kind of collaborations together
back at the beginning with C.B.D.
[SPEAKER_02]: really pushed the envelope.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about Oregon Growers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Mike Colley, Mike Colley, Araya Love,
Andrew Campbell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are the guys that geek farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Geek farms were really impressed with.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're they're not necessarily breeders,
but they're breeding their own strains and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're coming out with some great hot
fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they've got they're finding really
good genetics to make crosses with.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's stuff that hasn't really been
around that much lately, I guess you'd say
[SPEAKER_03]: exploring right now that Crooked River
Blues and the Oregon Indigo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of stuff from the blueberry space is
kind of what they started with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they kind of went into work with
like they really like like the lemon D,
[SPEAKER_02]: the sour lemon D, electric lemon G,
those kind of strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're what they really do good is
the grape high chew.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's the alpha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do the alpha cut of the doctor who
better than anybody in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And their weed is clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their weed is organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smokes down to a white ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice and calyxed out at the top with
like the crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's like perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a super snob and I've smoked weed
from everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the best fucking weed in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Publicly popular that frustrates you,
like why does everybody love that and keep
[SPEAKER_04]: buying it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like as a strain or a product or.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, twenty seven percent hydro
garbage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the dude that walks into the store,
see, we've owned clubs and dispensaries
[SPEAKER_02]: and recreational stores and we've done
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: The dude that walks into the store and
goes, what's your highest testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, gee, like that guy, that guy irritates
me because it's like why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what's going to give me most
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let me educate you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's your highest testing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, gee.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I got 30 percent whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, gee, I'll take that.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a nice day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Close mindedness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not willing to listen to scientific data
and to be educated and understand that THC
[SPEAKER_02]: percentage really means nothing in the
grand scheme of how a plan is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: affect you.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like a status symbol thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this one goes to eleven.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see, yeah, the numbers all go to
eleven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look right across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eleven.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eleven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the amps go up to ten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: As far as genetics, nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think all genetics have a place.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, some plants get hate,
you know, like everybody's like,
[SPEAKER_02]: fuck blue dream forever or whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like I just feel like every
genetic has their certain genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't choose for me that I don't like,
but I think every genetics important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it all tells a story and I
think it all has its own value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so there's not much hate.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I don't like?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like distillate pentops.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hot dog water and I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do live resin pentops.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like vape cartridges that are trash.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of trash vape cartridges out
there and a lot of people just they're
[SPEAKER_02]: cheap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they buy them and they just don't know
what they're missing out on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Live resin I think is the best,
you know, so a live resin extraction,
[SPEAKER_02]: not fresh frozen extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just think it just brings turp down.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you don't distill it with
terpenes re-added.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like putting a Bavita in
your weed bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the turp taker, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just taking away the flavor and
wonderfulness of the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like anything that that takes it
much far away from its original intended
[SPEAKER_02]: botanical value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the more you mess with stuff and
futz with it and clarify it and do
[SPEAKER_02]: everything, there's so many volatile
compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the cannabis plant that you're just
destroying, but it's all for the almighty
[SPEAKER_02]: THC or the almighty CBD, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's like that's an everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like who cares?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I want to see the, you know,
I want to see your turps up at 20%.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: It definitely makes better medicine.
Yeah.
Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
