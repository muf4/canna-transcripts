[SPEAKER_05]: Our topic, of course, for the next hour
is, once it's legal, I'm getting into the
[SPEAKER_05]: business.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're lucky because we have a good
panel here this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those panelists come from a bunch of
diverse backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: For better or for worse, there's three
attorneys up on stage right now,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we'll do our best to keep you awake
for the next hour.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's get started, Matt, with perhaps,
and grab a microphone if you would,
[SPEAKER_05]: please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please give us a perspective, very,
very general overview, perspective on how
[SPEAKER_05]: business and land use issues come down
upon the marijuana industry when you're a
[SPEAKER_05]: new operator.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am primarily a corporate and tax lawyer
and have some regulatory experience,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I rely upon my partners and our
government land use practice groups to
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of do the heavy lifting in that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're focusing on California only,
is that kind of what we're talking about?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think California is a good aspect of it,
but let's talk generally because I think
[SPEAKER_05]: folks here really want to hear about
what's happening from a broader
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think the, you know, people are
calling this a green rush.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to jump into this industry,
and I think it's important to take a step
[SPEAKER_02]: back and really explore the regulatory
land use side of the equation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before going full bore and submitting
applications and raising funds from
[SPEAKER_02]: investors or even worse, spending your own
money.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, is that better?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, in my personal experience in
doing deals, because that's what I do,
[SPEAKER_02]: I do deals, like Donald Trump,
I guess, and we've done a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: transactions in multiple cities.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Southern California now, in Desert Hot
Springs, in Cathedral City, in Atalanto,
[SPEAKER_02]: in Santa Ana, doing some transactional
work, first of its kind in Linwood,
[SPEAKER_02]: Cudahy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the common denominator is really with
the land use piece, you know, most of this
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff, these are discretionary
entitlements.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some cases, you don't even have permits
or licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have development agreements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's complicated stuff, and I think
it's very, very important to grasp that
[SPEAKER_02]: side of it if you want to be a regulated,
you know, legal cannabis business,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether you're a producer, you know,
retail, testing, you know, extraction
[SPEAKER_02]: processing type stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, every, especially now,
while we're in this sort of new,
[SPEAKER_02]: regulated world that's coming our way,
every local jurisdiction is different,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we've had a lot of clients that have,
you know, tried to go about this on their
[SPEAKER_02]: own or went to kind of like a criminally,
sort of a criminal lawyer, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: slash repurposed cannabis lawyer,
and they've been gravely disappointed in
[SPEAKER_02]: going down a, you know, sort of a circular
path and spending lots of money,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then either running afoul of the law
or simply not getting entitlements to do
[SPEAKER_02]: what they want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just as a general recommendation,
survey the landscape and make sure you
[SPEAKER_02]: have a really, really good regulatory sort
of land use professional to guide you from
[SPEAKER_02]: the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Matt, that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ultimately, when you're looking at legal
services for the marijuana industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: one thing to think about is, and this sort
of happens in a standard way, state by
[SPEAKER_05]: state by state, and that is, at the
beginning, the attorneys that tend to be
[SPEAKER_05]: popular, if you will, in the cannabis
industry are those that were criminal
[SPEAKER_05]: defense attorneys, or perhaps activist
attorneys, or perhaps folks that worked in
[SPEAKER_05]: various local government or state
government offices, and those folks are
[SPEAKER_05]: quality, and you need them to get along
the way, but as these issues become more
[SPEAKER_05]: complex, when you have a regulatory
structure and local regulations,
[SPEAKER_05]: you really need to drill down and find
that area of expertise.
[SPEAKER_05]: Expertise to apply the different standards
that apply.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Leslie, let's talk about standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why are standards important for the
cannabis industry moving forward?
[SPEAKER_05]: And perhaps you can start with,
what's a standard?
[SPEAKER_05]: How does a standard differentiate from a
regulation or a statute?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, the difference between a standard and
a regulation is that regulations are
[SPEAKER_00]: created by government agencies,
licensing agencies, and they have the
[SPEAKER_00]: force of the law behind them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Standards are actually guidelines that
just give a business owner the right
[SPEAKER_00]: foundation to assure quality, safety,
and consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any other industry outside of cannabis,
if it's food, drug, pharma, device,
[SPEAKER_00]: ag related, there's a division of the
federal government that licenses those
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses, and they do that through good
manufacturing practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because cannabis is schedule one,
the federal government has stepped out of
[SPEAKER_00]: this situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, as the industry has developed across
the US, state by state, state regulators
[SPEAKER_00]: and business owners are left to decide
what the rules should be, how we should do
[SPEAKER_00]: this, without any guidance from a good
manufacturing practice standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what we've done is create good
manufacturing practice guidelines for all
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of the industry, whether it's
cultivation, retail, extraction,
[SPEAKER_00]: infused products, lab, security,
sustainability, packaging and labeling,
[SPEAKER_00]: to help business owners protect their
liability, to reduce costs, and to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're producing a safe and
consistent product, as well as to help
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators understand how to better
regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if a regulation is based on a
standard, standards have to be continually
[SPEAKER_00]: updated, every three months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you don't have to change the
regulation every time the industry grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just change the standard.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, is everyone in this room, by a show of
hands, familiar with the nutraceuticals,
[SPEAKER_05]: or the natural product industry?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the nutraceuticals industry is a good
example, in terms of a model for where the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis industry is going.
[SPEAKER_05]: For folks in California, you might look at
this top-down regulation with MRSA,
[SPEAKER_05]: and ultimately the potential adult use
recreational ballot measure in November,
[SPEAKER_05]: and how that will affect things.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you need to understand is,
when you effectuate this top-down
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation, things are gonna change.
[SPEAKER_05]: But going back to the nutraceuticals
model, now this is an industry that's
[SPEAKER_05]: effectively self-regulated, self-policed.
[SPEAKER_05]: How did that happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: It happened because it created its own
standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: It created its own rules, so that
consumers were protected, so that there
[SPEAKER_05]: was no misclassification or
misrepresentation of what was in the
[SPEAKER_05]: product by way of labeling.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those standards, ultimately what?
[SPEAKER_05]: They became adopted by the federal
government as the regulations for the
[SPEAKER_05]: state.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's critically important to,
A, embrace regulation, but even further
[SPEAKER_05]: than that, these local governments are
going to, in effect, create regulations
[SPEAKER_05]: that are minimal at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's important to embrace the idea that
standards need to be enacted, and then
[SPEAKER_05]: achieved across the board, so that the
regulations can actually be meaningful,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so that you can police the industry
yourself, and not ultimately have things
[SPEAKER_05]: imposed upon you that will make the cost
of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The example I always give of that is,
if you look at the fracking industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: nobody really thinks fracking is a good
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fracking bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've got tons less regulations than
anybody in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as an industry, they got together
and adopted standards, and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations are based on the standards.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes it's not good enough to say,
for example, they want to treat us as the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis industry differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something to be cognizant of,
but they are going to treat this industry
[SPEAKER_05]: differently, and you have to embrace that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'd really like to ask a question of
exactly what you're addressing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a situation going on that
we can categorize as blowback.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are people who are just angry about
the fact that we're getting what we want,
[SPEAKER_03]: and so that's preventing them from,
it's eschewing their thoughts from having
[SPEAKER_03]: sensible regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that going into this,
we have to be a little bit wary of that as
[SPEAKER_03]: well, that we are being prejudiced
against, and that there is no other
[SPEAKER_03]: industry that they would consider taxing
25%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm all for regulation, legalization
through taxation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the same as any other industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would just like everybody to be
aware that we are being prejudiced
[SPEAKER_03]: against, and that we can't be meek or
modest about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to be able to stand up and say,
25%, how can you do that to us?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why do you think we are getting proposals
that are so obtrusive in the amounts that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're asking us to pay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stigma.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, well, that's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's very well said.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the point was, we're going to be
treated differently, for those of you that
[SPEAKER_05]: may not have heard that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And fundamentally, it is something that
you need to recognize, be cognizant of,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you can be on the leading edge of it
if you're creating standards on how the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry moves forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the same time, these regulations are
being created.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me move on down the line here and
shift topics, and all of this will tie
[SPEAKER_05]: together over the next 50 some odd
minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary, talk about the fact that we now have
a legal industry, or we certainly will
[SPEAKER_05]: here in the short term in California,
with a top down regulatory structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why is IP protection so critically
important?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first let me start with defining
what the acronym IP is, for those of you
[SPEAKER_01]: who might not be acronym friendly.
[SPEAKER_01]: IP is intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are four basic forms of intellectual
property.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is patents, the second is copyrights,
and the third is trademarks, and the
[SPEAKER_01]: fourth is trade secrets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a trademark and copyright expert,
so I will focus on that mostly,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in terms of answering Bob's question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are creating new business models.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are creating new products.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are creating new manufacturing
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so intellectual property is really
important, because that is the area of law
[SPEAKER_01]: that is going to protect you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, there's a few twists here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So patents and copyrights, were referenced
in the Constitution, so they have their
[SPEAKER_01]: own basis, and it was basically so that
creativity would be fostered, and that
[SPEAKER_01]: there was an incentive for the creators to
create.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trademark law is a little bit different,
and I overlap a bit with Leslie,
[SPEAKER_01]: because trademark law comes from a basis
of public policy for consumer protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not a strict property right
the way patents and copyrights are,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's a different animal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patents and copyrights also only exist
under the federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trademarks exist under both federal and
state law, and international, but I
[SPEAKER_01]: realize we're not going there right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And trade secrets is also something up
until recently that was only state law
[SPEAKER_01]: protected, but that has recently,
as I mentioned, changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why is it important?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're creators, and you have
business models that you want to protect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have brands that you want to
protect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt like Steve D'Angelo mentioned
earlier today about competitive intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the industry that we're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: He talked about the bell curve,
and we're all moving forward, and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: really great, but you need to really think
about what your competitive advantage is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be in the marketplace going
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could be something like a patent
that you own and that you can exclusively
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a competitive advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be your brand, and that's another
competitive advantage in terms of how you
[SPEAKER_01]: are viewed in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I think intellectual
property is so important, because this is
[SPEAKER_01]: an emerging industry with a lot of
creativity going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm going to ask you what I think is
the perhaps million or maybe the $10
[SPEAKER_05]: million question in the room, and that is,
can you get IP protection for a particular
[SPEAKER_05]: strain of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you have some thoughts, I'm sure you do
on that topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually can't answer that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a trademark attorney, I've been
focusing on the, well, you did say
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectual property protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been focusing on the branding aspects
of strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that an acceptable direction?
Absolutely.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Leslie, your favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you said not to ask you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have one.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gentleman in the front.
[SPEAKER_01]: GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we got a volunteer here,
GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: GDP may not be GDP when you get it in a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what somebody said it was,
when they brought it into the dispensary,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that may not be what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of what trademark law is
about is about quality control and
[SPEAKER_01]: standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want a patient who comes in to get GDP
to get GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want a patient who comes in for GDP to
get GDP that's been tested for THC and CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: and every other cannabinoid that we're
testing for, as well as mold and
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to have strong quality control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what trademarks are about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's happened over the decades
because it was an industry that was more
[SPEAKER_01]: or less completely underground for a very
long time and now is really bubbling up
[SPEAKER_01]: over the radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are lots of people who, there's no
quality control over the name GDP.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're going to start out and you're
going to want to develop a strain or if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to want to sell exclusive
strains, there's things that you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: know to make sure that you can have the
confidence that what you're selling is
[SPEAKER_01]: what you're saying you're selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look to another industry like
the horticultural industry in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: strains, in terms of protection,
if you look at Roses or if you look at
[SPEAKER_01]: Tulips, there are many brands that are
well established.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not impossible, but it is
challenging, particularly to kind of claw
[SPEAKER_01]: back something that's been in the
marketplace for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're starting out going forward,
there are some steps that you can take.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am actually in the middle of writing
an article on protecting strain names.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, well said.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's my understanding, I'm not a
patent attorney, but we have a patent
[SPEAKER_05]: attorneys that work in our office.
[SPEAKER_05]: And botanical strains in other contexts
are something you can protect from a
[SPEAKER_05]: patent perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you apply that same standard to
cannabis is in fact a big question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanted to add that part of being
able to get a patent IP, whatever kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: copyright that you're looking for,
is being able to produce that strain the
[SPEAKER_00]: same way over and over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody's making all sorts of Girl
Scout cookies or Blue Dream or whatever it
[SPEAKER_00]: is, and it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also different in the dispensary
from the person growing it, because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have standards in place that control
for all the individual variables from
[SPEAKER_00]: people to electrical failure to training
to anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what standards do,
is they allow you to control for outside
[SPEAKER_00]: variables so that you can do something
like a patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you'll know that your product is
going to be the same over and over.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's well said.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the topic for this hour, again,
now that marijuana is legal, what comes
[SPEAKER_05]: next?
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt, let's start with the concept of what
is legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, ultimately legal could be medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Legal could be the collective system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Legal could be don't use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you recognize that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what steps do you take to protect
yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, first let me start out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not be the most popular viewpoint,
especially from a lot of people in this
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm never too praiseworthy to people
up in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they generally do a very
good job.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what I think they've finally done here
with Immersa and Adult Use was a
[SPEAKER_02]: monumental step in moving this industry
out of the shadows, gray market,
[SPEAKER_02]: the cartel drug trades, all the things we
don't like here in California without any
[SPEAKER_02]: tax increment revenue, just the bad
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what my colleagues here talked about
in terms of standards and doing what's
[SPEAKER_02]: best for consumers and making sure you're
not consuming products that are ridden
[SPEAKER_02]: with mold and pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know what kind of THC
concentration levels are and CBD,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my point is that a speaker was in here
earlier saying this is terrible,
[SPEAKER_02]: 15% excise tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plus you got state and local, county
level, city level taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you got nine bucks in change a
foot tax on growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to make everything more
expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people won't get their medicine,
et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are all sort of valid viewpoints.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in terms of the system actually
working and benefiting the people here in
[SPEAKER_02]: the state of California, I don't know what
we were doing for 20 years with our heads
[SPEAKER_02]: in the sand with Prop 215 and 420 and
watching Colorado pass us by.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've taken the best of other
state statutes and ordinances.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've given it a lot of thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the latest initiative is a
pretty thoughtful 60 plus page,
[SPEAKER_02]: fairly well reasoned attempt for
comprehensive regulation, taxation,
[SPEAKER_02]: and control of use.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a challenge for businesses
now to set themselves up for what's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be in the next two to three years and
whether they want to focus on medical,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether we'll focus on recreational,
assuming that passes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whether medical and recreational will
fully merge at some point in the next few
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I personally think it's incredibly
challenging in that for now I think trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to do something as legal as possible in a
jurisdiction that you're comfortable with
[SPEAKER_02]: that does have a comprehensive regulatory
scheme in place is probably a good start.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're going to want to be pretty
strategic about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are no perfect answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a long winded way of saying that I
think we're on the right track and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have a fully recreational west
coast top to bottom very soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm pretty enthusiastic about it,
especially as a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have legal cannabis business
operators here in California, then they're
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty aware of the nonprofit sham is
really what it is in terms of organizing
[SPEAKER_02]: your business that way in a mutual benefit
corp that's really taxable as a C corp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've got to have an arms like
management services agreement in place in
[SPEAKER_02]: a management company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's fraught with risk and you don't
have the certainty you want there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as a deal lawyer, as a corporate tax
lawyer, I'm very excited to switch over to
[SPEAKER_02]: for profit, still get the patients the
high quality medicine they want,
[SPEAKER_02]: but be able to legally profit from the
business and advise our clients with
[SPEAKER_02]: reliable, predictable structures that are
regulatorily compliant here in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's face it, the cat was out of the
bag before state regulation, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So how do you take literally hundreds if
not thousands and thousands of these
[SPEAKER_05]: businesses and then jam them into a state
top down regulatory model and get folks
[SPEAKER_05]: licensed?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_05]: So maybe you can comment, Matt,
just briefly on the idea that there is a
[SPEAKER_05]: way to sort of preserve your place in line
for state licensure.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is, and again, regulation's not my
strong suit, but certainly there is this
[SPEAKER_02]: piece of legislation that's ready to be
once it's funded that fixes AB 266 that
[SPEAKER_02]: cities aren't going to necessarily have to
have an ordinance adopted today in order
[SPEAKER_02]: to get in the queue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've got your September 1st
deadline that passed for adult use to be
[SPEAKER_02]: legally compliant to get first in line to
get a recreational type license.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think the key is there will be
some preference and deferential treatment
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're operating today, period.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sort of like measure D here in the
city of Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had your tax registration
certificate and you're in a location where
[SPEAKER_02]: a landlord accepts you and you're a prop D
compliant dispensary, there's a pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: darn good chance that you're going to
continue to exist post-membership.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in other words, it's entirely up to,
in effect, the local governments to
[SPEAKER_05]: provide you some sort of licensing or
certification that you're operating
[SPEAKER_05]: lawfully, which in fact preserves your
place in line for state licensing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I've been told, and I'd love to
talk to you some of you folks after this,
[SPEAKER_05]: what I've been told is less than 33%,
less than one third of existing operators
[SPEAKER_05]: in the state of California will be
licensed under the state regulatory
[SPEAKER_05]: scheme.
[SPEAKER_05]: What the heck is going to happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: Litigation?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are folks just burning the midnight oil,
making as much money as they can,
[SPEAKER_05]: closing up shop, moving on elsewhere,
back to the black market?
[SPEAKER_05]: A variety of things are going to happen,
but it's going to be really, really
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think this also segues to why sort
of having standards are important.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you wanted to comment on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it's the same comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just going to say that, you know,
this industry has developed quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: without regulation on a national level,
but it's not the first time that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I sat down to figure out how to write
standards for an industry internationally,
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a pharma background and a nonprofit
background, and I opened the first license
[SPEAKER_00]: in Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started looking to other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, in the 80s, when the heroin epidemic
swept throughout the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: methadone clinics had popped up all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within two years, they were in every
state working under different state,
[SPEAKER_00]: city, and county regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the federal government took a look at
that and said, whoa, there's no way to
[SPEAKER_00]: protect for health and safety here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need somebody to develop voluntary
consensus standards and a third party
[SPEAKER_00]: certification system so that these
businesses can assure the regulators that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing things in a safe,
quality, and consistent manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So standards and making sure that you're,
and it goes back to Kyle's question even
[SPEAKER_00]: that came up about stigma, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's a little bit afraid of this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the people that are pro cannabis on
the regulatory side still are fearful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They see the benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some better than others,
but they're still fearful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the best way in my mind for us to
move this industry forward as a whole is
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to prove that we have quality,
safe, consistent products, that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible business owners, that we're
not ending up with another news story
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you know, this happening or that
happening that looks bad for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when is the right time to start talking
about standards?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it when we've got our legs underneath
of us for a couple years as an industry or
[SPEAKER_05]: now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's never a wrong time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have businesses that have been in
operation for five or six years that are
[SPEAKER_00]: now going through this process with us,
but certainly at the beginning,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether you're a regulator or an operator,
you want to start as early as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: because we can help build out your
structure and make sure that it meets the
[SPEAKER_00]: standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can control for all the variables
within your facility and it'll save you
[SPEAKER_00]: money in the long run versus having to go
back and do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mary, what about, go ahead, if you'd like
to comment on that, I also have a question
[SPEAKER_01]: for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems to me that based on my
experience with trademarks and branding,
[SPEAKER_01]: something that would be important for you
all to know is that if you want to expand,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have a business, you get a
business, you want to grow the business,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you want to expand, you have different
options of ways that you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can partner with somebody in a
different state to get the license.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can partner with somebody after
they've gotten the license, before they've
[SPEAKER_01]: gotten the license, or you can license
your brand to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means you're going to have to have
some levels of quality control.
[SPEAKER_01]: That goes back to the issue of whether
it's GDP or Dr. Green Thumb's jet fuel OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to have some standards for
growers and for others to follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole issue of regulation and
standards really flows through every
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect of your business.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about, Mary, the difference
between branding, creating a brand,
[SPEAKER_05]: and creating something that can be
trademark protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to let him ask the question?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many standard bearers are there?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get the seal of approval
or the certificate that says that you meet
[SPEAKER_04]: the standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who are the purveyors?
[SPEAKER_04]: How big is that industry, and how many are
there?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question is, who are the standard
bearers?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you establish who the standard
bearers are?
[SPEAKER_05]: How many are there, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_05]: Leslie, you probably can best comment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's definitely other organizations
out there that have worked on standards
[SPEAKER_00]: for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: To differentiate a little bit,
there are certain types of standards
[SPEAKER_00]: called voluntary consensus standards that
are suitable for adoption into regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, in 1996, the Fair Trade and
Technology Act specifies that the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government has to use voluntary consensus
standards when writing regulations for an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry if they're available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it goes so far as to say they can
actually make the standards, the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So FOCUS is the only organization that has
designed voluntary consensus standards
[SPEAKER_00]: that meet those guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just going to throw this in,
because I do pro bono work for Americans
[SPEAKER_01]: for Safe Access, and they have a
patient-focused certified program that
[SPEAKER_01]: addresses various aspects of the industry,
including cultivation, retail,
[SPEAKER_01]: and others.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say, who are they?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not to slight, define character,
California companies, but I would look for
[SPEAKER_05]: folks that are operating in multiple
states.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can achieve licensure in more than
one state, that suggests something very
[SPEAKER_05]: significant about you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It suggests that you can be capitalized
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can be capitalized well,
you obviously have a good business plan
[SPEAKER_05]: and a good business program.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would demonstrate that you have good
corporate governance.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would demonstrate that you understand
the importance of complying with
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the standard bearers are those folks
that operate, in my opinion, in multiple
states.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think many folks are on that path.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Mary, let's talk about branding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's talk about the difference between
trademarks and branding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I guess a tandem question is,
can you trademark anything related to
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes and yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll start with the first part of the
question, which has to do, what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between branding and
trademarks?
[SPEAKER_01]: So anybody out here have a vaporizer?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you chose that vaporizer,
there were various aspects of the
[SPEAKER_01]: vaporizer that you were looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you want it to be something that fit
into your pocket or your purse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you want it to be something that was
battery operated or something that you
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't have to deal with battery
operating?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you want it to have a indicator on the
front of the vaporizer that had numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: that showed you the temperature as it was
rising?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or did you want something really simple
that the light just went a certain color
[SPEAKER_01]: when the temperature was reached?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of those are aspects of branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the product itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the way that you communicate about
the product to your potential customers or
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything about your product that
interfaces or connects with the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what a brand is.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a trademark?
[SPEAKER_01]: A trademark is one portion of the brand,
and it's the shorthand for the brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when I say that I use an Arizer
Solo, some of you might be nodding and
[SPEAKER_01]: say, oh, I tried that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But some of you are thinking, oh,
I'll stick with the volcano.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my point is that the brand name
becomes the shorthand for all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: factors about the brand, the quality,
the price, the ease of access,
[SPEAKER_01]: the ease of use, and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you think about your brand,
which is very important in this area of
[SPEAKER_01]: competitive, the way this marketplace is
changing to be so competitive,
[SPEAKER_01]: because there are so many new entrants,
you've got to think about every aspect and
[SPEAKER_01]: have a sense about where you're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: One aspect of the branding is the
trademark.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to be Marielle Shapiro Law up until
earlier this year, because when I left my
[SPEAKER_01]: big firm, I felt like what I was selling
was me, because I had these relationships
[SPEAKER_01]: with clients and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just rebranded this year to Evoke Law,
because A, I wanted to follow the
[SPEAKER_01]: guidelines that I provide my clients,
but I also wanted to say something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I always tell my clients to do is
choose a brand that is distinctive and
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just because I think that's a
great opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what the law wants you to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be exclusive and distinctive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I looked around at other laws,
law firms, and I looked at other names,
[SPEAKER_01]: I ended up settling on Evoke, because I
felt like that was, you need to tell your
[SPEAKER_01]: client, you need to evoke some response
from your customer or your patient about
[SPEAKER_01]: what your product is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the difference between branding
and trademarks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you like me to answer the second
part, part two?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned earlier that there are at
least two kinds of trademarks,
[SPEAKER_01]: state and federal.
[SPEAKER_01]: State trademarks provide protection in a
given state, and it's for intrastate
[SPEAKER_01]: commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Federal trademarks are for interstate
commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of folks have a little issue
about getting into that federal land,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there are different ways that you can
do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the question is, can you get a
trademark?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the answer is yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are just different ways of going
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are only operating intrastate,
the thing that you need to look at is only
[SPEAKER_01]: a state trademark.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in California, you are screwed,
forgive my French, because the California
[SPEAKER_01]: Secretary of State is still voluntarily
following the federal guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the feds will not issue a trademark
registration to any product that touches
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you are offering education,
services, you're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can talk about cannabis, but if you
are a retailer, you cannot get a trademark
[SPEAKER_01]: for your brand for retail services.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as I mentioned, California is one of
the outliers in this, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just about every other state that I'm
aware of where there are cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, and it's permitted,
do offer state trademark registrations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unfortunately, as you're used to
already, you've got a patchwork quilt of
[SPEAKER_01]: local and state and federal laws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, this area of law is no
different, and you have to wind your way
[SPEAKER_01]: through and find the right strategy of how
you can obtain the maximum amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: protection.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the topic, again, it's legal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, question.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question is, or the comment,
you had recently been in touch with
[SPEAKER_05]: someone in Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_05]: from a trademark office at the federal
level, and they effectively told you about
[SPEAKER_05]: this problem, as Mary described.
[SPEAKER_05]: They didn't say anything about the
illegality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Matthew said it, or maybe Bob or
both said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I refer to navigating the waters of
the cannabis industry in terms of the law
[SPEAKER_01]: as the Maslow hierarchy of needs,
for those of you who know what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't know, it's basically like we
need food and shelter first before we can,
[SPEAKER_01]: and at the very top, we can have
existential happiness.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in my mind, there's the same triangle,
and at the bottom, you've got criminal
[SPEAKER_01]: lawyers who helped people in this industry
navigate, who helped people in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry navigate through the criminal
aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the next place that most
businesses went were for a corporate
[SPEAKER_01]: lawyer and a tax lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my anecdotal presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some place above that, you start to get to
places like employment lawyers and
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectual property lawyers,
and at the pinnacle, I see that you have
[SPEAKER_01]: created a business that has revenue and
income and equity that you can leave to a
[SPEAKER_01]: charity or your family, and that's where
you need trust lawyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my little thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to get to your question, I think,
unfortunately, because of all the interest
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, having a trademark lawyer can be
really beneficial.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen too many cases where people have
applied for goods that are unlawful,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they get refused.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the federal level, okay,
so you've got the money that you've spent,
[SPEAKER_01]: the time that you've spent, and the
frustration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm gonna admit that it happened to me
in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I applied for five marks for one client in
California, and this is what's really
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: California sends you back the application,
they send you back your check,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they write this really long letter and
tell you what's wrong with your
[SPEAKER_01]: application.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean to be critical of government
or bureaucracy, but I do mean to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it also offends me, and now I'm
gonna get on my high horse, but it offends
[SPEAKER_01]: me that in California where cannabis has
been legal for medical purposes,
[SPEAKER_01]: for such a long time, in an area of law
that is about consumer protection,
[SPEAKER_01]: that they have this total disconnect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because again, if you're a medical
patient, you want quality, and you wanna
[SPEAKER_01]: know which retailer is gonna give you that
quality, which cultivator is gonna give
[SPEAKER_01]: you that quality, and it's really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am a founding board member of the
National Cannabis Bar Association,
[SPEAKER_01]: and with the National Cannabis Bar
Association, we went to see the Secretary
[SPEAKER_01]: of State to try and start this dialogue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the CCIA has also done that,
and other people have done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just haven't seen the change coming as
fast as it needs to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just add that bureaucracy is part
of this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're thinking about getting into
it based on what the topic of this
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation is today, you gotta be ready
to get no at every corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be ready to come back with an
argument, and you have to have the right
[SPEAKER_00]: people around you that understand how to
navigate those waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like college is like that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: College is like this big college you go
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're learning what you're learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your degree is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, if you can't
meet their requirements, and you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out when things need to be turned
in, you're really not gonna be successful
[SPEAKER_00]: at college, even if you understand the
content of the course.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, now you're reminding me of the dream
that I have all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That I have an exam tomorrow, and I
haven't been to class all session.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there was a similar topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was laying in bed at a hotel in Chicago
May a year ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was David Letterman's last night on TV.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I got to thinking about what do you
need to know now that the industry's
[SPEAKER_05]: legal, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you package that?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I decided to come up with my own top 10
list.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not nearly as clever as old Dave,
but let me give you my top 10,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you will, things to think about now
that it's legal to get into the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: First and foremost, the Controlled
Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are talking about a federally illegal
substance, simple and plain, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: There are policy memoranda.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those policy memoranda create rights
for this industry to operate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those rights are not necessarily
enforceable in a court of law unless
[SPEAKER_05]: you're referring to the federal budget.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a great case from the Northern
District of California called the MAM
[SPEAKER_05]: case.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Marin Alliance for Medical Marijuana,
where a district court, federal district
[SPEAKER_05]: court judge said to the Department of
Justice, you cannot spend dollar one to
[SPEAKER_05]: enforce against MAM because the federal
budget prohibits it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are safeguards in place,
but remember, please start with the
[SPEAKER_05]: understanding of the legality federally,
but also understand your state legal
[SPEAKER_05]: structure, which we touched on a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's number 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number nine, cash and banking.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna have a lot of cash.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna have few banking options.
[SPEAKER_05]: So think about that.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Colorado, we've solved the banking
problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: States have solved the banking problem in
a variety of places through due diligence,
[SPEAKER_05]: through software systems, through
compliance by third parties.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not solved everywhere, so that's
gonna be a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number eight, state and local regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just marijuana business regulations,
environmental regulations, land use
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations, something in California
called CEQA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pamela Epstein, who works with our law
firm, knows this stuff as well as just
[SPEAKER_05]: about anybody in the state, and when you
begin to talk about it, people's heads
[SPEAKER_05]: spin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Understand the environmental issues and
the compliance side of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number six, seven, thank you, with the law
school for a reason.
[SPEAKER_05]: Math is not my strong suit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Publicly traded companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: SEC has shut down trading on publicly
traded companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most states don't allow publicly traded
companies to operate.
[SPEAKER_05]: So think about your structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think twice, in my humble legal opinion,
about creating a publicly traded company
[SPEAKER_05]: to hold a variety of holdings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isolate your liability.
[SPEAKER_05]: Isolate your licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: Get the notion of publicly traded
companies for the foreseeable future out
[SPEAKER_05]: of your mind unless you're an ancillary
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Due diligence.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's highly specialized in this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to do due diligence.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was on the phone with a client this
morning who we said, we will get you
[SPEAKER_05]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will get you this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will get you this and that for a
dispensary that they're going to acquire
[SPEAKER_05]: in Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need to see that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: The numbers are fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't need to see that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: People throw stupid money at this industry
with no due diligence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't be one of those people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of those areas, whether you're
doing a deal to acquire something or merge
[SPEAKER_01]: with somebody, or whether you're doing a
licensing deal for a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to know who you're getting in bed
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to use that metaphor, but you
really need to know the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just about the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to know what their values are,
what their ethics are, what their morality
[SPEAKER_01]: is before you get into business with
somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a natural segue to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I see happening when new
businesses form is they don't think about
[SPEAKER_01]: their intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't think about what's going to
happen if things go wrong between the
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is just a general principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to always think about what's
going to go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mention that because that's another
aspect of thinking about what's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: go wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't just assume we've known each
other for four months and we're still
[SPEAKER_01]: dating.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all good, but when you start to run a
business together, questions come up,
[SPEAKER_01]: decisions get made, and you can be unhappy
or happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I only wanted to mention that I think the
due diligence is so important about every
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not your grandfather's due diligence.
[SPEAKER_05]: Due diligence is unique in this industry
because it takes into account your
[SPEAKER_05]: standard business due diligence,
but also the compliance aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What and how seriously, from a compliance
perspective, do these folks take that
[SPEAKER_05]: seriously?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at Washington State.
[SPEAKER_05]: Washington State, in effect, did away with
its medical marijuana program,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it merged into an adult use program.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think this is important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trust me, this is not coming from a
position of a lack of regard for patient
[SPEAKER_05]: rights.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's happening in the United States is
you're going to see federally regulated
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis-based medicine based on
rescheduling, whether that's a two or a
[SPEAKER_05]: three in the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are pharmaceutical products.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are pharmaceutical grade companies
that are producing cannabis-based medicine
[SPEAKER_05]: regulated by the FDA at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then you're going to have this divide.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the other side of the divide is the
natural product marijuana industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the industry we all operate in
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the dispensary system.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very, very different.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is not going to merge into
pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be its own thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: To have distinctions like medical
marijuana and adult use marijuana,
[SPEAKER_05]: when it's all the same thing, it's natural
product marijuana in its simplest sense,
[SPEAKER_05]: is a way to open the door and create
regulatory structures so policy makers see
[SPEAKER_05]: that it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: When they see that it works, they will
ultimately merge, but the divide is not
[SPEAKER_05]: between medical and adult use.
[SPEAKER_05]: The divide is between OTC marijuana and
federally regulated cannabis-based
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even though most hardened zealot
anti-marijuana crusader like Chris
[SPEAKER_05]: Christie, for example, and I could say
that from my home state of Jersey,
[SPEAKER_05]: this guy would sit back and over a beer.
[SPEAKER_05]: He would tell you.
[SPEAKER_05]: He would say, Hoban, we are not going to
send $50 billion of business back to the
[SPEAKER_05]: black market because what is the marijuana
industry in its most simplest sense?
[SPEAKER_05]: It is the most organized, well-funded,
institutionalized drug distribution system
[SPEAKER_05]: in human history, and it's happening in
broad daylight.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to send that back to the
black market, I can assure you.
[SPEAKER_05]: To figure out and to understand that
distinction between natural products and
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmaceutical-based, which, by the way,
can be based on natural products,
[SPEAKER_05]: is really going to be an art, but that's
why I think that they merge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to add to that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at standards, people ask me
all the time, are your standards for
[SPEAKER_00]: medical use or for adult use?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just look back and I say, well,
we don't want to turn all the recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: users into patients because their cannabis
isn't safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of the day, it's about
producing safe, quality, consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: products, regardless of what marketplace
you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also like to add, oh, sorry,
Matthew, your turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to be the cynic of the panel
because that's my role.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact of the matter is, beyond patient
rights and quality and standards,
[SPEAKER_02]: both the federal government and most state
governments spend a lot more than they
[SPEAKER_02]: need to be spending.
[SPEAKER_02]: We continue to have a spending problem,
and we're running out of revenue tax
[SPEAKER_02]: sources to things to tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've gone so far down this path of having
insufficient revenue to fund big
[SPEAKER_02]: government that we're not going to return
to the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's only going to get more and more
regulated and more and more tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eventually, like you said, we'll see a
change in the scheduling, and we'll have
[SPEAKER_02]: yet another tax at the federal level at
some point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's three years from now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it's 15 years from now, but it'll
probably happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all depends on what President Trump
allows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to go back to the notion of
intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you create something and you get a
patent on it, that is some big protection,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it can help you navigate through big
pharma and natural products as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also want to say, as a patient,
I feel as though it's going to be really
[SPEAKER_01]: important and even more important to have
qualified people in dispensaries or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it turns out to be that is
providing advice and counsel to patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: because when adult use is authorized in
California, a lot of the stigma starts to
[SPEAKER_01]: go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who never considered using cannabis
to treat arthritis or glaucoma or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: the illness is are going to want that kind
of support, because now they don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: sign up and get a card and feel like
they're on some database and they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: worried about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can just go into a dispensary,
but it's going to be really important in
[SPEAKER_01]: my mind to segregate the kind of budtender
that's going to give advice about medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis versus recreational.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well said, well said.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so let me buzz through my top
five, and then I've got a question for
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Real estate is another key.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number five, zoning land use.
[SPEAKER_05]: This, at its heart, you've probably seen
articles out there that cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: at its heart, is a real estate industry in
its most simple sense at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, that evolves as an industry matures
from a top-down regulatory system,
[SPEAKER_05]: but understand the regulatory structure,
understand what the local governments are
[SPEAKER_05]: thinking before they think it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of those folks are in the room,
so get close with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you have a liaison for
government, local government in
[SPEAKER_05]: particular.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number four, you can't generally have a
security interest.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes it really hard to lend to the
cannabis industry, because folks that are
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be deemed financiers,
quote unquote, or lenders, it's not your
[SPEAKER_05]: traditional industry where I can have a
security interest in the money I lend.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, if you even can under the
regulations, is that enforceable in a
[SPEAKER_05]: court of law?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by the way, if anybody has a comment
on any of these things, please feel free
[SPEAKER_05]: to jump in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number three, capital.
[SPEAKER_05]: Capital's hard to come by.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't get institutional lending,
of course.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to go to groups of investors.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to go to friends and family.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that has opened up, we hired a
specialist about six months ago for Reg A
[SPEAKER_05]: +, sort of crowdfunding raise for this
industry, very popular.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's proven to be effective.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I tell you, you can't go to banks,
but there are a number of folks that'll
[SPEAKER_05]: throw that, quote unquote, stupid money at
this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number two, the FDA claims and labeling.
[SPEAKER_05]: May 2015, the FDA issued a Q&A on its
website regarding marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: There were 16 questions, 13 of those 16
questions, dealt specifically with
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana, and whether the FDA regulates
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other three had to do with hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp gets me really excited, so I won't go
down this road, but let me tell you
[SPEAKER_05]: something.
[SPEAKER_05]: The 13 questions about marijuana,
of course, say that the FDA does not
[SPEAKER_05]: consider marijuana something that they
should have the purview over because it's
[SPEAKER_05]: federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: With that said, be sure to comply with FDA
labeling requirements.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna say, and I'm actually on the
FDA committee for cannabis, so while they
[SPEAKER_00]: say they don't regulate marijuana,
they regulate it, that goes back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: Controlled Substances Act and giving the
power to Congress, not DOJ or FDA,
[SPEAKER_00]: to change things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the FDA is absolutely involved in this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have many, many meetings,
many phone calls about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't kid yourself to think you do not
need to meet those guidelines.
[SPEAKER_05]: So comply with your state guidelines for
labeling and packaging at a minimum,
[SPEAKER_05]: but look at the FDA guidelines as your
standard to operate because it's critical.
[SPEAKER_05]: And don't make claims that don't apply to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just wanna say too, just so it's clear,
the focus standards, and I'm not saying
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's a selling point, but I wanna
make sure that you guys understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: all we've done is taken code of federal
regulations, pharma guidelines,
[SPEAKER_00]: nutraceutical guidelines, OSHA,
HACCP, everything that's, agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: guidelines, World Health Organization
guidelines, and put those together into a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard for each of the areas that have
then been specified specifically to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to go seeking out what
do I do for here with pharma or with
[SPEAKER_00]: nutraceuticals or agriculture or whatever,
and that's the benefit to a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if we're talking about starting a
business, you take the guesswork out of it
[SPEAKER_00]: by doing something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say the same thing is I wanna
focus on the claims and the labeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am all about consumer safety,
and it's not just become a trademark
[SPEAKER_01]: lawyer or just a human being.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about the patient first or the
consumer first, and you're gonna probably
[SPEAKER_01]: end up doing the right thing as long as
you have some guidance as to the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: But claims are really interesting,
and I'm not an expert in this area,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you have to be really careful about
what you say your product is gonna do
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're gonna step over some very
important law that's gonna put you in a
[SPEAKER_01]: real bind, and I just wanted to throw that
in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even if, for example, your edible
product produced in California from your
[SPEAKER_05]: company, even if the FDA technically
doesn't count because there's no
[SPEAKER_05]: interstate commerce or there shouldn't be
over that product, although any lawyers in
[SPEAKER_05]: the room understand that interstate
commerce is really everything,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's neither here nor there.
[SPEAKER_05]: When that chibichu makes it to New York
and it's got a label on it that says
[SPEAKER_05]: something wrong, it says it has too little
or too much of what it actually has in it,
[SPEAKER_05]: if it says in a medical regime this
product is intended to treat prostate
[SPEAKER_05]: cancer, don't do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't let anybody do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bad move from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: And back to your question, sir,
those people will certainly not be the
[SPEAKER_05]: standard bearers, so be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number one, taxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Audits, state tax, local tax, federal tax.
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt, segue, talk about taxes as they
apply to the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you would.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the cannabis industry, like no other
industry really, there's not a whole lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll talk about 280E, but fully,
heavily taxed, state, local, and federal
[SPEAKER_02]: level.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cannabis products in California
are generally subject to BOE sales tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these mutual benefit corps that have
non-profit charters are taxable.
[SPEAKER_02]: C corps, generally speaking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they look a lot like any other
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of these businesses, management
companies are set up as pass-throughs,
[SPEAKER_02]: LLCs, or partnerships, and there's nothing
different there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is one code section, which I'm sure
everyone's heard of, or maybe not be
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar with, but have seen it,
and that's 280E.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the differentiator,
the game-changer for the legal cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry in terms of anything that's a
schedule-controlled substance,
[SPEAKER_02]: because Congress passed this law 30-some
years ago, and their infinite wisdom,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was really targeted towards the
cocaine trade, the Pablo Escobar's of the
[SPEAKER_02]: world, not being able to take itemized
deductions in business expenses for what
[SPEAKER_02]: is federally illegal drug businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we all know that marijuana is
currently caught in that web, and that
[SPEAKER_02]: still applies to state legal cannabis
businesses, which means that you're really
[SPEAKER_02]: getting a very, the disallowance on
deductions is significant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're really taking a cost of goods type
deduction, whether you're a retail
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary, or a grower, or a producer of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a number of cases in this area.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Champ case is a well-known case.
[SPEAKER_02]: In those cases, under IRS audit,
dispensaries were taking deductions that
[SPEAKER_02]: were disallowed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, the tax court got them up to
somewhere around, call it 70% of what
[SPEAKER_02]: would be 100% of a non-cannabis business
in terms of deductions, and kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: cramming everything into cost of goods.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's certain guidance that we give
our clients in this area to maybe sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: mute or lessen the burden with respect to
280E, and that might be, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: a retail dispensary selling non-cannabis
products, whether that's glass pipes,
[SPEAKER_02]: t-shirts, paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a whole other set of laws on
paraphernalia, but to the extent you can
[SPEAKER_02]: allocate some of your expenses to a
perfectly non-sort of controlled substance
[SPEAKER_02]: act, or strictly type good, candle
property, whatever it is, there are
[SPEAKER_02]: planning opportunities from a tax
standpoint to work around, to some extent,
280E.
[SPEAKER_05]: So some of those strategies, Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_05]: Puerto Rico, 280E doesn't apply in Puerto
Rico.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working with a number of folks in
Puerto Rico.
[SPEAKER_05]: In other words, you can deduct expenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: If marijuana were to be rescheduled,
despite what I said before, the impact
[SPEAKER_05]: rescheduling would have on the existing
dispensary or natural product over the
[SPEAKER_05]: counter system is that the 280E exception
goes away based on the scheduling.
[SPEAKER_05]: So rescheduling, don't quote me on this,
because I have a tax lawyer I rely on,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I believe it would have to be a
schedule three for that 280E to no longer
[SPEAKER_05]: apply.
[SPEAKER_05]: Matt, your last piece of wisdom for the
audience today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Consider other states besides California
over the next few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big proponent of Oregon,
and I would definitely diversify your risk
[SPEAKER_02]: and your exposure, and it's a fun new
market, but we're years away in California
[SPEAKER_02]: from having that regulatory certainty
we're all looking for.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Business Development Council for the
state of Colorado just ripped Matt's
[SPEAKER_05]: resume up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thank you, Matt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
