[SPEAKER_01]: We've got Eric Branstad here of Greenhouse
Advisory Group and also works for Boxcar
[SPEAKER_01]: Supply Co.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got my lovely wife Sarah.
[SPEAKER_01]: She works for Crescent Soil Services which
provides microscope analysis for soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microscope analysis for soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got the batting warm-ups out of
the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cup is awesome this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't rained yet today so everybody's
seeming in good spirits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, even though it's changed this
year, it's a little different than last
[SPEAKER_00]: year with the Prop 215 going into the Prop
64.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're definitely not seeing dudes with
backpacks of pounds walking around this
[SPEAKER_01]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no packs and the lines are a
little different in the way you got to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, everybody can blaze.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to get a wristband in a
certain area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's kind of unified now,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like that part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several years ago, the first Emerald Cup I
came to was the first cannabis event.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't bring my medical card.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't even know that was a thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to meet up with Eric.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to do the old little Watusi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, they still had dogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little wristband swap-a-rino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I learned that back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put them on loose.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm allergic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I appreciate it because I drove 480
miles to come to an event without my
[SPEAKER_01]: driver's license.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was pretty stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come a long way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've come a long way since then,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you guys are now leading the way
in the soils deal on Elaine's webinar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, that's big.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty surreal.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few years ago, we came hoping to just
try and meet people from the industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: try to get connected with the movers and
the shakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thankfully, Dragonfly Earth Medicine
and Eric allowed me to hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just the weird dude with the
microscope book trying to talk about math.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just really grateful this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have products that are on display that
we designed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working with some farmers that
entered the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just feel really grateful that
so much has developed in the first few
[SPEAKER_01]: years since just trying to be involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that it's very controversial right
now with the big farms and the small
[SPEAKER_00]: farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing any big differences in your
line of work with soils?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bigger farms versus the smaller
farms?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, does the microscope see the
difference in those kind of things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is your business still kind of the same
plan, big or small?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fix the soil, look it up in the
microscope, do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, our approach is always the same
regardless of how big the farm is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just come in and we analyze what
they're working with, what the issue is,
[SPEAKER_01]: try to take some measurements.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest issue we see in any facility,
whether it's a tent or whether it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: 40,000 square foot greenhouse,
it's the variation from the wettest pot to
[SPEAKER_01]: the driest pot is what really gives people
a headache.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as we're moving into scale,
we really try to quantify those
[SPEAKER_01]: variations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the biggest challenges,
if any, farm really is mindset change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have to be able to look at what
you're doing and scrutinize and say what
[SPEAKER_02]: is working and what is not working.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if you're married to a certain
type of program, is that actually working
[SPEAKER_02]: for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that actually bringing success and why
or why not?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so those are the questions that every
farm has to answer as they move forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we love to help them out with those
answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I love the getting to somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like everybody kind of
bottlenecks and kind of what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times people do nine
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they change this, they change
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to track where the success is,
but it's easy to, you know, notice the
[SPEAKER_00]: failure or the problems that exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I know, you know, for you guys and
myself, we spend a lot of time trying to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, do these things to help people
solve these problems, whether it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment up above or like you guys with
the soil environment down below.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, like I said, with the small
farms and the big farms, I'm kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: wondering because now what I'm doing,
the trim procurement, I'm seeing a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: the big farms too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it's kind of this
bittersweet situation where I'm working
[SPEAKER_00]: with small farms, working with big farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe it or not, the big farms are
trying to do good things in some way.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, I see a lot of them with
organic approaches and trying to do,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the right thing ultimately,
but they have that name big farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of laugh a little bit because I
thought of something the other day and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you guys can help me with this or
see if it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the regenerative soil food web,
you know, general population of organic
[SPEAKER_00]: soil people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that slide that you and Elaine and
people use of how the forest takes care of
[SPEAKER_00]: itself, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The forest is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need to feed itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need to do all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yet everybody's focusing on the small
farmer to do this regenerative work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, can't the big farmers do it
because it's the big forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to me the biggest of farmers
could do this because it's the biggest of
[SPEAKER_00]: forests or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, where's the hang up or the
disconnect where it's only the small
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer that, you know, I guess I feel like
is over, not over supported, but just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, hyper focused on where,
you know, the big farmer also needs a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of help because I don't want
them making a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, that's really what's
scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, a lot of these farms,
a lot of these people moving into the old
[SPEAKER_01]: cut flower houses, like those,
those water sources are so destroyed,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're forced to use reverse osmosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, these big commercial RO
systems with these really contaminated
[SPEAKER_01]: water, I mean, they're three, four,
12 to one waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, some of these facilities
are using 30,000 gallons a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we recently converted a
farm that was 40,000 square feet that was
[SPEAKER_01]: doing a drain to waste in cocoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, they were averaging,
you know, almost a thousand gallons for
[SPEAKER_01]: one little small area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we cut that down to 180 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one area was taken 700 to a
thousand gallons drain to waste,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we cut it down to less than 200.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, if you're talking about
the argument of this high production salt
[SPEAKER_01]: model, it's like, well, when you're
dumping a thousand gallons of water into a
[SPEAKER_01]: space every day, that's a lot of water
that becomes a dew point that becomes
[SPEAKER_01]: visible mold and botrytis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't the connection that people
are making.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we go into a room and we
cut that, cut that water usage by three,
[SPEAKER_01]: by four, by five, by seven sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mold pressure reduces,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're able to quantify the organism
populations, which can give us an
[SPEAKER_01]: indication of disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we can tweak these little values,
reduce the water usage, and we're lowering
[SPEAKER_01]: our carbon footprint, we're lowering our
destruction to the planet, we're lowering
[SPEAKER_01]: our usage of water, and we're getting a
mold-free higher quality product,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what Sarah and I have really
been trying to do is push these concepts
[SPEAKER_01]: into the commercial space so that people
can see that it is a real thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the biggest opposition we always get
is like, well, if we put everything,
[SPEAKER_01]: all these plants into a single bed,
how are we going to keep the disease from
[SPEAKER_01]: moving from one place to another?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just pull up an image of Africa on
my phone and point to Africa as one
[SPEAKER_01]: motherfucking container, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it is one container,
all roots in the same container,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely scalable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, regenerative soil solutions
are scalable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the real obstacle is that the
techniques that people are teaching aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily that conducive to success in
the commercial market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what Sarah and I have really tried
to do is figure out, like, how do we
[SPEAKER_01]: functionally put those natural systems
into the commercial space and get them to
[SPEAKER_01]: work for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, unfortunately, the organic
farmers, the regenerative people are,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they're getting a lot of waste
streams, you know, and it's hard to be
[SPEAKER_01]: successful while cultivating out of a
waste stream, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I think that we actually do best
is to make living soil absolutely scalable
[SPEAKER_02]: and very simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it has to be something very simple that
every single move that you do at scale
[SPEAKER_02]: becomes very precise and totally
reproducible across the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you make sure that every single
component, your water, your soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: are on point before you get started and so
that you have control and a baseline as
[SPEAKER_02]: you move forward and you roll it out
across a big area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that becomes something very
attainable, very manageable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you have labs that you look at and
you're watching what's going on so that
[SPEAKER_02]: before you start seeing it in the plant,
you're seeing it in the soil and you have
[SPEAKER_02]: time to address it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really what helps people scale
and get a handle on success in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's funny to me because I see
people with a lot of the products and
[SPEAKER_00]: certain things and maybe biologicals and
whatnot and they're not using a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis to determine what needs to be
added.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after hanging out with you guys for
so long, I just think, yeah, I see a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of waste and spinning our wheels and is
this the right thing or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you base that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you get that metric of this is
what I need versus what you don't need?
[SPEAKER_00]: People do have a habit of this is when I
throw a little dash of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mend with a little of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have our methods to our madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we're getting to this regulated
area where cost of production is
[SPEAKER_00]: everything and you're on a larger scale or
even a small craft farm, what you spend
[SPEAKER_00]: money on to put in has to count.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be a game where, oh, I didn't
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, working with you guys and
seeing what you do, it just blows me away
[SPEAKER_00]: at the lack of use that's being put
towards, you know, resolving these things
[SPEAKER_00]: and every place that I go to because it's
really spinning the wheels and somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't really do the microbiological
counting and testing to quantify exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what is going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I think it's so simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I think that the other thing is
that, you know, there's a lot of talk that
[SPEAKER_02]: we need living soils and we all know we
want living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unless you're quantifying it,
there's probably something living in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it pathogens that you're stimulating?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it only bacteria?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like bringing that knowledge into
something tangible and useful that that
[SPEAKER_02]: translates into yield and health and
harvest ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, the below ground is one
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're if you're cultivating up
above and in the atmosphere as well and
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at that plant mass, you got to
have the right greenhouse environment or
[SPEAKER_02]: the right above ground with the airflow
and the leaf temperatures and all that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what you bring to the table is that
perfect marriage with us in the below
[SPEAKER_02]: ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for what you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's worked great for both of us
because we kind of needed each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't really know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has worked out great because I've
learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen a lot of great results come
out of a lot of the projects that we've
[SPEAKER_00]: worked on together or, you know,
on the side together to help people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, yeah, it's been really it's
been really eye opening for me and and
[SPEAKER_00]: going some of the places we've been to,
you know, the trip to Macedonia and things
[SPEAKER_00]: in other countries of what's going on has
been really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think it's really neat to
go to some of those places that are really
[SPEAKER_00]: eager and blossoming for living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to grow, you know, nutrient dense
cannabis, which are trichome dense
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, because we got to make oil.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, do we bring in native soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of inputs are people working
with?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we use?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a variation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one of the things that we do is
we try not to stick to any specific dogma.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't try to stick to any sort of
religion.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just analyze what's in front of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does the farm have?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we make the best use of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, me personally,
I like to have anxiety and lose sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stress about stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I learned to quantify
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could send it out for a lab result
and I could look at the numbers and the
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers don't have any emotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can make decisions without emotion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, whether the farm's
planting a native soil or they're buying a
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial soil product, we still do the
mineral analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still do the biological analysis and we
look at what's in front of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately for cannabis farmers is,
you know, the supply of soil that's coming
[SPEAKER_01]: into them is remarkably inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from my mathematical standpoint,
really unsuitable for the goal at hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a massive demand across all
states, especially in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a legitimate supply issue
with soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the variation in the nutritional
values of those soils are varying widely
[SPEAKER_01]: from batch to batch to batch, from farm to
farm to farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, in my opinion, that's one of the
greatest benefits to permanent living soil
[SPEAKER_01]: is we quantify our inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We send them in for testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We verify what we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: We add what's missing to bring it into
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we just maintain it once.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all these farms that are trying to
do this really high production organic
[SPEAKER_01]: model and they're bringing in new soil
each time, you're bringing in a new set of
[SPEAKER_01]: variables into the most difficult thing
you've ever had to navigate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, that's one of my biggest
advocates for living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's what I care about,
believe about or think is what people
[SPEAKER_01]: should do, in my opinion, it's the easiest
way to mitigate variation in risk moving
[SPEAKER_01]: into an area when the profit is declining
significantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, some of the analysis we
do, you know, a lot of these soils that
[SPEAKER_01]: people are producing have potassium and
salt levels that are so high it's
[SPEAKER_01]: impossible to bring these soils into what
we would call balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these salts and these potassiums start
to antagonize other nutrients,
[SPEAKER_01]: namely calcium, manganese, and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you start to have really,
really, really difficult time having plant
[SPEAKER_01]: health at this new, largest scale with
this widest level of variability,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of these soils that we've been
relying on for all these years with these
[SPEAKER_01]: brands that we've become accustomed to,
like, you know, some of them are sending
[SPEAKER_01]: out soil that has compost from Hurricane
Katrina.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the compost component of some of
these bag soils are the waste and debris
[SPEAKER_01]: that was being composted from Hurricane
Katrina.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're seeing like, you wouldn't
name it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wouldn't believe what's in there in
some of these soils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that makes it difficult for
cannabis cultivars to execute this task.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so people scoff at the price a lot of
time, and they'll choose like a $70
[SPEAKER_01]: municipal waste soil, fight pests and
disease, and they'll scoff at our $300
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that $300 soil is a forever soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, every harvest or every
second harvest, you got to do like $20 to
[SPEAKER_01]: $40 worth of mineral amending to each yard
in the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the savings begins to build year
after year after year while the quality
[SPEAKER_01]: gets better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just becomes more predictable,
you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: We just try to meet people wherever
they're at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they're doing indoor, if they're
doing greenhouse or doing native soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're bringing it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just try to meet them wherever they're
at and make that better and simplify what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if they're putting in all these inputs
and top dressing and all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: we just make sure that that isn't swinging
our biology any one direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not necessarily saying, I mean,
sometimes we will say don't use that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular product, but sometimes we're
just saying, yes, that's a good product,
[SPEAKER_02]: but maybe scale it down to a proper dose
so that when we're dealing with biology,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything becomes a food source and will
swing your biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are the principles that we
teach.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so anything can become nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything can swing your biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even if you're not doing soil,
though, just teaching people about
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrition and spraying to heal things
rather than kill things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really what this is about,
is making sure that the plants thrive,
[SPEAKER_02]: making sure that our mindset enables that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spray for health, not for war.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of these older farmers we work with
have been growing for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll say stuff like, when I first
started, I never would have imagined
[SPEAKER_01]: preventively spraying for pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just didn't have mold.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't have pests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now we're into this mindset of fear
of losing, of crop loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are basing their program around
spraying poisons or spraying compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: that are designed to kill things without
accounting to how does that affect
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrition and plant development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and it affects the quality,
not the quality, but the end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as you've been hearing me rant and
rave about was with the trim procurement,
[SPEAKER_00]: that gets made into oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a lot of flour and a lot of
trim that passes cat one and cat two
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when it's condensed or concentrated
into an oil, that's where we see the
[SPEAKER_00]: detects and the failure rates start to go
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to find clean product and make
sure that every step of the way your
[SPEAKER_00]: product has viability and value,
you have to find better ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have to find better ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that's the way it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're going into category three
where the heavy metals are kicking in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a whole new ballgame
that people aren't really ready for
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the soils, the compost,
the things that you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is a bio accumulator,
a bioremediator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's trying to do its friendly job.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cleaning the air, cleaning the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it's doing is actually picking up
all this stuff and causing detectable
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts even in the flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I judged the flour and there was
some detectable amounts for certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the microbials were up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a whole other different category
to look at too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, there's a lot of transparency
of work and things that we all need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to do together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, sometimes we're bound
by NDAs and certain things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's ways around those two to help,
I think, express without giving too much
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what's going wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how to fix it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's backed up by math and also the
support of a lot of other people that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've helped turn around.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that we've seen in our
work is because a lot of our work is
[SPEAKER_01]: analyzing crop loss and analyzing issues
and helping people through difficult
[SPEAKER_01]: scenarios.
[SPEAKER_01]: Normally, since we're kind of a new era
math I guess you could say and we're kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of an emerging market, people aren't
really used to what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they don't seek us out first typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of times we come in after
products been confiscated, destroyed for
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants and after a massive crop loss
has happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we found is there's actually a
lot of contamination coming from other
[SPEAKER_01]: areas that we didn't know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our food isn't being tested every five
pounds like cannabis is in Nevada,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, Nevada had really,
really, really tight constraints.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we learned a lot helping farmers
navigate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we worked for several farms trying to
make it through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're starting to see is that
there's contamination in some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: products that we've been relying on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the Department of Ag from
Oregon has done a fantastic job at doing
[SPEAKER_01]: their own testing and quantifying some of
these products and posting on their
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'd encourage everybody to go check
that out and see what the Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Ag has already identified.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we try to encourage people to test
their own materials, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, everything you bring in the
building.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're starting to see pesticide
contamination come in through organic
[SPEAKER_01]: products like we saw with the azadirachtin
based sprays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, you know, on the drift,
because the drift is really big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I found out working with big ag
guys in Salinas area, not cannabis ones,
[SPEAKER_00]: the real ag is how drift will actually go
from town to town, city to city.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can actually start out in one place and
end up in Bakersfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stuff they sprayed in Salinas ended up
in Bakersfield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that story you told me about was
mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to trace it all the way back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we're starting to see a lot
of issues with contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things we talk about in
our workshops are, you know, testing your
[SPEAKER_01]: inputs so you don't get a surprise fail
detect that causes you issues down the
[SPEAKER_01]: line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're starting to see drift
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you've seen a couple scenarios where
the pesticides from an agricultural field
[SPEAKER_01]: actually somehow merged with the weather
system, went up and over the hill and
[SPEAKER_01]: caused the contaminant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were able to prove that,
which is mind blowing, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I'm doing the trim
procurement, a lot of the oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the flour on the trim will pass,
but we make oil and concentrate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where we see the detects.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the farms I go to,
when I see grape vineyards in the area,
[SPEAKER_00]: I already start to get a little worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in places where there's a lot of
strawberries and it actually did okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then again, the farms know when they
spray, I went back and did a quarantine
[SPEAKER_00]: and that stuff had a detect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really tough being surrounded by
the grapes, by the strawberries.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like I said, the flour on the
trim will pass, but a lot of times you
[SPEAKER_00]: need your product to be valuable all the
way through, whether it's the smalls,
[SPEAKER_00]: the shake, maybe the stems, if you can
make paper out of them or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nevertheless, you know, the value
starts to be diminished as these
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants float around from other farms
and it's carried by the fog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the wind, when you spray at the
wrong time, you know, not everybody pays
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the wind they're supposed to
spray and how these things are applied
[SPEAKER_00]: according to the weather patterns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, if they can track it in regular
ag, eventually they'll be able to track it
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because cannabis is that bioremediator
and it tries to clean things up,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it just sticks like a magnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's different contaminants from farm
to farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never just the same one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no, it's not all my kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all these other words I can't
pronounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ag guys say, Oh, that's found in,
you know, and you can Google them and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're found in, um, you know,
whatever they are, fungicides,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, so a lot, a lot of the fails is
that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a, what is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: A surfactant and organic fungicides or
something.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's causing, yeah, it's causing a lot of
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's, there's some strange ones
in there, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, we want to help figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we get into category three testing
with the heavy metals, microbials pop up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, it's just going to get a little
bit more difficult as we go and people
[SPEAKER_00]: have to refine their skills each time and
work with people that can test stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, you know, that's what we've been
about is since, since our work has come in
[SPEAKER_01]: after the car crash has already happened,
we've seen how these problems develop and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the best way to, to not have a
crop confiscated and destroyed from
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants or get a very, very low value
that isn't, that isn't conducive to a
[SPEAKER_01]: profitable model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we need to do some predictive
testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to test the pesticides that we
plan to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're seeing contamination in
the bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a certain aspect of,
uh, um, hiding products through waste
[SPEAKER_01]: streams, I guess you could say.
[SPEAKER_01]: And dilution is the solution is the
solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but that's the thing we were kind
of joking around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a judge for the flowers and,
and, uh, you know, I don't know if it was
[SPEAKER_00]: me or you or during the, you know,
help helping me judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, at one point the joke was after
we tried the flower, we were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this trim wouldn't pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the, one of the unfortunate,
sometimes it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think the trim would pass,
but the flower did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm also a little sensitive
though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my job includes going into a disaster
and trying to fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the funny things about cannabis
people is before they start working with
[SPEAKER_01]: you, they always want you to smoke their
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And which is cool, but like, you know,
if you brought, if you brought me for an
[SPEAKER_01]: issue, I'm smoking a detect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've, you know, I've seen the look
of the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen the bottles on the wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen the detect and I have a physical
sensation to correlate that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, yeah, I'm definitely quite
sensitive to the commonly used
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do got to say the quality though is
up detect or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: The entries were super fire, the personal
entries, the license entries, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: mixed light.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was super pumped.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top four was in my top four that you
helped me with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you even helped take notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was an insane task with the entries
were fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has a lot to do with, you know,
these techniques that we talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see a lot of this through,
you know, over the course of time,
[SPEAKER_00]: the mix light looking like indoor,
everybody has this level of, I want it to
[SPEAKER_00]: look like indoor is the saying,
you know, and how do they So how do they,
[SPEAKER_01]: so what is the difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the full sun sometimes takes some
weathering or has a look.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, why does some of these
newer coverings in the greenhouses start
[SPEAKER_01]: to change that look?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's happening in that space that
allows that flower to look more like
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's mostly how the light hits the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These micro climates, you know,
help in some cases too, because I have
[SPEAKER_00]: found a couple of indoor grower,
I mean, sorry, outdoor growers that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: like, how is this even possible?
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you get into the greenhouse,
there's many things that you can do wrong,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than, you know, I guess you could
do right and greenhouse becomes this
[SPEAKER_00]: global term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if I have a greenhouse, I'm going to
get this great product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not necessarily the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also leads to that idea that we can
control everything and control gets to be
[SPEAKER_00]: futile and costly at times too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, the greenhouse
cover is really important because we can
[SPEAKER_00]: either magnify the light or we can diffuse
the light, which is calming down the sun's
[SPEAKER_00]: intensity and doing that with shade cloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It restricts the light, but a good diffuse
cover will split the light and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: create more light particles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis does love a lot of light,
but it doesn't like too much because we
[SPEAKER_00]: can scorch and burn off those terpenes and
valuable oils and cannabinoids like CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do we retain those things?
[SPEAKER_00]: And usually it's with the use of good
soils, good airflow, and a good greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: cover that actually does help calm down
the sun's intensity, which lowers the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: surface temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with a lower leaf surface
temperature, we avoid condensation and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, which is plant transpiration at the
end of the day, which makes for better
[SPEAKER_00]: water usage and living soil techniques.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we use a lot of water and we run into
drying out, you know, it compromises our
[SPEAKER_00]: soil structure or quality of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they call in one of us or both
of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call me in and then I go,
well, now we got to call you guys in
[SPEAKER_00]: because we fix one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to fix the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at the end of the day, it just
always adds to the quality of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with less inputs, less sprays for
war, we have better terpene, cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: production and overall just, you know,
better look, taste, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just starts to go up and those
levels go up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and now we get people saying it to
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stop us at these events and go,
yo, I can't believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I mean, it's not something that,
you know, we're trying to sell as a
[SPEAKER_00]: product, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the truth approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's the approach, you know,
and we're, you know, we're really trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to change the mentality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things we've noticed in our
work is, you know, we'll get called into a
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's maybe a retrofit or a poorly
designed style maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll get brought in to quantify why
there's pockets of plant health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, our microscope work and our
mineral analysis can certainly show why
[SPEAKER_01]: there's variations and there is,
and those variations in the soil
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely lead to plant health problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when I stand there in the
greenhouse and I look up and they're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: some combination of pulling the shade
cloth halfway or pulling the depth curtain
[SPEAKER_01]: halfway in an effort to shade,
and what people aren't realizing is that
[SPEAKER_01]: creates the most dynamic variation in
microclimate from one plant to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is they're using the
wrong climate screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're similar looking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know if the greenhouse
company's pumping it because of cheapness,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it doesn't breathe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then what we're doing and trying to
bring relief to the plants by using a
[SPEAKER_00]: climate screen or a shade cloth that
doesn't breathe, we're trapping air,
[SPEAKER_00]: thus creating the greenhouse effect again
in an area that's cut off from the ridge
[SPEAKER_00]: vent for ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's almost like two wrongs that
aren't making anything right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we're opening the shade cloth to
burp the greenhouse, close the blackout
[SPEAKER_00]: system to calm down the sun's intensity,
but we're restricting a ton of light in
[SPEAKER_00]: the heat of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just these combinations and
nobody's following anybody or everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: following the neighbor, but the neighbor's
doing 10 different things every different
[SPEAKER_00]: run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's impossible to set standards with
some of these things because everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: moving at such a fast pace that they don't
have time to ask any questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just go and act and, you know,
maybe hire somebody that tells them to do
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who I don't know who it is or
where they're getting the info from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're that guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to bring you in and make sure
you got the right combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to wrap this up, where did
they find us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you at?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we get a hold of you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm almost impossible to get a hold of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I avoid, I avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you get a hold of Sarah?
[SPEAKER_01]: I avoid most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I dip in the shadows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sarah knows the website.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's cressivesoil.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cressive is c-r-e-s-c-i-v-e-soil.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, so you can find us there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram, we do have a cressivesoil.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram, we haven't worked at all that
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: He works his own scatola granola.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm nursing the dirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so soil is our passion, but also
this concept of nutrient-dense food and
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of setting the bar.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is it that, you know, here's the
interesting thing about what humans do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get busy creating something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it devastation?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it war?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do we really want to thrive?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what, that's what lights me up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, let's get busy thriving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's like, you know, make plants that
like have total nutrient density and feed
[SPEAKER_02]: our bodies and feed our souls.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis, because that's the bridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: She is the bridge off of pharmaceuticals,
folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you can find me at Light Dep
Greenhouse on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's light underscore dep underscore
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, if you want some trim
procurement, talk about farm consultants,
[SPEAKER_00]: any of these kind of things, let's link
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My email is Eric at BoxcarSupplyCo.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was great talking with you
guys and being at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: We appreciate it.
Thank you.
