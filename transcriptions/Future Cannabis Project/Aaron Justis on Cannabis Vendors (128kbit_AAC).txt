[SPEAKER_00]: We get a lot of vendors that come in with
their product over the years, and one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the main things that we're looking for,
since there are no regulations regarding
[SPEAKER_00]: the supply or the labeling or lab testing,
we really rely on a professional
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance and a professional product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it comes to the infused products,
we've irritated, I guess, probably a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of people over the last couple years,
but we've had some strict demands,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it just comes down to their packaging,
being labeled, lab tested, and being
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate, and being professionally
packaged, and also having a consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are really the first things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same thing when it comes to the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely want samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not the kind of place that will make
a decision on the spot just by the way it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks or smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need to try the product,
and that's probably the biggest thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're concerned with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have had people that we've said,
hey, can you bring some samples?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they seem a bit turned off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Buy it like we might just use the samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they have this experience at other
places and then never get back to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we take taking in samples extremely
seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make sure all the right people try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have forms for everybody to fill out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then basically, we take it from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's a good product, we usually
carry it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many little things that are
missing from our shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we just got medicated hemp milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have that before.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would we not take someone that had
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have even handmade cigars wrapped in
gold or cannabis leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's no competitor in that
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the product came to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good product, and we accept it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the big thing is trying to find
what's missing on a shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see, especially in the last few
months, I've seen so many new products in
[SPEAKER_00]: so many new categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I hate to keep going back to this
theme, but we're going to run out of
[SPEAKER_00]: display case space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to have to change the
layout of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest thing is isolating the
cannabinoids and having different
[SPEAKER_00]: combinations with those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like we were talking about earlier,
of course, CBD has become more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: popular over the last couple of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vape pens, we just got in a soda.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this thing, it's Sprig.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tastes like Sprite, and it's
medicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in a nice can with a nice
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And new vape companies keep coming out
with things because early on in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, we could get vape pens,
but a lot of them had a weird taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people were putting PG and PEG and
these fillers into the pen because they
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't get them to flow properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our patients basically don't want any
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want them pure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the vape companies have
noticed this, and that's what most of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the products are just getting cleaner,
better packaged.
[SPEAKER_00]: More consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an exciting time to be a cannabis
retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an exciting time to be a cannabis
retailer.
It's an exciting time to be a cannabis
retailer.
