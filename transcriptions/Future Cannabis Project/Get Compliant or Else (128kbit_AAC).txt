[SPEAKER_03]: Over the last year, I, like many of you,
have been dealing with a new thing in this
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in this game for 12 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done everything from trimming bud to
being a mule to packing flowers from
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt to Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been a really remarkable journey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But now we're getting into something that
I know very little of, and that's keeping
[SPEAKER_03]: paper records and complying with state
law.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a new world we're entering in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's probably the most difficult part
of my business today, is figuring out not
[SPEAKER_03]: only how to be compliant today,
but where is this all going?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so on the stage with me today is
Sherwin Amaron at the end, Chicago-based
[SPEAKER_03]: Ethos Manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's the chief technical officer in the
middle is Brett Prichard.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's here in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's part of the owner of Results Matters
Group, a consulting firm that's been
[SPEAKER_03]: getting not only myself, but many,
many, many cannabis companies in
[SPEAKER_03]: California compliant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Andy Spoon, a really good friend of
mine, as all these three gentlemen are,
[SPEAKER_03]: he is the CEO of Ethos Manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Cierra, the chief operating officer,
of Cierra Labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cierra Labs has been working on FDA
compliance for many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Andy's been in the FDA compliance space
for many years writing software that gets
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll give you a quick introduction.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably better to read off this than
just ad lib all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Sherwin is the chief operations officer
for Ethos Manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sherwin has comprehensive experience in
the design, manufacturing, and operations
[SPEAKER_03]: of fluid-based processing systems and
facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: A graduate of University of Iowa,
he has a BS in political science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a BS in BS?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: In economics, with over two decades of
industry experience, Sherwin has extensive
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge in environmental, water,
soil, hydrocarbon, and agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: processes, and has managed operations
installed in a variety of far-flung
[SPEAKER_03]: locales, including throughout North
America, Europe, the Middle East,
[SPEAKER_03]: and South Korea.
[SPEAKER_03]: His administration record that includes
bidding, site selection, facility
[SPEAKER_03]: operation, personnel management,
and intellectual property management.
[SPEAKER_03]: Andy Spoon has worked with multiple
startups in high-compliance environments,
[SPEAKER_03]: including clinical trials, medical
devices, and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most recently, Cierra Labs was started to
help companies automate software and
[SPEAKER_03]: hardware development processes to meet
regulatory demands and stay compliant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Andy's focus is helping align fast-paced,
innovative teams with regulatory
[SPEAKER_03]: frameworks and quality systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, just so I don't screw up the...
[SPEAKER_03]: Brett Pritchard, founder of Results
Matters Group, a cannabis consultant that
[SPEAKER_03]: includes project management for the
application process, build out,
[SPEAKER_03]: business consulting, budgeting,
and compliance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the real theme here today,
is compliance.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we get compliant?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we stay ahead of that curve?
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people think that federal
regulation is coming down the line fairly
[SPEAKER_03]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the FDA gonna say about CBD
consumption?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the FDA gonna say about smoking,
psychoactive compounds?
[SPEAKER_03]: None of us know.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's an interesting avenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking at longevity for your
cannabis-based business, you need to start
[SPEAKER_03]: focusing on compliance today.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need to start looking at the
regulatory landscape and seeing where your
[SPEAKER_03]: business fits into that model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're gonna start it out, and based on
your experience, I'm gonna start with
[SPEAKER_03]: Andy.
[SPEAKER_03]: What have you seen, and based on your
experience, where do you think cannabis is
[SPEAKER_03]: going on a federal landscape?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a quick question, just to get a show
of hands.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many in here own or work with a
cannabis company?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, and how many of those with your
hands raised are directly involved with
[SPEAKER_02]: compliance at those companies?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a cool, pretty good number.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our perspective from coming from the
FDA space is we see this being treated
[SPEAKER_02]: just like every other pharmaceutical
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, our goal in working with
companies like Travis and producing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis-based projects, we assume that's
gonna go the direction of just the same
[SPEAKER_02]: way that you would expect GLP practices,
GMP practices to be applied at a company
[SPEAKER_02]: producing Advil or Aspirin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of a couple of interesting things
about that is it has to balance with the
[SPEAKER_02]: pace of innovation to the standards and
compliant workflows and processes that
[SPEAKER_02]: come into that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's one of the biggest
challenges in the space right now is how
[SPEAKER_02]: do you continue to maintain that agility?
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you just saw in the past two
presentations, things are moving very fast
[SPEAKER_02]: with the technology, and it's still not
completely understood what are the best
[SPEAKER_02]: ways to extract, distill, remediate,
isolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think as you wanna keep that pace up,
you have to start thinking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, how do we start putting the
processes in place in our company that we
[SPEAKER_02]: can make sure that we're producing
consistent products a product that can be
[SPEAKER_02]: research-tested, research-studied,
and essentially be dosed?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's where we see it going,
is a product that's stable and that
[SPEAKER_02]: dependent.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sherwin, I was gonna ask you, or maybe
Brett to start out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you see the landscape on a state
level right now, and do you see that this
[SPEAKER_03]: is the beginning and that there's a long
road ahead of continuing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know CEQA's coming up in California in a
year, give us an overview of the landscape
[SPEAKER_03]: today and in your head where it's going
from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they did a lot in the very
beginning, so I don't think we have huge
[SPEAKER_00]: changes ahead, but they have already let
us know that they will be changing it
[SPEAKER_00]: basically every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're learning from either
problems that we in the industry run into,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we then go to them and say,
hey, here's an issue, adjust the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations, so that we can deal with it,
partially because of the innovation that
[SPEAKER_00]: goes on and just things they didn't think
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the cities and the states,
a lot of it is around keeping track of it
[SPEAKER_00]: from a security diversion standpoint,
but also from a tax revenue standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course the other big thing for them
is the safety of the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's gonna be a lot, there may be
more around testing or more around the GMP
[SPEAKER_00]: issues that we make sure that everybody is
producing it as a consumable product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's the things that will
change as time goes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope there's more kind of making things
easier, but it's not going to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: as in getting rid of regulations,
it's just gonna be hopefully filling some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the holes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's been mentioned twice,
Sherwin, there's a lot of talk about
[SPEAKER_03]: people like, oh, we're gonna build a GMP
facility or an ISO facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot of that really means keeping
track of everything that's happening in
[SPEAKER_01]: the facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Record keeping?
[SPEAKER_03]: Choke up on the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So record keeping, process tracking,
the ability to maintain and monitor
[SPEAKER_01]: processes, that's really what all these
systems in the end are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the ability to be able to look
backwards in time and understand what
[SPEAKER_01]: happened on a production side,
on a product side, on a process side,
[SPEAKER_01]: for safety side, energy control,
hazardous materials control, all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: elements are driven in those programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think as those things become more
formal, more well understood and part of
[SPEAKER_01]: the conversation, that ends up as part of
the conversation with the regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ability to keep that data flowing
upwards into those regulatory bodies is
[SPEAKER_01]: maintaining that conversation between us,
between the industry and the regulators.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how this regulation is gonna evolve
in a productive fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just extend that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing to keep in mind too,
anytime you're talking about GMP,
[SPEAKER_02]: GLP, ISO, you're pretty much all talking
about the same kind of thing, which is how
[SPEAKER_02]: do you put records in front of an auditor
and how do you explain what you do in a
[SPEAKER_02]: repetitive way, in a way that can be shown
that if I do this again, I end up with the
[SPEAKER_02]: same result.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one interesting thing to go back and
do next week, going back into your
[SPEAKER_02]: company, is sit down and see how would I
explain this to someone who knows nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: about how I operate, knows nothing about
what I'm doing, but if I had an auditor
[SPEAKER_02]: show up, what would I put in front of
them?
[SPEAKER_02]: What story would I tell them?
[SPEAKER_02]: And start thinking about that internally.
[SPEAKER_02]: And another interesting way that happens
is with new hires.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, how many of you are hiring people
at those companies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like probably pretty regularly,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have a new hire coming in,
you have to train them, you have to tell
[SPEAKER_02]: them what you do, what they need to be
doing on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good way to start sneak peeking
into what an auditor would expect to see
[SPEAKER_02]: when they show up at your facility and
won't understand what you're doing there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been seeing, there's tons of edibles
hitting the market, and coming from the
[SPEAKER_03]: California regulation through the CDFA.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when that goes to a federal level,
where we're making cannabis-based food
[SPEAKER_03]: products nationally, give me an overview
of what the FDA is looking for,
[SPEAKER_03]: the USDA is looking for when it comes to
those products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll kind of speak from the FDA
perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the main thing that they're going
to look for, first of all, is what claims
[SPEAKER_02]: are you making?
[SPEAKER_02]: As many of you know, the number one
dreaded thing that pretty much any entity
[SPEAKER_02]: making consumable drug, beverage,
vape, is they're going to make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not claiming that it can do
something that hasn't been proven,
[SPEAKER_02]: can be done, and other research studies
that have went through an FDA approval
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show of hands, if you're undergoing an
FDA-approved process in your development
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no one, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to be producing edibles
right now that you're claiming can cure
[SPEAKER_02]: Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an awesome series of talks right
next door that are showing that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: research being done to make those claims,
but it's not there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And only one drug has actually went
through that process, which was kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: double-edged sword.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was good in the sense that you now can
see that there's drugs being proven that
[SPEAKER_02]: the FDA is accepting our THC derivatives
that can be used to treat things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now that THC is a recognized drug by
the FDA for that treatment of that
[SPEAKER_02]: specific thing, they're going to be super
sensitive to you claiming it can be done
[SPEAKER_02]: for other things.
[SPEAKER_02]: See the Canalea forewarning letter that
went out this week.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had claimed that their topicals or
things could treat anxiety, sleep,
[SPEAKER_02]: depression, a number of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they got a warning letter saying
you can't make these claims, and that
[SPEAKER_02]: could potentially slow down the
development of that product pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: significantly and how it goes on the
shelves at CVS or Target or where they're
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to put that consumer-based product
in front of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the first thing I would say from
an FDA perspective is be very careful in
[SPEAKER_02]: your marketing material what you are
claiming publicly your drug can be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, going beyond that, so let's say I'm
now starting to prepare something I do
[SPEAKER_02]: expect to engage the FDA on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back to what Brett and Sean were
saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to start keeping records.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to start keeping records of how am
I producing it, who my suppliers are,
[SPEAKER_02]: what technology do I have in here,
how is it being operated.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just a whole set of series of
things that you're going to expect to show
[SPEAKER_02]: from an auditor perspective coming into
that facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the really interesting things about
that is that record-keeping, that
[SPEAKER_01]: processing, that doesn't necessarily mean
having a perfect record or not having any
[SPEAKER_01]: mistakes or any errors.
[SPEAKER_01]: When those auditors come in, they're going
to expect to see the things that went
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong and what was done to address those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And oftentimes companies will go through a
scaling process where they're implementing
[SPEAKER_01]: ISO-like processes and everything's 100%
compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually a huge red flag of a
process that's not properly implemented
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's not actually capturing the
things that are, the improvement cycles
[SPEAKER_01]: that are occurring in the facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little joke in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have auditors coming in and their
job is to go through and find things that
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing wrong, you probably want to
know where those things are that you
[SPEAKER_02]: expect them to find so you can act
surprised and be like, oh, I didn't expect
[SPEAKER_02]: to see that when they find it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It helps them feel like they're actually
doing their diligence, but at the same
[SPEAKER_02]: time, there are areas that you know that
you had some soft or weak spots or areas
[SPEAKER_02]: where you potentially weren't following
your processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one on the stage that I work a lot
with, Clark Newbark, LLP, and don't use
[SPEAKER_00]: that as your philosophy on your cannabis
compliance, please, because they are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for something and they may find
something, but don't give them something
[SPEAKER_00]: to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going back to products and processes,
it's, remember, depending on where you are
[SPEAKER_00]: in the chain, part of your responsibility
is the due diligence of where your product
[SPEAKER_00]: is coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in an extraction operation,
you really need to know what's going on at
[SPEAKER_00]: the farm, where your biomass is coming
from, and you can't just assume it's good,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's great, from not only a financial
standpoint, but it really could hamper you
[SPEAKER_00]: if you get something that's tainted.
[SPEAKER_00]: God forbid it's something that's tainted
that continues to go through the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So also remember that wherever you are in
the chain, you're kind of responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: where all this came from.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in my facility, we talk a lot about
deviation and how it affects batching.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you explain why deviation is
important?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like downstream, product recalls happen,
you can go back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you give us kind of insight into that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, any of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Open question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so how it's important in terms of
liability.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is it important?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have consumer goods hitting the
shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, consumer goods outside the
space, every space, the ultimate quality
[SPEAKER_01]: is important, but the repeatability is
more important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those deviations, they create
variances in the products that are out
[SPEAKER_01]: there in the market space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those exceptions become, a lot of the
weight of the product is interpreted from
[SPEAKER_01]: a liability perspective, from an
environmental perspective, from a health
[SPEAKER_01]: and human harm perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ability to control those, track those,
respond to them, to keep those extremes
[SPEAKER_01]: from becoming something that's in the wild
and uncontrolled, that's ultimately the
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that's most important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a reason that mass market companies
often get away with a solution that's 85%
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're very reliably 85%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, that's a solution that's
considered a less risky solution than
[SPEAKER_01]: higher quality products that have a
greater degree of variance.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's often why there are unregulated
agricultural operations, dairy operations,
[SPEAKER_01]: that really run into trouble, despite
having facilities that are some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: best facilities in the world, because the
lack of that traceability, the lack of
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge about when those deviations
occur, they introduce an element of risk,
[SPEAKER_01]: and risk is what generally drives
regulators crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and just to kinda go back on a
little bit higher level, those deviations
[SPEAKER_02]: are typically opportunities seen as your
quality team to figure out where something
[SPEAKER_02]: needs to be addressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't necessarily mean you did
something wrong, it just may mean you did
[SPEAKER_02]: something that wasn't documented properly,
or there may have been a work instruction
[SPEAKER_02]: that wasn't exactly aligned with the new
piece of technology that went into that
[SPEAKER_02]: process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think, you know, you gotta kinda
shift that mindset of thinking that,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, we don't need any deviations because
deviations are red flags and we don't want
[SPEAKER_02]: those on our books, to thinking of,
no, that means you have a healthy quality
[SPEAKER_02]: program in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you expect to be finding deviations
and you expect to be improving,
[SPEAKER_02]: and this whole model of continuous
improvement is kinda based on that idea,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that you make mistakes, you learn from
them, you continue to improve.
[SPEAKER_03]: That kinda leads me into the technology
side.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you've all had a chance to see a
slew of different operations and different
[SPEAKER_03]: equipment, and someone who's been kind of
growing the extraction business for the
[SPEAKER_03]: last six, seven years, I started out with
washing machines in my kitchen,
[SPEAKER_03]: doing bubble hash to plant-sized or
factory-sized processing, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: that was just kind of throwing in
equipment that could be implemented today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was always, we don't say this
anymore, but we used to say compliance
[SPEAKER_03]: third.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like production number one,
and then there's something in the middle,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then compliance third.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you still say it sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, from a mechanical, an equipment side,
where's our equipment today, and how does
[SPEAKER_03]: that translate to scaled, consistent
product being delivered in the future?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you see some shifts in the
landscape where equipment that everyone's
[SPEAKER_03]: really comfortable using, you know,
short path distillation, or white film,
[SPEAKER_03]: or nooch filters for isolation,
or whatever it is, is there gonna be a
[SPEAKER_03]: shift to move towards equipment that are
potentially more automated, more
[SPEAKER_03]: data-driven, more consistent in the long
run?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think that there's a lot
of chemical processes that are implemented
[SPEAKER_01]: in the space for a variety of different
extraction mechanisms that are at best
[SPEAKER_01]: currently roughly defined, where the
manufacturers have a reasonable idea about
[SPEAKER_01]: what's happening, everybody's rushing to
scale, to reach new heights.
[SPEAKER_01]: That scaling is coarse in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the processes become better
understood, better defined, things like
[SPEAKER_01]: tracking those deviations so you learn
more about how the processes evolve over
[SPEAKER_01]: time, I see that equipment being refined
to a very high degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other interesting thing that's
happening in the spaces, and it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent theme because of prohibition,
I think, in a lot of ways, is there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of interesting mechanisms,
know-hows, technologies, pieces of
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment out there in other spaces that
are 60% solutions for what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The evolution of those pieces of equipment
from something that's a water treatment
[SPEAKER_01]: piece of equipment, or an agricultural oil
processing unit, to a cannabis processing
[SPEAKER_01]: unit, that's really interesting stuff,
and it's a very active, live, evolving,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's evolving in a way that other
industries are not right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty exciting stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say also, we were talking
about compliance, is make all that work
[SPEAKER_00]: together in your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the technical people, whether it's
technical on the chemical side,
[SPEAKER_00]: the process side, or technical on the
software side, make sure that all your
[SPEAKER_00]: advances are interwoven with the people in
your organization that are responsible for
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you don't kind of run past what
you need to do and you kind of have to
[SPEAKER_00]: look back and say, wait a minute,
we quit tracking something because you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to build a good foundation and keep
running with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether it's people in your firm or
hiring good consultants that help you with
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but make sure that those
conversations are happening kind of in
[SPEAKER_00]: unison so that the compliance people
understand what the production people are
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where they're trying to go,
and vice versa, that the production people
[SPEAKER_00]: say, yeah, it's you guys' responsibility
to figure out where we got this from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to crank it out,
because both sides will suffer if they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm a big believer in, I think
compliance done right will make production
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's universally true.
[SPEAKER_01]: If compliance is a drag on production over
the long run, there's always hiccups.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's things that need to be worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But over the long run, compliance done
right will improve production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throughput, the economics of production,
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you think it through,
it will.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first, when we all saw it, it was like,
oh my god, this is going to slow
[SPEAKER_00]: everything down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But working with the right people,
working with all sides together,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be a nice flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're now seeing a lot of the things
that were implemented and just strict
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis regulations actually dovetail
nicely into the GMP and ISO stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if we do produce a product that
has to be recalled, we need to,
[SPEAKER_00]: number one, know at what point it has to
be recalled from, but also where that
[SPEAKER_00]: misstep took place so we can go back and
fix it, or maybe that it's just something
[SPEAKER_00]: that happened at the final stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it where everything was fine
right up into the very end, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging is what tainted something,
or whether it started at the very
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning with the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to make a callback,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great thread from Dustin's
presentation earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned machines, and he spoke about
open sourcing machines and sharing those
[SPEAKER_02]: innovative ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think compliance and regulatory should
be another great place to apply some of
[SPEAKER_02]: that same principle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to think that there was a
community forum there where people were
[SPEAKER_02]: able to go and discuss, this is our
interpretation of the regulations and how
[SPEAKER_02]: we're doing it and how it's working for
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being able to benefit the whole industry
by sharing those ideas of how you're
[SPEAKER_02]: addressing those standards and
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_01]: The regulators would love to be part of
that discussion, and they will write the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations in a lot of ways driven by
those discussions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think that's what's missing in the
cannabis space specifically, that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: not seeing enough voices speaking directly
to ... It has always seemed to me that a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of people whose voices are being heard
in the cannabis space have no idea what
[SPEAKER_03]: they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what's missing?
[SPEAKER_03]: There needs to be more ... True story.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably a mixture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mixture of too many voices that
someone is speaking loudly, the squeaky
[SPEAKER_00]: wheel, but they're addressing their own
issue, not something specific with the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're addressing it on a small scale,
and we really need something that is dealt
[SPEAKER_00]: with on a very large scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times, it's a lot of the people that
really know a lot of stuff sometimes stay
[SPEAKER_00]: quiet, because they're so used to being
quiet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not bringing that stuff forward,
and that's where, whether it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: political advocacy or working directly
with regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you from talking with them,
when things pop up, new regulations pop up
[SPEAKER_00]: or proposed regulations, they get tons and
tons of input, and I'm wondering if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just too much that they can't really
digest it when it's just a bunch of noise.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where these advocacy groups and
trade associations and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they can focus and not focus on their
own trade alone, they can focus on some of
[SPEAKER_00]: those things and help the voices be a
little louder.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see an interesting parallel,
not quite the same as the cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it happens somewhat similarly in
software and technology development and
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you start shifting from, let's say,
80s, 90s era tech, where a lot of these
[SPEAKER_02]: auditors were writing the regulations of
how to regulate software in pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: development, and now digital health
technologies that are being put out there,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can go get an app on your iPhone that
can help you stop smoking, to help the
[SPEAKER_02]: previous generation of auditors and
regulators that were writing regulation
[SPEAKER_02]: think how to talk to the modern day
software writers and software agile
[SPEAKER_02]: technologies and software development
platforms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to overcome a little bit of
arrogance from both sides of the table,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think there's a little bit of that
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your auditors think that they know
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wrote the standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your practicers and your developers think
that they know what's best, because
[SPEAKER_02]: they're able to go and write the best
software.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you are going to see some of that
with the cannabis space as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got people from both sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, maybe I don't know the regulators in
the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fairly new, so maybe they're not
quite as thinking that they know
[SPEAKER_02]: everything about it, but you do have to
have a little bit of meet in the middle
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of mentality going into those
conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: A conversation we had a while back that I
remember about the safety and compliance
[SPEAKER_03]: of the machinery.
[SPEAKER_03]: Show of hands how many people have used a
short path distiller.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know many of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We buy equipment from whoever.
[SPEAKER_03]: We set it up in our garage or lab or
whatever we have at that moment,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we start going, and we learn through a
process of failing.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you scale up, we had this conversation
about doing has ops to see where our
[SPEAKER_03]: failure points are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you touch on a little bit on how
important that is, being part of the
[SPEAKER_03]: roadmap to getting towards a compliant
facility?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The process management from an industrial
scale involves trying to understand from a
[SPEAKER_01]: safety perspective, an environmental
perspective, a hygiene perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: and an operability perspective what your
plant is going to do or what your facility
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a pretty involved and detailed
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's very valuable.
[SPEAKER_01]: It fits into the whole theme of ISO and
FDA compliant, but it really is about
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding every step, every nut and
bolt, every pipeline, every pump in your
[SPEAKER_01]: facility, and looking at it from a couple
of different dimensions, control of
[SPEAKER_01]: energy, control of heat, control of
pressures, and things that can interfere,
[SPEAKER_01]: things that can introduce toxins or
contaminants, perhaps even benign
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being able to track and manage those
things, these processes, in order to have
[SPEAKER_01]: what would be considered an OSHA compliant
facility, it has to be a process itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not something that can be started in
a day or solved in a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It never happens that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be a very important
factor going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being able to manage those risks means
being able to continually make progress on
[SPEAKER_01]: reducing those risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I think what ends up happening
is facilities get shut down.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get stop work orders.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get more regulatory review.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get auditors that are coming in that
then want to run through the same process
[SPEAKER_01]: and identify errors that might be made,
which then leads to further work
[SPEAKER_01]: stoppages.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's much better and more productive to
stay ahead of that, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to end up having to do it
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state requires it to a certain extent,
and the cities are requiring it more and
[SPEAKER_00]: more as you build out the facilities and
go through the building and safety
[SPEAKER_00]: concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fire development services departments are
getting more and more involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: They realize that some of these machines
that we build are big.
[SPEAKER_00]: They involve pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: They involve employee safety,
environmental, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of figuring out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to make you go through it
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might as well do it now, get a handle
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Liability, there are people lining up to
sue the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Employee safety is just going to be one of
the many areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like any other building, you would
expect if you're producing peanut butter,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're working there, you expect it to
be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hope that the company has done
everything it can do to keep you as an
[SPEAKER_00]: employee safe, as well as produce a safe
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really no different than these other
hemp or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to recognize that and get on
board and get your proper people involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be ahead of the game with a lot if
you're doing a lot of this quality control
[SPEAKER_00]: and understanding the equipment that
you're using, that it is safe for what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're using it for, and that it's going
to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have protocols, SOPs, all that kind of
stuff to develop a good product and to do
[SPEAKER_00]: it safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it, and I think from outside the
industry, from a regulatory perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: from a partner and customer perspective,
if they were doing due diligence on a
[SPEAKER_01]: large scale, a lot of it starts with
respect for the forces at work.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the industry, we deal with things that
are very hot and things that are very
[SPEAKER_01]: cold, things that are potential
asphyxiates, things that can catch fire,
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are at potentially very high
pressures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things that can go boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that can go boom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starting that discussion, starting the
process, the first step is recognizing and
[SPEAKER_01]: identifying at least the sources of
energy, the hazards that are out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just understanding that they need to
be treated with respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just getting to that point is at least
half of the work, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Final question before we take some
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen a company out in HCB over here
in southeast downtown building a pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: sizable plant and as we've had inspectors
come through and people come through that
[SPEAKER_03]: are in a regulatory position, they kind of
don't know what they're looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's difficult in some ways to kind of get
them to process, because to them it looks
[SPEAKER_03]: like an episode of Breaking Bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't really know what they're
looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know what it does.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we get around that?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we educate?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we bring those regulators into the
fold of being comfortable with what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: producing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think part of it is understanding their
language.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the things that they freak out
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that make things go boom or hurt
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've already dealt with all that,
you've documented all that, then when they
[SPEAKER_00]: see this and they say, ah, okay,
and then you can walk them through,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is the precaution we put here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is designed here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the hazard associate.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the analysis that we've done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you're speaking their language and
they're going, oh, these people do know
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have asked some of the same questions
I would and they've already gotten the
[SPEAKER_00]: answers and they've already dealt with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that their blood pressure can go down a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think part of it is as they go
through these inspections, they see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other part is I know part of what we
do is try to develop relations with these
[SPEAKER_00]: people so we can find out what they're
looking for so that we can talk to the
[SPEAKER_00]: clients in advance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But honestly, in some departments,
they're still trying to figure out what
[SPEAKER_00]: they want these things to look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's looking at other industries
and saying, okay, when they were
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing peanut butter, they wanted
to see this, this, and this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's address those same pressures and
flammability, all the different things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we know they're going to freak out
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of that starts with some pretty
traditional activities.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go into a peanut butter plant or a
steel mill or a plastics facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to start with signing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll start with a short safety briefing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There might even be an evacuation
briefing, an explanation of what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to see, perhaps a brochure that
explains it on a high level, and then
[SPEAKER_01]: questions and a review and a tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are kind of the normal steps that
are expected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's relatively basic stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: For most people that are involved in these
facilities, these are pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: straightforward concepts that we've
internalized, we understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can communicate them, things that
you already know pretty well on a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: basic level, I think that goes a long way
to being able to show that we take these
[SPEAKER_01]: things seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the not so fun answer is you make it
boring, like taking sexy out of the
[SPEAKER_02]: picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so many times you come in and
people are very fired up to talk about why
[SPEAKER_02]: this is the best short path because of
terpene or compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're obviously a fanatic about the
product where you're talking to someone
[SPEAKER_02]: who wants to think that you're creating a
water treatment facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're excited about steaming something
over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think from that perspective too that
it's not necessarily the answer I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: think really anybody wants to hear,
but it is doing some of those boring
[SPEAKER_02]: things and making it a little bit more
less exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, intangible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Sherman brings up an important point.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to get inspected.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's just traditional inspections
that happen to any business or whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it's specific inspections to the cannabis
or hemp business, you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: inspected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think preparing for that and knowing
not only do we do this with every visitor
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes in, they're going to sign in,
they're going to get safety licenses,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to get a briefing on,
don't touch this, go this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hear this sound, then if we get
into the habit of doing that with our
[SPEAKER_00]: visitors, then when our inspectors come,
it's like, okay guys, gals, we do this
[SPEAKER_00]: with everybody that visits the facility,
sign in, safety glasses, evacuation drill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, they say these people know
what they're doing and it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: of taking away the sexy, but it's also
taking away the fear that I know sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: when I review things, I get to review a
lot of premise diagrams to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they are compliant with city and state
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I get them and from the
front page, I can tell, oh my God,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is going to take a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not really got anything right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know I sit there and pour over
literally almost every square inch of the
[SPEAKER_00]: drawing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other times I get them, it's like,
okay, they've got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They figured this out and your guard goes
down because you feel like you're dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with a professional that knew what they
were doing when they put this together and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not so feeling like I've got to
find every single thing that they did
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong because they did a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to open up, we got a few more
minutes.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anyone has a question, these are three
great guys to talk compliance with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have a question, raise your hand
and we'll identify you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyone in the room?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right there in the middle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: just take a step.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is something that's amazing about the
cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_03]: We fall under... Can you paraphrase the
question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'll paraphrase it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what standards, what regulations are we
looking at overall in AFP or is it health
[SPEAKER_03]: and safety?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it FDA?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you go to find what standards
you're falling under?
[SPEAKER_03]: Did I cover that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think that's the interesting
thing about cannabis specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make food products.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make smokable products.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make topical products.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's so many things that fall under so
many different categories.
[SPEAKER_03]: We manufacture all those products in
buildings that could be a nice size boom
[SPEAKER_03]: machine, for lack of a better word.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how do you navigate all those different
regulatory bodies and make them work for
[SPEAKER_03]: you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, one important thing to realize too
is I think you have roughly at least three
[SPEAKER_02]: or four different angles of what
compliance means up on the stage here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there's legal compliance,
which is a lot of what Brett's talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about, your state, your local hopes seem
to be national regulations that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: required to just because you fall into a
business of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other piece of that is from a
manufacturing perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I'm putting in an ISO 9001 quality
system into my facility, there's tons of
[SPEAKER_02]: information online of what that looks
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty standard thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you start getting into,
you're making a food, you're making a
[SPEAKER_02]: consumable, you're making something that's
going to be inhaled, digested.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole other set of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as I start bringing my different
pieces of equipment into that
[SPEAKER_02]: presentation, you're going to start
engaging potentially a fire code or CO2
[SPEAKER_02]: code or another code that's from another
industry or electrical code from an
[SPEAKER_02]: electrical industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So keep in mind it is a complex topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably, once again, going back
to the earlier comment, it's one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: things that would really benefit people
sharing information of what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: encountering.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this is kind of, I'm in California,
I'm doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to talk to other people in my
area about how they're addressing DCR or
[SPEAKER_02]: how they're addressing fire compliance or
metric compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's probably a great one right there,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's so many people we talk to
are saying like, well, I know we're
[SPEAKER_02]: supposed to be doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really unclear what we're supposed to
be doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wish I could go talk to somebody
else that actually is going through the
[SPEAKER_02]: same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's a big point right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody sees Dustin later on,
make sure we get a compliance portion of
[SPEAKER_03]: that website built before too long.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right there in the right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question was, how do people budget
for this activity and where do they budget
[SPEAKER_03]: that from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a formula?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a percentage?
[SPEAKER_00]: The easy formula is budget more than you
thought it would be because everybody has
[SPEAKER_00]: underestimated that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say treat it like a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got different pieces of the
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing equipment compliance
and safety, that's going to go into the
[SPEAKER_00]: buying or the building of the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're probably going to have a legal
budget or you're going to have a business,
[SPEAKER_00]: a staffing budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's more of your human brain power
compliance issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're producing products that fall
into the FDA realm, we've seen a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: different facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say almost every single one of
them have one, if not four or five people,
[SPEAKER_00]: that that is their only job is to know
what the rules are, to train all the staff
[SPEAKER_00]: in the facility to follow those rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a team to continually watch to
make sure that as we're doing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're following the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really budgeting it I think falls
into the different areas and it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be on the scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But generally people have under budgeted
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just mention this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot cheaper line item if you start
it from the beginning than if you try to
[SPEAKER_01]: bolt it on later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Retrofit again, compliance, quality,
safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are very hard, expensive things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just one more comment on that,
which I think just mentioning once again,
[SPEAKER_02]: like all things compliance, it's risk
management based.
[SPEAKER_02]: So assessing what are the risks I expose
myself to and aligning that to what the
[SPEAKER_02]: right dollar spend would be against it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the risk is me getting shut down and
having a million dollars invested in this
[SPEAKER_02]: license and this facility evaporating out
from underneath me, you probably want to
[SPEAKER_02]: allocate a chunk of that into protecting
against that from happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one real quick add on to that is
working with your, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: architectural, GC, your engineering firm,
because some of this, some compliance is
[SPEAKER_00]: flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make it really easy to be
compliant or you can make it really
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult where people are having to go
back and forth from one area of the
[SPEAKER_00]: building to the other to do what's needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think of it from, build a good
foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think of it from the very beginning and
build it workable, compliant, good
[SPEAKER_00]: workflow, efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back there in the white t-shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the question was, is there programs to
start training compliance officers,
[SPEAKER_02]: compliance personnel inside of companies?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, the thing is this, this is,
there's tons of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the interesting thing is this is an
industry that's kind of approaching
[SPEAKER_02]: compliance is not a new thing,
but as a fairly recent thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be aware that there's a whole lot of
training of compliance outside of cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: that will dovetail exactly into what
you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, USC has a regulatory affairs
program that produces compliance and
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory affairs people looking for jobs
in pharma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guarantee you, some of those students
graduating from those programs are very
[SPEAKER_02]: excited to figure out what that looks like
inside of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the, those programs are out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They may not have cannabis on their name,
but there's definitely people in them that
[SPEAKER_02]: are very excited to get into this space
and figure out what that looks like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, bringing those principles into
this space.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're tuned into that frequency.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, so go and I'm blanking on the names,
but ASQ, the American society of quality,
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory affairs societies,
international societies.
[SPEAKER_02]: ISO obviously is a huge one.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of those large networks produce
quality professionals and training
[SPEAKER_02]: programs for quality and compliance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then right there in the black shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll just last question right
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the, the question, uh, you're not as my
GC and the, and the, and the awesome
[SPEAKER_03]: question was, um, he's building out one of
our facilities and, uh, from a GC,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, general contractor point of view,
things keep changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We keep putting new equipment in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the plans have to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: The electrical has to get redone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're, we're doing a lot of research and
development in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, there's a facelift every a
month or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and he's, uh, wondering,
is there at some point they're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: a stop?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to say, okay, this is it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what we're moving forward with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, sadly, I would probably say,
no, there's no stop to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I just don't think the industry is
quite got there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, you know, you're, you're still
figuring out what's the best technology.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the right scale?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, what is the right scale?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's interesting just looking at
the market of extraction, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I extracting, you know, 500 pounds,
5,000, 50,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all those have very different
answers from a compliance perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're not, you know, you're,
you're not building a restaurant that has
[SPEAKER_02]: a pretty established, like, if I know if
I'm building a restaurant in LA,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is, you know, how you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, I know who I'm going to talk to
and inspectors are going to come in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think you've quite hit that,
that point yet in cannabis build out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's going to be interesting to watch
with hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I, I think one thing that we haven't
spoken very much about yet is how hemp,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, is very quickly going to dovetail
into this conversation as well and get
[SPEAKER_02]: treated the same way as cannabis and,
and help standardize the regulatory
[SPEAKER_02]: compliance approach across processing both
of those plans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is, which is how it is in Canada,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The hemp and cannabis fall under the same,
same, same legal regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think also to your, to your
question, that's part of that getting
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody to, to work together because
some things you want to find out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I, I kind of sometimes find it
along the way with clients that they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to build this and then they want to build,
you know, this times two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's having that conversation if
you can, because not all the time do they
[SPEAKER_00]: know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is, what is the scale up on this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a result, if we're putting in,
and I'm just, I'm just making up something
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're putting in something that needs a
200 amp circuit today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's, you know, from a GC
standpoint or an architect standpoint,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that where we're going to stop?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times the owners,
no, no, that's not what we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop, but we didn't ask the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then it's like, no, we would like
to actually put two of those in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, okay, well maybe we'll run
conduit for two or maybe we need to pull a
[SPEAKER_00]: different transformer off the pole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's us using what we know to help
the clients vision what they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have in the next, you know, three to five
years versus looking at what's right in
[SPEAKER_00]: front of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I also find that in, in the
client's mind, there's a thousand things
[SPEAKER_00]: run around in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes the thing that's not there
is what we're going to need to do to
[SPEAKER_00]: comply with the electrical, you know,
a year from now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's us doing those that are in the
fire or electrical or plumbing or whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: to ask those questions and say,
do we need to, do we need to beef it up
[SPEAKER_00]: for you from day one so that you can
expand when you're ready?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a, it is a moving target.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we saw from, from Dr. Callaway,
you know, short path distillation,
[SPEAKER_03]: you pump something through it and all of a
sudden your, your results come out at 75%
[SPEAKER_03]: total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the other 25%?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you know, it's not water,
you know, it's not a solvent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've burned all that stuff off.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's, what's the rest?
[SPEAKER_03]: And is that acceptable from a consumer
good standpoint?
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone's marking something on a box as
75% cannabinoids, that means there's 25%
[SPEAKER_03]: some sort of inert material in there that
you're not identifying, whether that's a
[SPEAKER_03]: psychoactive material or, or anything
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those things really haven't been
established yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see that target continuing to move as
more regulations come on board.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel we're in the boat of there's
probably a long road of regulation ahead
[SPEAKER_03]: of us and it's not going to shorten
anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're getting relief from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last question right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a great topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting a lot of discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: In this space right now, I think the
interesting thing is FDA's mandate is
[SPEAKER_02]: protect the public health, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that it's easy for them to
look at supplements or nutraceuticals and
[SPEAKER_02]: say they're lower risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: They take the same approach as we're
encouraging you to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take it from a risk based approach,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they say, hey, I can go take these
vitamin D pills over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the risk of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the risk of that producer being way
off target of what they put in there?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a, it's a low risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's how the FDA looks at
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if I'm making something that I'm
claiming has ability to treat pain relief
[SPEAKER_02]: or potentially has an addiction component
or potentially has a liver impact,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're going to see that as a much higher
risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's going to depend on the,
you can't really steer it from a PR
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing kind of strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your doctors are going to be steering that
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if you're trying to do and
reach the full potential of what you think
[SPEAKER_02]: this plant can actually do, I think it's
going to land solidly as a pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: compound is I think what's being spoken
about in the room next door.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would recommend just on that note,
talking or listening to Dr. Jeff Chen,
[SPEAKER_03]: who's speaking, he's speaking about the
war for cannabinoids, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: GW pharmaceutical put out epidemics.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's an analog THC out there right now
that's been on the market for more than 20
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are flags being planted in the
ground at the FDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as the FDA, by law approves a
drug, then it is no longer, you can't make
[SPEAKER_03]: it yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you can't go out and make
opioids yourself because it's under the
[SPEAKER_03]: FDA's purview as a drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now, CBD, CBG, CBC are all under
a drug under the FDA's regulatory approval
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is there so much talk about CBD and
them limiting the market for edibles and
[SPEAKER_03]: things like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that is already found.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those flags have already been planted in
the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, and Jeff will speak about this
probably more elegantly, but he'll talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about, you know, what do we do to prevent
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's prior science, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we can start developing that prior
science in an open source kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: methodology, then those patented flag in
the ground claims can't really keep
[SPEAKER_03]: rolling forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: But jokingly, embrace it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess that's kind of the joking answer,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead of trying to fight it,
I would encourage the industry to try to
[SPEAKER_02]: embrace it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's going to be your best.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been the biggest stumbling block.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason for this panel I've seen
over the last 12 years, and certainly
[SPEAKER_03]: after Prop 64 in 2017, we had 30,000
cannabis businesses in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Today we have less than 10,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because people looked at this new
regulatory system and like, these guys are
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to screw me.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is too arduous.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't keep my business afloat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't turn the corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is reality.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you want to keep your cannabis
company moving forward, this is kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: what we, like Andy said, we have to
embrace.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are competitive advantages.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's ultimately, this is
leverage for you to stand out beyond your
[SPEAKER_02]: competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: You embrace and you show that I can do
these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no problem with quality compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like then you're on the path to become,
whether or not you want to be or not,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll throw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Big Pharma is not a good name here,
but you know, if you want to be the next
[SPEAKER_02]: generation of Bayer or J&J, I mean,
you embrace that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to help you stand above
the rest.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really appreciate your help.
[SPEAKER_03]: Big round of applause.
[SPEAKER_03]: Woo!
