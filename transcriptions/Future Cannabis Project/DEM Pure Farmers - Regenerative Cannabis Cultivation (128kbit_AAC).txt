[SPEAKER_02]: Things like this are just really special
like all of these incredible people in the
[SPEAKER_02]: same place right now with this mindset of
like how do we do what's right for the
[SPEAKER_02]: earth?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thinking about our children thinking ahead
of time and thinking about the soil and
[SPEAKER_02]: sequestering carbon and producing healthy
food and Thank you guys for coming out and
[SPEAKER_02]: thank you Joshua for putting this on.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an amazing event.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is real community Thanks
[SPEAKER_04]: for those kind words Oh, yeah,
correct from open glow and I Was asked to
[SPEAKER_04]: put this panel together and what I did is
I looked at these farms I know some of
[SPEAKER_04]: them very well and I know some of them not
as but you know, that's how we build our
[SPEAKER_04]: relationships and I'm gonna kind of you
know, we're gonna all start sitting but
[SPEAKER_04]: now I feel like we're like doing Monday
night football or something Coming out
[SPEAKER_04]: like we're building the team, but it's
kind of what we're we are doing,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know We're looking a little more
organically.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're building a web and the stronger it
is with more people in it and and holding
[SPEAKER_04]: it all tight Could you do me a favor?
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you introduce your family your give
us your dad's name and your mom's name and
[SPEAKER_04]: your little sister's name or brother's
name?
[SPEAKER_11]: And Carla and Rose and my name's in yo
India
[SPEAKER_04]: can I ask you your farm name?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you know your farm name?
[SPEAKER_04]: flower days farm And where where is your
farm what do you know a county or what
[SPEAKER_04]: what town it's in And I'm gonna ask you
one last question I would like you to name
[SPEAKER_04]: all the animals you have on your farm from
the biggest to the smallest They could
[SPEAKER_04]: just be if you have a chicken or a cow
Okay, we don't need their names Okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: you probably have them all named.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't you nice?
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's just let us know what types of
animals you have Nice thank you for
[SPEAKER_04]: sharing So I want to get so both of you
can stay there I'll come between you guys
[SPEAKER_04]: so flower days 2017 Am I right 2017 they
won the regenerative Award at the Emerald
[SPEAKER_04]: Cup And you know that they've been
constantly inspiring us as a community
[SPEAKER_04]: with their posts and their methods and and
finally this year they put out a book and
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to hand you the mic and you guys
each talk about the inputs of your book
[SPEAKER_04]: and why you came up with it and where
Maybe the next one to come for them or
[SPEAKER_04]: would there be more and so forth?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well the book came to be because the goal
on our farm was really to answer the
[SPEAKER_09]: question of what is a sustainable farm and
Can a farm be a closed-loop?
[SPEAKER_09]: you know sustainable organism and setting
out to answer that question we We did
[SPEAKER_09]: answer that question and the answer is
yes, and so we compiled all of the recipes
[SPEAKER_09]: from Our homemade or home homegrown on the
farm ingredients how we generate our
[SPEAKER_09]: fertility to grow cannabis specifically
and So we wanted to share that with
[SPEAKER_09]: everybody because we've had a lot of
success with the quality that we've been
[SPEAKER_09]: producing and And we're producing
extremely clean You know effective
[SPEAKER_09]: medicine, so it's Great to see so much
interest in regenerative agriculture And I
[SPEAKER_09]: think there's a lot of interest in like
how how do I do this on the farm?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we decided to put put this recipe
to book together and share with you all so
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks part of how this book came about
was actually because of the movement of
[SPEAKER_00]: what is happening that is so much bigger
than any of us, but that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: something special and I think the time
we're living in and being Involved in what
[SPEAKER_00]: we do in the time we're living in is just
you know we're constantly Facing
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges every day, but it's it's
brought us together in so many ways as a
[SPEAKER_00]: community from Local all the way to global
and it's really amazing to see What a
[SPEAKER_00]: grassroots movement based on people
building resilience towards?
[SPEAKER_00]: basically Every everything that's it's
like this David and Goliath battle right
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of our natural resources are it's
Take there are so many things Reversing
[SPEAKER_00]: global warming climate change putting a
stop to it putting a future back in our
[SPEAKER_00]: children's hands I mean, there's so much
more to it than than just cannabis and we
[SPEAKER_00]: all know what this this plant teaches us
some really powerful lessons and One of
[SPEAKER_00]: the biggest ones is just How we are but
really one with nature we are part of it
[SPEAKER_00]: and how to actually live as a part of that
system that was the question we sought out
[SPEAKER_00]: to answer and We're still asking it daily,
but we've come to this point where Here we
[SPEAKER_00]: were all having this amazing discussion
together and we live in the middle of
[SPEAKER_00]: nowhere in Trinity County and we feel like
a really part of a really amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: community and we're not alone out there
and it was really nice to reach out to
[SPEAKER_00]: each other and To all thank you Craig.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of the people that really has
helped make the mycelium network
[SPEAKER_00]: connections happen That's what's happening
But
[SPEAKER_00]: really it's about you know, just all of us
not being afraid to just take that first
[SPEAKER_00]: step to start wherever that is and with
every step everything Exponentially
[SPEAKER_00]: evolves from there and so it just keeps
getting better and you just keep seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: more and more rewards of why it is Proven
time and time and time and time and time
[SPEAKER_00]: and time and time again that this really
works So I'm excited to hear everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: share a little bit about that and we're
just grateful that we were able to find a
[SPEAKER_00]: way thanks to compliant farms actually for
Calling us up and saying we want to order
[SPEAKER_00]: a whole bunch of books and we're gonna
send you them Put a check in the mail
[SPEAKER_00]: today and that's how we were able to
actually publish the book And so I just
[SPEAKER_00]: want to give a shout out to those guys for
helping me And
[SPEAKER_04]: they have the book for sale tonight is it
they sold them all of course How can they
[SPEAKER_09]: get more it's gonna be on our website
flower days farm calm This probably very
[SPEAKER_09]: soon and it's also going to be available
as an ebook at all of the major ebook
[SPEAKER_09]: publishers Fantastic thank you
[SPEAKER_04]: guys I Just want to jump into the stories
because I think as the stories unroll or
[SPEAKER_04]: roll out you're gonna get a feel for what
it is about being damp here and some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the Criteria needed to become damp here.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's you know six closed loops you need
to identify in your farm Oh You have to
[SPEAKER_04]: identify six closed loops on your farm You
need to identify rain catchment or your
[SPEAKER_04]: source of water You need to have a
pollinator garden education back to the
[SPEAKER_04]: community grow fruit food crops alongside
of your cannabis and Yeah, and and and I
[SPEAKER_04]: will stop there just because you're gonna
see something else that comes from all
[SPEAKER_04]: this and Let's go right into it because I
want to make sure we have enough time to
[SPEAKER_04]: get through everyone So we'll hand it off
to Patricia Is this thing on yeah sounds
[SPEAKER_06]: like it all right hey guys ladies in the
house Thank you for being here,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I hope to see more and more of us my
name is Patricia Vargas I am co-founder
[SPEAKER_06]: and co-owner of Sunroots farm as well as
co-founder of the village hearth
[SPEAKER_06]: cooperative in Kovalo and I'll talk a
little bit more about that in one moment
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi everybody my name is Forrest Gowder.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm co-owner of Sunroots farm with my
partner Patricia I've been cultivating on
[SPEAKER_10]: our property for about eight years now and
Being regenerative has always been a and
[SPEAKER_10]: being sustainable has always been a big
part of my growing up growing up on a
[SPEAKER_10]: Off-grid you know apple orchard You know
so in Kovalo so sustainability was always
[SPEAKER_10]: at the top like so it's big resonate
always been very resonating with me and so
[SPEAKER_10]: growing plants and cannabis it's amazing
and it just seems to getting better and
[SPEAKER_10]: better and Here we are now to share with
all you our experience so We have any
[SPEAKER_03]: pictures tonight Well the reason for this
that I want to show you guys is because
[SPEAKER_06]: you guys it's probably seen I've been here
since 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yesterday and like if anyone feels the
same way I do my brain is just like over
[SPEAKER_06]: Loaded with so much information,
but what you guys have been seeing a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of is photos of these indoor grows and I
Want to just I want there to be an example
[SPEAKER_06]: of what regenerative farms are for us And
I also first want to call out Kelly and
[SPEAKER_06]: Josh and Willow and sky who are the
Dempere founders a dragonfly earth
[SPEAKER_06]: medicine They're amazing I'm sure you've
all heard of them This is our farm in the
[SPEAKER_06]: background This is me talking about
pulling up water from the soil So Oh,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's what I'm telling for us We're
talking about tilling and that back right
[SPEAKER_06]: before right when I moved on to the farm
which is about five years ago for us had
[SPEAKER_06]: been tilling and But this guy I mean I I
literally saw this guy's Cannabis for the
[SPEAKER_06]: first time and I was like This guy knows
what he's doing because I've been smoking
[SPEAKER_06]: for a long time and I mean his his ganja
was really beautiful and it's always been
[SPEAKER_06]: growing in this method of Really huge
plants because of the genetics we've been
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding you guys have been breeding for a
long time his family has Strains that date
[SPEAKER_06]: back to the 70s in the same terroir same
Appalachian So of course, you know getting
[SPEAKER_06]: into that little part regenerative
agriculture really is about using what's
[SPEAKER_06]: local and Working with what you have and I
guess what I really wanted to talk about
[SPEAKER_06]: today was integrity in in cannabis and in
farming these days because we're At a
[SPEAKER_06]: point in our lives where we're there's
corporate cannabis here, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's right around the corner.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already come it's moving into our own
backyards and it's so scary because To
[SPEAKER_06]: grow on a smaller scale we do ten thousand
square feet for us that's huge and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: all outdoor everything's in the Ground and
it's all from seed if we make clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's from our own genetics and we make the
clones right in soil We've been trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: educate a little bit more about that since
people are going a lot towards that route,
[SPEAKER_06]: but the integrity of When you're working
on this farm and things come up such as
[SPEAKER_06]: you have a new pest that you've never seen
before Instead of making the decision to
[SPEAKER_06]: go and buy some chemical or buy something
from the store That is going to be a quick
[SPEAKER_06]: and easy fix the integral part of that
Which is what your commitment is as a
[SPEAKER_06]: dragonfly or earth medicine certified farm
is to to check everything that you're
[SPEAKER_06]: doing because every single decision that
we make from seed to soil and everything
[SPEAKER_06]: that I'm doing right now everything that
we do every single day is a decision and
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to commit ourselves to Really
knowing what are the impacts of that
[SPEAKER_06]: decision?
[SPEAKER_06]: Everything that we do this is like our
daily lives can be walked In a sacred way
[SPEAKER_06]: and we can continue on the path of this
regenerative beautiful uplifting place I
[SPEAKER_06]: mean look at how happy he is like smiling
these pot plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like my legs are so big It's just
when you create Beauty around you and when
[SPEAKER_06]: you walk that way when every single
decision in your life, and we're not all
[SPEAKER_06]: perfect I mean my god, we're human like
we're all gonna do things that maybe we
[SPEAKER_06]: shouldn't do but just integrity of Every
single day and I'm making an effort to do
[SPEAKER_06]: my best and to actually give back to the
earth because we're all taking from it so
[SPEAKER_06]: it's time that we start giving back a lot
of our methods are Basically building
[SPEAKER_06]: compost all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're just Constantly adding and it's
adding from our own local resources So
[SPEAKER_06]: we're not going out and trying to seek too
much outside of ourselves and outside of
[SPEAKER_06]: our own farms we know That the knowledge
is there to deal with obstacles that come
[SPEAKER_06]: up We understand that everything that we
need is on the farm already all the local
[SPEAKER_06]: medicinal plants everything That's growing
in abundance can help to be a part of your
[SPEAKER_06]: farm You can make beautiful compost teas
with the things that are growing right
[SPEAKER_06]: right by your feet Nothing's ever a weed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all medicinal It's all beautiful if
there's a lot of weeds growing in your
[SPEAKER_06]: garden you're concerned about it those
weeds are there for reason they're growing
[SPEAKER_06]: because they want to protect the soil
underneath from eroding or whatever
[SPEAKER_06]: purpose they serve everything has its
purpose and When we are working with
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis this amazing medicine that we all
love I'm just here to as a little
[SPEAKER_06]: reminder.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's saying integrity matters and our
decisions ripple out so Be what you want
[SPEAKER_06]: to see in the world we have the potential
to really change the wave of agriculture
[SPEAKER_06]: that is set in standard today,
especially in California And our Pacific
[SPEAKER_06]: Coast in the United States we have an we
have the opportunity to really Create a
[SPEAKER_06]: higher bar higher standard and doing
regenerative agriculture is a way to set
[SPEAKER_06]: that bar for a new wave of agriculture
that's actually not depleting our soils
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's actually giving back so that we
can work with The conditions that we have
[SPEAKER_06]: like wildfires and drought things that
that are real for us right now if we don't
[SPEAKER_06]: play a part in that in our daily Decisions
and everything that we do from seed to
[SPEAKER_06]: what you buy Yeah, I mean let's pay
attention to that I Want to add to two
[SPEAKER_04]: comments to what you were talking about
one was you were saying you make clones or
[SPEAKER_04]: cuttings What do you use to?
[SPEAKER_10]: root those so When we make cuttings we
have this soil blocker we just use put put
[SPEAKER_10]: soil in there and block it up and We make
our own rooting hormone at a willow tea
[SPEAKER_10]: and then aloe so we make the tea what once
we put the we dip our starts or our
[SPEAKER_10]: cuttings in the aloe first and then We
pour the willow tea over it and as they're
[SPEAKER_10]: Rooting we can add more willow tea just as
like when we're watering our plants so
[SPEAKER_10]: that You can Just just like making regular
tea so just cut it up in little pieces and
[SPEAKER_10]: put it in a pot and Bring it to a boil
don't let it boil too much or you could
[SPEAKER_10]: just do it without boiling and it'll take
a lot longer but Simmer it don't don't
[SPEAKER_04]: overcook it and I think I've seen you guys
having some set up in jars so you Are you
[SPEAKER_04]: making it making maybe like a gallon or
two of it and then putting it in pint jars
[SPEAKER_04]: or something?
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're ready to work, you don't
have to do all this prep You can prep on
[SPEAKER_04]: rainy days and then use it a week or two
Yeah, I mean you can use it whenever you
[SPEAKER_10]: want, but it's really easy to work We to
use we have a big willow tree right
[SPEAKER_10]: outside our house.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we have it readily available all the
time so we can by the time the the clones
[SPEAKER_10]: are ready to go out and be transplanted
they're actually like bigger than when you
[SPEAKER_10]: cut them and They're healthier and more
vibrant and they're already in their
[SPEAKER_10]: native soil that they're gonna be using
anyway, so Just which is awesome
[SPEAKER_07]: Fantastic.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys Just give you a quick
Description of our farm kind of what we do
[SPEAKER_07]: what what makes us special in this we're
also recipients of the regenerative farm
[SPEAKER_07]: award from 2017 Couple years ago but I
think what I can add to this discussion
[SPEAKER_07]: because because there's a lot of us
farmers up here and we all have great
[SPEAKER_07]: practices is is kind of my passion for for
growing food for people alongside medicine
[SPEAKER_07]: alongside our herb and and so we're a
production vegetable farm we grow food not
[SPEAKER_07]: only for ourselves and for our kitchen,
but we grow food for market and for our
[SPEAKER_07]: community and and the importance of that
has become a big part of Kind of I feel
[SPEAKER_07]: like my role in the world what what makes
me feel complete as a person and what
[SPEAKER_07]: makes me The only thing that that's made
sense in the world to sort of say so I
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of started down this path as a
homesteader getting back to the land
[SPEAKER_07]: getting away from the dysfunction of
society and and seeing if I could close
[SPEAKER_07]: all these loops seeing if I could have a
Sustainable farm and and grow what I
[SPEAKER_07]: needed there and create my own power and
be responsible for the things For my own
[SPEAKER_07]: life they'll build my own house those
kinds of things and and it's a really
[SPEAKER_07]: satisfying path and I love it and I loved
Growing cannabis to support that path and
[SPEAKER_07]: creating this great product for people,
but I also started feeling this
[SPEAKER_07]: responsibility to I can create this bubble
I can create this bubble of sustainability
[SPEAKER_07]: in the eddy of this world I can create
this river of culture and and but but this
[SPEAKER_07]: river is still here.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still everybody in town There's
still all all the elders who aren't going
[SPEAKER_07]: to get out in the garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's still the people with with a
little postage stamp of a yard and and the
[SPEAKER_07]: people without without the desire to do
the manual labor to grow food and those
[SPEAKER_07]: people need to be in that loop of
sustainability and And if those people
[SPEAKER_07]: don't have the option for good food grown
in a good way they're gonna get the next
[SPEAKER_07]: best option and and that's not going to be
as good for the planet as As what I feel
[SPEAKER_07]: like I was learning to do the skills.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was learning for myself Being able to
bring those out and share those and create
[SPEAKER_07]: an option for our community where they can
buy food That's grown with no till that's
[SPEAKER_07]: grown with a lot of closed-loop techniques
and Therefore is also incredibly
[SPEAKER_07]: nutritious and delicious and all of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So So for me that was like The next step
for me in this whole process is kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: the Dharma that my my responsibility not
only to my my own geeking out on all this
[SPEAKER_07]: stuff, but my responsibility to my world
to my to my legacy in the future and in
[SPEAKER_07]: the past in in this piece is like If we're
gaining skills as farmers, I think it is
[SPEAKER_07]: an amazing gift to give cannabis to the
world I think it's an amazing gift to grow
[SPEAKER_07]: this great medicine and But I've never
been a big fan of monocropping I've been
[SPEAKER_07]: never been a big fan of like, you know You
can have a diverse cannabis farm and you
[SPEAKER_07]: look at above and it if it's still 90% of
your canopy is cannabis it's a monocropped
[SPEAKER_07]: farm and and I just Want all of this skill
and all of this thought that we're all
[SPEAKER_07]: putting into this To share on this broader
scale because there's lots of people that
[SPEAKER_07]: don't even smoke cannabis But man,
they they eat food and that's medicine in
[SPEAKER_07]: the same way
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what we've been working on a lot on
our farm is how these things integrate how
[SPEAKER_07]: production food farming systems,
which is You know with production food
[SPEAKER_07]: farming if you're gonna make it work and
not lose money but actually say break even
[SPEAKER_07]: or or maybe even Make a little bit of
money for your time doing it It's it's a
[SPEAKER_07]: different kind of model than doing a
garden and it's about efficiency and
[SPEAKER_07]: planning and and kind of the combination
of efficiency and planning and and doing
[SPEAKER_07]: things according to Your morals and
worldview as well But what we've been
[SPEAKER_07]: really looking into is is how the cannabis
works with those kinds of systems how to
[SPEAKER_07]: integrate it so you can get Cannabis and
food crops out of the same area so the the
[SPEAKER_07]: food crops and the systems you use for the
food crops can support the cannabis and
[SPEAKER_07]: how the lessons that that market gardeners
and And food farmers have been learning
[SPEAKER_07]: for years, which is you don't make much
money off of a head of lettuce So if you
[SPEAKER_07]: want to do it Right, you have to be
efficient You have to be thoughtful and
[SPEAKER_07]: you have to do these closed-loop things
because you're not going to the store to
[SPEAKER_07]: buy a $50 a gallon jug of nutrients To
grow arugula.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not it's not it's not what you do so
these lessons that The small-scale market
[SPEAKER_07]: gardeners have been working on for for
Some decades now since the organic
[SPEAKER_07]: movement are really applicable to us in
the in the cannabis community and vice
[SPEAKER_07]: versa so that that's been the focus of our
farm is working with that and I invite you
[SPEAKER_07]: to check us out on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_07]: See what we do and Let's
[SPEAKER_04]: let's go over to Kelly now
[SPEAKER_04]: and Kelly let's uh Let's have you Let's
have you talk about how last year's
[SPEAKER_04]: regenerative Conference in Redway affected
you guys and and what you did with some
[SPEAKER_04]: knowledge again and some of the
inspiration, okay?
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Kelly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm with Hard Rock Mountain farm We're out
in Potter Valley Last year we came here
[SPEAKER_05]: and we regenerate cannabis It's kind of
like a rabbit hole and we were like
[SPEAKER_05]: looking down it for a long time And then
after we came and we were exposed to all
[SPEAKER_05]: these wonderful ideas and seeing all these
wonderful people I'm gonna get to sit next
[SPEAKER_05]: to you now, which is like really inspiring
We took a lot of initiative after and the
[SPEAKER_05]: things that we learned like we went and
put in 220 feet of hugelkultur We got all
[SPEAKER_05]: of our water on solar We started making
teas we did We're moving towards no till
[SPEAKER_05]: still and that's another thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like we learned that it's okay that
it's a process and that we get to all move
[SPEAKER_05]: towards that and work towards that like
together and Just coming to all these
[SPEAKER_05]: things and learning about everything and
connecting with people has been really
[SPEAKER_05]: helpful to us We also learned that
regenerative like is like a lifestyle and
[SPEAKER_05]: it can be like the things that you eat and
put into your body or even like we were We
[SPEAKER_05]: made it out of the fires this year by the
skin of our teeth And so now we're gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: work on improving the health of the forest
around us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not a tinderbox We're still
dialing everything in and we're diving and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like we're still falling down that
rabbit hole and still seeing so much more
[SPEAKER_05]: that we can improve on and it's a
never-ending journey that We're really
[SPEAKER_04]: happy to be on So what you're in Potter
Valley, is that right?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you having influence on your
neighbors or other folks in your road or
[SPEAKER_04]: community members?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, absolutely So we're going through
and we're talking to all the other
[SPEAKER_05]: growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know whether or not they're Legal or
not and we're getting them to dump their
[SPEAKER_05]: smart pots.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're introducing companion planting to
them While are convincing them to grow
[SPEAKER_05]: more food for themselves Just like all the
small things to improve Yeah, just like
[SPEAKER_05]: our world around us because it's a
reflection of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep One thing he's right there really
resonated with me and that was whether
[SPEAKER_04]: they were in the regulated market or not
and and that's a choice that your
[SPEAKER_04]: neighbors are making or not making and
That's one, you know That choice doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: bother me either way But can we still help
them even if they're in the unregulated
[SPEAKER_04]: market to still become regenerative?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well that helps the overall Plan that we
have and to better the earth and to help
[SPEAKER_04]: our environment heal So we don't we don't
want to be judgmental on a neighbor if
[SPEAKER_04]: they're choosing to go a different route
But let's just help them and show them
[SPEAKER_04]: that there's a better way that they can
actually run their farm whether it's
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever market they choose to be in so
thank you Kelly Next
[SPEAKER_08]: we'll run with Cyril from water dog farm
So Carla mentioned something earlier and I
[SPEAKER_08]: just kind of want to piggyback it and and
it's like to me permaculture is kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: what like really brought this for me and
and I saw a quote today a friend posted
[SPEAKER_08]: and it was Permaculture is a revolution
disguised as a garden party So if you can
[SPEAKER_08]: look at everything we're doing as a
revolution against the standard Model and
[SPEAKER_08]: the way big ag is and like the influence
regenerative is having on ag is pretty
[SPEAKER_08]: incredible so one of the things I think
would be cool for you guys to walk away
[SPEAKER_08]: with is like some things to go home with
and One of the things that we've realized
[SPEAKER_08]: on our farm is like diversity is really
the key and so I would suggest Seeking out
[SPEAKER_08]: all the plants you can find that have pink
flowers yellow flowers white flowers red
[SPEAKER_08]: flowers purple flowers blue flowers small
flowers big flowers And plant them in your
[SPEAKER_08]: ecosystem and and to me like them That's
gonna bring in like after hearing the bug
[SPEAKER_08]: lady talking like that's gonna bring in
that ecosystem to keep all those bugs
[SPEAKER_08]: happy And you know one of the things I
like to talk about is just context and
[SPEAKER_08]: like all of us have a slightly different
context that we're gonna come to this
[SPEAKER_08]: table with and so if you can find what
your context is and see how these tools in
[SPEAKER_08]: the tool belt can work for you on your
farm because for some people who go
[SPEAKER_08]: culture just isn't gonna work,
so don't even think about it or Maybe
[SPEAKER_08]: that's all you should think about and so
really finding What's the tools that
[SPEAKER_08]: you're gonna use and and take advantage of
so you know on our farm?
[SPEAKER_08]: We have animals we have horses sheeps
chickens Not really like composting my dog
[SPEAKER_08]: Crap, but I have a pile of it that okay,
cool kashi.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's pukashi kashi.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, cool And that's the other thing is
like I'm constantly learning I came here
[SPEAKER_08]: and I learned a little bit about the
Korean natural farming today and just
[SPEAKER_08]: constantly trying to learn more But so we
incorporate a lot of compost and you know
[SPEAKER_08]: the horse manure gets fed to the chickens
and the chickens then it goes to the worms
[SPEAKER_08]: and this is like part of the closing loop
systems that that we're talking about and
[SPEAKER_08]: You know one of the things that we
realized is with companion planting.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do a lot of experimenting For fun,
and I'm obsessed with it and so we've
[SPEAKER_08]: gotten There's a difference between
companion planting and competition
[SPEAKER_08]: planting And so it's really important to
if you are gonna start companion planting
[SPEAKER_08]: to make sure you're not Competing with
your cash crop and like for most of us the
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis is our cash crop So if you're
experimenting on a large scale just make
[SPEAKER_08]: sure that if it fails You're not out of
business because like we need all of us to
[SPEAKER_08]: be growing the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's gonna change these people's minds So
when they smoke our weed, they're gonna
[SPEAKER_08]: start thinking oh man This is amazing and
you know big ag's really looking at this
[SPEAKER_08]: and and so it's the ripple effect They're
gonna be big so one of the things that
[SPEAKER_08]: we've realized and this is kind of a cool
thing you guys can take home and in
[SPEAKER_08]: practice is companion planting with high
terpene plants and if you understand like
[SPEAKER_08]: almost all plants have terpenes and so if
you're growing high terpene rich plants
[SPEAKER_08]: your lemon balms your lavenders your
rosemary's You know yarrow is a great
[SPEAKER_08]: companion plant to have and and in the the
flower days book They've got a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: recipes that that are very easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I definitely suggest everyone to buy
that book just To have some some things to
[SPEAKER_08]: do but we've noticed that so terpenes they
communicate In the air whereas the roots
[SPEAKER_08]: that you know, everything that's happening
in the roots is communicating in the soil
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you have high terpene plants in your
ecosystem, they're gonna be communicating
[SPEAKER_08]: with your cannabis and you're gonna
actually get higher profiles So we we have
[SPEAKER_08]: we we do planting with high terpene plants
near our cannabis And then we're also
[SPEAKER_08]: feeding those plants to the cannabis and
we're seeing really amazing results with
[SPEAKER_08]: fermenting specific Crops you can do lemon
balm You know, we did a side-by-side
[SPEAKER_08]: experiment with lavender to two clones in
the lavender the plant that got the
[SPEAKER_08]: lavender Ferment had a little off the
charts compared the plant that didn't so,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, we did that this year and I made
a mistake and when I was curing my weed
[SPEAKER_08]: because I wanted to do the experiment The
plants are communicating in the soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're communicating Through the
terpenes, but then I also wanted to do it
[SPEAKER_08]: one step further and cure the weed with
these high terpene plants But I didn't do
[SPEAKER_08]: a side to side by side.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it didn't really work because it wasn't
very scientific but So I'm just a really
[SPEAKER_08]: big fan of companion planting and making
sure you're not competing And there's just
[SPEAKER_08]: there's a lot of closed loops that we can
all do that Just makes us not spend as
[SPEAKER_08]: much money growing our weed because the
margins just aren't there and a lot of
[SPEAKER_08]: these closed loops really help Lessen what
we have To pay so it I'll be I'll be quick
[SPEAKER_08]: because I'm sure you guys have a lot of
questions and we can get through the panel
[SPEAKER_08]: and start answering like specific things
that you guys can all start doing and and
[SPEAKER_08]: really like don't be overwhelmed because
Just start doing one thing and two things
[SPEAKER_08]: and start closing as many loops as you can
and you probably already are without even
[SPEAKER_08]: knowing it and if you live in the woods
You have an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's right for the harvesting if you do
it, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's all about context, you know,
don't be overwhelmed because what he's
[SPEAKER_08]: doing is different than what I'm doing and
we're all slightly different and you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm a one-man army and Someone else might
have five employees.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're gonna be attacking different
things differently So that's kind of all I
[SPEAKER_08]: want to say and I'd love to answer
questions when people have them I grew up
[SPEAKER_01]: in southern Humboldt and I'm gonna go back
a little bit before the guild like imagine
[SPEAKER_01]: We all move to a community with no money
And we all didn't have to work very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just met at the river every day and
swam And like money was money wasn't a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem We had we had money you could sell
a one pound for $5,000 You could grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it was an amazing childhood in
southern Humboldt And then it turned dark
[SPEAKER_01]: with Reagan and all that but those those
few years kind of defined a lot of our
[SPEAKER_01]: lives like it's hard to go back to that
and When regenerative farming and
[SPEAKER_01]: permaculture started really gaining
knowledge and becoming an advanced study
[SPEAKER_01]: It's I latched on to that because of the
patterns were similar and like pursuing
[SPEAKER_01]: money and economics Isn't really the goal
because we're just trying to get back to
[SPEAKER_01]: not worrying about money and it's the
pattern right like In regenerative
[SPEAKER_01]: economics In regenerative farming,
you're trying to build mycelium.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to build networks.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're trying to build Connections and so
only through diversity and connections do
[SPEAKER_01]: we actually get to quality and it's the
same with economics like if you channel
[SPEAKER_01]: all the money into an investment bank or
if you channel all your investment out of
[SPEAKER_01]: a community then you're left with a
dwindled industry that doesn't really have
[SPEAKER_01]: life so Carrie Reynolds and I realized
that this community like has been getting
[SPEAKER_01]: getting the life sucked out of a lot of
the farming and It's like innovation is
[SPEAKER_01]: born out of necessity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the the fact that this small scale like
the county came and you know Set up 10,000
[SPEAKER_01]: square feet in Mendo and and limited
acreages here and humble and we're like
[SPEAKER_01]: really Reduced down to small scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time now we're learning
that being small scale doesn't limit our
[SPEAKER_01]: production or Innovation like we can John
Jevons is renowned worldwide for growing
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing amounts of food and the small
acreage and he's from here in Willets,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the innovation that we can create in
doing this regenerative Agriculture in
[SPEAKER_01]: these confined spaces is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daniel can feed 40 families from his one
farm
[SPEAKER_01]: How many people can you get stoned from
that one farm And when the county Looked
[SPEAKER_01]: at us and said no cannabis shouldn't be
grown in the forest or in the hills Like
[SPEAKER_01]: we're building soil in forest landscapes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we're we're becoming an
agroforestry region.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we invented a farm system Like
because we had people we have people from
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the world living on our farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is that possible?
[SPEAKER_01]: we have We have we donate our own money to
our nonprofits we we're the first homes
[SPEAKER_01]: that homesteaders were Salvaging old
growth like deciduous mulch to grow their
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plants born out of necessity
because they didn't have money But now we
[SPEAKER_01]: realize that that's the same methods that
grow the best Cannabis that IMOs of old
[SPEAKER_01]: growth and I'm not saying go out and
scrape old growth forest but that's you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, that's kind of what defined Humboldt
County pot is that like those that first
[SPEAKER_01]: wave of Innovation and now we're in the
same thing like we're getting attacked by
[SPEAKER_01]: Investment huge investment banks and the
legalization process has been the
[SPEAKER_01]: nightmare It's not it's you know,
some of the the rules make sense,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they also Come at it in a political
manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not really gaining I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been difficult, but this movement is
creating a rapid innovation that I think
[SPEAKER_01]: Has the possibility to really change the
world like you're saying so We started the
[SPEAKER_01]: guild to really bring this knowledge to
our community So if you guys want to
[SPEAKER_01]: present to our community and be a part of
building that network in this region We're
[SPEAKER_01]: starting the Soham guild and I know
there's other Read communities up and down
[SPEAKER_01]: the North Coast that are like really
networking and getting that knowledge to
[SPEAKER_01]: raise the small farm level up so
[SPEAKER_08]: The one of the thing that's missing in a
lot of businesses is that kind of equity
[SPEAKER_08]: Share with your employees or your partners
that you're working with and and there's a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of standard model CEO at the top
making all the money the guy down there is
[SPEAKER_08]: making nothing and he's not really
invested in the company and so You know,
[SPEAKER_08]: this is also a good opportunity for young
farms to actually start changing that and
[SPEAKER_08]: giving your employees a different share
and they can still get a paycheck,
[SPEAKER_08]: but then they're also an equity owner and
you know, it actually took me a really
[SPEAKER_08]: long time to kind of like Come around to
that because I was always like well if I'm
[SPEAKER_08]: the guy with the money and I got the land
and I'm doing all the work and I have one
[SPEAKER_08]: employee why would I give him equity and I
realized actually that's really nice for
[SPEAKER_08]: them and It literally took me years to get
to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think that's one thing that that is
missing in the this model is the equity
[SPEAKER_08]: shares and that's something that you know,
each person can kind of Accept,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, I Was just gonna add to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like there's standards that were
part of this black market industry that we
[SPEAKER_01]: should carry over that we should not Lose
some of the beautiful parts of the black
[SPEAKER_01]: market Free people's market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah the old dirt road You know,
it was people to people networking You
[SPEAKER_01]: knew a guy that lived in the city that
could bring it to your friend who you know
[SPEAKER_01]: You follow the chain and everybody made a
little bit of money Like that was sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could still do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't all have to go through some
major business it could go through a
[SPEAKER_01]: network of Value-based businesses,
you know, what are your values?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they have integrity with my values?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's form a Mycelium Network Rio's
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioning innovation and where that comes
from then you're saying like that
[SPEAKER_02]: Necessity is part of that and we are in a
point where it is very necessary for us to
[SPEAKER_02]: Make this paradigm shift and regenerative
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's gonna the only thing the
really that can possibly work against
[SPEAKER_02]: global warming against too much co2 in the
air too Much greenhouse gases.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's putting it back in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's these processes of putting it back in
the soil So like everyone they hear that's
[SPEAKER_02]: making soil like yeah big round of
applause for making soil for putting that
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon in the earth So we can grow Food so
we can grow medicine and be a part of
[SPEAKER_02]: healing this planet part of innovation
though is it comes from this these this
[SPEAKER_02]: network that's coming together and
everyone's different viewpoints and a
[SPEAKER_02]: serial was talking about like I mean going
to your fire was I learned so much and
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone's farm like Daniel's was insane
like just so much because They're there
[SPEAKER_02]: paying attention to their land intently
day after day Studying the little bugs
[SPEAKER_02]: that are going around taking some amazing
photos to like Cyril is an incredible
[SPEAKER_02]: photographer and he's Pull up one of these
That's really pretty he knows he
[SPEAKER_02]: understands light and you can tell that
he's paying attention to things And yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: Well Observations a big deal that's
getting a lot done.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Daniel and Taylor's but this is a
Breslin forest farms and it's just such a
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful farm so much food produced and
just an incredibly beautiful family making
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible food and medicine and It's just
been such a privilege to be able to go to
[SPEAKER_02]: these farms and learn the different
techniques that they have figured out over
[SPEAKER_02]: these years Daniel has very like amazing
and thoughtful tilling processes that
[SPEAKER_02]: actually are Like Harvard like end up
leading to really amazing microbial life
[SPEAKER_02]: in fact your mycorrhizal test like from
last year was showing that it had a higher
[SPEAKER_02]: count than the store-bought mycorrhizal
products and but through really thoughtful
[SPEAKER_02]: cover crop and polyculture and tilling and
Casey as also adapts some of these The
[SPEAKER_02]: hero right is the tiller.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah But so just like learning new
innovations from each farm back in the I
[SPEAKER_02]: Mean the turn of the century farm sharing
was was normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it wasn't until the world wars and
the Harvard Bosch process and and chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer being able to be made from
taking that nitrogen from the air and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, the only thing that can do that
normally is the bacteria in the soil the
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizobium and like legumes but and
lightning can do that as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we invent this process got invented
that basically pressurizes it so much and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're able to take that end to that has a
really powerful triple bond the hardest
[SPEAKER_02]: thing to like break apart and Turn it into
plant usable nitrogen When that happened
[SPEAKER_02]: and all of a sudden like they started
putting that out everywhere now,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's something that you own you own
fertility There was only so much nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's so much people that could be
supported by that and it was about 1
[SPEAKER_02]: billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when this got Invented then we could
rise to 7.5 or whatever billion we are
[SPEAKER_02]: now, which is really rough on the earth
and it's a total out of process nitrogen
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle, it's way too much of it and we're
beyond carrying capacity and so that idea
[SPEAKER_02]: that like fertility could be owned and you
could sell these processes of
[SPEAKER_02]: industrialized agriculture that you just
spray and you'd feed and you'd kill and
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd make a model crop and you just get
rid of all the diversity and It was
[SPEAKER_02]: something that could be owned and sold and
you know makes dollars and cents and and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's very linear and and it's straight to
waste innovation stopped then because it
[SPEAKER_02]: was basically that was tried it wasn't
good for the companies and So this rebirth
[SPEAKER_02]: right now where we share as much
information as possible is really
[SPEAKER_02]: important the innovations that were
happening in the 40s on farms were Amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: and then it just stopped and then it's
just the same crap But like us cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: growers we we are very inventive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean we went through Prohibition of 80
years and like I think we were winning I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know if this is great right now,
but like we were doing pretty good because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a Yeah, okay great But it's a lot of
amazing inventful thoughtful creative
[SPEAKER_02]: people that we're working in this
environment and we we have this incredible
[SPEAKER_02]: potential right now Taking that energy
that we all have that love that we have
[SPEAKER_02]: with cannabis and the way that it connects
us with nature and then now the way that
[SPEAKER_02]: it connects Us with each other like we've
always I think everyone here understands
[SPEAKER_02]: that we've been brought together by
cannabis like in so many ways You know
[SPEAKER_02]: sharing a joint and I mean I love cannabis
so much and everything it's done for me
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wouldn't have met all these people
without this connection that's wanting to
[SPEAKER_02]: share this love for the earth So I'm
thankful for the plant I'm thankful for
[SPEAKER_02]: this community and I'm so pleased to be
able to do this award and go to Some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the best farms I've ever been to and the
idea that the Cyrils are runner-up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit Like that's amazing because your
farm is incredible like like like in any
[SPEAKER_02]: like when I thought of this idea Years ago
the idea of even going to finding a farm
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately like you're like would be like
cool That's it like and and now to see all
[SPEAKER_02]: of these farms and all these inventive
processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's it's so cool Yeah, it's every
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going up and like last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was an amazing event and 135 people or
something can fit in the octagon it was
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's about
[SPEAKER_04]: As it was moving I had to communicate with
someone in town and I said hey man,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's like woodstock can't fight it We just
got to keep growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's this regenerative movement that you
know Forbes is claiming it's in the top
[SPEAKER_04]: five There's cannabis and the regenerative
agriculture and we're ground center right
[SPEAKER_02]: here like Yeah So let's keep that like
momentum moving let's connect with each
[SPEAKER_02]: other Let's learn from every farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's not think that we know everything
because every time you connect with
[SPEAKER_02]: another smart individual They're gonna
have another idea about something another
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's take all those perspectives in
because that's powerful and Let's share
[SPEAKER_02]: the innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean the the main tool of it is us
sharing as a community So thank you
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone for being here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's let's take this movement as far as
we can As far as the bureaucracy with with
[SPEAKER_07]: the food production, it's actually pretty
straightforward being a certified producer
[SPEAKER_07]: and unlike cannabis the the bureaucracy
with food production is kind of a like
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, here's your slip of paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's they're they're not they're not
chasing you down and checking on you in
[SPEAKER_07]: the same way No, I don't think anybody in
Humboldt County ever got Ag exempt permit
[SPEAKER_07]: for a greenhouse on their small farm
before the cannabis thing came along Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: we do I was asking if he does fertility
testing We about every third year we test
[SPEAKER_07]: our soil and just kind of see what What
it's been up to and and which direction
[SPEAKER_07]: it's going Kind of informs us how to make
our compost and if we need to amend adjust
[SPEAKER_07]: pH and stuff like that but You know one
thing I wanted to get back to for a second
[SPEAKER_07]: because I had this thought well while
Jesse was talking and talking about about
[SPEAKER_07]: the climate and and about nitrogen
fertilizer and and I was Just quantifying
[SPEAKER_07]: it recently for another talk I was doing
in the the top soil on this planet holds
[SPEAKER_07]: three times as much carbon as the
atmosphere as the entire atmosphere does
[SPEAKER_07]: so when you think about what we're doing
and why we're doing it industrial
[SPEAKER_07]: agriculture is is Making nitrogen
fertilizer adding carbon to the atmosphere
[SPEAKER_07]: that way through fossil fuel adding
nitrogen to the soil So that it burns up
[SPEAKER_07]: the carbon in the soil and adds that to
the atmosphere in addition so the soil on
[SPEAKER_07]: this planet has the ability to sequester
all the carbon we need it to and and if
[SPEAKER_07]: our agriculture is doing the opposite it's
a huge miss opportunity and and I think at
[SPEAKER_07]: this point anything we do with our With
our productive lives at this point that we
[SPEAKER_07]: can obviously we're all going to be
driving cars We're going to be doing this
[SPEAKER_07]: and that but if you're doing agriculture
anyway do it in a way that puts carbon in
[SPEAKER_07]: the soil
[SPEAKER_08]: And plant more plants Just go buy plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody should be planting plants
perennials.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need perennial calories.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need perennials everywhere There used
to be so much perennials.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean there's 33 million acres of oaks in
California and how many of those acres are
[SPEAKER_02]: getting harvested Just saying it's food
plants are solar-powered carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: sequestering machines like We're talking
about building carbon scrubbers and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like dude like yeah, how about
forests and grassland and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: well integrated natural systems and
regenerative agriculture Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: we need to be putting it in the ground and
there's recent math done that Potentially
[SPEAKER_02]: shows that if 10% of our ag lands convert
over we will sequester more than what we
[SPEAKER_07]: release That's a doable thing go back To
your question about cannabis and food
[SPEAKER_07]: actually one of the biggest regulatory
burdens with cannabis and food is that I
[SPEAKER_07]: want to grow my cannabis like I grow my
food and rotate my crop through my farm
[SPEAKER_07]: and that's nearly impossible because
they're not treating cannabis like
[SPEAKER_07]: agriculture for the state I would have to
redraw and resubmit a map and a different
[SPEAKER_07]: site plan each flippin year to move my
cannabis through my farm
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's hard when the inspector comes
they want a little box around it they can
[SPEAKER_07]: measure and they want it to be in the GPS
points that On the site that you had it on
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other questions out there
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go right down and name six across
the board that you Either resonate with or
[SPEAKER_04]: that you find would be easy for someone to
identify on their farm already There's
[SPEAKER_07]: there's so much I mean like okay you grow
your own food you eat it you use that
[SPEAKER_07]: energy to work soil to grow your own food
to eat it to use your energy to Where do
[SPEAKER_08]: you live You can make compost you can make
worms you can harvest water you can grow
[SPEAKER_08]: things you can teach people things Yeah
Using the stock And the rest of the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: as return nutrients Regenerative power
solar and wind you know that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: regenerative system if you can localize
that I have to argue that that is almost
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainable system Because the only actual
solar power that is regenerative is
[SPEAKER_02]: plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it because That's that's you know,
you know, it doesn't take power.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to mine anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no Solar cells, there's no
batteries There's no like silicon and
[SPEAKER_02]: lithium being mined and there's huge
issues with that and everything being like
[SPEAKER_02]: shipped everywhere It's way better than
the alternative, but I just yeah plants
[SPEAKER_02]: are the only Regenerative solar powered
thing for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So cover cropping and mulching is big for
me and also and and and care for the wild
[SPEAKER_02]: lands thinking about Promoting native
diversity and taking care of your forests
[SPEAKER_10]: and watersheds Well said We have alpacas
on our farm and they work wonders with
[SPEAKER_10]: fertile fertility and fire suppression and
They're really easy animals to handle So I
[SPEAKER_10]: recommend having alpacas Oh, yeah,
yeah, we have incorporated their manure
[SPEAKER_10]: into our biodynamic Compost piles now and
spread their manure out through our whole
[SPEAKER_10]: garden.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we've had them over a year now and Last
year was amazing Yeah with The Amount of
[SPEAKER_10]: Beautiful ganja that we produce so yeah Oh
my god, it was such a treat walking onto
[SPEAKER_02]: their land you saw the videos well,
yeah, maybe we'll play it with the audio
[SPEAKER_02]: here to second but and just like I came to
the front yard and I was already so stoked
[SPEAKER_02]: because like you were saying like,
you know every plant is but and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: like Oh, this is kind of how I do my card
where I don't do anything and just like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's about the soil Look how cool this is
and all these weird things that are
[SPEAKER_02]: growing and like and it's a total mess But
there's so much in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I was immediately Just really happy
with that, you know the messy like natural
[SPEAKER_02]: garden in the front that had incredible
soil and then we walk out back and just
[SPEAKER_02]: like holy crap look at these monsters like
we're just like just towering beautiful
[SPEAKER_02]: happy plants that are grown in the soil
now not tilled and biodynamic compost
[SPEAKER_02]: being made with their closed-loop systems
with their animals and And and they're in
[SPEAKER_02]: Kovala to where there's a biodynamic
community So it's actually preps that are
[SPEAKER_02]: made in that area And the information
sharing that happens with the biodynamic
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's really amazing and going to
Radical herbs was incredible too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those guys practice biodynamics and
cannabis probably better than anyone I've
[SPEAKER_02]: ever seen is like it's amazing the amount
of food and they're one of the winners of
[SPEAKER_02]: the award this year, too And we'll play
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll play their movie.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll play there's actually next when we
will yeah, and yeah, she's having a
[SPEAKER_02]: getting close to having a child too so
that's why they're not here right now,
[SPEAKER_02]: but Amazing farms and and the genetics it
actually like I was really impressed with
[SPEAKER_02]: your energy immediately like just having
the the design the care for the earth and
[SPEAKER_02]: the passion and it you know resonates and
you put ripples out and the moment I met
[SPEAKER_02]: you I was like, oh, yeah your plant to
like I I identify with plant people and
[SPEAKER_02]: and I immediately just felt his energy and
was like yes plants like this person a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know cannabis loves you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so clear and you love it ever And the
genetics like growing up with it like they
[SPEAKER_02]: was breathing since he was a child and
paying attention since he's a child and
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a really amazing thing going
on with the genetics in their community in
[SPEAKER_02]: Kovala to like the job goo and the share
we went to all these different farms and
[SPEAKER_02]: the work that he's done with his brothers
are all over the place and Tomorrow we're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna have a very special day of having
some of the best breeders in the world
[SPEAKER_02]: like all here and getting to hear from
them and Like yeah, so that community work
[SPEAKER_02]: of sharing genetics of talking about what
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just so powerful That's one of our
biggest tools and we can't lose that
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's That's diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what cannabis wants us to be doing
and you know monocropping just og for you
[SPEAKER_08]: know, those days are over so hooray To
answer her question you could do if you do
[SPEAKER_08]: breeding that's a closed loop if you save
seeds That's a closed loop if you have
[SPEAKER_08]: aloe for your clones.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a closed loop If you have an
orchard, that's a closed loop.
[SPEAKER_08]: So You know the concept of a closed loop
is like it stays here and it goes in a
[SPEAKER_08]: circle and so we have to like break that
every now and then and It's okay to do
[SPEAKER_08]: that because that's how you get your weed
out into the world is breaking that loop.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's it's That's like we use these
terms and it's very loose and just kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: fluid So those are some easy closed loops
that pretty much anyone could do if you
[SPEAKER_08]: have an oak tree in your yard You can
collect the the leaves and you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's there's so many things you can do so
We're gonna we're gonna have Patricia
[SPEAKER_06]: identify some more here So those of you
who like to write things down because I
[SPEAKER_06]: would be I was taking notes all weekend
I'm gonna list off so closed loop systems
[SPEAKER_06]: incorporating what's On your farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: So use what you have and be be
resourceful.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Listen to the plants take Step two.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, so we got closed loop systems We're
also talking about water conservation in
[SPEAKER_06]: any way or form that works in your local
area know what your watersheds are connect
[SPEAKER_06]: with your Water that's near you know
what's going on Brings me to three local
[SPEAKER_06]: community support.
[SPEAKER_06]: So every drop of money I've ever made in
cannabis Has gone back to my community the
[SPEAKER_06]: village hearth cooperative, which I've
talked about is it's a nonprofit Cafe and
[SPEAKER_06]: apothecary and art supporter that I'm just
giving money back to my community because
[SPEAKER_06]: investing in your local area Investing in
your not just your local land not just
[SPEAKER_06]: with your family But like moving on bit to
bigger community get to know those people
[SPEAKER_06]: around you because that is That's your
bigger family and we're building up
[SPEAKER_06]: resilience together when we come together
So get on the same page another one is So
[SPEAKER_02]: many I have a really cool one actually
when you mentioned the heart When we went
[SPEAKER_02]: to radical herbs one of the things that
they're doing is They raise meat birds and
[SPEAKER_02]: we were eating those Those birds in the
food that we had there and that was really
[SPEAKER_02]: really cool Like oh well these came from
the farm that we were just at well as
[SPEAKER_02]: they're raising these meat birds they're
moving them down the Line and that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: fertility and they move it before they do
too much disturbance but all these these
[SPEAKER_02]: chickens are are pooping and putting
fertility right back in an area that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're gonna grow cannabis and I think
that's like amazing like reading the bird
[SPEAKER_02]: but like was was grown that way and They
also take that bone meal and process it in
[SPEAKER_02]: and turn it into nutrition using Yeah,
perhaps that actually stuff you could
[SPEAKER_02]: probably learn from The flower days book
as well I thought that was a really cool
[SPEAKER_02]: closed-loop system though that we're
eating it I Was gonna add one more thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's devices you can buy if people are
familiar with flow forms It structures the
[SPEAKER_08]: water before you use it You can actually
buy inline flow forms that structures the
[SPEAKER_08]: water and your water usage goes down
Unbelievable and on our farm we invested
[SPEAKER_08]: about $2,000 and we had these systems put
in and It's absolutely stunning how much
[SPEAKER_08]: less water you need.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if anyone's water poverty Or just has
doesn't have that much water or wants to
[SPEAKER_08]: conserve water It's really worth looking
at these devices Because it's not you
[SPEAKER_08]: know, it's not that much money to spend to
save, you know I could pretty much say 50%
[SPEAKER_08]: less water and I'd be pretty confident
with that and For the first couple weeks I
[SPEAKER_08]: was over watering and I called the owner
of the company and I said What's going on
[SPEAKER_08]: here?
[SPEAKER_08]: He says stop watering So I was going about
once a week.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would water My big plants in the heat of
summer in Mendocino for some context Also,
[SPEAKER_02]: your flowers are crazy tasty to like the
terpenes that come out of that the like
[SPEAKER_02]: the less water the Herbs that you're
growing the the ferments that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: making with them like really nice turkey
flowers and we Learn that if you drought
[SPEAKER_08]: your plants out towards the end that that
stress if you do it, right you can You can
[SPEAKER_08]: reduce your yield by a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you do it, right, it's not that big
of a deal But you do get a really rich
[SPEAKER_08]: terpene profile through that dry stress is
a plant is like Stressing and it's talking
[SPEAKER_08]: it's yelling to all her friends.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no water and that's you know You
always say that the loud nose and that's
[SPEAKER_08]: why it's loud is because it's literally
talking.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm thirsty So don't water your plants at
the end and it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say For me one of the closed loops
are one of the things I really like to
[SPEAKER_04]: Explore my farm is how I can build soil
and How can I utilize some of the things I
[SPEAKER_04]: already have on my farm like Patricia was
saying and one of the things we use for
[SPEAKER_04]: storing our cannabis At harvest when it's
before it leaves the farm is cardboard
[SPEAKER_04]: boxes So we're putting those cardboard
boxes down in our pathways.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're putting our wood chip over that and
what I've really seen And is the mausoleum
[SPEAKER_04]: just runs I mean it just I'll inoculate a
little bit with Kingston Ferrier or some
[SPEAKER_04]: of the other mushroom blocks that I get
and We were pulling some back today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We did a little farm tour this morning and
it's Incredible like Elaine was saying you
[SPEAKER_04]: could pick it up and it's it's like a wind
chime.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's grabbing those pieces of wood woody
material and we have you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: some of us in Humboldt County and parts of
Mendo we have this Agroforestry model that
[SPEAKER_04]: is so rich.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have endless biomass Constantly and to
the point that it's sloughing onto our
[SPEAKER_04]: roads in the form of like fractured shale
that we would normally push aside and cast
[SPEAKER_04]: away but now that is such a light loose
material we're adding that to our beds and
[SPEAKER_04]: That is gonna provide food for food for
our plants as a mic microbes break it down
[SPEAKER_04]: and it really would replace something that
aerates and holds structure So that's one
[SPEAKER_04]: of the things we're doing and it really is
rewarding building that soil and closing
[SPEAKER_04]: that loop in that fashion and you know,
I want to talk about well take on some
[SPEAKER_04]: more questions, but one of the things that
Josh and Kelly were pushing at that first
[SPEAKER_04]: living soils was stop spending money.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the second living soil a second
living cells.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes stop spending money and and They were
dead serious about it and I wish I would
[SPEAKER_04]: have slowed Sooner because so much got
taken out during compliance And then last
[SPEAKER_04]: year's messaging was okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We stopped spending money We're trying to
figure this out plant more food plant more
[SPEAKER_04]: food plant more food and and I think the
messaging this year what I'm seeing with
[SPEAKER_04]: the collective being formed and That's we
need to hold hands.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to form stronger communities and
you can see how this has grown last year
[SPEAKER_04]: We were in the octagon and it would have
been just the first three rows and how
[SPEAKER_04]: this is growing and this word can spread
quickly and and and it's challenging at
[SPEAKER_04]: first getting the momentum going in a
community until you hold those first
[SPEAKER_04]: couple Gatherings barbecues whatever
excuses to get together this time of year
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great to do seed swap in general and
and that really brings people together It
[SPEAKER_04]: can be on a tailgate at first and then
before you know, you're meeting at some
[SPEAKER_04]: space and it's much larger But I just
wanted to share that and and the working
[SPEAKER_04]: together is really crucial right now that
that's gonna really help Us all any more
[SPEAKER_04]: questions out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you used your cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: stock leaf material to feed cattle or
animals Our alpacas actually love to help
[SPEAKER_06]: us like pluck leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you let them walk around they'll pluck
leaves I've heard them doing that in other
[SPEAKER_06]: gardens, but when we're out there
harvesting, they'll eat all the leaves
[SPEAKER_06]: They so I know alpacas love leaves and
another way that you can utilize those
[SPEAKER_06]: materials your stock and every Part of the
plant you should be utilizing back into
[SPEAKER_06]: your garden those stocks make awesome wood
chips the roots are medicinal the Whole
[SPEAKER_06]: plant should be used.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's another part of dampures There's no
waste on the farm because there doesn't
[SPEAKER_06]: need to be everything is is Part of the
system that you're creating and to close
[SPEAKER_06]: that loop in that way It just makes your
farm so much stronger and saves you so
[SPEAKER_08]: much money I think goats would like the
stocks better than cows would to be honest
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and go ahead chow down on the stalks
the leaves whatever good fences keep them
[SPEAKER_04]: from doing it too soon yeah, and this made
me think about one of the things that we
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure we all do is we don't pull our
our Stalks and our roots out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: We leave that just to just to stay in the
soil and not disturb that mycorrhizal zone
[SPEAKER_04]: and yeah, so if you think about it and
Jesse is probably I'll let you share your
[SPEAKER_04]: last bit because I know it's gonna be but
on my farm for instance Yeah, we'll we'll
[SPEAKER_04]: break all the material down We have run it
through a chipper what we're trying to do,
[SPEAKER_04]: but then we're burning fuel But we're
trying to take the smaller branches and
[SPEAKER_04]: put them deeper into as a first layer of
our compost area and build on top of that
[SPEAKER_04]: and we use that as the aeration and Then
yeah, we some of the bigger stock though
[SPEAKER_04]: We run through the chipper and we'll chip
that right in place and keep that in the
[SPEAKER_04]: aisle space or wherever you might need So
all that leaves my farm is just the flower
[SPEAKER_04]: and Jesse can brag a little deeper on that
Oh, no, no, well, I thought you're gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about I was gonna talk about you
watching no But what I was gonna say is
[SPEAKER_02]: when Elaine was that you're talking about
her pulling up Really really strong
[SPEAKER_02]: mycelium where it's like holding on to the
wood chips and that's stropharia I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: assuming because that's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a really strong mycelium
stropharia rugoso annulita.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the also known as the garden giant Or
king stropharia or wine cap.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a picture here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to you're not gonna be able to
totally see it But there's a whole bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of them sprouting out and that's a
cannabis stock next to it and it loves to
[SPEAKER_02]: eat cannabis chips or stocks also stocks
are really useful for Building compost
[SPEAKER_02]: aeration you guys do a good job of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been doing that for years I like the
Peter Proctor style of biodynamic compost
[SPEAKER_02]: building where you make kind of an air
tunnel and using what you have on site so
[SPEAKER_02]: like Whether it's just branches from doing
some cleanup But cannabis stocks are so
[SPEAKER_02]: good and the worms love it and the
mycelium loves it But uh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you if you have stropharia to you feed
you feed your cannabis to that They'll eat
[SPEAKER_02]: it real quick and then they produce really
tasty mushrooms to you Yeah, they're
[SPEAKER_08]: really good You know these guys mentioned
roots and I bet you know both these Casey
[SPEAKER_08]: and Daniel and you know, we're all growing
companions But with root exodates we've
[SPEAKER_08]: learned is if you have if you are going to
be doing this successional planting of say
[SPEAKER_08]: Vegetables or or lettuces next to your
cannabis if you if you have the if the
[SPEAKER_08]: baby root exodates the the Vegging root
exodates and the flowering root x8.
[SPEAKER_08]: You always have a little bit of all of
them happening throughout the time You
[SPEAKER_08]: know, you're you're you're leaning towards
optimum and just having one is fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's great You're getting exodates,
but I'm sure Elaine talked about that and
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm no expert on it, but you've We have
learned that having different age plants
[SPEAKER_08]: within your cannabis network is really
cool so like so some of the things if you
[SPEAKER_08]: guys want to do some cool things is having
Perennial plants planted around your
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis Whether they're next to it
underneath it or in the vicinity Having
[SPEAKER_08]: these ecosystems is really going to pay
off in the long run and if you're growing
[SPEAKER_08]: in greenhouses You can just put them
around the greenhouses and there's really
[SPEAKER_08]: clever things to do and it's actually
going to grow you better weed so It's
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty easy to go buy some native
perennial plants that have flowers on them
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just explain exodates for a second
just in case anyone doesn't know that but
[SPEAKER_02]: uh So plants taking in that photo energy
they're able to produce Different foods
[SPEAKER_02]: basically like carbs that they can feed to
the microorganisms right along the
[SPEAKER_02]: rhizosphere that the microbes that are
Near the roots and by releasing exodates
[SPEAKER_02]: full of different foods They can actually
promote different microbial populations
[SPEAKER_02]: and then those are going to be what's
mineralizing What's in the soil to bring
[SPEAKER_02]: out further nutrition?
[SPEAKER_02]: So being able to produce good exodates is
very important And if you don't want to do
[SPEAKER_08]: that just mulch the heck out of your soil
And you know that there's so many things
[SPEAKER_08]: we can do that are really leaning in that
right direction
[SPEAKER_07]: We we used a small flower called agaritum
In our greenhouses this last year and it's
[SPEAKER_07]: a it's a Really good flower pollen food
for beneficial insects and for
[SPEAKER_07]: pollinators.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's low growing we saw No root
competition.
[SPEAKER_07]: No issue with what it was taking from from
the cannabis plants and we kind of put it
[SPEAKER_07]: on the the southern edges of some of our
beds under under the shade under the
[SPEAKER_07]: canopy of the cannabis, but you know in a
greenhouse you have enough light diffusion
[SPEAKER_07]: that everything get get some Sun,
but the beautiful little purple flowers
[SPEAKER_07]: grew about 12 inches tall or so and and
No, they do if they're near cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: They're gonna get as much water as they
want and they didn't seem like they took
[SPEAKER_07]: water from the cannabis but I did notice a
lot of like like syphoid flies and
[SPEAKER_07]: Predatory wasps and stuff like that often
often eating off of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I felt like they were doing what I put
him there for And that's the idea of
[SPEAKER_08]: having like all the different colors and
sizes and shapes because like that you'll
[SPEAKER_08]: see very small insects on things that
you're not going to see on other plants
[SPEAKER_08]: and and and figure out what plants that
you want on the the periphery on the
[SPEAKER_08]: outside of your garden to keep things
there Versus having it in the middle of
[SPEAKER_08]: your garden And you know cilantro is a
great one a list like the really small
[SPEAKER_08]: Flowers valerian yarrow is great,
but I would put that on the periphery
[SPEAKER_08]: Chamomile is absolutely amazing Not only
can you harvest it and use it we use it
[SPEAKER_08]: for biodynamic preps One of its jobs in
the garden is to increase resin
[SPEAKER_08]: production.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why wouldn't you do that?
[SPEAKER_08]: That was what the one that we did have
issues with for competition, but again,
[SPEAKER_08]: we were growing like one ounce sea of
green plants So it's slightly different
[SPEAKER_08]: context, but if you're growing bigger
plants you would go for it
[SPEAKER_08]: He was asking where it was and the the
chamomile plant was on the bottom edge Of
[SPEAKER_08]: the where the walkway transitioned to the
bed So like a foot away, but in the ground
[SPEAKER_08]: and not in the bed is obviously a
half-size plant
[SPEAKER_06]: I Was just gonna say too with your with
your gardens You can experiment probably
[SPEAKER_06]: with anything and try like low-growing
foods Some like herbs like cilantro you
[SPEAKER_06]: mentioned that will bolt pretty quickly or
spinach things that need that are shady
[SPEAKER_06]: small and are still gonna Allow you to
have enough room and just play with it and
[SPEAKER_06]: definitely lots of herbs all those
fragrant flowery Oily herbs and depending
[SPEAKER_07]: on the effect you're going for to there
You can design your companion planting
[SPEAKER_07]: system or Around your needs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for instance, you can get a good annual
seed mix That's a mix of flowers,
[SPEAKER_07]: especially tailored towards beneficial
insects and those you don't need to grow
[SPEAKER_07]: them under your camp But if they're you
know every so often throughout your farms
[SPEAKER_07]: because their purpose is that That they're
a place that these these insects that are
[SPEAKER_07]: beneficial can go to for different parts
of their life cycle can go do to eat so
[SPEAKER_07]: that doesn't need to necessarily be Under
your cannabis plant competing with its
[SPEAKER_07]: root space to have the desired effect of
adding the biodiversity that supports the
[SPEAKER_07]: insect life You're looking for like in an
IPM program Our favorite companion is
[SPEAKER_04]: potatoes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We like putting those into roots And
around the bigger plants will come off
[SPEAKER_04]: about 18 inches from each plant and put
them in the four directions So we can
[SPEAKER_04]: after a harvest we can literally forget
about them and go back to those stocks and
[SPEAKER_04]: dig those up And it's a fun thing for my
family to do Tulsi is amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Everybody should have Tulsi It smells
amazing and the amount of insects on it in
[SPEAKER_08]: the fall is stunning Tulsi holy basil and
if you have the queen of herbs you should
[SPEAKER_06]: dedicate If you are in a greenhouse
dedicate a garden bed to food and medicine
[SPEAKER_06]: if you don't want it to compete You know
have other plants in your gardens other
[SPEAKER_06]: than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's gonna help you with your pest It's
gonna help with the overall Beneficial
[SPEAKER_06]: insects that you're bringing in and by the
way, there's so many more beneficial
[SPEAKER_06]: insects than there are of bad ones So when
you do find bugs or something's a problem,
[SPEAKER_06]: I just am touching on that quickly that
there's something you can use Naturally,
[SPEAKER_06]: you don't have to kill everything in your
garden because then You kill all the good
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I Love you are all we mentioned already
mentioned it's but I wanted to double down
[SPEAKER_02]: on it and it comes in so many different
colors too so you get that aspect and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: also a native and I also would encourage
everyone to get to know anyone doing
[SPEAKER_02]: native plant nurseries in your area and
figure out what the actual insects in your
[SPEAKER_02]: area need and what you know, you can be
doing to help the biodiversity in your
[SPEAKER_02]: area because the more we lose the natives
like then the These very specific insects
[SPEAKER_02]: that are keeping certain things in balance
no longer can feed in the way that they
[SPEAKER_04]: have evolved to Thank you guys You
