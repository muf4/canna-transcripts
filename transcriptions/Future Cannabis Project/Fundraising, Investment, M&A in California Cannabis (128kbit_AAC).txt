[SPEAKER_04]: We, I guess, are here today just to kind
of discuss what we're seeing in the way of
[SPEAKER_04]: what's happening in Canvas-based business
and, you know, what we're seeing in the
[SPEAKER_04]: way of valuations and M&A activity that
are happening in Canvas.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, Jay, what are you seeing right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your clients telling you?
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of the bigger challenges you're
seeing from your client base?
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, we're seeing a ton.
[SPEAKER_05]: Things are moving super quickly and kind
of in different paces across the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, Los Angeles is still kind of this
laggard in terms of getting people like
[SPEAKER_05]: really licensed, but then we see,
I think yesterday or two days ago in San
[SPEAKER_05]: Francisco, some of the big marquee
dispensaries are sold for, I think,
[SPEAKER_05]: nine figures, like maybe $120 million.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the challenges I think my clients
face all the time is they see big marquee
[SPEAKER_05]: transactions like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They see in the news that somebody has
sold for $120 million and they think they
[SPEAKER_05]: need to redo what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to revisit a term sheet.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need to hold the phone on some deal
that's in progress.
[SPEAKER_05]: We kind of see almost deals getting
disrupted when they see other good deals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you kind of seeing the ripple effects
of some of these big transactions?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're largely seeing a lot of the
same things.
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem that we're watching right now
is a lot of these transactions aren't
[SPEAKER_04]: being done as cash transactions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the buyers are offering,
you know, usually publicly traded
[SPEAKER_04]: companies that are coming in, they're
offering what are called 20-80 deals where
[SPEAKER_04]: it's 20% in cash and 80% in stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the stock then has some sort of a
lockup period attached to it, oftentimes
[SPEAKER_04]: over multiples of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then oftentimes you've got no ability
to mitigate any sort of downside risk on
[SPEAKER_04]: that stock component.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's been difficult for the clients
I've had is as they take a look at the
[SPEAKER_04]: offers that are being made to them,
they'll have a cash offer over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the cash offer, let's call it a $20
million offer.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the other side, they've got an
offer that looks like it's a $50 million
[SPEAKER_04]: offer, but really it's 10 million in cash
and 40 million in downstream stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't know what's going to happen
to the $40 million stock component to it
[SPEAKER_04]: in many ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: The $20 million is a better deal,
but they start thinking we're worth 50.
[SPEAKER_04]: And more importantly, everyone else around
them thinks they're worth 50.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you had somebody come to you in that
situation, everybody's seeing these
[SPEAKER_05]: Canadian businesses, their valuations just
kind of go bananas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I used to work in Silicon Valley where
we're kind of used to seeing things go
[SPEAKER_05]: bananas and then come back to sanity.
[SPEAKER_05]: How would you tell somebody to think about
the value of the stock that they're being
[SPEAKER_05]: offered?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_04]: It does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when we talk to them about it,
first of all, we're not sure if we're
[SPEAKER_04]: completely in bubble territory or whether
we've already reached tulip bulb territory
[SPEAKER_04]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in many ways, I look at a lot of these
valuations, and I think they aren't
[SPEAKER_04]: defensible.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you look at where Canopy and
Tilray are, and it's not just a multiple
[SPEAKER_04]: earnings.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trading at 300 times revenue,
which is a number that we didn't even see
[SPEAKER_04]: in tech or telecom.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's almost impossible to give these
guys the belief that this thing's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: stay as high as it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But right now, because you've got a lot of
out-of-industry Wall Street capital
[SPEAKER_04]: pouring into some of the Canadian banks to
fund these things because they see the
[SPEAKER_04]: Canadian market as being the safest place
to invest, they're starting to feel some
[SPEAKER_04]: comfort there, which means it's validating
these other market caps and other people
[SPEAKER_04]: are coming out or getting the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is when the blue sky ends and
fundamentals start kicking in,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's absolutely no way they can sustain
even if they continue to acquire other
[SPEAKER_04]: people's balance sheets, which is,
as we're talking about earlier,
[SPEAKER_04]: what they're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I speak to clients about this,
what I try to advise them is, don't look
[SPEAKER_04]: at the stock component.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are going to look at it,
think about it from the perspective of,
[SPEAKER_04]: all right, how do I mitigate that stock
component against any downside risk?
[SPEAKER_04]: How do I put a recalc in there so that
should I come off restriction and the
[SPEAKER_04]: shares have lost 80% of their value
between the time that the acquisition
[SPEAKER_04]: happened and the time that they actually
become freely tradable for me,
[SPEAKER_04]: how do I say to the purchaser,
look, we need to put something in there
[SPEAKER_04]: that says, should you lose x percent of
value, we want to have a recalculation
[SPEAKER_04]: that brings us back up to the total
consideration that we were promised in the
[SPEAKER_04]: first place?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I think I see, we see folks
trying to negotiate things like collars,
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to negotiate some kind of,
you know, you say it's going to be $50
[SPEAKER_05]: million in stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, it needs to be between 40 and 60
then.
[SPEAKER_05]: It needs to have some grounding.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we see a lot of the Canadian
buyers really disinterested in that
[SPEAKER_05]: because they know that their shares are
crazily valued and they really want all
[SPEAKER_05]: that risk to kind of be on the seller.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want the dispensary of the small
company to kind of live with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that I try and tell clients
sometimes, if you had $10 million,
[SPEAKER_05]: would you buy $10 million of Canopy stock
or $10 million of whatever Canadian
[SPEAKER_05]: company stock?
[SPEAKER_05]: And usually they think no.
[SPEAKER_05]: If they had $10 million, that's not what
they would do with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Canopy is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't about Canopy, but I feel like
when they think about it that way,
[SPEAKER_05]: it becomes real dollars.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And at first when we just say,
I'll give you $20 million in stock and $10
[SPEAKER_05]: million in cash, it seems like infinite.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when you ask them like, do you want to
invest in this business?
[SPEAKER_05]: They think twice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go a step past that and ask them,
you know, if you had that same amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: money, would you buy yourself at this
valuation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you really think that your business is
worth that much?
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you see these other valuations,
you know, I often hear this like so-and-so
[SPEAKER_04]: just got bought for 50 million.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, yeah, that's,
that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so you can't say that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I expect to have that as well
because the two things are incongruous.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to make sure that they're
thinking about from the perspective,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, fundamentally, what are you
worth and what's defensible, especially
[SPEAKER_04]: when you're thinking that a lot of the
transactions they're comparing to are the
[SPEAKER_04]: ones that have a public stock component to
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when they're raising capital,
they're still raising capital with,
[SPEAKER_04]: with private money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there is no stock component.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to say, okay, you know,
even if this other company breezed at X
[SPEAKER_04]: and, you know, because there it was an
acquisition where they actually were
[SPEAKER_04]: bought with stock, if you're out there
trying to raise 10 million in growth
[SPEAKER_04]: capital and you're trying to do an
evaluation, you can't peg your valuation
[SPEAKER_04]: against their valuation simply because
it's a, it's an apples and oranges
[SPEAKER_04]: situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if somebody came to you and said,
you know, there's an offer to sell,
[SPEAKER_05]: but there's also an opportunity to grow
the business for a couple more years,
[SPEAKER_05]: would your answer vary if they were a
retailer or a manufacturer or a
[SPEAKER_05]: distributor?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or do you think either one of them should
kind of make the same sorts of decisions?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would further categorize a way past that
and say, what market are you in?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what state are you located in?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if it's a, an oligopoly state,
like a New York or New Jersey or
[SPEAKER_04]: Connecticut, where you've got,
you know, a golden ticket and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can grow the business and very likely
the state's not going to, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: create some sort of an environment with,
with new entrants in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone that's already in it has a
really strong lobby to protect market
[SPEAKER_04]: share there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd certainly encourage them to continue
to grow rather than try to sell right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in a state, you know, like California,
where you know that, let's say,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, Los Angeles is a comp set,
it's going to go from 135 pre-ICO
[SPEAKER_04]: companies to significantly more over the
next couple of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: If someone's offering to buy you for,
you know, ridiculous valuation right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say, go ahead and sell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure you don't sign a non-compete and
turn around and do it again, as soon as
[SPEAKER_04]: you get the chance to get a new license.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because, you know, the markets are
completely different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that when you look at it based
on, you know, retailer versus processor
[SPEAKER_04]: versus cultivator, again, it completely
depends.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if I were, if I were an indoor
warehouse right now in LA and someone
[SPEAKER_04]: offered me money, I'd sell in a heartbeat
because the whole market's moving towards
[SPEAKER_04]: mix like greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's, there's no reason to be
an indoor grower anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: And most states that have indoor growers,
you know, ultimately they're, it's a
[SPEAKER_04]: failing business model.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, how do you actually be the
lowest cost producer at the highest
[SPEAKER_04]: quality?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're not that, then, you know,
you're largely wasting your time,
[SPEAKER_04]: long-term.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you've got a near term exit,
take it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we see, I used to work up north.
[SPEAKER_05]: I still do work up north.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of switched between both,
but it seems like the cultivators are the
[SPEAKER_05]: ones who are first being, I don't want to
say driven out, but being, having the most
[SPEAKER_05]: difficulty surviving, having the most
difficulty adapting, having the most
[SPEAKER_05]: difficulty finding a place for themselves
as things move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it seems like the ones who are almost
newest to cannabis, the ones who are
[SPEAKER_05]: starting new businesses, sometimes almost
have an advantage because they're not,
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to bring an old business in,
but just starting something from scratch.
[SPEAKER_05]: Does that, does that make sense?
[SPEAKER_04]: It does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that California, again,
is unique because as we went through this
[SPEAKER_04]: transition of illicit or gray market to
legal, you had thousands upon thousands of
[SPEAKER_04]: growers that existed already in the state
that the state was encouraging,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, hey, get legal.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll give you the opportunity to come
into the light.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't have that with, you know,
to an extent with retailers, but certainly
[SPEAKER_04]: not with processors.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a relatively new industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Distributors is, you know, very new
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But with the cultivators, there were so
many of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So while you have, you know, all the
Northern counties, you know, Mendocino,
[SPEAKER_04]: Humboldt, Trinity, and then the whole
Grass Valley region, all those guys were,
[SPEAKER_04]: were dealing with, you know, okay,
do we want to make the determination of
[SPEAKER_04]: stop having an addressable market of the
rest of the United States on the illicit
[SPEAKER_04]: market to having an addressable market of
just California?
[SPEAKER_04]: They had to make that decision of,
do we want to, do we want to come in?
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're all largely cottage industry
growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They weren't, you know, large scale
commercial growers that you're now seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: in Salinas, Monterey, Carpinteria,
you know, the desert.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's much, much different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I mean, to your point,
are those guys having a tough time
[SPEAKER_04]: surviving?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they're having a really tough time
because not only are they dealing with
[SPEAKER_04]: each other in a much smaller addressable
market of just the state of California,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're also dealing with all these,
you know, mega corporations that are
[SPEAKER_04]: coming in and building these massive news
facilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see, I think I see sometimes they're
almost, there's a cultural challenge
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes I see too.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are folks who, and it's not just
cultivators, but folks who have been kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of steeped in a kind of cloistered or
remote, whatever the word is, industry for
[SPEAKER_05]: a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we do have private money.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we do have mature investors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we do have sophisticated people who
want to do real estate transactions that
[SPEAKER_05]: are kind of just novel to a lot of these
folks.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a deal I'm working on now and the
buyer and the seller very much want to do
[SPEAKER_05]: the deal, but they're just almost like
socially incompatible.
[SPEAKER_05]: The buyer wants to communicate through the
attorneys.
[SPEAKER_05]: The seller thinks that's impersonal and
waste too much money on legal fees.
[SPEAKER_05]: The seller wants to call the CEO of the
buyer often and schedule big conference
[SPEAKER_05]: calls, which is a totally fine way to do
it, except the buyer thinks that's nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the whole thing, it seems like it
might collapse because they're just too
[SPEAKER_04]: incompatible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The business is compatible.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the styles of these two guys are just
not compatible at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see a ton of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of it's based on sophistication
of the level of business that they've
[SPEAKER_04]: done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And oftentimes the buyers at this point
are sophisticated guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're coming in with real capital.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're looking at these businesses in a
very traditional way.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're looking at what their revenues are
currently, what their EBITDA is,
[SPEAKER_04]: what their growth curve is.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're thinking about this from the
standpoint of when I make an investment,
[SPEAKER_04]: what do I think this looks like five years
downstream?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a cash on cash component to it?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's my horizon?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the debt service?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can these guys actually cash flow hard
enough to service the debt?
[SPEAKER_04]: The sellers are looking at it from the
standpoint of I used to grow weed and make
[SPEAKER_04]: it for $1 and sell it for $2, and a
handshake was my bond.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for them, going through all these
questions, when I tell people to put a
[SPEAKER_04]: data room together, I often get this blank
stare of what's a data room?
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you go through and put the due
diligence checklist in front of them,
[SPEAKER_04]: they go, we don't need any of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you don't think you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the person that's actually going to be
writing that check sure does.
[SPEAKER_04]: And put it together now, because
ultimately you're going to have to anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And rather do it with me first than do it
with the buyer that goes, I'm not
[SPEAKER_04]: interested because these guys have no idea
what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I feel like it's one of the things
they just kind of have to hold their nose
[SPEAKER_05]: and jump, is the process of selling your
company is slow and difficult and
[SPEAKER_05]: unpleasant and expensive.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's no escape from any of those
four things.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do it with friendly people.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can plan ahead, but it's just going to
be difficult and slow because that's what
[SPEAKER_05]: someone who's going to write a check for
millions of dollars is going to insist we
[SPEAKER_05]: go through in order to get the check.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's hard to, like you said,
there's a lot of folks who are used to,
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew it for one, I sold it for two,
and then I went to Costa Rica for six
[SPEAKER_05]: months, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just not really the next step.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the problem is now you're starting to
get the, not only sophisticated investors
[SPEAKER_04]: are coming in, but they've already come
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And those guys are already thinking about
the next link in the evolution of the
[SPEAKER_04]: company, which is they want their exit.
[SPEAKER_04]: These guys aren't buying for altruistic
reasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're buying because they want to make
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they come in two years ago or three
years ago when these first real deals
[SPEAKER_04]: really started happening in California and
you started seeing people pour,
[SPEAKER_04]: not sort of money that was buried in
ceramic vessels in your backyard on the
[SPEAKER_04]: hill, but actually coming in from
reputable sources around Los Angeles or
[SPEAKER_04]: San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those guys are already thinking,
okay, I've been in this deal for three
[SPEAKER_04]: years and now I want to sell to the GTIs
or the Canopies or the Auroras or you name
[SPEAKER_04]: it, the multi-state operator in the US or
the LP up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're thinking about what their
exit's going to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're doing things properly
already on the sales side.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you've got the guys that are still
resisting it, that are saying,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if I want to go through all
of this, they're not only at a deficit to
[SPEAKER_04]: what their knowledge base should be with
the buyer, but they're at an amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: deficit to the people that have already
gone through the process once and are now
[SPEAKER_04]: that further along in their life cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we know nobody likes all the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know nobody likes the cost of vendors
and the cost of people like me.
[SPEAKER_05]: But on the other hand, everybody was
great, we'll come out of the darkness,
[SPEAKER_05]: we'll have a real W2.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's almost like the two things have
to go together.
[SPEAKER_05]: People wanted legalization without all the
legalities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, maybe that's a really obvious
comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is, but it's one that shouldn't be
lost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see comments on MJ Business all the
time or when you see LA Times articles or
[SPEAKER_04]: San Francisco Chronicle articles,
you see the comments section that comes
[SPEAKER_04]: after the article.
[SPEAKER_04]: And inevitably it's like, look at the
announcement of Gavin Newsom now sending
[SPEAKER_04]: federal enforcement up to the northern
counties to try to enforce illegal
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And everyone's like, this guy,
I can't believe he's doing this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought he was pro-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's pro-legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's not pro-illicit anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you guys were given a couple year
period.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, I'm the biggest supporter of
illicit farmers over the last 30 years
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to find.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at a certain point, when you realize
that this is disrupting a market that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're trying to get off the ground,
they're doing it in a way that everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: asks them to do it, there's got to be some
give and take there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So would I prefer not to see the years of
camp come back and humbled men to see?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure, I don't want to see helicopters
landing on people's properties.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, I also don't want to
see illicit growers taking the ability to
[SPEAKER_04]: have a good business away from guys that
are following every bit of letter of the
[SPEAKER_04]: law.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a tough situation there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But eventually you are going to see the
people that were non-sophisticated or
[SPEAKER_04]: unwilling to change.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're just going to end up going out of
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think sometimes I use the word
almost unsophisticated incorrectly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I think sometimes they're super
sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just want to stay out of the legal
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not easy being a criminal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've got to be good.
[SPEAKER_05]: They totally get it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they prefer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Outlaws, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But point well taken, living outside the
law requires honesty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It requires being good at what you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It requires not burning people.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all the things that you expect to see
in real business actually happens in a
[SPEAKER_04]: much more profound way on the illicit side
or the outlaw side of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that the people that all of us
in this room probably dealt with for years
[SPEAKER_04]: and years, it was because we're still
sitting here because you didn't burn
[SPEAKER_04]: anyone or do anything really stupid.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that acting that way for years
is probably the mantra that you should
[SPEAKER_04]: have as a business owner in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you realize the real criminals and the
real dirtbags out there are the guys on
[SPEAKER_04]: the legal side that are coming in and
trying to figure out ways to create term
[SPEAKER_04]: sheets that completely and totally rape
you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it requires guys like Jay and I to sit
there and go, don't sign that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So believe me when I say I'm absolutely
simple.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sympathetic to the outlaw.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a question of how do you bring
the outlaw into the legal market without
[SPEAKER_04]: getting absolutely destroyed in the
process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now I think that's business-wise
a really tough thing to advise people on
[SPEAKER_04]: doing because they only know a certain
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that certain way was based 100% on
honesty and trust.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the returns in non-reported
transactions can be really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have this client who said something once
like, I just want to go back to the time
[SPEAKER_05]: when I could grow for three months a year
and surf in Costa Rica for nine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we thought that would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was never sustainable.
[SPEAKER_05]: That wasn't going to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it did for 30 plus years.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it did.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you have someone that's been
working that long.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would do that if I could.
[SPEAKER_04]: The fact that matters that we are going
through a crazy transition right now in
[SPEAKER_04]: the state of California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the analogy I always use is kind of in
a relay race for your passing the baton.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now we're in the space that's 50
yards of the baton pass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're on the gray market or prop 215
side on the formerly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you're moving into the post-64 new
life in California cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And surviving this baton pass lane is
going to be exceptionally difficult.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now having said that, the illicit market
in the near term, until all 50 states are
[SPEAKER_04]: legalized in the United States and you're
able to cross state lines, we're never
[SPEAKER_04]: going to see the illicit market go away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's a lot of people in the
northern counties and a lot of people even
[SPEAKER_04]: probably within 10 blocks of here that are
perfectly pleased to stay in the market
[SPEAKER_04]: they've always been in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to your point, as far as profit
motivation, the return profile is still
[SPEAKER_04]: significantly better to operate on that
side.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just a much higher risk profile as
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where do you want to live?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for most people now they're
weighing that option.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're having to think about it
seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, as they're making
that decision from a business standpoint,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is really what we're here
discussing, is how do you think about it
[SPEAKER_04]: in a way that's going to be meaningful so
that eventually you're not spending three
[SPEAKER_04]: months on the beach in Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're spending all your time on the beach
in Costa Rica because you had a meaningful
[SPEAKER_04]: sale.
[SPEAKER_04]: That allowed you to walk away from a great
business that you built up and said,
[SPEAKER_04]: I made the transition from, I wouldn't say
dark to light, but gray to light
[SPEAKER_04]: successfully.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a conversation we have a
lot with clients who they never really
[SPEAKER_05]: thought what was going to happen to the
business in the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most small businesses are either sold
or closed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I hear clients often say, when we do
our IPO, and they want to gently lean in
[SPEAKER_05]: and be like, almost no business does an
IPO, even if you're fantastic spectacular,
[SPEAKER_05]: probably not going to happen, especially
for a cannabis business.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're coming for you, Jay.
[SPEAKER_05]: But getting, you know, kind of starting
those conversations where in reality you
[SPEAKER_05]: were probably always going to sell this
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: You were going to sell it to someone you
know, you were going to pass it on to
[SPEAKER_05]: someone, or you were going to sell it to a
stranger, hoping that you would get some
[SPEAKER_05]: great outcome, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: For this business that's been your life
and your sweat and your blood and your
[SPEAKER_05]: tears.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you told me a few minutes ago that you
have a sign that your mother wrote outside
[SPEAKER_05]: your farm that was discouraging people's
horses from pooping on your farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she's had this sign for like six
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this business is your life.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Dew Point.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the horses nearby are very kind,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: She's nodding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think we talk a lot, and that was a
long aside, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talk a lot with clients about kind of
getting them comfortable with the idea of
[SPEAKER_05]: it might be a great idea for you to
transition away from this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This might be the best chance you have to
move on to what's next.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's something that shouldn't be
lost on most people, anyone that started a
[SPEAKER_04]: small business.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you go into it, you know,
you think about how great the business is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to do and how you can build this
thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But after about year five or six or seven,
you start to realize that this thing is
[SPEAKER_04]: you.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a marriage.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a complete tether on everything else
you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It limits your ability.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you find a better opportunity,
you're like, well, what do I do with the
[SPEAKER_04]: one I already have?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm stuck with this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in many ways a business is an anchor
and you're stuck with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you think about an exit,
you know, it's rare that a business is
[SPEAKER_04]: cash flowing so well that, you know,
you're like, look, I'm perfectly happy
[SPEAKER_04]: just to keep this thing going.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for a long time, that's what Northern
California cannabis was.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like as much as we can make,
as much as we can grow on the risk that
[SPEAKER_04]: we're willing to take doing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't know anyone to date
that's ever thrown away a pound of weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's going to find a home unless
it's completely molded out or some other
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even then, there's shady guys that'll
blast it.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you see clients who are really
attached to some business that they've
[SPEAKER_05]: been growing forever, how do you,
as is often the case, some people in the
[SPEAKER_05]: business want to sell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people in the business don't want to
sell.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you have those conversations with
them where, I mean, because my instinct is
[SPEAKER_05]: to encourage them to probably take the
good offer, take the reasonable offer
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did it with a client yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the client yesterday, you know,
there are three different term sheets were
[SPEAKER_04]: on the table for them by three decent
companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, all of them were qualified
suitors.
[SPEAKER_04]: They got an offer, you know, yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the third turn of a term sheet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, we got the call,
like, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: And our answer is, you know, look,
you guys have been waiting for this for a
[SPEAKER_04]: while.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one that not only can you live
with, but it's one that's got great upside
[SPEAKER_04]: potential.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got mitigated downside risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else are you waiting for?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you are serious about selling
this company, take the offer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if it's going to ingrate you
into a company where you think the
[SPEAKER_04]: corporate culture is one that largely
coincides with who you are as people and
[SPEAKER_04]: you think you can integrate in easily.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing I discourage people from doing
is being inquired by a company where the
[SPEAKER_04]: corporate culture is just not a fit.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're, you know, moving into a group
that you want nothing to do with
[SPEAKER_04]: ultimately.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they go, oh, well, it's only a two
year lock up where I've got to stay with
[SPEAKER_04]: the company.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that could be the most miserable two
years of your life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's we try to encourage that,
A, if there's one buyer or one seller that
[SPEAKER_04]: is on the team that really wants to sell
and there's another one that doesn't,
[SPEAKER_04]: have that conversation internally first.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make sure that whenever you go out with a
forward facing look to the outside world,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're doing it with consistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there's one person that doesn't,
you know, want to do it, then you figure
[SPEAKER_04]: out a way to offer to sell to them first
or, you know, a way to do something else
[SPEAKER_04]: that allows the needs of the different
people within the company to match.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think if the clients can go into these
conversations thinking someday I will do
[SPEAKER_05]: something next, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: This isn't the last thing I'm ever going
to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the thing I'm doing right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can kind of facilitate either other
people coming in, sell to your partners or
[SPEAKER_05]: just not the, this is mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Remember like Gollum in Lord of the Rings?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like this is mine forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I feel like it, it, it will wither if
it's kind of concrete like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also think that a liquidity event,
even one that might not be the one that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're hoping for, but you know,
if you've got a company that's doing,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, call it $3 million in top line
revenue and someone offers you five times
[SPEAKER_04]: revenue and all of a sudden there's a $15
million offer on the table and you've only
[SPEAKER_04]: got, you know, $1.5 million of debt to
knock out and you've got a couple other
[SPEAKER_04]: equity investors that own 20% of your
business.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you end up walking away from this thing
post tax with $6 or $7 million in your
[SPEAKER_04]: pocket, I hate to break it to most people.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's life changing money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want to go out there now and
make investments yourself into other
[SPEAKER_04]: spaces and start peppering the market with
companies that you like with check sizes
[SPEAKER_04]: of 150 to 250 K, you know, all of a sudden
now you can, you know, spread that couple
[SPEAKER_04]: million bucks, still keep two or 3 million
in your pocket and you've put three or 4
[SPEAKER_04]: million back to work in the space,
hoping that you get another exit on one of
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 companies you're putting in and chances
are based on the climate, you'll get one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so it's, you know, for people
that are like, Oh, I'm holding out for the
[SPEAKER_04]: $50 million payday.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you've got a business that's,
that's that dynamic and that exceptional,
[SPEAKER_04]: great.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're, you know, creating a
product that, you know, another vape cart,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: You probably want to take the 15 million
bucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think one thing we were talking
about earlier was the idea that,
[SPEAKER_05]: so when you're being paid with stock,
it's, you're really making a second bet,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the first bet was that I can build a
company.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can put this money in, it's going to
succeed.
[SPEAKER_05]: The second bet is they can build a
company.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can do it better.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can do it with my, with everything
I've done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and it's this, it's hump.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's, I feel like that's one scenario
where I'm always encouraging folks to be
[SPEAKER_05]: really on the one hand, I'm, I try and
encourage them to find a transaction that
[SPEAKER_05]: works, but I think I'm also really cool on
accepting paper from Canadian companies,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is just so, such a gamble at this
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll look in the camera and don't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, I'm not saying don't do it a hundred
percent, but a lot of these companies,
[SPEAKER_04]: like they, they have almost no liquidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: They trade, you know, 10,000 shares a day,
5,000 shares a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and you're about to be given millions
of shares of paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, okay, even if you had that
paper and he came off restriction,
[SPEAKER_04]: if there's no, if there's no buyer on the
other side of the trade, then what do you
[SPEAKER_04]: really have?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if you actually start putting
these shares out in the market,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to crater the share price of
the company anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're going to do it, make sure
it's a company that really has the ability
[SPEAKER_04]: to, to let you have your ultimate exit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, if not, you're probably better off,
you know, continue to build your company.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're good at building the company,
then keep going and someone else will come
[SPEAKER_04]: along, uh, later.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question I have for you then kind
of on the same idea is, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: as, as we're watching progression happen
on a federal basis, um, and we're
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely watching progression happen
state by state.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think there's a person in this
room that doesn't think that federal
[SPEAKER_04]: legality is not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, not probably not in this
administration, but certainly,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, in the next, if it, if it goes,
um, you know, the way of, uh, a democratic
[SPEAKER_04]: Senate and a democratic president,
um, at that point, you know, what do you
[SPEAKER_04]: think about the California market as an
export market in the longterm?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because for me, I'm watching a lot of
consolidation right now happening in
[SPEAKER_04]: California, but ultimately California
always powered American cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that day comes back?
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you think it's worthwhile telling
people to hold out until a, the capital
[SPEAKER_04]: markets open up in the U S and B,
when California becomes the epicenter
[SPEAKER_04]: again of American cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: So, I mean, I think I've heard people like
Lori Ajax say, and one of these days we're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to become an exporter and it's
probably true eventually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I'm reluctant for any of my clients to
hold out for that just cause there's
[SPEAKER_05]: probably going to be 10 things that happen
between now and then that might impact how
[SPEAKER_05]: things actually look.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, you know, someday we'll probably have,
I used to, I'd smoke a pack of cigarettes
[SPEAKER_05]: every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that tobacco was grown in North
Carolina at that point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I have no idea where it's grown today,
but it's probably not cheapest to do it in
[SPEAKER_05]: North Carolina anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, cannabis commercial recreational
cannabis probably become just like any
[SPEAKER_05]: other commodity someday.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and for maybe I have a lot of clients
up North who hope to become like high end
[SPEAKER_05]: vineyards, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're going to have like a very
specialized product.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Appalachian theory of the humble grown
or Mendo grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm sure for some of them that'll
work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I think the question is like for how
many of them could it work?
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I guess I would think federal
legalization will probably happen,
[SPEAKER_05]: but not soon enough to impact anyone
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you, do you think it's,
would you, if someone came into you and
[SPEAKER_05]: said, I'm going to wait until I can sell
my product in 50 States so that I really
[SPEAKER_05]: have a market, would you tell them they're
crazy?
[SPEAKER_04]: It depends on the, uh, depends on the
client.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I'm looking at some of the
companies are being built in California
[SPEAKER_04]: right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, you look at, um,
the announcement made yesterday that
[SPEAKER_04]: Gotham green put 125 million to work into
flow Kana.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, do I think that,
you know, with $125 million and the
[SPEAKER_04]: revenue that Mikey Steinmetz is putting
out of the Fetzer facility up North that
[SPEAKER_04]: he's got the ability to, to weather a
storm for a period of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, one, one 25 is a decent investment
by any other industry standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tiny investment, but it's,
you know, for cannabis is big,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, a company like that or a company,
you know, like, um, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, some of the other mega, uh,
you know, groups are being put together
[SPEAKER_04]: that, uh, that are looking at California
as a consolidation play.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, do I think that for them,
you know, companies that are, are raising
[SPEAKER_04]: capital at North of three or $400 million
in, uh, as a valuation, I would,
[SPEAKER_04]: I would think those guys would probably
want to weather the storm because I think
[SPEAKER_04]: that in several years time, and I don't
think that this is, uh, something that
[SPEAKER_04]: goes on forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while I agree with you that in the
meantime, you know, do we see like the
[SPEAKER_04]: country of Columbia become an export
market or do we see like Macedonia become
[SPEAKER_04]: an export market to Europe or,
you know, are there new places that are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to pop open?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I always think there, I think there's
always going to be, um, the need for high
[SPEAKER_04]: end flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's always going to be
producers that are specialized for high
[SPEAKER_04]: end flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that the part that'll be
commoditized is, uh, is, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the extraction side of it where people are
going to grow just a blast.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've got a client who has a technology
that it thinks, and I think it's
[SPEAKER_05]: compelling, but they have a basically like
a new gummy processing technology that is
[SPEAKER_05]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's their goal to basically make that
platform.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, you could, you could do that
platform in 50 States.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then at the last minute put in
cannabis from that state, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no reason the first nine tenths of
the gummy needs to contain cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, they are a company.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think some of the, if there are
manufacturing techniques, if there are
[SPEAKER_05]: some new recipes that could come around
and really, I mean, I think, sorry,
[SPEAKER_05]: roundabout way of saying, I think some
products could become national.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even before we have legal cannabis
nationally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think you're looking at some of
the, uh, the branded products out there
[SPEAKER_04]: and the race right now is to create brand
equity in branded products.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of those are licensing deals
where they'll be created in California and
[SPEAKER_04]: then they're licensed to five or six other
States on the expectation that when
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization happens, they've already
built the brand equity and then they can
[SPEAKER_04]: move in, uh, with three PL facilities in
five different locations.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thinking about licensing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so in the past four or five months,
there's been a ton of excitement in
[SPEAKER_05]: California.
[SPEAKER_05]: About how much contract manufacturing
people can do.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and today the final regulations,
people can do a good amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, that was rule nine oh four.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's 50 32.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, the, uh, the, the white labeling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, but the, the people, so there's some
hopes to jump through, but people can do
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I wonder when you see folks come to
you who want to, to assemble, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, portfolio brands, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: A portfolio of iconic brands and then just
license the heck out of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something that you think,
is there, is there a future in that
[SPEAKER_05]: business or is that kind of trying to do
it like on the, on the cheap almost?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think there's a, I think there's
definitely a future of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, for if you're talking about a
California based company, if you,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're talking about a Connecticut
based company, I don't think you have a
[SPEAKER_04]: large enough addressable market in your
home market to, to really want to be able
[SPEAKER_04]: to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you're talking about, you know,
when I think about the market we're seeing
[SPEAKER_04]: right now, it's the largest canvas market
in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you think that there's 39
million people in California and 20,
[SPEAKER_04]: 21 million of those people live from LA
County down to the Mexican border across
[SPEAKER_04]: five counties in the space that,
you know, geographically is about the size
[SPEAKER_04]: of Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're talking about a market
that is just significantly more important
[SPEAKER_04]: than any other market that it's out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's, that's Colorado, Washington,
Oregon, uh, Alaska and Arizona combined,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, in, in one market.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you think about from the standpoint
of aggregating brands and only working
[SPEAKER_04]: just the SoCal market and using that as
your, as you're jumping off point,
[SPEAKER_04]: then yeah, I mean, I think just that alone
is, is worth it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can think about licensing,
but if you're talking about a small
[SPEAKER_04]: addressable market, that's where you're
launching like a Minnesota based,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, like aggregation of brands
company.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't make any sense to me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think another, maybe one thing I should
have said was, so if I were a company and
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted to get the rights to make Marley
and meatloaf and guns and roses,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I said, I was going to be the
licensing company that has like all of the
[SPEAKER_05]: music, all of the music type brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, today we're still, today there's a ton
of products.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today there's a ton of inconsistency at
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: Today there's still kind of the,
on the retail side, the market's still
[SPEAKER_05]: really choppy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, do you think the brands that are going
to be, are the ones that have,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the grateful that label on them?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what's going to allow them to
kind of become something or it's just
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be like a better product.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the, the private equity firm that I
founded a couple of years ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: we did the Willie Nelson transaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: We led the series on Willie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you really thought about, yeah,
we actually were working very closely with
[SPEAKER_04]: the Grateful Dead and the Garcia band
estate as well at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, we're, we're looking really
seriously at, do we bring a Grateful Dead
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis brand to market?
[SPEAKER_04]: And right when Marley was being done by
privateer and it's right around the same
[SPEAKER_04]: time that you're watching, um,
you know, Snoop work with, uh,
[SPEAKER_04]: Siverde.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, everyone was thinking about
the standpoint of, you know, do you need a
[SPEAKER_04]: marquee sort of endorser to do it?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the thing I kept hearing that was
consistent across everyone is,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, the advertising equivalency of
having these people out there,
[SPEAKER_04]: having the name out there, because,
you know, if there's restrictions on
[SPEAKER_04]: advertising and marketing, can you make up
for those restrictions by actually having,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, Willie Nelson at every single
tour stop wearing a Willie's reserve hat
[SPEAKER_04]: or having, you know, Snoop dog talking
about the fact he's got some deal with
[SPEAKER_04]: live well in Colorado and that,
that was going to drive business.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but ultimately, uh, you know,
you look at the wine industry and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, while you might have a Coppola
wine, it's not Coppola's name that drives
[SPEAKER_04]: the other sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, it's the underlying product itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think with cannabis, you know,
it's, I think right now what's,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's becoming hotter are specific,
um, genetics are still hot and then it's
[SPEAKER_04]: specific growers that are, they're putting
those genetics out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you know, you really trust,
you know, whatever, whatever the
[SPEAKER_04]: underlying brand is like, I'm here today
with a group called Palomar and,
[SPEAKER_04]: and Palomar puts out some of the best,
you know, craft cannabis product in the
[SPEAKER_04]: country.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think people are going to buy
it because they had a celebrity
[SPEAKER_04]: endorsement.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to buy it because you know,
the, the grow for Palomar is one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: best guys in the, in the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then what made Willie Nelson's likeness
compelling to you?
[SPEAKER_04]: I voted against it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was the only person on the investment
committee that said no.
Okay.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what was compelling to me was,
was the fact that there's an icon that's
[SPEAKER_04]: recognizable even in states that are
illegal, especially the American south,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, Texas, Louisiana, Tennessee,
like all the country music states.
[SPEAKER_04]: That anyone that smoke canvas down there
would be like, Oh man, I got to try
[SPEAKER_04]: Willie's wheat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's, there's certain part of it
that everyone's going to try it once
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's Willie's weed, but will they
try it the second time or the third time?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that brand quality has to hold the
day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as you said, there's inconsistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you hire six different growers in
six different markets to grow that same
[SPEAKER_04]: brand, even if you're putting out the same
genetic, even if everyone's doing like an
[SPEAKER_04]: OG Kush, unless you're growing in the
exact same growing conditions with the
[SPEAKER_04]: exact same media, with the exact same
nutrients, the exact same relative
[SPEAKER_04]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's going to be a different
product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from like true branding perspective,
I don't think there's any brand equity in
[SPEAKER_04]: something that you can't say is
consistent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you guys like trying to raise money,
friends and family investors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are people sniffing around to acquire you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those that couldn't hear it in the
audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: What she was saying is that her farm and
her land up north is, is her life.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just because she has something that
people might want to purchase,
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't mean that she wants to sell.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's a lot of people that
feel that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I applaud that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's, that's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that means that, you know,
you're, you're happy building this thing
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's, it's what you want to do
long-term, which is awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cheers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, and I don't know if the same is true
with like, I know there's so much Pacific
[SPEAKER_04]: guys are over here as well, who are pretty
decent sized distribution company that
[SPEAKER_04]: have offices kind of all over the
California, uh, north and south.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I know they've done a pretty good job.
[SPEAKER_04]: Picking up quite a few brands.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if the same is true for those
guys, but, uh, Do you guys want to save
[SPEAKER_05]: the experience that you're having trying
to navigating the regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to figure out how to get into the
market, how to get into the market
[SPEAKER_00]: legally, how to build partnerships,
uh, that are scalable has been,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, you know, a big part of what we've
been trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the fundraising side,
there's obviously like a lot of interest
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of money, but again,
finding those partners that can bring
[SPEAKER_00]: value.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, as well as those partners that are
strategically aligned to the type of
[SPEAKER_00]: growth that you want to have, um,
and kind of keeping those, especially as I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess, um, outsiders to the industry is
not those that have been in the gray
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, one of the things that's been
important to us though, has been actually
[SPEAKER_00]: working with small farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and we have an established
relationship with a licensed farm in
[SPEAKER_00]: Medicino.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big part of it, but some of the
pushback we've actually gotten from some
[SPEAKER_00]: investors as well as, um, as well as some
manufacturers, uh, that we've talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: partnering with has been, oh, like,
you don't need to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we've got this stuff that's grown in
this warehouse and you should just roll
[SPEAKER_00]: forward with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much cheaper and it's much easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, we can make that happen much
quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so finding those partners that are,
have that value alignment has been a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more difficult for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but something that we're working on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what's your product?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the product drew Martin is a line of,
uh, botanically, uh, infused pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, cannabis with, uh, specific blends
of, uh, botanicals, uh, that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: formulated by, uh, by Drew Martin himself,
uh, herbalist.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds compelling.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think that's a good point that,
and your name is Andrew as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Andrew.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's a good point that as you're
getting off the ground, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: people that want to tell you how you
should build your business and why you
[SPEAKER_04]: should build your business that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, you know, in most other
businesses, you don't have, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: that much outside influence, uh,
here, you know, as people are getting in,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's amazing to me that every time I go to
a cannabis convention, 70% of the people
[SPEAKER_04]: in that room are like, Oh, this brand new
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I started laughing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I go to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I started in this industry 28 years
ago and I was new then, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I was, I was a kid and like
being taught by guys that were 20,
[SPEAKER_04]: 30 years older than me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, you know, for people to say
it's a new industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, the industry has always been here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, legality.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's new.
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you, were you living out here now?
[SPEAKER_04]: So probably I was out here in the
summertime, but, uh, but I was living,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, living in Salt Lake city, Utah,
and then spending most of the time on
[SPEAKER_04]: grateful debt tour.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was sort of bouncing around,
having fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Better than Costa Rica.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I haven't been to either.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do the, uh, the, the, the price is
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Come on down.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can be, you can be Conan and I'll be
Andy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, George lost spike.
[SPEAKER_02]: My, uh, product is called.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookie crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fantastic edible, uh, cookie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it actually came from, uh,
a cookie that we have been, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: marketing for years, uh, without cannabis
with crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just with, but now we've infused it
with cannabis before it was just a fun
[SPEAKER_02]: dessert cookie that actually, cause like
both are schedule one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't, you know, yeah, yeah,
that's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, trying to get into the legal
part of the market, if I can be so,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, uh, blunt, um, it's,
it seems there's different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'm interested in and my question
is about, is this a shared facility that
[SPEAKER_02]: they just enacted?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I think late last year and they did
something with it, uh, earlier this year,
[SPEAKER_02]: which for somebody like me would be
perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, do you have any advice on that or any,
uh, information?
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you can find someone who's looking
like to open up one of the shared
[SPEAKER_05]: facilities, I think it's pretty relatively
easy to get one of the, what is it type?
[SPEAKER_02]: S S it's an S S right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is, yeah, it's very easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to find a, uh, you know,
somebody with an N or, uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: M six, M seven type license.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know how they can get into a,
but from what I understand, it's like a
[SPEAKER_02]: commercial kitchen that, you know,
several people can go in there,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, but they can't go in there at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, so in essence you rent time,
uh, get a S a license or permit and you
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of piggyback into them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think I've seen folks in,
um, like entrepreneurs in Oakland who are
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to basically buy a big space and
then like basically rent it out to people
[SPEAKER_05]: like you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, so I guess if you, are you in a larger
area or in a city?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, no adventure County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's very little that they're
putting up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thousand Oaks to be specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they've got one testing center and
one medical.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think if you looked in a place
where there were just more, right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hear long beach is pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've also heard that Huntington beach,
there's a couple of cities there and I've
[SPEAKER_02]: contacted the, the, the state,
uh, about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said there's a directory they're
working on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they just haven't put it out there yet
because, um, which I think would be very
[SPEAKER_02]: helpful to myself and a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think BCC has the list, but does CDPH
have a list on its website?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one that they're saying that
they're, they have all the ones that have
[SPEAKER_02]: a permanent and temporary license or
annual and temporary license, but they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have a specific directory for shared
facilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't, pardon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I've talked directly with them and
the gentleman, uh, Billy, I think it was
[SPEAKER_02]: his name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I've been communicating an email with
him from the California department and he
[SPEAKER_02]: was saying it's something they're working
on and they're real close to publishing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to answer the question, yes,
it's a viable way to go with the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or a white label.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand there's facilities that do
that that already have them, but then you
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of open your license as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've got their license as long as
both entities are licensed.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any other suggestions on how
one, you know, other than going,
[SPEAKER_02]: getting a building, buying the building
and then applying in, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: where the, the licenses are still
available?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the, the barriers to entry are
super high.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, and I think for a manufacturer,
yeah, you're, you need to find a place
[SPEAKER_05]: where you can do it and then you need the
equipment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, the kind of shared space idea though,
I mean, you can drop your cost of
[SPEAKER_05]: acquisition by a ton.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, it sounds like you just need to find
other folks who are close enough to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, which like you're saying it shouldn't,
I'm sure there are other people in your
[SPEAKER_05]: shoes, you know, who want to do this as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, I know, I know people who are doing it
in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know people who are trying to do it in
San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's something that California is
trying to, I mean, cause obviously
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody knows they didn't have the
revenue they thought they'd have.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, they had less revenue with the
recreational than they did the year before
[SPEAKER_02]: with just medical.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, it's the restrictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they're just, you know,
from seed to sale is almost impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, my background is manufacturing
apparel and I know how complicated
[SPEAKER_02]: everything is with regulations and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's so hard to track.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I, I believe they're trying to,
you know, kind of open it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, they say that they want micro
businesses in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to do something like the beer
industry has where it's just not the quote
[SPEAKER_02]: Budweiser's coming in there and
controlling the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, which will get the growth of
different strains, different flavors,
[SPEAKER_02]: different, you know, different vehicles of
how to, how to consume it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, um, you know, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, uh, it's got the, um,
the sign.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're about out of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Jay, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, hopefully we'll thank you,
Peter.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks for putting this together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to a future canvas project for,
uh, for putting on these vats.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's super cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice that there's a group in LA
that's actually doing this and get people
[SPEAKER_04]: together in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
