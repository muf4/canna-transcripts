[SPEAKER_03]: Tom, you have any two by fours?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I've been looked.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a two by four.
[SPEAKER_03]: I need something to put into.
[SPEAKER_07]: What for?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just to frame this off so that we can put
that tarp in and the water will collect in
[SPEAKER_07]: the hole.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will a smaller piece of wood frame if we
cut it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Layton, look what he has.
[SPEAKER_07]: Layton.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I mean that's better than nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's better than the ones I was using
obviously for stakes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tom, you can snap it with your muscular
arms.
[SPEAKER_03]: That I could do.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is kind of the best I can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that'll work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it will frame it in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep, and it just can be right up tight to
the pot that's there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Move the frame in tighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want me to break these or leave
them whole?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, let's leave them whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then what we'll do is we'll put this
one underneath.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then look, you can just put that one
up and over.
[SPEAKER_03]: That works?
[SPEAKER_03]: That works fine.
Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we see this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you want to get all of this,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want to explain what you're doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the gist of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what you're known for,
but you haven't made a video yet?
[SPEAKER_07]: I introduced this to the cannabis
community four years ago in Portland,
[SPEAKER_07]: Oregon and got laughed off the stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: People thought I was fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_07]: They thought, what do you know about
growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, dude, I'm a fucking soil
engineer.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know how to build fucking soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your problem is you're using this low
tension soil that goes hydrophobic on the
[SPEAKER_07]: top and anaerobic on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who are you talking to?
[SPEAKER_07]: A conference.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they laughed at you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was there to introduce living soil
concepts to a bunch of growers who were
[SPEAKER_07]: all over the map.
[SPEAKER_07]: From soil, full sun, indoor hydroponic,
you know, that defines the community.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all over the map.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So basically, you know, they were like,
you know, what the fuck do you know about
[SPEAKER_07]: soil?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's happened in the intervening four
years?
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done a pose.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did a podcast on shaping fire about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Has anyone picked up the technique and
used it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I've done.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've done, you know, five thousand foot
grows, six thousand foot grows.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big commercial grows and a shit ton of
little guys have called me, texted me to
[SPEAKER_07]: thank me on how well this works.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it took four fucking years and no
video.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to fix that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tom, do you want some of this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have a pipe?
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have a lighter?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lighter and a pipe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the match is over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everton won one nil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that good or bad?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a great man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like Everton?
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a good team.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a lighter.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was like, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know who has a lighter.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, Mr. Leighton Morrison.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_08]: The stage is yours.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'm suggesting for people is to
always use a mat underneath these pots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, the cool thing about these pots is
they have a vapor barrier, which I've
[SPEAKER_07]: always been telling people is critical
because you do not want moisture to escape
[SPEAKER_07]: the pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excess moisture.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to keep these sides in the soil
profiles from drying out.
[SPEAKER_07]: The top we're going to deal with with a
cover crop.
[SPEAKER_07]: But traditional smart pots that did not
have this liner had major issues because
[SPEAKER_07]: the sides went hydrophobic, which is when
the bacteria cyst up and create a wax
[SPEAKER_07]: coating around themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a bitch to rehydrate.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a wonderful product.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really happy that grassroots did
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what we're going to do today.
[SPEAKER_08]: And this is a 30 gallon.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a 30 gallon.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so if you notice, there is a band at
the bottom that will allow moisture to go
[SPEAKER_07]: through, which is ideal for this system,
because, again, we have that aquifer on
[SPEAKER_07]: the bottom that is designed to allow.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I didn't know you set the other one
up, which is designed to allow excess
[SPEAKER_07]: moisture to escape and be stored in the
profile.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's ideal if you can see when you're
watering, if you're overwatering,
[SPEAKER_07]: the excess is going to come out and build
up in the mat below.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of a safety mechanism.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you don't have or if you have pots that
are lined all the way down the side.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll see it versus have you being
oblivious to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is ideal because it's really
going to teach you how to water with this
[SPEAKER_07]: new system.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's it's a win win for you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, again, you'll be able to
see excess moisture if you have any.
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, it will be stored in that
system and wicked right back up again as
[SPEAKER_07]: it needs it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first step in this is to lay out
the horizons.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of pretty much brainless that
the lowest horizon is going to be right to
[SPEAKER_07]: this top of the fabric, which is about two
and a half inches or a little bit less.
[SPEAKER_07]: Two and a quarter inches, depending on
where I measure from.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: So our horizon is going to go right up to
the edge of this, which is ideal.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the rest of these measurements
are going to be to give us a general idea
[SPEAKER_07]: of where we're supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is five inches.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to hit that at a couple of
points around it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So now you're in increments of five
inches.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the concept is the the horizon,
which is the starting point.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is one unit of measurement.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then from there on out, each unit is
going to incrementally increase.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the first unit is two and a half.
[SPEAKER_07]: The second unit is five.
[SPEAKER_07]: The last one will be about 10 inches or a
little bit less because these pots aren't
[SPEAKER_08]: quite from the previous mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So think about it as E is two and a half.
[SPEAKER_07]: So times two would be your A horizon times
four would be your O horizon.
[SPEAKER_07]: So four times the A horizon.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the depth of the horizon.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that can be done in any any dimension.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're 36 inch deep, 24 inch deep,
just use those increments.
[SPEAKER_07]: E is one, A is two, O is four.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm just going to measure it,
finish marking these.
[SPEAKER_08]: And is there a bare minimum for the E or
like it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I mean, if you're getting into a pot
that's only 12 inches tall, then,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, it's kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_07]: To try to do all this, although I did it
for my girl's house plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And man, did they take off.
[SPEAKER_08]: So like, is there a minimum pot size below
which you'd be like just six inch,
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe, you know, something that's just so
small that your E horizon would be
[SPEAKER_07]: minuscule.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just do a mark.
[SPEAKER_08]: Would you bother with this in like three
or five gallon pots or just if I was
[SPEAKER_07]: transplanting?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I was transplanting out of that,
absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't waste the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would just use the O horizon because
you're going to be transplanting them into
[SPEAKER_07]: an O horizon.
[SPEAKER_07]: So why even bother with the A?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because if it's a temporary pot,
what's the point?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, this is a lot of work and it
becomes heavy.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you don't want to be dealing with that
excess weight.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, in a transplant situation,
everything's going to get all mixed up.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have our units of dimension.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're going to start with gravel.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is gravel that I got at a local
gravel pit.
[SPEAKER_08]: And are there different types of gravel?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to make sure it's jagged.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what about color?
[SPEAKER_07]: Color is great.
[SPEAKER_07]: The more different colors you can get
indicate different minerals.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So having like a mix of dark and light
color would be totally fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And no matter what size pot you start
with, this is the size of the gravel
[SPEAKER_03]: pieces you want to use.
[SPEAKER_07]: In deeper beds, I will do what's called a
two or three inch minus.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's rock that has been ground up
with a machine.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's all jagged, but they've sifted
through a screen, two inch, three inch,
[SPEAKER_07]: four inch, depending on what you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you get all the fines with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are these?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is just a three quarter gravel.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then I'm going to add in some sands.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have two different types of sand.
[SPEAKER_08]: Before you dump it in.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a coarse sand.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, it has quite a bit different
colors in it, different sizes.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this one, see how it's a little fine
for my liking, but again, it's not going
[SPEAKER_07]: to be a problem as long as it's not.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now it's like kitty litter sand.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that, you know, this is like beach
sand.
[SPEAKER_08]: Did you actually get this from the beach?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I just got it from the dunes behind my
house.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, it's not white powdery.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not white powdery.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's fine, but it's not super fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: You do not want the, you don't want that
powdery stuff because that'll plug up.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't want like the Caribbean fluff.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, really fine beach sand is
not ideal.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, actually LA sands great.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it sucks as beach sand,
but it's course it's good for this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's ideal where I am at our beach.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I have to go out there after
windstorms, after Santa Ana's because that
[SPEAKER_07]: blows all that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, and Oxnard it is fine.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Super fine sand.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish we had that in LA.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So bottom line is we have our base mixes
and I'm going to kind of homogenously
[SPEAKER_05]: blend them together here.
[SPEAKER_08]: This pot's not going to blow over.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have our sandbag as the bottom
layer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Trying to get rid of any excess organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: Layton destroyed a whole sand dunes
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_08]: This was in a vacant lot, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just bought the lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going to get trashed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_09]: That asshole ripping up the grass.
[SPEAKER_08]: So basically the course and the not fine,
but less course, you're just going to mix
[SPEAKER_08]: them together.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what are you looking to achieve if
you're just adding a layer in?
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, you know, if you're limited to
the sands that you have, just use what you
[SPEAKER_07]: have.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, like I know guys that are,
don't have access to these types of sand.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they just go to a masonry supply yard
and they purchase coarse masonry sand.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're going to do that,
you want to be looking for tan,
[SPEAKER_07]: brown, gray, not white, not fine,
but like colored sands that will indicate
[SPEAKER_07]: diverse nutrients in calcium carbonate or
just silica.
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, you're going to get a good mix
of organic nutrients at the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_07]: pot.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the purpose of this layer of sand?
[SPEAKER_07]: This is called an aquifer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you think about the way nature
stores water, she does not let organic
[SPEAKER_07]: matter get in.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the biggest problem that we have is
that when we put organic matter on top of
[SPEAKER_07]: this, if we don't have a sand filter,
then the fines can get down in there and
[SPEAKER_07]: then eventually go anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the roots will be growing through.
[SPEAKER_07]: The roots will go down and create channels
and then they will die off and the biology
[SPEAKER_07]: will eat it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it won't be like fines, like organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Organic fines are a real problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's when you see what's called a black
layer in the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do a lot of testing, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I go out to soil sites and I dig pits
and I look down and I can see where the
[SPEAKER_07]: plow pan is because it's a black layer of
anaerobic organisms.
[SPEAKER_08]: So is that just super compact soil?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what happens is over time,
the fines migrate and they hit that
[SPEAKER_07]: compaction layer and they can't go any
further.
[SPEAKER_07]: What did you say, the plow pan?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called plow pan.
[SPEAKER_07]: It depends on where you are in the
country.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's plow pan or hard pan or anaerobic
layer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the depth at which the plows can no
longer reach.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here in Oxnard, they have deep rippers or
chisel plows that go down about two and a
[SPEAKER_07]: half feet, three feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: For what purpose?
[SPEAKER_07]: For all the strawberry farms?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the strawberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So up there you may need to go down three
or four.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: The equipment can't get any deeper.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you're looking at the soil?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I'm looking at the soil, I use a
backhoe or an excavator so I can dig as
[SPEAKER_07]: deep as I want.
[SPEAKER_07]: But often I'll see these layers and then I
go, OK, now I know whether I've got to
[SPEAKER_07]: build on top of that soil or whether I can
remediate it depending on how bad that
[SPEAKER_07]: plow pan is.
[SPEAKER_08]: But when you mean build up, you mean like?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Build right up on top of the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a lot of guys call me about,
hey, I'm in North Cal.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got this clay soil that will not drain.
[SPEAKER_07]: So up you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't even mess with digging a hole.
[SPEAKER_07]: As soon as you dig that hole, all the
water is going to go there and it's going
[SPEAKER_07]: to create an anaerobic soup and kill your
plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that going to happen anyway,
even when you build on top of it?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's just going to hit that top soil
and drain off the sides.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that hole is like a swimming pool
surrounded by hard stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: So any water that gets that low is going
to go into that hole.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, impermeable soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're creating a swamp.
[SPEAKER_08]: When the roots eventually make it down
into that area, you said they die off or
[SPEAKER_08]: they're living and getting their minerals.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll live until the plant dies.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then they'll decompose.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they'll decompose.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, it won't be fines because the
biology around the rhiosphere of the root
[SPEAKER_07]: will eat that up and consume it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also disproportionately more rock
mass than roots.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I'm not concerned about it on
the long term.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tom, that is service.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that a grapefruit?
[SPEAKER_07]: It is a grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want one?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm good right now, but I'll
definitely hit that up later.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, so now that we've got our...
When we get really crazy, we'll crack open
[SPEAKER_08]: the flavored seltzer water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now that we have our eHorizon in place,
it's important to... What kind of crazy
[SPEAKER_07]: gizmo is this?
[SPEAKER_08]: You just hit the... Don't aim it at me
though.
[SPEAKER_08]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we just want to water this in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should see a little excess water coming
out the sides.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give it a couple of minutes.
[SPEAKER_08]: For it to start... For me to see it coming
out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now you can see it changing color.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to get too crazy,
but I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Take the time to do it right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just make sure that there are no voids
because if we have a void, then our sand
[SPEAKER_07]: filter is no longer functioning properly.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I'm packing it by doing this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a void would be like a bubble?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, any pocket that would allow those
fines to get down in there, which is the
[SPEAKER_07]: whole purpose of this filter is to prevent
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is to keep all the soil stuff from
getting down into the rock, the rock's
[SPEAKER_08]: homes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do we have any excess moisture?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, but the edge of the pot's black.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you like the height of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Layton, so far, are you happy with the
work you've done?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think this is great because this is
the horizon that's most important.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, if you screw up your A horizon a
little bit, it's not going to be an issue
[SPEAKER_07]: if your clay to silt to sand ratios are
off.
[SPEAKER_07]: No stress.
[SPEAKER_07]: But here, this one is the most important
because if you screw up this, you're going
[SPEAKER_07]: to have nothing but problems all the way
down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think we're in good shape here.
[SPEAKER_07]: That looks nice and settled, smooth.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't see any issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: With pockets starting to see some moisture
come through the sides.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's not excess moisture, but we did do
accomplish the goal, which was to make
[SPEAKER_07]: sure that we got this nice and nice and
moist so that it completely collapsed on
[SPEAKER_07]: itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we're going to move into making.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so we did just a recap.
[SPEAKER_08]: How many inches of rock?
[SPEAKER_07]: About two and a quarter inches.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a total of two and a quarter.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then you do four and a half of sand.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go five of eight.
[SPEAKER_07]: The A horizon, the sand and the gravel are
the E horizon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, the rock layer at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_08]: The rock is just two and a quarter inches.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, whatever the whole layer,
that whole layer we just put in is two and
[SPEAKER_07]: a quarter.
[SPEAKER_08]: A rock plus sand.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_08]: But is there a ratio between rock to sand?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: The ratio rock to sand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like if I had a little bit more rock,
I would have put that in there as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, I just didn't bring enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have brought another bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, also, is the idea that at this point
now, the sand has filled in all the voids
[SPEAKER_03]: within the rock.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if if you're using rock to the two and
a quarter, two and a half inch depth,
[SPEAKER_07]: you're going to have a bigger challenge of
getting that sand to work all the way into
[SPEAKER_07]: the bottom in between.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want it to get a little muddy because
only when it's in that state.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fill everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fill all the voids.
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you want the sand like the rock was
laid down first with air pockets?
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you want the sand to fill in all
those air pockets?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's why I love the products
like the two or two and a half or three or
[SPEAKER_07]: four inch minus, because you're getting
all of that broken, you know, stone dust,
[SPEAKER_07]: rock dust mixed with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, I'm still going to put sand on
top of that layer just to make sure
[SPEAKER_07]: everything gets washed down into the
pockets.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the taller the rock layer,
the more challenging it is to get all of
[SPEAKER_07]: those voids way down at the bottom of that
rock layer to fill with sand.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's when it's really important that you
water the hell out of it until you know
[SPEAKER_07]: that there's not there's no voids in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So and in some cases, I'll even take a hoe
and just kind of hoe it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you had a raised bed that was like
this high, your sand rock layer is going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be proportionately probably six inches.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the size of your gravel pieces will
still be like no larger.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to use larger gravel
pieces, are you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: In commercial.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the largest gravel piece you'll
use?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it'll depend on the depth of the
bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the biggest depth bed you've used?
[SPEAKER_07]: Thirty six inches.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it was about an eight inch horizon,
the horizon.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in that case, we didn't go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we ended up using three inch minus
in that application.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't use monster boulders because
you're just complicating yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're making it more difficult on
yourself.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have this layer, which is almost
like a layer of cement at the bottom,
[SPEAKER_08]: but it's it's breathable cement.
[SPEAKER_07]: Call it a sand filter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Google, Google sand filter,
sand filters are used in all different
[SPEAKER_07]: types of applications.
[SPEAKER_07]: From golf courses to aquaculture.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's for filtering out fines.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're doing we're again biomimicking
existing.
[SPEAKER_08]: You built your very first sand filter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, sounds like the sand is like of the
two components, the actual critical,
[SPEAKER_03]: the critical one.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the rock is for the mycorrhizae.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, because we're going to have
fungus that's getting down into those
[SPEAKER_07]: rocks and mining materials and feeding
them back up to the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know eventually would break down,
but what would happen if you use like wood
[SPEAKER_08]: chips at the bottom?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, turn to mud.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then you'd have a swamp.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: The whole goal is to prevent that layer
from ever becoming a swamp.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, which is why it's a sand.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then you can do whatever you want
above it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Essentially, I mean, you could just throw
on just super soil right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the key is the next layer is going to
be like the heart and lungs for the soil
[SPEAKER_07]: system.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going to help to pull that
moisture out of the horizon and wick it
[SPEAKER_07]: back up into the over.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's get on to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So next, we're actually going to skip
making the A horizon and we're going to go
[SPEAKER_07]: right into the E horizon.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason we're doing this is because
our A horizon has 20 percent organic
[SPEAKER_07]: matter in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's the same as the O horizon.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to use some of the O
horizon to mix into our A horizon.
[SPEAKER_08]: O horizon is the top horizon.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's E A O.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the sand one called?
[SPEAKER_08]: Aluvial.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there are only three layers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So think about the abbreviation E stands
for alluvial.
[SPEAKER_07]: O stands for organic layer.
[SPEAKER_07]: A is just a it's a if there's no there's
no classification for that name.
[SPEAKER_07]: It goes A, B, C, bedrock and or E horizon,
depending on where you are in the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's you know, that's soil science.
[SPEAKER_07]: I didn't come up with this.
[SPEAKER_08]: Isn't your cat's name alluvial?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a good cat name.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me get my next child alluvial.
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the correct pronunciation?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alluvial layers are really I'm going to
weave that into a conversation in the next
[SPEAKER_08]: day.
[SPEAKER_07]: So alluvial is really cool because it
really should be broken up into multiple
[SPEAKER_07]: horizons or multiple zones because it
actually goes from inside down in the
[SPEAKER_07]: water a few feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: To up on the land by a few hundred yards,
depending on the plant species.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of one of those zones that
really should be broken up into multiple
[SPEAKER_07]: zones.
[SPEAKER_07]: You shouldn't count what's underwater with
what's above water just because the plants
[SPEAKER_07]: there dictate that that's a wet soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, you know, I'm not here to bash
the way soil systems are set up other than
[SPEAKER_07]: I hate the dogma.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll be a little snarky about it,
though.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, OK, Layton, where's the camera?
[SPEAKER_07]: Other than the fact that I strongly
dispute the way soil science classifies
[SPEAKER_07]: sand, silt, and clay based on their
particulate size, not based on specific
[SPEAKER_07]: gravity, whether they're magnetically
charged or not, and where they're formed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Silt does not come from rock.
[SPEAKER_07]: Silt comes from organic matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sand comes from rock.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it would break down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it does.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sand comes from rock and clay come from
rock.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that clay is formed through glaciers
or volcanoes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sand can come from the ocean, ancient
coral beds or shellfish beds, or it can
[SPEAKER_07]: come from just broken down rock,
broken down mineral.
[SPEAKER_07]: So clay has a magnetic charge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sand is not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Silt has a negative charge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clay actually has a positive and negative
charge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Silt has just a negative charge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sand has no charge.
[SPEAKER_07]: So why do we call these different things
based on sieve size, based on their
[SPEAKER_07]: particle size?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's dogma.
[SPEAKER_07]: That needs to be changed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's my only bitch with soil
science.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the way you describe that in plain
English makes total sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: So why do other soil scientists have such
a difficult time being like, that makes
[SPEAKER_08]: sense?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because they were taught through
university, college, and traditional
[SPEAKER_07]: educational dogma that has not been
changed for hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's kind of like we treat
cancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: We treat cancer the same way we have for
50 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where's the improvement people?
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're saying that the plants are
interacting with the different charges,
[SPEAKER_03]: not with the particulates.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there's so much going on with the
charges.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're getting into anions and cations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I didn't really mean to open up a can
of worms here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you did.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sure everyone watching will.
[SPEAKER_08]: Appreciate a little knowledge drop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now we got all of our different
ingredients for.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is basically like mulch, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's chips.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's chips that are aged for at least a
year and a half.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do not have aged chips,
don't use them.
[SPEAKER_07]: They will steal nitrogen from your soil
system.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so it's almost like they've been
buffered.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is some fine screen compost that I
made.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to have lots of earthworms.
[SPEAKER_08]: At the house?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Fuck yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I actually make my product with this stuff
and I microscope it and I know that shit's
[SPEAKER_07]: killer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we have.
[SPEAKER_08]: Look at that little rolly polly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you get everything in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gosh.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll have millipedes, you'll have
nematodes, you'll have earthworms,
[SPEAKER_07]: all kinds of goodies.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a little rolly polly.
[SPEAKER_08]: Set it free.
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember when Jemma was setting the rolly
pollies free?
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we have some Agro Coco from a company
here in LA that I highly recommend.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can purchase this nationally.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the company?
[SPEAKER_07]: Agro Coco.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, that's the name of the company.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you say what each one of these adds to
the mix, what it's providing?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's providing what I would consider a
diverse group of organic matter
[SPEAKER_07]: components.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, again, diversity is key.
[SPEAKER_07]: The more diverse things we have,
the better.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is high in potassium.
[SPEAKER_07]: The potassium is locked up, so it will not
affect your saturated paste test.
[SPEAKER_07]: Incredible water holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, Agro Coco does something no other
cocoa company does, which is they compress
[SPEAKER_07]: their product to only 2.2 pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: The ones in the Far East compressed to 10
pounds.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they destroy.
[SPEAKER_07]: It destroys the water holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're talking about when they ship it as
bricks?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: And worse, their cocoa comes from what's
called brackish water.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's high in chlorine.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd like to drink some brackish water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's high in chloride and high in
sodium.
[SPEAKER_07]: And also, the way they handle it,
they're running equipment all over it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're doing it on a scale where they're
spilling hydraulic fluid and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_07]: contaminants all over the stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then they press it down.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like if Tom's Mustang were leaking
oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: All over our soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: And Tom was driving all over the cocoa
coir.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here we have a little pit moss,
grower's grade.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've heard him talk about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a pit moss question later.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I am anti-peat.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's only 3% of the world's surface is
covered with peat bogs.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're incredibly important as far as
filting water for all of our aquifers and
[SPEAKER_07]: drinking water, rivers and streams.
[SPEAKER_07]: So to destroy them, to harvest them,
to harvest a product is lunacy,
[SPEAKER_07]: to say the least.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, it's its own diverse ecosystem
that cannot be built.
[SPEAKER_07]: It took millions of years to build it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we're never going to see those again
as long as we continue to mine them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So stop using peat, please.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then here I have a little bit of
what's called steer compost.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it has a little bit of cow manure in
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been pasteurized.
[SPEAKER_08]: By weed free, it means like seeds and like
shit that'll sprout up.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's anti-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we got to let everybody play nice in
the box.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's essentially, and this is going
to be straw for the top layer.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, again, a mulching in so that
our soil doesn't dry out until we start
[SPEAKER_07]: getting plants in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And hopefully we'll get some cover crop
seeds going in that soon after we build
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, I was going to bring some of the
daikon over.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of different ones I like.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like the creeping lavender.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, vatch is cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clover, be careful because it can be a
pest attractor.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, again, do your homework.
[SPEAKER_07]: I recommend again all about diversity,
diversity, diversity, diversity,
[SPEAKER_07]: and then pay attention to what's gross.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if it doesn't grow there, if it
doesn't like your situation, don't do it
[SPEAKER_07]: again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Pick something else.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, play with it.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no reason not to do a thousand
cover crop species and see which one grows
[SPEAKER_07]: and which one doesn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all just food.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all fodder for the system to feed the
biology.
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't be afraid to experiment,
but learn your lesson.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it doesn't work the first time,
don't repeat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any that a lot of people use
that you like to avoid?
[SPEAKER_07]: There are ones that grow up and I consider
too fast for the plant to keep up with.
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, you want low lying creeping
plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's lavender.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like daikon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Daikon is another one.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a few different creepers that I
really love.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you got to look at the cover crop in
the way that it's preventing the surface
[SPEAKER_07]: of the soil from drying out, whether it's
from wind or sun.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's creating a microclimate right at the
soil surface, which is ideal for biology
[SPEAKER_07]: and for earthworms and for roly polys and
all of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So and then better yet, it's growing miles
of Riosphere.
[SPEAKER_07]: Which is the organisms that we want to be
doing our work, our nutrient cycling,
[SPEAKER_07]: and you're doing it for free.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you do get mycorrhizae,
which I suggest you do with this style
[SPEAKER_07]: system, because it can mine material.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has the things it needs.
[SPEAKER_07]: It will connect with all of your different
cover crops and share nutrients all
[SPEAKER_07]: throughout the whole system.
[SPEAKER_07]: They all work in conjunction.
[SPEAKER_07]: So based on our dimension here,
I got to assume that's going to be about
[SPEAKER_07]: two buckets times four.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's your calculation so that someone
can?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what I did was I figured out what I
used at the bottom was was three quarters,
[SPEAKER_07]: three quarters, three quarters,
half.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I used about two buckets on the on the
bottom layer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to assume that I'm going to
use about eight buckets on the top layer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we got four to one.
[SPEAKER_07]: A bucket of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a bucket of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: A bucket of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I need an empty bucket.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, again, you don't have to get
too anal with this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nature isn't perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to air is only human.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we're up to four buckets.
[SPEAKER_07]: That'll be five buckets.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you notice, I'm not putting them
all in at once.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of just layering them together here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now shovels.
[SPEAKER_07]: Shovels right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: My loyal assistant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, it's so interesting because it always
seems like it's more than you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: need.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, it's always good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's always good to mix up a little extra.
[SPEAKER_05]: Try to go all the way down to the bottom
with that core flipping around.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, whatever we don't use,
we're going to store.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, ideally, I like to use a cement mixer
for this because it will mix everything
[SPEAKER_07]: homogeneously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But unfortunately, it's not worthy for
this little project.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm also putting that in your truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not worthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, maybe worthy was a bad word to be
choice of words.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, but the mixer, just like in your
kitchen, probably gets it like totally
[SPEAKER_03]: ground up.
[SPEAKER_08]: So did you just go rogue on the one bucket
of each concept?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you notice that made you decide
you wanted to dump a bunch of more pit
[SPEAKER_08]: moss in?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because we were only at six buckets.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm estimating eight, but I probably
am wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think I'm probably going to end up
needing six total, but we shall see.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're going to put more of everything
in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, I've used up everything that I
had.
[SPEAKER_08]: But point being, it doesn't matter that
you are disproportionately a little more.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, again, it's, you know, a lot of guys
just use one third core, one third rice
[SPEAKER_07]: holes, one third pit moss, no peat moss
people, people, please people,
[SPEAKER_07]: I should say.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, no, if you do that, it's not going
to it won't mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, we just got to keep.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can grab all the corners and keep
throwing it up in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's pretty homogenous now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not too bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think, Peter?
[SPEAKER_03]: It looks pretty homogenous.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_07]: Smells like heaven.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but what do you think?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: That smell says it all.
[SPEAKER_07]: That smells like Dover.
[SPEAKER_07]: Smells like the woods.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: When you did go out in the woods and step
on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's moist.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little moist.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, you know, when you're mixing wet
ingredients, especially for your A
[SPEAKER_07]: Horizon, you have to dry them out because
if you don't dry them out, they're going
[SPEAKER_07]: to be all clumpy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so therefore, you're never going to
get it homogenously mixed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, that's why I like to use a
cement mixer, especially for the A
[SPEAKER_07]: Horizon, because that one's hard.
[SPEAKER_08]: Especially if you're doing bigger
projects.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, this is a 130 gallon bucket.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if you're if you're filling like 30
four by four raised beds.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, if I'm doing that, that's a commercial
blend.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I work with companies all over the
country that blend for high performance
[SPEAKER_07]: sports fields, golf courses, shit like
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the key to that is, though,
is knowing your inputs.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of these golf courses won't have
all or these soil blenders will not have
[SPEAKER_07]: all the components you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to go out and speak to local
people, find sources for the silt and the
[SPEAKER_07]: clay, maybe.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then have it trucked in and then
blended.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a little bit of a job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Plus, when I'm doing a job like that,
I test every component and I'm anal,
[SPEAKER_07]: like crazy about making sure that what I
saw, what I grabbed, what I tested is what
[SPEAKER_07]: ended up in the in the mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't be lazy about this shit,
people, because, man, the guys at these
[SPEAKER_07]: blending places, they don't give a flying
fuck about you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have to do the homework.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to do your due diligence.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or you're going to get fucked.
[SPEAKER_07]: Bottom line.
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't count on anybody to do their job.
[SPEAKER_07]: Count on yourself to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially not at scale, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Especially at scale.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's when you get killed.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we're going to wrap this up and
pull it off to the side.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, let's pull it into the sun and
blend in the shade.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's get smart about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hot as hell out here in L.A.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a New England boy.
[SPEAKER_07]: My blood's a little thick.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have another tarp?
[SPEAKER_08]: I do.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can we grab it?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tommy, you want to hold this one?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me find my keys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ah, but it's nice and cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's what I love about
Southern California.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're too hot, you just go in the
shade.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Leighton, freestyle on cations and
anions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cations and anions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cations are sites in the soil that attract
nutrients of the opposite charge.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a cation is negatively charged,
like a clay platelet.
[SPEAKER_07]: And around the outside of that clay
platelet, it looks like a flying saucer,
[SPEAKER_07]: is 100 sites.
[SPEAKER_07]: In those 100 sites, we want to attract 75
parts of those, should be calcium.
[SPEAKER_07]: 17% of those should be magnesium.
[SPEAKER_07]: And eight of those should be potassium.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I see that in a saturated paste test,
I know that the basic soil health is in
[SPEAKER_07]: good shape for me to go ahead and plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: The next thing I look at is your
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are key to different critical plant
functions.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did a conference called learnlivingsoils
.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: Chip and I got into this pretty deep.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you want to, you can still purchase
replays and watch that section
[SPEAKER_07]: specifically so you better understand how
these nutrients affect the plant's
[SPEAKER_07]: physiology.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then now we get into anions.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anions are positively charged soil
particles that attract negatively charged
[SPEAKER_07]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, when you have a soil test,
you will see your percentage of CEC,
[SPEAKER_07]: which is cation exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_07]: They will often do an anion report as
well.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you really want to be focused more on
the cation exchange capacity, CEC,
[SPEAKER_07]: because that is your major nutrients.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are your really important ones.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of misnomers about nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a tremendous amount of nitrogen
already in soil systems and in the air
[SPEAKER_07]: around us.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a matter of capturing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the same is true with phosphorus and
potassium to some degree.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is why it's so important to do a soil
test.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I highly recommend you do a test prior
to the grow and after the grow so you can
[SPEAKER_07]: see what that cultivar stripped from your
soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: In a perfect regenerative agriculture,
50% of what you grow is being left in the
[SPEAKER_07]: soil for the next grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do not do that, you are removing
more than you're leaving behind.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's something to think about.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in a high value plant, you're not
going to leave half your cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_07]: behind.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you do not test your nutrients,
especially if you're running the same
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivar multiple times, you will have
deficiencies of some kind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Each cultivar removes different nutrients
at different levels.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's important you do your soil
testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's something that I think the
cannabis industry as a whole has neglected
[SPEAKER_07]: to deal with.
[SPEAKER_07]: They've kind of just bro-science did.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just threw more and more and more at
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I get calls about nutrient lock.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so this is how to avoid wasting money
purchasing nutrients that you don't need.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is nutrient lock?
[SPEAKER_07]: Nutrient lock is when you get out of
balance with the different nutrients in
[SPEAKER_07]: the system.
[SPEAKER_07]: pH is one thing that can screw that up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing is you have too much of one
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_07]: It locks out another nutrient.
[SPEAKER_07]: It just causes havoc.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, you want to have balanced
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give an example of one where if you have
too much of it, the plant won't be able to
[SPEAKER_08]: uptake the other one.
[SPEAKER_07]: You've all heard about nitrogen sickness.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the plant starts to hermy,
freaks out, because it locks out all the
[SPEAKER_07]: other nutrients.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a lot of these different
relationships that can screw you up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, I'm not a soil chemist.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a good friendship, Osborne,
from Osborne Organics, who I often chop it
[SPEAKER_07]: up with to talk about these different
interactions between nutrients.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I get a soil test, again,
I'll read through the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I focus first on the saturated paste test.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I look for your micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_07]: If those two are in balance, then I'll go
up and look at the relationship of sulfur
[SPEAKER_07]: to calcium and some of these other
critical relationships.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for the most part, if you have those
first few steps OK, you're not going to
[SPEAKER_07]: have any issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're also saying you definitely want
to test in between harvest?
No.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to test when you start and after
you've harvested, just to make sure that
[SPEAKER_07]: you didn't lose something because you're
not being regenerative.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not putting back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Think about this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always tell people everything that
you're not using, your stalks,
[SPEAKER_07]: your leaves, everything should be returned
to the soil because it took those
[SPEAKER_07]: nutrients out of that soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's exactly what that plant needs to
have put back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So even if it's trim, even if it's low
grade trim or moldy bud, crunch it up,
[SPEAKER_07]: grind it up, do whatever the hell you
want, but put it back into the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: People, oh, the mold will spread.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the mold is because you're an idiot.
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't have a balanced soil system.
[SPEAKER_07]: You didn't have a healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not going to spread to the next
plant as long as you have good biology.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're growing with salts, forget it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to kill yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you have a healthy soil system,
all of that's food.
[SPEAKER_07]: That petritis, that fusarium is all just
going to get gobbled up by the other
[SPEAKER_07]: organisms that are in the soil unless you
are out of control, out of balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if your plant is died because of
fusarium and you snap it open and that
[SPEAKER_07]: nasty white pussy stuff comes out,
get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if you have a little bit in there,
it's not the end of the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just common sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: Common fucking sense, people.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really not that hard.
[SPEAKER_07]: But those are some of the things that I
think are missing in the deeper
[SPEAKER_07]: understanding of living soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're just growing with a super
soil, don't bother getting crazy and doing
compost teas and all this.
I mean, yes, those compost teas will
unlock the nutrients that you put in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's never going to last in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they don't have what they need to live
on, there's no way they're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: sustain in that soil system.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're just growing with a super
soil, don't bother getting crazy and doing
[SPEAKER_07]: compost teas and all this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yes, those compost teas will
unlock the nutrients that you put in
[SPEAKER_07]: there, but it's never going to colonize.
[SPEAKER_07]: Therefore, you're going to always have to
be adding these compost teas back in.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how cannabis was grown when it was
pushed indoors.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they realized that these salt grows
were a problem and the taste was a problem
[SPEAKER_07]: and the high wasn't the same.
[SPEAKER_07]: They started talking to their parents and
grandparents and said, hey, when you guys
[SPEAKER_07]: grew, how did you do it?
[SPEAKER_07]: And the hippies, they knew what they were
doing, but they didn't understand the
[SPEAKER_07]: relationship of the soil that they were
putting in the ground.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were just putting their potting soil
in these pits up on the mountains.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there was an incredible microbial
community that would tap right into that
[SPEAKER_07]: plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, they had these amazing nutrient
formulas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of the formulas I saw from the oldies
or the OGs were really fucking impressive.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, man, how did you guys know all
of those nutrients and that balance?
[SPEAKER_07]: I figured that they probably learned by
repeating and seeing different things more
[SPEAKER_07]: so than being like, oh, I'm a soil
scientist.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need this, this, this, and this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So eventually, the indoor guys started
going, OK, we got to get away from salts.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's too expensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we want to go to a living soil like
our grandparents or great grandparents
[SPEAKER_07]: grew.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want that fire that we used to have
when we were growing up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so then the push to living soils came
around.
[SPEAKER_07]: But again, the biggest problem with the
living soils was there's no sand,
[SPEAKER_07]: silt, and clay.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was just purely organic matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of the communities, multiple
communities of microorganisms that
[SPEAKER_07]: successionally pushed that soil through
its many, many different phases were not
[SPEAKER_07]: present because there was nothing for them
to live on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it gets complicated in the thought of
just how many communities you've prevented
[SPEAKER_07]: from colonizing by not including those
basic sand, silt, and clay ingredients.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's all about biomimicry.
[SPEAKER_07]: All I'm doing is copying the way nature
does it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you do that, that system will last
you a lifetime.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sure, you're going to have to amend the
ohorizon.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some of it's going to get gobbled up.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's just a matter of top dressing
between cycles.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like you'd have to drag this
whole thing in and out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I worked with a client who had a budget of
$270,000 for a soil system, which he had
[SPEAKER_07]: to replace after every fucking grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I spent $50,000 and built him a system
he's never going to have to touch.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're saying like innumerable numbers
of harvests out of?
[SPEAKER_03]: Ever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you live.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, you may have to add a little.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't afford not to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nobody can.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's in these guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: These salt growers are just like,
oh, I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you're going to bring in all these bad
things.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to have all these problems.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you do this right and you inoculate it
right, you're not going to have any issues
[SPEAKER_07]: whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you have the sand, silt,
and clay.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have the diversity of the
microorganisms that will keep everything
[SPEAKER_07]: in balance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you're going to have a little shit
here and there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you're not going to have the
infestations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dry farmers on the banks of the Eel
River, aren't they?
[SPEAKER_08]: Tom Weaves, dry farming in every
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it makes me think of this because
aren't they naturally doing this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Isn't it naturally happening?
[SPEAKER_03]: So dry farming is not dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing dry about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're building on an aquifer.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: All that refers to is water coming from
the top down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Leaking out of the sign of the mountains,
leaking out of the sides, oozing out,
[SPEAKER_07]: and coming out of the form.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why those farms only work where
they have that aquifer at the right level.
[SPEAKER_08]: But they definitely have a lot of
nutrients there.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're right by the river.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm saying before you get down to the
water, isn't there the silt and sand,
[SPEAKER_03]: the levels doing the same thing?
[SPEAKER_08]: The banks of a river is not a bad spot for
a plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's ideal.
[SPEAKER_08]: It could find worse places.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you fly over the country, everywhere
you see a green stripe is a river.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though you have the fields mowed down
with crops everywhere else, where the crop
[SPEAKER_07]: fields stop, you'll see these green
snake-like things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are just cricks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are where all that groundwater is
oozing out and providing all of the
[SPEAKER_07]: necessary elements for those plants to
grow in diverse environments.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's dry farming.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's just, again, nature doing its
thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Layden, equally as important,
are you a socks and sandals kind of guy?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I guess so.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess so.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got caught.
[SPEAKER_07]: I should have worn my black socks.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's all about Baby Yoda, so fuck the
socks.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's next?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we need about three buckets of our
sand, silt, and clay mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I have here is I have two
different sand, silt, or clay,
[SPEAKER_07]: silt mixes with some sand.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this has got about 45% sand in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has a little bit of rock.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one is more closer to 50% sand,
and you can look at it all.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the sand.
[SPEAKER_07]: But also in here is this one is about 20%
clay.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one is about 19% clay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I was really happy about the clay
levels in these.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where were you sourcing this from?
[SPEAKER_07]: These are from different soil blenders in
my area.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as part of my job, I'm always finding
out who's got what so that I can work if
[SPEAKER_07]: the jobs come, which they do.
[SPEAKER_07]: They usually do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these are two different sources,
but you can see they're definitely
[SPEAKER_07]: different.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one's darker.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one's a little bit more orange.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think this one is the one that came from
the mudslides.
[SPEAKER_07]: And like Carpinteria?
[SPEAKER_07]: No.
[SPEAKER_07]: This one came from Santa Barbara mudslides
on a 101.
[SPEAKER_07]: It might be Carpinteria.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, maybe it is Carpinteria.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's right in that area.
[SPEAKER_07]: These guys got I don't know how many
hundred millions of yards of this shit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was on top of their homes.
[SPEAKER_08]: They started a whole business out of
disaster.
[SPEAKER_07]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, they had trucks running for four
months straight.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: 24 hours a day just trying to get that
road opened up again.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now they're sieving it and doing
different things.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these guys were like, we will take
every dump truck road.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this stuff came from a river project.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they were cleaning up the river so it
didn't overflow.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's in Oxnard.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's up north.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's towards Santa Paula.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is stuff that came from right next
to the river?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: They were dragging out the river because
as the river comes down in these
[SPEAKER_07]: incredible rainstorms, it builds these
sandbars.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the sandbars keep building and
building, and then it overflows the sides
[SPEAKER_07]: of the banks.
[SPEAKER_07]: So these guys go in and they clean that
all up in between these major storms.
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, this one's a little bit more
silty, which is why it's darker.
[SPEAKER_07]: But is it nutrient rich?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the silt is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, is this the E layer?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, these are both part of the A.
[SPEAKER_07]: The O was already made.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's our O.
[SPEAKER_07]: O is top.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is E.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these are A's middle.
[SPEAKER_07]: E-A-O.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just think of the E-A-O.
[SPEAKER_08]: What was that song?
[SPEAKER_08]: E-A-E-A-O.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, now we're mixing these.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're going to mix these together.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, guys, if you can afford to get
more multiple sources of this stuff,
[SPEAKER_07]: go for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you see how that holds together?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the clay.
[SPEAKER_07]: And clay has so much nutrient,
and everyone's scared of clay,
[SPEAKER_07]: which I just don't understand.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess it's the fear of not knowing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's back up a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're saying to the audience,
if you can get multiple amounts of
[SPEAKER_07]: different sources of silt, different
sources of clay, grab them up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grab them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mix them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tom, we have a lot of room on your
driveway.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of weight storage.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it is a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we got to add in 20% organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was about two buckets.
[SPEAKER_07]: And let me do the math real quick here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Into this layer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want this to be A.
80%.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we had two buckets.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to use half a bucket.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Close enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, you guys don't have to get crazy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just smoked weed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're going to trust my math.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably wrong.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's not far off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good with the math.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm going with the man with the socks and
the sandals.
[SPEAKER_08]: We call that weed math.
[SPEAKER_08]: So do you feel like Martin Luther in the
early days of the Protestant Reformation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they laughed at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you feel like Carrie?
[SPEAKER_03]: Carrie?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to laugh at you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Carrie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Carrie's a little dark for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Normally, what I would do in this
situation, if this was a big job,
[SPEAKER_07]: is I would install this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if I'm going to go over eight inches of
depth, then I would put in half of that
[SPEAKER_07]: first.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I would inoculate it with a high
grade compost tee.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sorry, half of the sand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Half of the layer.
[SPEAKER_07]: So say it's 10 inches, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Say our horizon is 10 inches.
[SPEAKER_07]: It isn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're only at five.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're talking the A horizon or the E
horizon?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, the E is fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: E, I'd leave it like it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, if I had aquatic microorganisms,
I would install them in this.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I'm doing a big job, I'm going to
have all of the organisms I want.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have my aquatic microorganisms,
my AMOs.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll have my IMOs.
[SPEAKER_08]: Do you have any AMOs here?
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not at the moment.
[SPEAKER_07]: But that's not an issue because we can
water them in.
[SPEAKER_07]: They'll find their way down.
[SPEAKER_07]: To where they want to have a home.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are these microscopic little aquatic
organisms?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the biggest misnomer is that aquatic
microorganisms can't live in a terrestrial
[SPEAKER_07]: environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: And terrestrial organisms can't live in an
aquatic environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone knows that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, people.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want you to think about before the
Great Human Expansion, when our skies
[SPEAKER_07]: darkened with migratory birds and fowl and
our lands were ripped up by huge herds of
[SPEAKER_07]: buffalo, deer, moose.
[SPEAKER_07]: They would trash through river streams,
ponds, lakes and rip that stuff up onto
[SPEAKER_07]: land for miles and miles as it slowly
dried or the biofilm caked their hair and
[SPEAKER_07]: their hair fell off.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so they were naturally colonizing,
moving everything all over the place.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we don't have that anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's why I've been using aquatic
microorganisms since 2008.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how I started down at Rodale was in
2010 as I brought a vial of this stuff to
[SPEAKER_07]: Elaine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where do you source them from?
[SPEAKER_07]: From aquaculture.
[SPEAKER_07]: I worked with a lot of different
aquaculture companies to help them clean
[SPEAKER_07]: up their anaerobic pockets so they had
better fish health.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I, in turn, would get the fish for us,
which is what I wanted in the first place.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'd essentially work for them for free.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then I'd get a better product from
them to work with in my job.
[SPEAKER_07]: So anyway, Petco, you should work with
Petco because they know the tropical fish
[SPEAKER_07]: have a lot of diseases.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of tropical fish.
[SPEAKER_07]: We try to take again, you know,
I wouldn't harvest from a source that I
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I worked with many different aquaculture
companies up and down the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're ones I will never go back to.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they're ones that I've focused on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my good friend, Keith Wilda,
finally is willing to bring his fish waste
[SPEAKER_07]: to the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've taught him how to stabilize it.
[SPEAKER_07]: How do you test it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Microscope.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_07]: And his company is called fishbrew.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I highly recommend that you reach out
to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're presently getting through all of
the regulatory in all 49 states.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're not going to be doing Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_07]: So soon they'll be able to sell and ship
this product all over the country.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I highly recommend people use them.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a wonderful inoculant.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to have incredible yeast
plumes, which make way for the saprophytic
[SPEAKER_07]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to have aquatic nematodes.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to have testate amoeba,
which live on the soil or in the water
[SPEAKER_07]: environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Same with rotifers.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to get incredible amounts of
amoeba and flagellates, which live again
[SPEAKER_07]: in the soil and in the aquatic
environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, you're getting all the
goodies.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any baddies that come along with
it?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, because it has been aerobically
stabilized.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a process I taught Keith.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like the cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I first introduced this to them,
he laughed his ass off at me for years.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, what the fuck are you doing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like Terry, they laughed at him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I've been laughed at a lot in my life.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, look at even Peter's give me
shit about my white socks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're going to have the last laugh.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was kind of deserving.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget about Yoda.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now we've mixed this up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And traditionally, when I would install a
layer again over eight inches deep,
[SPEAKER_07]: I would do it in two lifts.
[SPEAKER_07]: So each lift would be about four inches.
[SPEAKER_07]: I put a lift in and I would spray my
highly concentrated organic tea compost
[SPEAKER_07]: extract on here till it glazed.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to soak it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want a nice glazing, like a glazed
donut.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I put the next layer on top and I'd
glaze it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then I'd install my horizon on top.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for today, we're going to go ahead and
install this and just moisten it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even in a small one, in not having
that glazing and... Well, again,
[SPEAKER_03]: we don't have any plants going right in
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll eventually kick.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm going to be giving him some
wonderful parts of my product,
[SPEAKER_07]: liquid and solids, so that he will be able
to feed this plant as he moves forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to give you the best 30 gallon
pot ever.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I get to stand in the shade.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: For some labor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you can speed this up, Peter.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's still a little bit of sand left
over.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to put more sand in and mix it?
You know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: Waste not, want not.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to bring anything home with
me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now this is when you put on... The rake
would be good.
[SPEAKER_04]: You put on some nice music and you just do
a time lapse of me.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go real time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise it's going to be boring as hell.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to hose that down.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tom, why don't you give it a spritz?
[SPEAKER_07]: Make it look like a glazed donut.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now this is the most important thing in
the world to do it right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: See how it's glazed?
[SPEAKER_05]: See how that looks glazed?
[SPEAKER_05]: You can hit this side a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now something that you guys have to pay
attention to under no circumstances put
[SPEAKER_07]: any kind of filter fabric or fabric of any
kind in this because that's going to
[SPEAKER_07]: happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going to happen is those fines are
going to migrate down, build up on that
[SPEAKER_07]: and you're going to create an anaerobic
layer within days.
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, no fabric ever in these pots in
this system.
[SPEAKER_07]: Copying nature.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nature don't put no fabric down.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why would people put fabric down?
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen them do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like between layers?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting all creative.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you know, these are fabric pots.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's irrelevant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not in the soils.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's people like, you know, they go,
oh, Layton's got a great idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to make it better.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to add filter fabric.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a grow that I know of that did
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, you know, I don't know what
the fuck you were thinking.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, and it was someone who's got
some intelligence.
[SPEAKER_07]: Should never have done that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone who's yelled at me not to modify
their systems, but no names will be named
[SPEAKER_07]: for the safety of all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here comes the dog.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, Tom, make it glisten.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hang on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me use the respite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that, you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right to the marks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look at that, Peter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right to the marks.
[SPEAKER_08]: The dude who lubes up the supermodels in
the photo shoots.
[SPEAKER_08]: The beach photo shoots.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's get it on those white socks.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to leave me alone,
are you?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, Tom, pick up that half of the
thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tom?
[SPEAKER_07]: Tom?
[SPEAKER_07]: Pick up that side right in the middle,
like two points, and then we're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: dump it right in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, waste not want not.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't want to send Peter with a dirty tarp
home.
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_07]: Pretty close?
[SPEAKER_08]: Looking good.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another thing you can do is like,
yeah, little spritz.
[SPEAKER_07]: Glaze donut.
[SPEAKER_06]: Coffee roll.
[SPEAKER_06]: See how it's kind of hydrophobic already?
[SPEAKER_07]: What I'm doing is just kind of creating a
little bit of penetration for the next
[SPEAKER_07]: layer to get down in there and start to
mix.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead, spray it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, this one we get to use a big scooper
on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tom, when was the last time you drove the
Mustang?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, not during the pandemic,
so it's usually been a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have to start it every once in a
while?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I drained the oil.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is like long-term storage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, I'm going to tow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have it towed and have the
body done, and then the engine's in great
[SPEAKER_03]: shape so they can just get it started
again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it won't be anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put fresh oil, do whatever needs to be
done.
[SPEAKER_07]: I definitely got a little heavy on this
mix, but better to have a little left over
[SPEAKER_07]: because you guys will be top dressings.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this you want to keep in a sealed
compound bucket because there is living
[SPEAKER_07]: biology in it.
[SPEAKER_08]: From the compost you made at home,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have one, I can leave you
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I might need a bucket.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm just going to fill it right up because
it is going to sink.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually going to mound it a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can't hurt.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, Tom, if you see that the straw has
blown off, you have hay bales right over
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_04]: This stuff I'm going to keep because I'm
just about ready to plant our garden
[SPEAKER_04]: again.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can go ahead and water her in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give her a good soaking.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I ask everyone this, but how come
everyone always uses straw over like
[SPEAKER_08]: leaves around your yard?
[SPEAKER_07]: Leaves are great.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love leaves.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just didn't have any here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: I like old leaves, especially some that
have started to break down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that good?
[SPEAKER_07]: All kinds of good critters in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, go ahead and hit it some more.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because that's what I do at home.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could use a good drenching right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, we're not planting anything in
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everything is good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just let it drain and keep it moist.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Peter, my love bought some house plants
and they were all struggling.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's like, well, don't I have to feed
them?
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't I have to do that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, no, honey, let's just up pot
them into bigger pots and I'll use this
[SPEAKER_07]: system.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now those were 12 inch, eight inch pots.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I actually did it on small scale within
24 hours.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those plants just perked up.
[SPEAKER_08]: What size did you move them up to?
[SPEAKER_07]: So they were little, I don't know,
four inch squares, five inch squares.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we got like eight inch diameter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not big at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were they planted in previously?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just potting miracle grow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, potting soil of whatever kind with
obviously garden center.
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously had some synthetic fertilizers
in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was great to see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I knew what was going to happen,
but obviously, you know, she was like,
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah, I hear you talking about all this.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to laugh at you anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, let's just shake this together.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can probably just kind of dump it in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want, I might make a mess here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me, let me do a couple more and then
we'll dump it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, what you can do is just flip
that right on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want a little too aggressive there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So which of these babies gets to go in
there?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's the, it's going to be the next
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are these two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this plant right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get this, get this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The both of these.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's the dream time haze.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is probably also the same thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's also a dream time haze.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, these are cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tom, can you put this somewhere out of the
sun somewhere where it stays relatively
[SPEAKER_07]: same humidity and temperature?
[SPEAKER_07]: Peter, I wanted to show you this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what raw clay looks like for
people that are mining it or looking for
[SPEAKER_07]: it along the sides of rivers.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the stuff you want.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you tilt it like that?
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll find these in pockets.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hold that like that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you'll find pockets of this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be hard to break apart,
but when you get it wet, it will roll up
[SPEAKER_07]: like a snake in your fingers.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's how you know it's good clay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, you want color.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want color.
[SPEAKER_07]: You do not want white clay like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's called primary clay.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it has no nutritional value.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you want something that looks like
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Topey, brownie.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen purple.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen blue.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've seen red.
[SPEAKER_07]: So don't worry about the color.
[SPEAKER_07]: The more color, the better.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, if you can get multiple colors,
awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this was just another example of some
material I didn't need because it's too
[SPEAKER_07]: gravely.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it was something cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at that rock.
[SPEAKER_07]: This was from another landslide.
[SPEAKER_08]: What mineral do you think that is?
[SPEAKER_08]: The yellow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Feel how light it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not a sandstone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I drop it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Listen to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it breaks apart.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it has this hum to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's really interesting stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I just brought these kinds of things
just to show you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's put a real one in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you have any quartz crystals or any
other amethyst crystal.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's basically like a big mineral stick,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's going to be like super slow release.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is a mason jar for doing soil
textural tests.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what I do when I'm working with these
giant productions, I will bring these out
[SPEAKER_07]: to the place that is being blended.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I will take a handful of the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, this came from a mudslide,
another mudslide up in the Santa Paula
[SPEAKER_07]: area.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll fill it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have about 5 eighths full.
[SPEAKER_07]: This might be a little full.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I will take water and add water.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have just a little bit of space
above.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have about an eighth.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can see that bubbling.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the clay absorbing all that water
and getting down in between the cracks.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I'll shake it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then 24 hours later, 48 hours later,
I'll come back and I'll see the layers.
[SPEAKER_07]: A lot of times in the super clay soil,
it's going to be difficult to see those
[SPEAKER_07]: layers.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have to look really careful because
that clay gets down into the sand
[SPEAKER_07]: particles.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if I can't see it, what I'll do is
I'll take my fingers and scoop till I feel
[SPEAKER_07]: the sand and then measure it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that way I know where that sand layer
is.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you can disturb this as many times as
you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you have to shake it up again,
do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a lot of times you're going to see
this tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to actually have to come back
in here and add water.
[SPEAKER_07]: Look at how much water just got absorbed
by that clay.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're going to have to add more water
to really see these layers.
[SPEAKER_07]: See where the top of the soil is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like a sponge.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's something people don't
understand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Clay is amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: All the properties it has between negative
and positive charges.
[SPEAKER_07]: Between the nutrients that are in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: It also expands and contracts.
[SPEAKER_07]: And when it's in perfect soil balance with
microbials, one will lay like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next will lay like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then it'll be like this, then that,
then this, then that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And inside these pockets are where all
this biological magic happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the biology, the bacteria will set
up camp and start growing out biofilm and
[SPEAKER_07]: start mining the material of the clay and
prevent the clay from stacking up like
[SPEAKER_07]: this.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is where you'd see an anaerobic
environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: But if it stands up like this,
it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, the biology is in charge of
doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it won't do it if you do not have a
good solid biodiverse.
[SPEAKER_07]: Again, without the right organisms to eat
the clay, you're never going to get that
[SPEAKER_07]: clay to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just going to flocculate and sink to
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to leave this here for you
guys to film tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tom, I don't know where you want this.
[SPEAKER_08]: How about right on that table over there?
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, you might want to take that with
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might want to take that with you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to look at it tomorrow and
it's going to be a bunch of different...
[SPEAKER_03]: But you'll be at home.
[SPEAKER_08]: You won't necessarily... Well,
you can look at it and you can take
[SPEAKER_08]: pictures.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_07]: You may have to add water to wash that
down.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then when you wash that down,
just leave it alone.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you can't see the layers,
then what you want to do is stick your
[SPEAKER_07]: finger down in there until you can feel
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then wherever that is, pull it out and
just make a little mark.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now you know how much percentage sand is.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only problem with these mud
slides.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that they've mixed everything so
thoroughly and there's so much clay in it
[SPEAKER_07]: that you can't settle it out the way you
do traditional soils.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nice.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that was a good day's work.
[SPEAKER_08]: Good job, team.
[SPEAKER_07]: Out of the sun finally.
[SPEAKER_07]: We built... Peter's the proud owner of a
new horizontal soil system.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, Tom is.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tom has it all.
[SPEAKER_08]: He has the beautiful wife, the muscle car.
[SPEAKER_08]: The amazing soil set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really it is extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen... I mean, I've been down
to a lot of grows, but I've never seen an
[SPEAKER_03]: environment like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this is ideal for biology because it
has all of the important ingredients to
[SPEAKER_07]: let the biology do their job, whereas a
super soil would not.
[SPEAKER_03]: No caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be on the hunt now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tom, you need to put a big sign to warn
the caterpillars not to come over there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Tom, what I'd love you to do is
continue to water this a couple of times a
[SPEAKER_07]: day until you start to see water around
the base of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've got the filter on this
water.
[SPEAKER_07]: It takes out the chlorine.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you keep watering it until you see
water come out around the bottom.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we know we're at field capacity,
which is where this soil can no longer...
[SPEAKER_03]: Each time I water it, water it until I see
water.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just keep watering it.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: By gut feeling.
OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, ideally, you'd never want to
overwater soils.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in order to get this system started,
you kind of have to.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you don't want to do it all at once.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like priming a chainsaw.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once I see it pooling out,
then... You know you've hit field
[SPEAKER_07]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now you know that that entire system
is completely saturated and it's time to
[SPEAKER_07]: seed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you want, take some of that hay
mulch off the top of it or straw mulch so
[SPEAKER_07]: that you can see the soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: And put all your cover crop seeds in
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just slightly cover it back up.
[SPEAKER_07]: But until you get growth, we need that to
cover the soil so it doesn't just get
[SPEAKER_08]: turned into rock.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what cover crops do you want to see
when you come back?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Give them a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Pahrump grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: What that cover crop was.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because that was really... Steve Cantwell?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can ask him.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, he has Dichondra and other stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: The only thing I'd really love to see is
some creeping lavender.
[SPEAKER_07]: Creeping lavender, Tom.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it probably smells nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, the more diverse cover crop you
can get.
[SPEAKER_07]: How far does it creep?
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get out of control.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can smell it before you go to bed
every night and you'll sleep like a baby.
[SPEAKER_08]: You'll be so relaxed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any further questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: We need some vines back there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Either you guys got any further questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think today's lesson was a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a very good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We covered a lot of ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the people who asked 1,000
questions, have you pretty much answered
[SPEAKER_03]: theirs with this?
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a good question.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they watch this and pay attention,
the biggest problem I find is they start
[SPEAKER_07]: watching it and then they zone off and get
monkey mind and then they focus back in
[SPEAKER_07]: and they miss the whole middle section.
[SPEAKER_07]: So watch it four times, five times.
[SPEAKER_03]: But also, when he puts it together,
those top five or six points, if those can
[SPEAKER_03]: be put somewhere in the video in a bullet
point, that's what these people,
[SPEAKER_03]: then maybe they'll copy it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe they'll remember it.
[SPEAKER_08]: If Tom transcribed it and put it into the
Cliff Notes version.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which reminds me, ask me about that later
because yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tom, you've got to be looking through the
camera.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, that was cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_08]: Tom, are you happy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Remember last year?
[SPEAKER_08]: We've had periods of extreme optimism and
extreme pessimism.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been everywhere in between.
[SPEAKER_08]: About what?
[SPEAKER_08]: We had butterfly caterpillars destroyed
everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many plants did you use?
[SPEAKER_08]: Just four.
[SPEAKER_03]: More than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they were my first.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had all the clones that were growing
out.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had all the autos.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are your babies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I figured I'd leave this stuff for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I take care of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I always take care of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Your current reputation is the Grim
Reaper.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's your nickname behind your back.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to change that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, do you see the little hitchhiker?
[SPEAKER_03]: Into that little plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, in this one.
[SPEAKER_04]: That little plant growing in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: My ass.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just as soon as my little fingers can edit
this whole video with multiple cameras.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did he say three days?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just going to stop this.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thanks.
Thank you.
