[SPEAKER_01]: No longer do any of the grower communities
have money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go to any grower community in California
and ask them, are you doing well
[SPEAKER_01]: financially?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone raise their hand and say,
yeah, I'm doing great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm making money.
[SPEAKER_01]: My business is thriving.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very, very few cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some distributors are doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some extractors are doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of stores are probably doing
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, processors, you know, that kind of
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Secondary, outside of cultivation,
but cultivators show me anybody that's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I take a look at all these Canadian
companies coming in, snatching up
[SPEAKER_01]: territory here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of Canadian investment in
Humboldt County people aren't aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if it's heavy here, it's heavy
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they're doing is they're buying
up areas that have historical cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're buying up places that have good
brand value for the future of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: because they can make longterm investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have that ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to survive right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, it's easier to get a job and
stay poor and keep my farm alive than try
[SPEAKER_01]: to risk running the farm and lose money or
run the farm and divert it and have any
[SPEAKER_01]: issues and lose the permit and never get
the permit again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just like, so what do we do?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I made the decision, you know,
years ago that for me, the farm was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so whatever I had to do to keep it
alive to move forward is what I was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I could just work on getting the
permaculture gardens put into where I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: actually creating a very closed loop
system over time and it's, it's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I work on a genomic project where
I can figure out how to get one line that
[SPEAKER_01]: I can build that works at my property that
has a quality that I think is good,
[SPEAKER_01]: that I know would be good for time,
that I have an ability now to be
[SPEAKER_01]: differentiated in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I can just survive, we'll be okay
because our regional have brand value with
[SPEAKER_01]: the Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ability to stamp humble products here
is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when McGuire put that in, it was
brilliant because what it needs to do is
[SPEAKER_01]: give us differentiation so that you can't
just say, well, sungrown, sungrown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause really it's not the sungrown in
Texas and sungrown in Florida and sungrown
[SPEAKER_01]: in New England.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I love the New England grows
and the grow is a killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's like the Michigan boys and
Michigan boys can grow some good weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not have the same ability to grow
what we can grow here because we're in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have different climactic situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it gives us some advantages in
different ways and humble has a historic
[SPEAKER_01]: reputation, which is a gift to be able to
live here and be able to be part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, for the average cultivator,
oh my God, man, they stepped into a bear
[SPEAKER_01]: trap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and I'm, I'm the average cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and the irony is that they're being
held up by CEQA environmental review.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meanwhile, with the resurgence of
prices in the traditional market,
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems that there's, it could be
encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine people both going indoors more,
which is not good for the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also diesel grows in the hills is one
of the reasons why people in the Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: triangle voted against their financial
interests and voted for legalization was
[SPEAKER_00]: because one of the major reasons was they
really wanted to stop the environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: harm that they saw the, the, you know,
the reckless black market growers that
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't care about the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people here want that to stop
because we do live in such a beautiful and
[SPEAKER_00]: important ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the regulation being what it is,
it's the good actors are trying to come
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and get permitted and they're
being held back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meanwhile, the, it seems like the
diesel dope is returning to the hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, I remember years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, when I first got to, when I first
went to work in Arcata, someone came in to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy some clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was right after the financial collapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: The world was crumbling for most people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I looked at this person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, didn't I see you on a jury
selection for me on a week trial?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they looked in horror.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, amazing how now that you have
need, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's called reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so diesel dope is a reality where if
they're going to satellite the space so
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy that you going to pick everybody up
growing, people can't afford to,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go homeless?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go home?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no alternative, especially if you
have such an investment in what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a nightmare because the whole
point about going into, into legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: with Humboldt was to be able to create all
these killer outdoor grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in Northern Humboldt,
they could do the indoor operations
[SPEAKER_01]: because you can't run an outdoor on the
coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an indoor is a necessary evil in the
world of cannabis because it fits in the
[SPEAKER_01]: model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're even creating indoor
commissions to further the indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: production of cannabis because that's how
we should produce cannabis because
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody that's got indoor spent huge
money on the infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that means typically they're tied into
bigger operations, which can lobby that
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The outdoor was all basically owner
operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me it was the, it was the beauty of
the industry was all these small
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals producing really gorgeous
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew that we would never have the
diversity we did prior because it just
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't, it doesn't work for the model
where you only have a three pounds to sell
[SPEAKER_01]: to the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need more or otherwise they,
they sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then there's the, you're not there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got to cultivate a million different
clients that it makes it hard for
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution because they, they source it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then everybody likes it and they can't get
it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they get, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's why the regions had to build
multiple varieties that were licensed,
[SPEAKER_01]: that were patented, that were protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone's like free the plant,
let it run wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm like, it doesn't work like that in
ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: It only works like that in black market
ag, because there's no regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once you regulate it and you make it
so that bigger companies can enter safely
[SPEAKER_01]: without losing infrastructure in a raid,
well there, there's economy scale takes
[SPEAKER_01]: effect and economy scale just means how
big do you have to be to play the game
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're finding here is that none
of us are big enough to financially
[SPEAKER_01]: survive this purge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're, you're paying this much
money for the real estate to put a store
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're paying this much for the people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're paying this much for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your margins are small.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farmer, they build this credible farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They produce this gorgeous product that
then sits at the farm for seven months.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for seven months, nobody got paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where'd the money come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: From my investor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that means he's going to get back
when he gets paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're just basically a worker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'd almost be better off not taking
the investor, keeping the property.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go get a job and hang out for a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number of people I know that have jobs
now is mind-bending.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where they went and got a traditional job
so that they could just stay alive as this
[SPEAKER_01]: thing sorts itself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because otherwise what you do is you'll
work for a full fiscal year and not get
[SPEAKER_01]: any money.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't be emotional.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not an emotional thing you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so your emotions, you know,
they, they're important because it's what
[SPEAKER_01]: drives you.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you live off of them in business,
you're going to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this, this, this is a 1% Walmart
model.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even a lot of the stores, you have to
pay for shelf space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the stores charge the farmer for shelf
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The farmers get charged for every step of
the process before they ever get paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I built all the other,
that's why I built the other operations
[SPEAKER_01]: was because I knew that I wanted to be a
farmer more than anything because that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where my, my, my, my heart lies.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could be at the hill every day,
I'd be the happiest I could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I got into all the other things
because I knew that the farmer in life
[SPEAKER_01]: gets screwed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew that if I didn't have multiple
options, then I would basically end up
[SPEAKER_01]: losing the farm into bankruptcy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't want to lose the farm because
I wanted to give it to my kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm in my fifties for Christ sakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been, I've been in the game since I'm
12.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I got over 40, 42 years of hustling,
you know, 40, 41 years of being involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiple felony cases, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've named the damn thing I've been in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, the goal is to be able to take
this piece of property here and give it to
[SPEAKER_01]: my kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way I could afford to do that
was make it into a farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the whole time I was doing it,
I knew that it was a risk, but I knew that
[SPEAKER_01]: if I could just look at it for a really
long term purpose, then it would make that
[SPEAKER_01]: risk something I could understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I expected to be able to make enough
money off the first year of sales to just
[SPEAKER_01]: balance it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I didn't expect big wealth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just expected balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I see is complete imbalance and
it's mind bending that it got this bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the state is so traumatized that
they're talking about sending the national
[SPEAKER_01]: guard up to, you know, Northern Mendo,
Southern Humboldt to, to get her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't see them not doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can see the satellites getting all the
information they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it could, it's going to be a
very interesting depth season.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting because why would you
wait for outdoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why wouldn't you wait for the depths where
everybody's strategy is to get quick depth
[SPEAKER_01]: in before the game's over?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when I'd come in and get you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have all the tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of a sudden everybody is,
you know, really riding on this little
[SPEAKER_01]: moment and it's pretty scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, I let my farm sit fallow
last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got hit up with archeological reports
and by the time I was going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually plant, it would have been August.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just said, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I went to proof of life pictures of me
with newspapers at all the grow sites on
[SPEAKER_01]: the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that way I had documentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they did satellite confirmation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every 50 days they had photos of my
farm on satellite.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, Hey, you never grew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it completely took away that $20,000
excise tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because I didn't cultivate,
I didn't have to file income tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to file, but there's no
monies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's more money in not growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me personally, there's more money in
not growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather lose 15 grand a year than lose
a hundred grand because I'm going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow it all out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to have to hold it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have onsite processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to have to send it to a
processor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to have to jar it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to have to get a label.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to have to get it
distributed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'm going to have to wait for the
money to come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I'm going to have to keep
bleeding it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to watch it deteriorate over
time because it's going to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to oxidize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we don't have this multi-year shelf
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not making concrete block.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't just put the block in the yard
and wait till next year when the building
[SPEAKER_01]: projects jump up.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I don't move it, it deteriorates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if your label is on it, you look bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it looks like you can't grow a
good pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when my friends are doing all this
analytical work for me in LA, I've got
[SPEAKER_01]: these older guys I hang out with in LA
that are wealthy, older dudes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have time, which wealth gives
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they love to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they go and check out samples of every
dispensary there is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go and look at everything and buy
weed constantly and smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And an older group, older smokers who are
all affluent, a very rare group,
[SPEAKER_01]: rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of it, it lets me say,
hey, they're unhappy with everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the thing is that that's not
building brand value.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not building brand value.
[SPEAKER_01]: You build a brand value when you're in an
indoor model in Los Angeles and you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: supply line that lets you function because
you're in some very trendy spots.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how much did it cost to build that
facility?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long is it going to take you to
recover that investment value?
[SPEAKER_01]: How much are you actually making as the
operator with investors in the room?
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you have a piece of equity and a
paycheck.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the perception that everybody's
wealthy here is not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the investors are waiting to get paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most of the operations that I see that
are major are on their second or third
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators, second or third CEO.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the investors are like, holy Christ,
I could bled out 10 million already.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I got to bleed more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're in the same situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That men's a great example.
[SPEAKER_01]: They couldn't have more capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even Flo Can, 125 million they raised.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're losing a million and a half a
month.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're losing a million and a half a
month.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not making money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their earnings were great this month.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a million and a half is still under
what they should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any other business in Humboldt County
would collapse.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because they're so well funded,
they could play the game and ride it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is, is that the model
you're in?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not in that model.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to be in the 10,000 square foot
model.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got 18,000, a little under a half acre
from my cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to shrink it down to 10 over
the next couple of years so that I could
[SPEAKER_01]: just be in that craft designation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have something that I produced
that was of a really nice quality that
[SPEAKER_01]: shined on my property.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd be able to, over time,
push it into this US market because our
[SPEAKER_01]: region would allow it to take place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it would be a decent income for
the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it would just be an income.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would pay for the farm, basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never intended to be able to just grow
again, ever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I looked at the future, I said none
of us will ever be able to do what we did.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll never be able to grow a couple hours
a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five hours a day and have great money and
have a vacation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's done.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a farmer now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you get used to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you better build multiple income
streams or you're going to go bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's terrifying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's as real as it can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me, I built as many things as I
could build.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm trying to push as far ahead as I
can with every tool I can.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I'm not doing is trying to
screw anybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm trying to take every advantage I
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's science, I'm going to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's common sense, I'm going to use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I lay down the numbers on a piece
of paper and I take a look at it like I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: an accountant, it says there's no money
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's wishful thinking.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think for farmers and
cultivators, if you're in a situation
[SPEAKER_01]: where you have a good relationship with
some stores and you have convenient
[SPEAKER_01]: processing and you're able to churn a
decent paycheck, then you go forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just make sure your product, as you
clearly understand, look at what the
[SPEAKER_01]: nurseries are selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go take a look at every nursery online.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take a look at their catalogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to get out of those products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because every major manufacturer is using
those nurseries for their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So therefore, you're going to see a
million pounds of Purple Punch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's some of the best looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always knock it because it's so
beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It couldn't be any prettier in your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't have a secondary buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of products like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just use that one as an example
because it's gorgeous, but people don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because everybody knows it's hot,
it got overproduced, and then now it's in
[SPEAKER_01]: your arsenal and it's on the shelf,
it doesn't mean that people want to
[SPEAKER_01]: consume it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just means it's what's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need things that when they consume it,
they want to consume it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you need to be able to find who you're
selling it to, who's the distributor,
[SPEAKER_01]: what stores do they sell to, the farmer
that has to go to those stores and make
[SPEAKER_01]: the relationships so the stores know who
you are so they know they get your
[SPEAKER_01]: products good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can bring an ounce with you and smoke
a joint with them and say, look,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is what I'm selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you're relying on all these
other people to do the business for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're putting yourself at this
incredible vulnerability, hoping and
[SPEAKER_01]: praying that all your pot's going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're going to end up having to
backdoor it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't fault you for that either
because that's where I came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would never fault anybody for trying
to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that, God help you, you get
caught and they take your license because
[SPEAKER_01]: now you're property is no longer
licensable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you have a problem now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have to go explain to the
BCC, hey, I know you caught me selling out
[SPEAKER_01]: the backdoor, but I want my property to
get licensed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll just say, no, we don't want
your license.
I don't want your license.
I don't want your license.
