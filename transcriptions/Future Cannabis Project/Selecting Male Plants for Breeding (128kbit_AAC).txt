[SPEAKER_01]: What traits do you look for specifically
in male plants if you're seeking a good
[SPEAKER_01]: breeder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm a big fan of the stem rub and I
really love terpens and all the different
[SPEAKER_01]: possibilities that there are in the
cannabis species.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's something that has done me
served me well forever and I'll probably
[SPEAKER_01]: never put down that tool, you know,
no matter what.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we did some testing of males this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of a cool trick, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, certainly structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're trying to breed for
homozygosity or uniformity, then you want
[SPEAKER_01]: to look for one that has a similar
structure to, you know, if you're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to make an inbred line, for example,
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Gene, you want to do some of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually just touching the plant
and seeing really what smells you get from
[SPEAKER_00]: the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different ones are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, like OG and everybody's nose works
different, but like me, I can pick an OG
[SPEAKER_00]: male hella easy because it smells like
dill pickles to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it smells like dill pickles,
that one has it, and it doesn't mean that
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll necessarily carry it depending on
what you're pulling it from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you already have seeds where you
know that all the females do smell like
[SPEAKER_00]: OG, and then you get a male out of there
that, you know, like if I was going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding something with OG, for example,
I'd be like, okay, what does it need
[SPEAKER_00]: improvement on?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you want a little bit of an improved
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's a little more sturdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want improved resistance to powdery
mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if I was breeding OGs, I'd probably
want to like stick them in a room and get
[SPEAKER_00]: them really humid for a little while,
maybe let them droop a couple times before
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really flower and heavy so that I
can kind of trigger their stress response
[SPEAKER_00]: so that they'll get attacked on purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can kind of go, okay, there's the
one that's resistant because otherwise,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you treat them, you know, if they have
perfect conditions, and you're breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: for something that's triggered by bad
conditions, you're not going to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it doesn't, there's no way to select
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you have to kind of put pressures on
things to see different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you want to know if the branches
are strong, you're going to have to snap
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to be like,
all right, weak, weak branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: You break some, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, like some plants grow with like
actually almost, sometimes it'll almost
[SPEAKER_00]: look like a bubble.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the junction of the branch and the main
stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it'll actually be like, there's these
ones where they'll never break right at
[SPEAKER_00]: the junction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll actually bend and kind of break
over right up from it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those ones tend to be a lot more
sturdy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, I found those in most stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's like, you know, little things
like that are cool to look for.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, yeah, the stem rub is
basically if you, I really like to,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I can grow something, if I have enough
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I don't have enough, I'll grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll just use all the males and all
the females and do an open pollination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I know I have a bunch more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, out of my favorite females,
then I'll try some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I do the, when I grow them out
the first time, I'll try to figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: which plants, you have to observe a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you look, okay, these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can notice these things about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, when they finish as female
plants, then you kind of see trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you go, okay, well, every female that
looked like this or that had the stem rub,
[SPEAKER_00]: they wound up being like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you can get a correlation there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, okay, so like,
if you're looking for a good OG male and
[SPEAKER_00]: you go, this one smells like OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it turns out, no, they're
really good OG clones to me that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smell like pickles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I want the male that smells like
pickles.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it smells like OG, when it's done,
it might not smell like OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it already smells like OG on the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it's kind of like learning the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, I like to learn them before I try
to really do any selective breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that makes it easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing about looking for
male traits is there's overall ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want one that's a pest magnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want one that's a fungus magnet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want one that has really weak,
snappy structure or, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe if they're super hard to clone or
they have really weak roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some basic things that you can
look for just overall and go, it's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: best plant for these reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times with selecting males,
you actually want to find the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: carries what you like about the females.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that takes observation and figuring
out where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And different genes basically travel in
groups in breeding to where you might try
[SPEAKER_00]: to get rid of something and discover that
every time you get rid of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get rid of the other thing you wanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, maybe you go, oh, I always want,
maybe somebody's already made,
[SPEAKER_00]: already bred something that you're
starting with where you go, the one that I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to smoke, I can grow as many as I
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones I really like, they always
have kind of flimsy branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you might be stuck with that unless
you want to make a new hybrid and then
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in your new hybrid, you can get new
stuff happening, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really for male selecting to me
is really looking at finding which male is
[SPEAKER_00]: the one that really does what I want in
that type and then using those kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: males.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, it really takes like studying the way
that is and then you can pick them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, use your,
you know, use your general things where
[SPEAKER_00]: you go, okay, anything crappy,
we don't want to use that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But of the ones that we like, you know,
then you want to figure out what's like
[SPEAKER_00]: the actual it's almost like seeing a face
and recognizing a face or recognizing a
[SPEAKER_00]: voice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, there's that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always does this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you want to find those correlations
and those groups of traits that all travel
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like someone was asking me about the pi√±as
that I sold this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're purple stem and they're all purple
stem and they all have the same smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the trip was that the purple stem
travels with this particular group of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes so that it's really easy to breed
it to have the smell if you just look for
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones with the purple stems and then
you smell the stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be a couple of them that are a
little off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go, no, but this one has the most of
that smell and it's purple stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them together and really fast I
was able to go, okay, this is that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if that was, that male might have been
the sturdiest and the stinkiest and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fastest growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you hate that smell, don't pick the
purple stem one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get a different one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you got to learn the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you select your males,
then you can have success a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also just go, I really like this
plant and use that male because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to get plants that look like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might have been what you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, wow, this thing has a luster
and a vigor to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, well, you're at least going
to get that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can find out later if you get
those other traits that are important to
[SPEAKER_00]: you too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can always try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can always throw it and see if it
sticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to ideally learn what you're
working with first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was talking about the weirdos
in the cherry limeade.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you didn't mind having really little
weird plants, you might be able to make
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool stuff with that because the
weeds always kill her.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant's not that good though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, what I did is I looked and looked
until I got males that had the same smell
[SPEAKER_00]: and the same resinous leaves and
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went, okay, so this is like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more rare in this form.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this has the traits I like in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this thing grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't have a weird look to it
that freaks people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you wind up going with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's how I select males personally
is by learning what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, okay, if you were breeding
dogs, you'd be like, okay, you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to breed Rottweilers and go,
I liked this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't have Rottweiler markings.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a good Rottweiler.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after a while, people will be
like, this ain't a Rottweiler,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't pick the right one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a sport.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't the right thing to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you want to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know what a Rottweiler looks
like.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know how tall is the shoulder?
[SPEAKER_00]: How tall is the hips?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the sway in the back?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long is the tail on a puppy?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do the ears lay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do their teeth sit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Howard, what's the line in the front?
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff to learn to go,
okay, now I'm breeding dogs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, if you really want to breed stuff,
you really have to know the description of
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're shooting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you pick the males.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not to say you might have had a
killer dog that was like a Rottweiler that
[SPEAKER_00]: was all black or all tan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, I like that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing wrong with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're just going to be going to a new
place and you have to have focus for doing
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you can just randomly select a male
because you like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to be more difficult to
lock down the exact things you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you want to learn your genetics to
pick them, you know?
So, that's how you do it.
