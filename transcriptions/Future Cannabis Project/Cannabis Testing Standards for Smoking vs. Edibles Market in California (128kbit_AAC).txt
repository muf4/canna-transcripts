[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin Jodry, can you talk to us about how
you think the emergency regulations are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to impact the climate of cannabis
for the farmers of the Emerald Triangle
[SPEAKER_01]: and California in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your perspective?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I had a perspective that I thought
was right because I'm trying to study the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations on a really current basis and
it looked like it was exceptionally
[SPEAKER_00]: stringent on mold levels, yeast levels,
just active culture in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very stringent in pesticide usages
and fungicide usages.
[SPEAKER_00]: The level of contaminants allowed visibly
on a product was exceptionally limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to me, the regulations were
difficult to get product to the store
[SPEAKER_00]: because it was going to be very difficult
to find cultivars that could handle the
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal pressure without using adulterants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was going to be difficult to be able to
do certain situations because of just
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogenic pressure or pest pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was up late last night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't sleep and I started doing some
research and I dug up some weird stuff and
[SPEAKER_00]: it was really from Project CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was an article called Bugs,
Mold and Excrement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it was was it was on November
16th, they said they released this new set
[SPEAKER_00]: of rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I went online into the California
site, I can't find this information,
[SPEAKER_00]: but this basically is a change in how
California is going to deal with pesticide
[SPEAKER_00]: usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they went from 42 band down to 21
band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the ones that you can use now is
ivermectin, which is avid.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use bifenthrin, which is a termite
killer and use that typically for root
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in some of the testing,
we've seen over the course of the years
[SPEAKER_00]: that bifenthrin was in maybe 65% of the
Bay Area cannabis because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponic root aphid situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a lot of these large cultural type
media where they share things,
[SPEAKER_00]: a root aphid is just a savage predator to
all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so typically we use funguses and we
inoculate and it kills it from a fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: point of view where it actually affects
the plant, I mean, affects the body of the
[SPEAKER_00]: creature itself and breaks them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bifenthrin is a termite killer,
but it's a heavy carcinogen and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing some form of like a mosquito side
and a pyrethium based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're allowing something else
for, so the pyrethium based, the
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticide used for killing mosquitoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bifenthrin was the one that really caught
my eye and avid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now these things are things that we
like have been sifting out of the lab and
[SPEAKER_00]: excluding from dispensaries for the whole
time I've been in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ever since I got into cannabis and we
started having lab tested cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: these are some of the main things that
were disqualifying you from selling your
[SPEAKER_00]: product at the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now those things are allowed in
production for not consumption in smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: form, but in edible form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if the cannabis is destined to be
turned into a product made for edibles,
[SPEAKER_00]: any of those products are allowed to be
found in trace amounts in it, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: that really you could probably use it on
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the levels don't appear in it,
because if it was used by bifenthrin,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these things typically used in like
nursery operations too, so it changes the
[SPEAKER_00]: way these plants hold these toxins and
residuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just so weird to me because I
couldn't find substantiation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: California regs, but this is all stating
other regulations through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Project CBD is usually pretty
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the next one that caught my eye was
where they were only going to check for
[SPEAKER_00]: three major bacterial groups, was E.
[SPEAKER_00]: coli, asparilagis, and seminella.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing else they were going to look for
in any way, shape, or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't matter what the yeast counts
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't matter what any of the counts
were.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have up to 25% of the flower
with visible mold, and it was still
[SPEAKER_00]: sellable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just kind of shocking because
we just went through this incredible purge
[SPEAKER_00]: on what could enter the system this year
and what couldn't enter the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of us are getting beat up at the
events on fungal levels, and we're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn how to comply with these fungal
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now basically it's 25% of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 25% of the product could have
fungal problems or any kind of coverage,
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt, contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were allowed to have on a gram,
was it maybe 3.5 within an eighth,
[SPEAKER_00]: one drop of mammalian excrement,
which means rat shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you had a chocolate bar that was an
ounce, and he broke it up into 16 pieces,
[SPEAKER_00]: four of them could be covered in dirt,
four could be covered in mold,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of them had a single drop of rat
shit on it, that's legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it freaked me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it freaked me out so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, this is just for edibles because
there's a feeling that our digestive
[SPEAKER_01]: systems can break anything down.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're using for cannabis is
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what they did is they backed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they took all these different
pesticides out of the program,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they basically copied cannabis
treatment for pathogenic pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: for pest pressure, using these chemical
families, same as you can use in tobacco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're marrying that, but they pulled
aside all these others, because you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: remember, Avid is a great miticide,
but it's designed for ornamentals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Bifentherin is a termite killer that
toxifies the ground it's in, and it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: it to where there's a residual that stays
in the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those problems like
Mycobutrenol, where it's a chemical family
[SPEAKER_00]: that lives in the tissue of the plant at a
cellular level for a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have these things that are
known problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just tripped me out that we've been
preparing for this incredibly stringent
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm worried that we're not going to
see any cultivars make it into the system
[SPEAKER_00]: because the regulations are going to be so
onus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, I go home last night
and I find out that everything that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: preparing for is actually not even in
existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one I know has even seen any of
this paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's on the net and it's current.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a question of, you know,
what regulations are we following?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I would like to know, because if
you're going to have this type of
[SPEAKER_00]: situation occur, it radically changes,
you know, how you approach all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're an organic farmer and
they allow you to use these tools,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have to compete at a price point,
do you use the tools or what do you switch
[SPEAKER_00]: into growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're either toxifying the
ground, you're using with some of this
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a lot of individuals, you know,
that's the biggest market is the
[SPEAKER_00]: distillate market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the distillate market is the one
that's really going to be the most
[SPEAKER_00]: burgeoning as we go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's one of the more crucial ones
to have access into as it grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's almost too big right now to
satisfy completely or you wouldn't see so
[SPEAKER_00]: many people trying to grab products that
they grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the ability to enter that market
would be fantastic with the product that
[SPEAKER_00]: we pass through because then it lets us
use cultivars that are bulky and weighty
[SPEAKER_00]: and come in on a good timeframe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not worried about the quality of
the flower appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need an organically produced
product or what we believe to be
[SPEAKER_00]: California regulated product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now you can use stuff that you have
never been able to use in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all the years we've been selling
cannabis and they started having lab
[SPEAKER_00]: tests, avid was the number one ingredient
they went after first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Avid and then the other families,
fluoramides, all these different chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: families that they've used to attack bugs
for time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once they get a resistance,
you got to switch to a new family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people have been rotating through
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forbid, pylon, avid, fluoramide and
whatever other products they're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those were all these families and
now you're able to get back into some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it changes a lot for us because for
us that are organically minded where we
[SPEAKER_00]: ethically want to grow a clean pot,
but we're also trying to work under this
[SPEAKER_00]: situation where I'm fighting spider mites
with Neem and you're fighting spider mites
[SPEAKER_00]: with an oversight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to kind of compete.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the part that's tripping me
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yesterday I figured we were all going to
have a hard time because it was going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a very difficult situation to get into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you have a hard time because you're
going to get to compete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Against people who are using tools that
you wouldn't use at your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't use at your home farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to spray this in the greenhouse,
that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that greenhouse in your yard?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because one of the products, when I looked
up what it was connected to, it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: mosquito killer used for Zika virus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't even cross reference what
they were using it for in ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't find really what were they
using this for in what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're allowed to use it and it's
connected to childhood development of the
[SPEAKER_00]: mental stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're having brain development issues
and it was directly linked.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could find that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That link popped right up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it was used for outside of
killing Zika virus, it didn't have an
[SPEAKER_00]: applicability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I couldn't, I have to get all the
chemists and say, hey, what is this
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wonder if that's coming from one
department of regulations like public
[SPEAKER_01]: health.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's looking at what's legal to
consume, but then if you look at outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation regulations, is that going to
conflict in terms of what you're allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: to put in the environment?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so maybe that's only for indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It talked about it specifically saying
that they couldn't believe they allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's in the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't believe that these things
were allowed to pass through, not because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the toxins to the people, but because
of watershed damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fully known that the problems that
you have with these type of contaminants
[SPEAKER_00]: move down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stream and then migrate through the
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that it's fully known.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the article reveal it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it's if it's the full awareness of
these products and what they do inside the
[SPEAKER_00]: financial concerns had to have affected
this to make that possible because it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes it so simple to grow fields because
you with avid you don't have my problems
[SPEAKER_01]: with avid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you don't have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have root avid problems with
bifenthrin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's termite killer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll kill termites.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you can kill a termite,
you can kill a root avid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when you have these tools and then
you have high like synthetic pyrethium
[SPEAKER_00]: creations to use as other bombs to
utilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're also problematic in there and
what they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those are incredible tools as pest
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not for what we're allowed to
use traditionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm not sure why you use the
mosquito killer because it didn't it just
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't tie in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't find a cross reference on what
are the pests that killed other than,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, controlling mosquito populations
and maybe maybe the areas around the place
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that the fungal sifting was
going to knock the living daylights out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the totals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now when I read this article last
night, I realized, like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went back and looked through all the
California stuff and I couldn't find the
[SPEAKER_00]: reconciliation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is if the laws are
changing so fast that when I looked at the
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francisco headline and it said one
acre cap installed, no commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: takeover, cannabis, we all lauded the
incredible victory.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I got home, it was in the
article.
[SPEAKER_00]: I looked at the newspaper and got home and
went on the Internet and it said cap
[SPEAKER_00]: completely wiped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it it happened after it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, first they told us it was good and
we all celebrate for about 17 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we read the news on another news
service and it tells us, no, that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: real at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't have a cap at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I read this, I realized it
must be the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just too much velocity in what's
taking place for any one site to have all
[SPEAKER_00]: the information accurately because the
California site should be the most
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go through, I went through all
the web process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going through all these things like as
if I wasn't doing it in real life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have people working with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just going through it myself to see
all the little pieces and understand this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very complex system to get into
the registry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the regulations, you know,
it must be so complex that when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: having stuff like this happen,
how do you update it this quick and change
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they're still working off of I can
use Neem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can use my control.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can use Bifossia Barbena.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can use fungal controllers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I can use some sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can use some potassium bicarbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking a really restrictive organic
regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's still what's up on the
regulatory controls for the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I couldn't find these to reconcile.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, once you start to have the
ability to do this, I mean, you start to
[SPEAKER_00]: have an ability to, you know, we go
through the whole list and find out what
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are incredible tools to change
your efficiency and effectiveness of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing cannabis on a large level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think that it's something that
you'd like to see stay in place or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, would you like to see?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the mold counts.
[SPEAKER_01]: For one thing, this seems like it's only
for edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got the whole anybody doing
flour or even for vape pens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably have to stay away from all of
this soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So edibles is not that large.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good percentage of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But edibles is still, you know,
a fraction of the whole pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's it'll be interesting to
see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think it's the direction that
people wanted to see that want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that the environment still being
improved and better than it has under the
[SPEAKER_01]: black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, you'll have you'll have a
lot more control of what they're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have if you're allowing this
stuff, it's a progression.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I see these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, edible production is maybe,
say, let's call it 20 percent of the pie
[SPEAKER_00]: here of what's what's going into because
it's going to it's going to be big because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the delivery system people prefer the
new people that aren't smokers and
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no no stigma to eating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the quality of the edible products is
incredible right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's diversity and complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's going to it's going to
be big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the thing is that you start to get
people used to consuming products that
[SPEAKER_00]: were never meant to be ingested period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So so does that mean that the nurseries
that produce the clones that go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: farms that produce this, that they are
they allowed to use that product to like
[SPEAKER_00]: is it if you can use it, but is there no
if we don't catch you with the residual,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning that we don't mind if it's in your
spray cabinet and it's in your spray logs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that it can't come up hot on the
product that we dequeue it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it starts like a slippery
slope of accountability on how you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing agriculturally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this whole thing with cannabis was
basically this clean revolution of people
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to say, let's not destroy the
watersheds in Humboldt, let's not destroy
[SPEAKER_00]: the watersheds in Mendocino, let's not do
all these things that are traditionally
[SPEAKER_00]: done with industrial logging practices,
industrial mining practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were kind of held to that
incredible stringency, no sediment runoff
[SPEAKER_00]: from your property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, everything must be contained.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now all of a sudden, if I decide that
I want to produce distillate, which I
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend people to do because it's it
allows you to get a simpler product line
[SPEAKER_00]: into market, then all of a sudden you're
now spraying all over your property,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's totally cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my neighbor next to me above me on the
watershed is now dumping this crap into
[SPEAKER_00]: his ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're going to we're going to
toxify all the stuff that we just did all
[SPEAKER_00]: this work on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to do to the guy below me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think it's a horrible thing
because I think that they need to work on
[SPEAKER_00]: mold differentiation better versus just
saying, look, if your if your flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: covered with 25 percent of dirt,
it's still loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just that's just commercial.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's treating it like it's it's it's
produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is, is that it's it allows
there to be almost no hand work
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever, because how can you compete at
a price point when you can when you can
[SPEAKER_00]: just basically cover your cannabis in mud,
cover it in dirt, because they're saying
[SPEAKER_00]: this is for edible pieces, but it begins a
25 percent of the market can be
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to assume it's going
to change as it goes forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard for us, you know,
and we've been we've been saying this is
[SPEAKER_00]: important as craft producers to have
differentiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still believe it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that it is is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible to compete with them if
they can chemically get the cost so low?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once we start to get this into
these lower basements, all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_00]: it becomes a very difficult situation to
have craft cannabis if there's no pricing
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't know if they have the
ability right now to drive this market so
[SPEAKER_00]: deep because the infrastructure isn't
fully established.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if all these these added
pesticides are allowed in the marketplace
[SPEAKER_01]: and on farms, you're going to have a farm
inevitably that's working to be all
[SPEAKER_01]: organic and their neighbors using all
these things like avid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're going to get drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it causes a lot of problems,
whereas before we thought that we really
[SPEAKER_01]: thought that cannabis was going to be held
to a much higher standard than other
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it sounds like big egg and all its
dirty practices are coming into cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: really fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they had said to us, you know,
a long time ago, hey, we're going to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: this way, then then it would have
influenced the entire regulation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: all the codes and all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything would have been the beginning
of like, look, look, this is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: toxins everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't go like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you have is you have the ability
to grow for whatever market you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you if you're medical, you can go
medical rec, you can go rec, but if you go
[SPEAKER_00]: in rec, you can go edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're medical, you can go edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you have a four acre,
you have four APNs with four acres sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: next to each other on it, and you're using
these products at a level, now you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow protocol and there's going to be
spray logs and you're going to have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: and get a spray license like Pedro has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll that'll force you to do,
which is everything that goes on the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: has been logged and sent to the the
regulatory control on the ag level over in
[SPEAKER_00]: Eureka.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it'll go through the cannabis board in
addition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be multiple people who are
looking at what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've been doing it for a long time
just because it starts a protocol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you understand how to comply because
it's complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in the zones and what was done
and how much was used and then the control
[SPEAKER_00]: practices and the time you have to wait to
reenter and all these components go with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you start to be able to use
chemical lag and in products that were,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be so so tripped out on it if
it was chemicals that were meant for human
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption that were meant for human
consumption, where even though I'm not a
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical guy, it was at least tested for
people on health when they ate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's not what these products are
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: These products are for non ingestible and
so when you're taking termite killer and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're taking a miticide and other side
that is ornamental based horticultural
[SPEAKER_00]: based and is in these things are known
toxins and you're just saying it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just kind of makes you wonder like what
are what laws am I preparing for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I said yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the small scale black market
person who is able to just keep themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: alive in the interim, they'll probably
survive more than anyone else will because
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone else is financially going to have
to compete and for all of us that are
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do an organic operation,
these kind of things make it difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to change in molds but I don't like
to change in 25% of the total product to
[SPEAKER_00]: be covered in mold because now we're not
looking at powdery mildew which is lung
[SPEAKER_00]: irritant and we don't want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would like to have levels of it that
are acceptable and fair and those things
[SPEAKER_00]: can be worked out but when it's just all
right, just cover it with dirt or any kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of foreign contaminant so it could be
covered in leaf material, it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: covered in this, it doesn't make a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% of the flour, so if you have a one
gram flour, 0.25 of it could be dipped in
[SPEAKER_00]: mud or you dip it in anything else you
want and that's totally okay, all moldy.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% of the total.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are like that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't buy that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you bought a pound and 25% of it,
four ounces were moldy, you would be like
[SPEAKER_00]: whoa, that's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's legal and so it's trippy because I
think a lot of it is because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: penalties and so I started to take a look.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went back from here and so I looked at
this thing and I went into the penalty
[SPEAKER_00]: phases if you make a mistake with your
permits and so you have a level one,
[SPEAKER_00]: a level two and a level three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only a couple things give you a level one
which is the least punitive and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple that give you a level two but there
is an ocean of them that give you a level
[SPEAKER_00]: three and a level three was if you have
pathogenic material on nursery plants
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning root aphids or mites and so my
thing is like well those are the two
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are the most dominant
pervasively used chemicals to control
[SPEAKER_00]: those two problems and when you look at
Bay Area cannabis traditionally,
[SPEAKER_00]: just like when you look at outdoor kush
pot and then indoor kush pot, you see
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe up to 80% mycobuturone contamination
through lab tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're looking at Bay Area hydro
cannabis, primarily you're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like 65% by Fintherin over like the
last couple years and so it's just so used
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's just very effective and it's
cheap and if you're trying to do the way
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing it with fungal additives so
that you can let the plants back it off
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves in this form, it doesn't ever
really work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in a perpetual never ending cycle
of it and it's just what it is but that is
[SPEAKER_00]: a tool that allows you to have an
incredible efficiency so you never get a
[SPEAKER_00]: violation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never any kind of issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've wondered, all of us have
wondered and all the nursery guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all wondering how you're gonna pull
this off because everybody is judgmental
[SPEAKER_00]: on their nursery operation but most people
have a couple trays of clones and a mom in
[SPEAKER_00]: the closet and they're like I can do a
great job but when you produce in 365 days
[SPEAKER_00]: a year and you're in any situation where
there's inclusion, you end up having a
[SPEAKER_00]: very different situation occur and it's
tough to keep these things moving on this
[SPEAKER_00]: level and the ability to be able to
protect yourself chemically from any kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of violations and so we wondered how we
were going to be able to work with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: this and now I haven't had a chance to
talk to any of the other nursery operators
[SPEAKER_00]: I know yet just because when I read this
but I'm like whoa it changes everything
[SPEAKER_00]: because suddenly you know it's 25% of your
nursery now for sale only to food because
[SPEAKER_00]: can we back the whole chain up?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can use it on producing the product
then why wouldn't we be able to use it on
[SPEAKER_00]: producing the clones that produce the
product?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the same product, it's a track
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when can I apply the toxins?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do they get applied in this chain
because they might as well get applied
[SPEAKER_00]: early if you're gonna use them late.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of this stuff is it's
competitive in different ways than you
[SPEAKER_00]: believe because it allows you to
efficiently control problems that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: bring you bottom line down but keep you
out of punitive financial punishments and
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory and they can go back seven
years on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's a good point that in terms of
records of your cultivation practices or
[SPEAKER_01]: even manufacturing any of the licenses you
have it's seven years of records and they
[SPEAKER_01]: have that seven years so you could get
fined for something they're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: that happened seven years ago if your
records aren't kept properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you face fines that they come
after you for and assess you fines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you know so much of this is
important not to make these mistakes and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just that you know we've all been
under the same exact premise that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna work off of this extremely
regulated, I just spoke on a panel at the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emmerich about microbial contamination and
I was talking to a very intelligent lab
[SPEAKER_00]: operator from one of the labs,
she was a speaker on the panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we never talked about, they still
talked about basically identifying mold
[SPEAKER_00]: levels and working on score counts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We understood that asparilla just had a
higher level of tolerance if it was to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to the edible market but they didn't talk
about 25% of the flour covered in mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean I'm not sure, it's hard to keep
track if and I don't think that I'm so
[SPEAKER_00]: good at pulling info off the web.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just happened to be up late last night
at four in the morning and I couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep and I pulled up this information.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it seems like it's pretty accurate and
it makes sense and so it causes problems
[SPEAKER_00]: for all of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just creates a situation where it
absolutely favors a very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: production methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw that with the unlimited canopy
but we figured hey they'd have to at least
[SPEAKER_00]: work off of some of the same operating
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what you do is you get to use all
these Salinas operations and all these
[SPEAKER_00]: Monterey operations that are historically
covered in these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if they can't get cannabis to pass
because the soil is bifenthrin saturated,
[SPEAKER_00]: well it down can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they can't get things to,
remember these are all residuals and so
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff that they've used for years in all
these facilities and all these places,
[SPEAKER_00]: toxins, just like a lot of the grow
buildings in Sohum that had Eagle 20
[SPEAKER_00]: applied continuously.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff is still active in the room and
when cannabis is grown in it, pieces of it
[SPEAKER_00]: fall off the ceiling and literally land on
your flowers and it comes up hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because people go I'm not using it,
I don't know why it's testing hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the building had it sprayed in it
prior and if you don't have UV it might
[SPEAKER_00]: take five years for that to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we don't see the same amount of it
anymore because people sealed up their
[SPEAKER_00]: spaces and you don't see the applications
as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is we're all working
off of this incredible control system to
[SPEAKER_00]: do quality work and now we just have to
understand where do we go from here.
