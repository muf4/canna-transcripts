[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Mel Frank.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm author of the Marijuana Grows Guide,
Marijuana Grows Insiders Guide.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the publisher of Rob Clark's book
Hashish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been growing since 1968.
[SPEAKER_03]: First started in New York City in an
apartment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Moved to California in 76.
[SPEAKER_03]: And have grown indoors, outdoors,
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: A couple of times on some real scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most of the time, pretty small stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still breed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still consult.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still write.
[SPEAKER_03]: I still photograph.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recently had, last year I had two photo
art shows.
[SPEAKER_03]: One at M&B Gallery here about carbo
marijuana photographs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one in New York City at Ben Ruby
Gallery.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was last fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: So currently, I'm still doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Still breeding and do some consulting.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Carl Castanon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the founder and grower of Palomar
Craft Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been growing in a two-car garage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started growing in a two-car garage back
in 2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the years, I've scaled it up to a
32,000 square foot mix-like facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Mel and I are actually having some
pretty good conversations about the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and how it's been changing over
the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the things that we were really
talking about, it was just the skill sets
[SPEAKER_01]: that we've developed over the years as
growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The thing we both agree on that's probably
the biggest problem in the cultivation
[SPEAKER_03]: aspect of the industry is the lack of true
master growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That we just see too many grows fail
because the master grower really isn't a
[SPEAKER_03]: master at growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something that should be
changing because there's so much money
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in it, so much at stake in it,
that I think more and more people who are
[SPEAKER_03]: growers will take what they're doing much
more seriously in terms of the science,
[SPEAKER_03]: the technology that's available now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because when you grow indoors or in a
greenhouse, you need to control the
[SPEAKER_03]: environment as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not only in the cleanliness aspect of it,
but also in terms of humidity and of
[SPEAKER_03]: course the CO2, your fertilizers and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all has to be monitored.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be monitored consistently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the grows that I've seen that are
really successful are set up in a way that
[SPEAKER_03]: there are remote monitors in every room
that are telling them what their humidity
[SPEAKER_03]: is, what the temperature is, so that it
falls within a VDP range that's healthy
[SPEAKER_03]: for the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: This way here, you can avoid getting
things like powdery mildew, so you never
[SPEAKER_03]: have to treat the plants with something
before or after it happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: The days of Eagle 20 are gone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people have to learn how to grow
clean crops without resorting to these
[SPEAKER_03]: things that we used in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, we were just talking about
some horror stories of these real estate
[SPEAKER_01]: developers, new entrants into the industry
coming in, hiring some guy from Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: who says he's a master grower,
dumping millions of dollars into facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: installing the wrong technology,
and just losing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing that a lot in California
over the last couple years as legalization
[SPEAKER_01]: has happened and these regulations have
been implemented.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just really heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just some of the bad advice and just
wrong advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That traditional agriculture people are
giving to cannabis growers and saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we would recommend one set of
equipment, but say a guy who grows tomato
[SPEAKER_01]: or corn would say, oh, you don't need
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's a heat tolerant plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how do you know it's a heat tolerant
plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many cannabis drivers have you had?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just a lot of bad advice in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people are just not valuing the
skill sets that we've developed over the
[SPEAKER_01]: years at great risk because they just
think it's a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really heartbreaking to see some
of these just very simple mistakes that
[SPEAKER_01]: are costing people millions and millions
of dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also the practices that a lot of growers
had just aren't accepted in the industry
[SPEAKER_03]: anymore simply because your product is
going to be tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to be completely free of pesticides
and fungicides and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whereas before it wasn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people just used whatever they
could to finish a crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're living in a place that had
a lot of humidity, a lot of cool
[SPEAKER_03]: temperatures, they were going to end up
with powdery mildew or partritus and that
[SPEAKER_03]: they would treat with fungicides and just
can't do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the products you mentioned,
Eagle 20, that was a very common fungicide
[SPEAKER_01]: to get rid of powdery mildew or bot or
some of these other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that shows up on tests now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even when you extract it, that can
actually pass through the extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: process and go into your concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are struggling with that as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, people thought that they were
clean of that because they would use a
[SPEAKER_03]: clone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a clone that came from a plant that
had been treated with Eagle 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: But still it's systemic and it would end
up and it could still be detectable.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing I think that has really
hurt the cultivators in terms of some of
[SPEAKER_03]: these big indoor and greenhouse growers is
when they accept clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody is so interested in getting new
genetics, better genetics and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: They accept clones that they think are
clean and only to find out that they end
[SPEAKER_03]: up with rusted or broad mites,
mites that are microscopic and take a long
[SPEAKER_03]: time to discern that you actually have
them until you see your plants failing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's something I've seen in
the industry that's very common.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody brings in a clone from a trusted
source and that trusted source shouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have been trusted as much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So something else we were talking about
just as industry is changing, you've got
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the first time you can put up these
high tech greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you think the industry is really
going as far as the cultivation methods?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, cultivation I think for bulk it will
probably be straight outdoors,
[SPEAKER_03]: although straight outdoors has its
problems too.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of the areas that have been
traditionally farmed like in Carpinteria
[SPEAKER_03]: and places like this, the soil may have a
lot of heavy metals in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may have contaminants from past growth
from years ago that are still going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: drawn up and they're going to be detected.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean you see a lot of bulk coming out of
the North Cow Market, the Carpinteria,
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Barbara.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's going to be for extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean that's a whole new industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not going to be flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is extraction and that has its own sets
and challenges too with now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you do have heavy metals that
could pass off to the concentrates as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's gotten a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something I've just been focusing on is
just some of my friends who are trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: get legal income to the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to help them do all their
paperwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to get them licensed and
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because what they said, there's about
50,000 growers in the state of California
[SPEAKER_01]: in 2017 and now there's like 5,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happens to the other 45,000?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're not going to close up shop
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just pushing everything out the
back door like they always have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that undermines the whole system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to hope to change that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it'll be interesting how this all
flushes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that there will always be a craft
industry for flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: But flowers are probably going to become
less and less a part of the industry as
[SPEAKER_03]: more and more goes into the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think California will probably be one of
the last places where the use of flowers
[SPEAKER_03]: diminishes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we just have a long history of it
and that's the way it's been consumed for
[SPEAKER_03]: so many years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know personally I still like to smoke a
good joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's one of the best things to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: That and maybe a rosin hit is nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also get the whole plant thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was never big on concentrates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Other than the fact that they're really
strong, they'd just be missing the whole
[SPEAKER_03]: plant feeling that you get when you have
all those different terrapins in with your
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my problem with the vape pins and
everything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some really good vape pins out
there and sure the flavors are great,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it felt like such a one dimensional
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You smoke it, you get high, really high
for like 10 minutes and then it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where some of the organically grown,
sun grown stuff that I get to smoke every
[SPEAKER_01]: now and then, it's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're high for two or three hours,
but you're not overly like, oh my god,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to die high.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the extraction still has a ways to
go in some cases, but the rosin,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely does.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the extraction you're basically
putting in your terrapins that are coming
[SPEAKER_03]: from other sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're growing from lemons you eliminate.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just putting it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're smoking that in a vape pen,
you get a strong flavor, but it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: artificial because they can't put in the
30 or 50 or how many terrapins there
[SPEAKER_03]: actually are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of them are there in minuscule
amounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: They put in the most prominent.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's four or five of those terrapins
they might put in to try to match the
[SPEAKER_03]: terrapin profile they get back from the
lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works in terms of you get some flavor,
but you still don't get the same effect
[SPEAKER_03]: that you would if you were smoking the
flower it came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once they extract it into that matrix that
the plant has evolved into, it cheapens
[SPEAKER_01]: the high.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grow one string called Saturnoji and
it's really mild, but it'll last for three
[SPEAKER_01]: or four hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: You try extracting that with a BHO or even
rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rosin actually gets the closest thing,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're only using heat and pressure for
that as opposed to a solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just beautiful, but you're
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing over the years extracts are
taking more and more of the shelf space
[SPEAKER_01]: for ease of use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who doesn't like a vape pen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who doesn't like a vape pen?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can smoke at a bar and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want to taste the plants and
the craft that went into it, the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, I think, is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think over time, less and less flower
will actually be consumed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it will always be that craft
industry just like beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have Budweiser, then you have all
sorts of little craft ones, local ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's funny you mention how long it lasted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day in the 70s when I was
breeding, I produced Afghani 1 and Durban
[SPEAKER_03]: poison for the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was one of my claims to Frank.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would give out member joints to people
to smoke and have them report back to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things I always told them,
always try to do your comparisons at the
[SPEAKER_03]: same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You smoke at night, 8 o'clock at night,
always do it at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then tell me how long it lasts.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long it lasted to me was the best
indication of how strong it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Saturn OG that I have was an Afghani
cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could have done it without you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the things we were talking about
too was all these new entrants to the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the first panels was talking about
the mergers and acquisitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of money coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: As someone who pioneered the industry,
how does that make you feel?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got these guys who are two years
into the industry and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: these multi-million dollar valuations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about you, that kind of
pisses me off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: People come in who have money and are able
to make more money because they have
[SPEAKER_03]: money.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't have a skill set or anything
else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, that's the way capitalism
works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, we all can still grow our
own marijuana and I think seeds and that
[SPEAKER_03]: will always be part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: What hasn't been adopted here is really
the autoflowers like they are in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the biggest seller in Europe are the
autoflowers, that and then feminized
[SPEAKER_03]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest, I've been growing for 10
years and I've never grown autoflower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't really fit into my production
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as California goes, Southern
California cultivation guys, we just don't
[SPEAKER_01]: do them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do you think that is?
[SPEAKER_03]: For one thing, we don't worry about the
length of the season as much as they do in
[SPEAKER_03]: other parts of the country.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can still grow like Colombian in my
backyard here in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, most of the country you can't do
that only because it's still flowering in
[SPEAKER_03]: November, December.
[SPEAKER_03]: The autoflowers, I don't have much
experience with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did grow autoflower because I wanted to
learn a little bit about its genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I did is I crossed it with a male
autoflower with six different varieties
[SPEAKER_03]: that I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I knew how strong they were.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one that I had tested was a Pakistani
that had tested it at about 17 percent
[SPEAKER_03]: THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I crossed it with the autoflower and
I had it tested, it came out to eight and
[SPEAKER_03]: a half percent THC, exactly one half of
what the original was.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because the autoflower doesn't
contribute anything to it, at least the
[SPEAKER_03]: autoflower I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: It only had one THC synthase versus the
two it had when it was a Pakistani.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how it came out to half of what it
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, it may have been a coincidence,
but it seemed to make sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder another reason why we never just
got into them, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Southern California, everything's indoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bulk of my career was all indoor
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only when it was fully legalized under
Prop 64, it's like, okay, I'll drop a few
[SPEAKER_01]: million dollars into actually building a
real facility with sensors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prior to that, I had my metric where it's
like, okay, I have to spend $3,000 a life.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for all my ACs, my lights,
the rent, until you get to the first
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had to do it as cheaply as possible so
you could make all your money back in
[SPEAKER_01]: about six months because six months is
about the average length of time that a
[SPEAKER_01]: police investigation takes before they
raid you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how I used to set up all my old
indoor grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, for the first time ever, we're all
licensed and permitted and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay, wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't returned on investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can actually forecast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, we're going to put these really
high-tech sensors and data logging things,
[SPEAKER_01]: sensors, for the first time ever because
we're not worried about getting the door
[SPEAKER_01]: kicked down in six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's been really exciting for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, as I started in my garage and
always wondering if I'm going to get my
[SPEAKER_01]: door kicked down, which we have,
and that was fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 13,000 square foot indoor space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gone in about a span of eight hours,
like two years in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you finally can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's going to be great for our
industry too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the indoor cultivation definitely
has a place in the market for small craft
[SPEAKER_01]: producers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen just amazing flower grown by
really, really high-skill set of guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it's going to be important too
for just environmental and regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mixed-lite greenhouses are going to be
a big thing with all the new carbon taxes
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're starting to hit up the indoor
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the idea of using all artificial
light to grow your plants is just such an
[SPEAKER_03]: expense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of wattage.
[SPEAKER_03]: The water problem indoors is not really a
problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should be able to recycle almost all
of your water, and that's no problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just collect it off your HVACs or your
dehumidifiers, and it has nowhere to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in a sealed system, closed system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of misinformation on
the cultivation side, especially with the
[SPEAKER_01]: cities and the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember a few years ago when we were
in that drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our news articles were saying,
oh, it takes six gallons of plant every
[SPEAKER_01]: day for a cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, no, it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's caused a string of problems
with the regulatory agencies in the cities
[SPEAKER_01]: and saying, well, you have to recollect
and reuse all your water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, OK, so I'm going to save about
5% of my water usage, but I'm going to up
[SPEAKER_01]: my filter usage by about 100 times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to save a bunch of water,
but it would generate a ton of waste with
[SPEAKER_01]: all the filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm using it to recapture all this
water that you're so worried about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting them to understand all that has
been really a challenge for me and as
[SPEAKER_01]: we've been working through all these
regulations that seem to change at a dime
[SPEAKER_01]: right in the middle of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, does that make you feel like now
you're coming from your first book was
[SPEAKER_01]: published in 74.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we are in 2019.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ever think this would actually
happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, in the 70s, I thought it would
be legal by 1980.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the problem, you see, most of the
more enlightened municipalities or states
[SPEAKER_03]: were starting to decriminalize it,
make the penalties a lot less.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you had Carter in the White House who
seemed sympathetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You also had the first US report come out,
or recent report, the SAFRA Commission.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they basically recommended that it be
decriminalized.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said that criminalizing it caused
more harm than good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, Nixon said, F you,
and just threw out that, paid no attention
[SPEAKER_03]: to it, and created the DEA.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really what happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was when the war on drugs really
started.
[SPEAKER_03]: By 1980, you had Rockefeller come in with
the determinant sentences on drugs,
[SPEAKER_03]: which changed everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Reagan came in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you started to have programs like
CAMP.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was a California program of
helicopters flying over the countryside to
[SPEAKER_03]: find marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when indoor cultivation really
started.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really started, pushed the indoor
cultivation absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you also had Operation Green
Merchant in the 80s.
[SPEAKER_03]: That started the whole round of them just
coming and not arresting you, but just
[SPEAKER_03]: taking all your shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was some tough times.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was some tough times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought we should mention something
about our experiences with lights,
[SPEAKER_03]: people who want to grow their own pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: My experience is you can grow it with
pretty much any light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some lights are better than other
lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the more recent ones, like the
ceramics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've grown with a little 315 ceramic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's amazing how much you can get from
that one little light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you were saying that you're trying
some 600s?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the light-emitting ceramics is a new
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, everyone knows about the LEDs,
the light-emitting diodes.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a guy who loves doing R&D projects and
side-by-sides with it, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: never really got the LEDs to work,
especially in flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the light-emitting ceramics,
like for veg, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100% embraced that technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we were using 600 watts metal
highlights, which wiped them out one for
[SPEAKER_01]: one.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a 315-watt, those light-emitting
ceramics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually worked a bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping some of the technology will
catch up where indoor cultivation actually
[SPEAKER_01]: could be economically viable for a lot of
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in other states, too, they're only
allowing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Massachusetts is like that to an
extent, where most of the cultivation is
[SPEAKER_01]: all indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's probably not that good from the
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using about 100 watts a square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think some of the LED stuff and the
LA C's could help get there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, I think the big
production is going to be mixed like
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses like mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are going to be more and more
comfortable investing in that
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially as you scale up, you have to
invest more per square foot in that
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure to actually keep you
climatized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we talked about earlier,
it's just like, you have to have a stable
[SPEAKER_01]: climate first.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the LEDs will be a big part of the
industry, even in flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you said you actually got them to
work, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never been able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I suck at LEDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Greenhouses with supplemental lighting,
I think, are really where it's going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: in terms of the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you have a greenhouse and just
rely on your natural crop, you're getting
[SPEAKER_03]: one crop, maybe two crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can push it and get maybe three to
five crops a year easy in a greenhouse if
[SPEAKER_03]: you have supplemental lighting and
darkening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's basically what you guys do,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this kind of goes back to earlier
conversation of these master growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to design a cultivation system
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you design your facility around
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we grow in organic soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a four-week veg time,
two weeks in a one-gallon, two weeks in a
[SPEAKER_01]: five, eight to nine weeks in flowering,
give or take.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have four compartmentalized
flowering zones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we get five harvests a year per zone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us, we're going to get about 20
harvests this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: About every 18 days or so, just like
clockwork.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's hard for a lot of guys,
understanding project management and
[SPEAKER_01]: scheduling and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to sync that with your drying
and your manicuring and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it all has to be figured out in terms
of that timing.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you're going to be really
unbalanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I can't tell you a main reason why
a lot of these guys are failing right now
[SPEAKER_01]: is, one, because they hire someone from
whoever, Colorado, and there's a master
[SPEAKER_01]: grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they put together a system they think
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once they actually start really
running the thing, it's like, oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our drying room's not big enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now we've got to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we've got to pull permits and fix this
and run electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, oh, crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't big enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or this is too big.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we have a lot of wasted space where
you could have thousands of square feet
[SPEAKER_01]: just line follow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, that's not making any
money for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you've got to pay the taxes on
that, because that's how much square feet
[SPEAKER_01]: is a canopy that you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that city is going to want your tax
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's a really big problem is
people don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just go in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They acquire land.
[SPEAKER_01]: They build a facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they try to shove a cultivation
system into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's really unbalanced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just leads to a lot of losses and
decreases in efficiencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think we've seen it both
since.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a lot of problems with guys who
don't understand that and don't value
[SPEAKER_01]: those skills.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, yeah, I've had guys tell me who
are willing to write me a check.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, your skills doesn't
really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just get some Dutch guy in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really disheartening.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then always in the end, it's like,
those guys are fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're failing right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, mentioning the Dutch just
reminded me of something funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is just maybe about eight months ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a DM through my Instagram account
from a guy in the Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_03]: in Amsterdam, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he asked me if I knew anybody,
any master grower who were willing to come
[SPEAKER_03]: to Amsterdam and grow for him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had the facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wrote back saying, what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're in Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should have tons of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, no, they all went back to
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice weather out here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anybody in the audience have any
questions or anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cultivation questions, licensing
questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question was about automation,
increasing efficiencies through robotics
[SPEAKER_01]: and reducing your labor costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as we get taxed more and heavily
more regulated and things like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're looking like guys like us are
looking for anyone any way to reduce those
[SPEAKER_01]: costs when you're at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for us right now, our biggest cost
is labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It accounts about for 55% of the costs
produced one pound or one plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: pound plant, whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially depending on what state or
municipality you're in, there could be a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of labor shortages and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I'm not in the middle of
nowhere right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And staffing can be a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'd be great if I could have some more
automation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're definitely putting a lot of
that stuff in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking to big ag for some of their
technology, like moving benches is one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Dutch are another guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the sliding benches.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got rolling benches that go side to
side.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I need a bench that goes front to
back, because my greenhouse is about 100
[SPEAKER_01]: feet long.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a heck of a trek when you're trying
to move plants up and down all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about trimming?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you use automatic trimming?
[SPEAKER_03]: We do a little light work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, because that kind of goes back to a
balanced system, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a 20,000 square feet of canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're harvesting about a little over 2,000
plants every 18 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing that every 18 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still a degree of seasonality
in our greenhouses, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the sun's really weak right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need staff up and staff down
throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we were to hand trim everything,
we would need 70 full time trimmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happens if I'm two days ahead of
schedule, and I've got 70 trimmers,
[SPEAKER_01]: like, hey, sorry, I'm going to take the
next couple days off.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would piss them off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use a light, a little bit of
automation when it comes to our trimming
[SPEAKER_01]: to have about a full time workforce of
about 20 full time guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, they get better at their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm able to cross train them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now they also know a little bit about
trimming, about processing, the packaging,
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of my entry level guys and
some of the guys who are kind of new,
[SPEAKER_01]: they get to see every part of the company
because we can move them around,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we are using some of that
automation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're more bought in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get to see who's going to be a good
performer instead of just having a head
[SPEAKER_01]: count of like 50, 70 people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we are able to reduce our turnover
rate because of that as well, just by
[SPEAKER_01]: implementing some of those automations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of our peers in the
industry are still kind of stuck in that
[SPEAKER_01]: mindset of, well, this is how it's done
for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to hand trim it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to hand water it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, yeah, that works great at a
craft level if they want to stay small.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works great when it's illegal also.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly, when you don't have to pay
payroll tackers with a workers' comp and
[SPEAKER_01]: all this other great stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it definitely has to be a part of the
new regulated world that we live in
[SPEAKER_01]: because those are just sacrifices you have
to make to not get your door kicked down
[SPEAKER_01]: or guys drop in from Blackhawd helicopters
on your head.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just things that we're all going
to have to accept.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've embraced a lot of that stuff
because we're not trying to get rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to make the jobs we have
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to pay the one guy who's
running those systems a lot more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to give him more opportunities
because we can expand the company that
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead of having dozens of minimum wage
employees, let's have a bunch of salaried
[SPEAKER_01]: guys who are actually making money,
good benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for my company, that's really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's only two things in my
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's people and plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: They grow good plants, produce good weed,
make good money, get right back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we do use a lot of that stuff
just to balance the system and make better
[SPEAKER_01]: jobs for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the automation
technologies that you're most excited to
[SPEAKER_00]: play around with?
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I've used BlueMath.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of irrigation?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really excited about, yes,
a fertigation system called Rhythm that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're just having installed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that can really just dial in some
of our systems further so we can actually
[SPEAKER_01]: see how dry the plant is and what that
time like, OK, here's when I watered
[SPEAKER_01]: first.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my dryback time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the system will know exactly based on
the parameters we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We set in it when to water it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some other data that we collect,
OK, what's that runoff look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the tissue analysis of the plant
look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the soil holding what's still
inside there?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can go back and program and dial in
these strains even further.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've developed a regimented system
where we know the genetics of the strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like my Saturn OG is an Afghani cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to borrow that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can actually optimize the system
faster because we have that good data set
[SPEAKER_01]: of collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know it's like, OK, this Afghani
likes this kind of fertilizer blend or
[SPEAKER_01]: this little bit of soil difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we find another strain that might
have another Afghani cross, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, well, we've already got a baseline for
that genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can optimize it faster by doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm really excited about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The environmental control systems like
Link 4, we're working with them pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I hate it when some of these companies
say, no one's ever asked us that before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that must be I have a new idea that
might be cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then it's a pain in the ass to
actually implement it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really excited with the data
collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've hooked up a lot of those
servers and sensors to a SQL server
[SPEAKER_01]: database.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can actually pull all the data out
of that and mash it up with these data
[SPEAKER_01]: visualization software.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the thrust of it is data.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that collecting more and more data
about how much water they're using and so
[SPEAKER_03]: forth and really getting it down to a very
fine art.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really when you get the most
production, the cleanest production also.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's repeatability, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question was, are we using data to
day-driven decisions on what strains to
[SPEAKER_01]: grow during what seasons?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also doing breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not doing breeding anymore because
of an accident I had years ago where I
[SPEAKER_01]: seeded 20 lights with the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no breeding on the side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a lot of amazing breeders
in the United States right now and in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's something, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a good point in terms of at
different times of the year, different
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivars will respond better or worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might be looking at a shorter season,
one for a winter crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For us, we really cut back our production
of certain sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because sativas, they tend to be much,
much more light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sativas evolved around the equator.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a longer flowering period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, the Southern California market
doesn't really like a lot of sativas in
[SPEAKER_01]: the wintertime anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, right now, if I had 10 pounds of a
sativa, I couldn't sell it to save my
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as the summer months come in,
they become much more popular.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're using data to just what's the
market demand and also what our
[SPEAKER_01]: environment allows us to grow the most
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you have a sativa that wants a
lot of light, and right now our light is
[SPEAKER_01]: so weak, it's about 70% weaker than it is
at the peak of summertime, you just won't
[SPEAKER_01]: get the yield out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're still using the same amount of
fertilizers, nutrients, soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: labor to actually still produce that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So your cost to produce a gram of a sativa
flower in wintertime is much, much higher
[SPEAKER_01]: than a comparable indigo.
[SPEAKER_01]: So absolutely, we use that 50%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the question was how much higher?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's about 50% higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: These things like a lot of light to get
that kind of yield out of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Blue Dream, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Classic sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Loves a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've seen guys who just grow beautiful
Blue Dream, but only under very specific
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of those is they eat a lot of
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the pure sativa is, like here in
Los Angeles, they'll still be going in
[SPEAKER_03]: November and December.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: The same when I was in Oakland,
I can remember growing Thai and actually
[SPEAKER_03]: haze, the old haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: The old haze would still be going
gangbusters in December.
[SPEAKER_03]: Slowly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I shouldn't say gangbusters, because it
all slows down, because the level of light
[SPEAKER_03]: is just diminishing, both in intensity and
duration.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question was, we've been talking to
other cultivators with alternative methods
[SPEAKER_01]: of farming, so dry farming, no-till
farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are very classic styles of
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: No dry farming is when there's no
irrigation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's still done a lot in
Southern California with certain berries,
[SPEAKER_01]: crops, and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as cannabis, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, the no-till is also something that
people have done for, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_03]: centuries maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I haven't seen these, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen these.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, I've seen just standard
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've seen them both ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it with premonized seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it with just going in there and
getting the males out before they flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Spacing, all different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depends on what they think.
[SPEAKER_03]: The size of the plant they expect to get
out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to be all different ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it'll come down to the person's own
personal data, their database,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's in their mind or it's
actually logged right in, of what works
[SPEAKER_03]: best for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen people, when it was illegal,
grow plants very close together and try to
[SPEAKER_03]: get a lot of plants, and now they want to
grow many fewer plants, but much,
[SPEAKER_03]: much larger plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: This will start to flush out as different
people, because whether you're profitable
[SPEAKER_03]: or not is what's going to determine how
long you last.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, you talk about dry farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't seen it done with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen it done with dozens of other
crops, but does it actually add value to
[SPEAKER_01]: the market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in our dynamic market,
the market will make those decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I've seen is just the
hand-trimming aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: While I still think that's the absolute
best one, I've done it probably a dozen
[SPEAKER_01]: times over the last 12 months,
where we had 20 pounds of a strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: and half of it was hand-trimmed,
the other half was a light machine-trimmed
[SPEAKER_01]: on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I couldn't get a dollar more for the
hand-trim stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, it looked better, but it only looked
marginally better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while that increased our labor costs
substantially to produce those pounds...
[SPEAKER_01]: No, the aesthetics did not add a perceived
amount of value to actually recoup the
[SPEAKER_01]: cost of actually generating that perceived
value, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's just a very dynamic market
right now, and there's a seasonality to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we're in the middle of
February.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are a bit slow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sales goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as soon as people get their tax
returns, man, let our sales go right back
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe not so much this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a whole other discussion for that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as no-till farming,
we use a method of that, and no-till
[SPEAKER_01]: farming is meant to increase the microbial
density in the soil, and that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: important for organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the structure of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, that's soil food web.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use a modified version of that,
and I think that's important, because I
[SPEAKER_01]: think for our style of cultivation,
that really increases the quality of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use mostly organics, and with organics,
it's like painting with a very large
[SPEAKER_01]: palette of colors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant can absorb multiple sources of
nitrogen from guanos, and different meals,
[SPEAKER_01]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas if you're using nitrates or
synthetic fertilizers, the plant's only
[SPEAKER_01]: able to absorb from one source of that
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can only absorb so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you have 12 different sources of
them, whatever input you're having,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it could actually take all that all
in, metabolize it, and get a much better
[SPEAKER_01]: yield out of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, that no-till method does have
benefits, but you have to understand how
[SPEAKER_01]: it works, and works within your
cultivation system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've seen a lot of guys,
like the raised planter beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever seen that work at scale?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, me either, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I mean, just so you know,
raised planter beds, they're just tall
[SPEAKER_01]: boxes of soil that's living, and you don't
typically replace that soil every harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're always reusing the same soil over
and over again.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I've seen happen at scale,
if one thing goes wrong with that soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: like root aphids, you're screwed,
because you're dependent upon that soil
[SPEAKER_01]: having that certain kind of nutritional
microbial mix to give the plant what it
[SPEAKER_01]: needs when it needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then if something goes wrong,
if you've got 10,000 square feet of
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse, you're going to have a lot of
problems with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it has a place, but you have to
know where to put it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the whole thing with growing
outdoors is like any farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have your good days and
your bad days, and your good crops and
[SPEAKER_03]: your bad crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be terrified of growing outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing outdoors here, just my experience
with growing at my own place, is just the
[SPEAKER_03]: bud worms are devastating, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which means you're going to have to net
the entire crop, or you're going to have
[SPEAKER_03]: to do BT the entire crop, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the BT works wonders.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works great if you're consistent with
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works perfectly right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of people just think they're
going to put the seeds in the ground,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they're going to water them,
and they're going to pull it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to have all those kinds of
problems you have when you're a farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the additional problem is that you're
stuck is going to be really scrutinized in
[SPEAKER_03]: terms of how clean it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of new entrants coming to
the market, like a lot of big money guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: big players.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of advice do you have for these
guys who are ready to drop millions of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars in this industry when they've
never grown a plant, or never sold a bud
[SPEAKER_01]: in their life?
[SPEAKER_03]: Find real master growers for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And good design teams to design the
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how would you even know one?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the kind of question I get all
the time, well, what makes a good master
[SPEAKER_01]: grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm a master grower because I've
earned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing this for 10 years,
and I've had a lot of successes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've developed a style of cultivation
that I think adds a lot of high quality
[SPEAKER_01]: and consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't really know what to tell
someone and how to identify some of those
[SPEAKER_01]: traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say we've got a millionaire over
here, and he's about to build a massive
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how is he supposed to hire that master
grower?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if I was that millionaire,
I would go to a place that is highly
[SPEAKER_03]: successful and get their master grower to
interview master growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be another consulting
interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this should be your job.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all this free time I have,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in the wrong business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just consult, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a friend who owns a compliance
lab here in LA that we use, CannaSafe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're always going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, I'm in the wrong game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should be doing lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then he looks at me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like, no, I'm in the wrong game.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should be growing wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grass is always green on the other side,
though, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's kind of some of that, when you're
at scale, you're not licensing in ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're kind of doing your own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you experimenting with,
genetic wise?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, as I was going to say, what are you
working on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when I have a really good clone I
feminize it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feminize it because I can't maintain all
these clones.
[SPEAKER_03]: But feminizing doesn't mean you're going
to get an identical plant at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still a mix of genes, even if it's
coming from the same plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll cause two or three branches on a
plant to transition to male flowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: Collect that pollen, pollinate the
branches that are still female,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then grow out some of those clones the
next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And none of them will have the same
terpene profile as the original did,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is very disappointing because I'm
usually choosing plants that I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: propagate because they have a really great
nose and a nice eye.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I also have been doing stuff with CBD
varieties, feminizing those, but also
[SPEAKER_03]: crossing them with a good THC varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have F1s and F2s that this year here
will be grown out to see what kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: different ratios we get and try to figure
out how this really works in terms of the
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD and the THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my first time doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was kind of surprised at the results.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had crossed a, I think it was what was
called Tsunami.
[SPEAKER_03]: I suspect it was a diesel that tested
about 10% CBD and no THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I crossed that with a Jack that
outdoors was testing at 20% THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: No CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I thought, what am I going to get out
of this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I didn't get anything I expected.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I got was 12% CBD and a 6% THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a perfect two to one ratio,
but it wasn't anything that I envisioned
[SPEAKER_03]: was going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why this year I've already got
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm prepared to do this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll work with another grow where we
can grow many, many more than I can do
[SPEAKER_03]: with my little grow and start to see if we
can make some sense of how these ratios
[SPEAKER_03]: will come out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we can better plan on how we do
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if there's going to be a real
market for the CBD crossed with THC CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers because this may all be done by
the extracts where they can get exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: the ratio that you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people, if they're taking a mix
of CBD and THC, they're taking it most
[SPEAKER_03]: likely for some medicinal purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they're doing that, they can always
get the exact ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to be able to produce strains
that will have those ratios anyway if
[SPEAKER_03]: people want to smoke them.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things that I think will be a
marketable flower that has CBD is
[SPEAKER_03]: something that has a good amount of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's say it has 15% THC and it has 5% CBD
because I think that's something that
[SPEAKER_03]: people can smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to get paranoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not going to get anxious because
the CBD is there.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one of the main objections to
smoking these high THC things is people,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially novices because they smoke too
much, they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get paranoid or they get very anxious
on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the CBD does counteract that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there will be a market for higher
CBD flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we grow Harlequin, which was one
of the original two-to-one ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got it from Harborside Health Center
back in 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a really medicinal strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the strains that we don't
covet.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anyone wants the cut, we will freely
give that out because it has a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: medical benefits to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can't sell it to save my life
because the real medicinal users are
[SPEAKER_01]: switching to extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It used to have a good presence on the
shelf years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shops like to have a high CBD strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that was still, when we were back,
all medical collective and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nowadays, yeah, all the extracts have
gone away.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the CBDs have moved all the extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I would love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10%, 15% THC and 5% CBD flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one quick question.
[SPEAKER_02]: On a purchase scale, can you talk about
how you go through the process of
[SPEAKER_02]: phenohunting and how you identify and how
do you make it to call out before you
[SPEAKER_02]: actually find it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phenohunting, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I would look for the structure and
make sure that I like the branching on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the flower formation on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice, tight buds, those sort of
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it was healthy, a vigorous grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then to choose between ones that were
fairly similar, I would just be rubbing
[SPEAKER_03]: the stems, branches, and trying to see
what kind of a nose it had, whether it was
[SPEAKER_03]: strong or not strong, and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then ultimately, it's what they
actually turn out to be afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to breed those things to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have a number of candidates that
you breed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you see what comes out of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd say experience really helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes you're surprised at what
comes out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really, I've seen some very
strange things happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, one of the ones was, if any of you
have heard of Brack City, Brack City came
[SPEAKER_03]: out of Virtual Las Vegas is one of the
groves there that I consult with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they crossed a Doctor Who with
something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think they had some bubble gum that I
had given them a while ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: A number of things go into this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happened is that the Bracks,
which I hope you all know, are actually
[SPEAKER_03]: where all those resin glands are.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the female flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people call those calyxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not true at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're Bracks.
[SPEAKER_03]: The calyxes you can't even see on a female
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anyway, it's called Brack City because the
Bracks are about three or four times as
[SPEAKER_03]: large as you see on a regular plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they're like that size.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was just something that happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: It turned out to be a wonderful cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for you, it's like you breed a lot
of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm guessing your phenol hunt's a lot
shorter than ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for us, it takes about nine months
from the day we pop a seed to the day we
[SPEAKER_01]: have a commercial amount of product for us
that's about 20 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's about a nine-month process
because we start with 12 pack of seeds and
[SPEAKER_01]: then sex test them through phylos labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that goes down to six females,
if we're lucky.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those six, you've got to keep all
the moms on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it takes up a lot of bench space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our estimates for us, over that nine-month
period and the wasted bench space,
[SPEAKER_01]: because now under the current regulations,
if you want to sell that, each phenol hunt
[SPEAKER_01]: or each phenotype or each one,
two, three, four, five, six, that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: different strain with a $750 compliance
test that you need to pay if you could
[SPEAKER_01]: even sell it to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's about 100 grand because of a lost
revenue from that bench space you're
[SPEAKER_01]: taking up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we only have a 70% success rate,
maybe 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, actually, OK, here's something that
we phenol hunted for nine months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it didn't work, like none of them
did.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's almost like, I would argue,
intellectual property at some point,
[SPEAKER_01]: where it's like, we found this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we might not have exclusive rights to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is definitely something that our
company has.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a mission.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, this brings up something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is the tissue culture and also
the testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The testing is just getting more and more
sophisticated, where you're actually going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be able to tell what kind of profile it
has in terms of terpene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether it's going to be pretty strong
in cannabinoids also.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the tissue culture will eventually,
I'm sure, replace the whole mother cloning
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, we're putting tissue culture in
our next facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of space, I mean, it's just
ridiculous that you wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, our next facility, we're going to be
doing tissue culture and turn those
[SPEAKER_01]: straight into moms and take the cuts off
those moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because tissue culture is just great to
really revigorate the plant and revitalize
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because keeping mother stock is
challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a high skill set.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have one employee at my facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's his only job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's great at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I didn't have him, we'd be taking
cuts off of our vegging stock,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are always healthy and robust.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you have to walk around 6,000
square feet of space to get a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand cuts off a plant, that takes
several days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having a good, healthy mother stock is
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anything past our scale, I think
that'd be really difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to be getting a tissue
culture lab all set up and everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think a lot of the advances that
we're going to be using, it's from Big Ag
[SPEAKER_01]: and a lot of data and technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we're going to be having
drones manicuring our plants just yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still always going to be that
human element.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's going to take a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can read over Trichome Technologies,
which is out of Oakland.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ken Morrow still writes for Canvas
Business Times.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember when I visited his grow,
that was the first time I saw a motherless
[SPEAKER_03]: grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he just lollipoped his plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They would grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would lollipop, take those bottom ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what he then rooted those.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was just a perpetual thing like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did that for years, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because my problem was I couldn't train
someone to maintain the mother stock well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if your mothers start degrading,
you're going to have really weak cuttings,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will lead to weak veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your veg isn't set up right,
you're going to have a bad flowering time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we would just focus really heavily on
the vegetative cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure everything was dialed in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take your cuts off that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flip into flower a few days later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then flower is pretty much on
autopilot if you have a really good veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this size, the mothers play a
pretty important role.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even then, it's like we're in the
middle of winter trying to veg those
[SPEAKER_01]: things out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a lot more light to keep them
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we're definitely moving towards
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, and some of those more big ag
practices and things like that that I
[SPEAKER_01]: think do have a home in cannabis,
especially at scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, that's just things that we have
to adjust to as we get this so much
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Onward, upward, right?
Yeah.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question was, when you say scale,
what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's anything above 10
employees, honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've scaled up other kinds of companies
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, manufacturing-based companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you hit that kind of 10 people,
that's when your level of communication
[SPEAKER_01]: just gets exponentially more intense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because now, if I'm telling you something,
well, now you have to tell someone else to
[SPEAKER_01]: do something as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just level of communication has
to just get much, much more robust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're at 40 full-time employees right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've gone quite a bit past that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I found, when it was myself,
I was doing things one way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I had three employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I had to change up everything I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I hit 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a whole other dimension.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was a big dynamic shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I hit 30 again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of 30, that was another big dynamic
shift of actually scaling up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking more at employees because,
at least for cultivation, ours is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very tacit knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, the knowledge that we've gained
over the years is very hard to transfer
[SPEAKER_01]: and to translate to other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if I can show you a plant,
I think you and I could tell you there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: dozen things wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I try to explain it to someone who
doesn't have that knowledge, that's very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, it doesn't look the right
kind of green.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, well, why?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, then you have to go back in
your data and understand that and make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure you understand all the moving parts
in a facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anything past that 10, you have to have
a lot of SOPs or a very good system in
[SPEAKER_01]: place to get you past that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, you're going to be doing,
or the quote unquote master grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to be doing 90% of the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while all those other employees are
just kind of like little helpers,
[SPEAKER_01]: getting him done who can't be critical
thinkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially when you need to have data
available and make people make decisions
[SPEAKER_01]: based on that data, that's really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, too, it's like scaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And scaling just to scale doesn't make
sense either.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, how many mega-grows are out there
right now in California?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like hundreds of thousands of square foot
since in Carpinteria and Santa Barbara and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, sure, they're pumping out
thousands of pounds a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's all garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all going for extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're barely making any money.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sell through distributors throughout
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just flour, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do extracts or anything yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will be doing that soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same with the ones that I collaborate with
and advise.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because these are really high end.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very, very well done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything that they grow is sold at top
dollar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the question was, what factors are
involved in deciding what phenotype that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to select for the market?
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, yeah, there's a multitude of
decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: One, if the flowering time is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our facility is really designed around an
eight week flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've selectively fetal hunted and
bred all of our cultivars and strains to
[SPEAKER_01]: fit right into that nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has to meet that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to yield well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to have a good aroma.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to fit within our portfolio and our
brand as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, my company Palomar has 20
different strains that we rotate on a
[SPEAKER_01]: bi-weekly basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So over a course of, say, two months,
we'll have four harvests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And three of those harvests are all
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll have set one, two, three,
one, and that really helps with our design
[SPEAKER_01]: scarcity in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Years ago, I was growing nothing but
Blackberry Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was crushing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one day, everybody stopped buying
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took me months to reset and get a
new cut in there and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we rotate ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where the mother stock comes
into play and just be able to pull that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Brings up the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: The market is really what determines it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You put your stuff out there and you get
back from the dispensers that this stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: disappeared in a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you've got this other stuff that's
still there five, six weeks later.
[SPEAKER_03]: You kind of know what you should be
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really what determines it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, the cookie strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't grow cookies to save my life for
some reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: The system doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not good at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's because there's so many different
cookies in the actuality.
[SPEAKER_03]: All different cuts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for me, they never yielded very
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're small bites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a really high cost producing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't get more per pound for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that just didn't make sense for us
economically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though it flew off the shelf,
I just couldn't get the wholesale price
[SPEAKER_01]: point I needed to make it economically
viable for our cultivation system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, I'd say that, yeah,
what the market will bear.
[SPEAKER_01]: But making sure it fits into your own
production, cultivation system,
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure all those things fit is really
important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just basically, when cultivar will yield
more.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the same conditions that another one
will.
[SPEAKER_03]: That plays a big part.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those things play a part.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's important, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some heavy yielding strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some lower yielding ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they all have a place in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the slightly lower yielding one
might help the other ones sell as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like support strains almost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it's like you have the really
popular gorilla glue or whatnot or wedding
[SPEAKER_01]: cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also have some other ones that are
really complementary to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people, it's listed in Southern
California, they'll buy an eighth of this
[SPEAKER_01]: in their normal one.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they might want to buy a gram of that
other one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so having that variety for a
cultivator is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: It keeps the market engaged and your
buyers engaged as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen wedding cake yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in person.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it looks really frosty.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got wedding cracker.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a wedding cake crossed with a
purple punch, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, any more questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's one of the strains that you're
still chasing from your yielding?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm not chasing it anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I wish I had the original Durban
poison.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that went to Amsterdam and became
something entirely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not entirely different, but quite
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the first one that I had, the one that
I really liked, actually, I just lost it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It never went to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had two different lines of the Durban.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had an A and a B.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the A happened to be the one that I
liked the most.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had a real licorice flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had purple stigmas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which you just don't see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Purple, some of them were lavender.
[SPEAKER_03]: That I wish I had.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you have now is a much more
commercial kind of rendition of what went
[SPEAKER_03]: to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of that problem was that I made a
mistake.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I gave Skunkme and Sam an Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I gave them the Durban, the B line.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the B line had a little bit of
hermaphrodism in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't realize it when I gave it to
him at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't find this out until many
years later when he told me he had to work
[SPEAKER_03]: with it, work with it, work with it to get
rid of their hermaphrodism.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was part of what changed that line
a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a heavier yielder now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not as sativa-like as it was when I
first got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was the most unusual plant that I
would say variegated.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a variety that I grew, I've seen
individuals that were pretty spectacular.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as a variety, it was just very
different from anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: The main thing was what a short season it
was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were harvesting it here in Oakland in
September.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I brought it to New York,
this is about 60 miles from New York City,
[SPEAKER_03]: we were harboring some of that in August.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was that early.
[SPEAKER_03]: So being from the East originally,
my whole thing with breeding when I came
[SPEAKER_03]: out here was to develop cultivars that
could mature back East before the terrible
[SPEAKER_03]: weather came in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the people I knew who grew back
there, they were basically growing leaf or
[SPEAKER_03]: really crappy Mexican that had some
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a situation out there where I went
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I already had hybrids, F1s of things like
Afghani and Congolese, Afghani and
[SPEAKER_03]: Nigerian, Afghani and Durban, and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I went back and I took those sativa
crosses and I back crossed them again to
[SPEAKER_03]: Afghani to try to make sure that we got
the shortness of Afghani in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did fantastic out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, those people couldn't believe how
strong that pot was.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had never experienced anything like
it in their lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was... That's pretty cool,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know where that's going,
but anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want you guys to realize that frame
of reference, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, okay, you were breeding stuff
to grow in New York back when it was still
[SPEAKER_01]: super illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: One seed would get you thrown in jail for
a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll tell you, that year was a very
successful year.
[SPEAKER_03]: We grew over 500 pounds of top notch.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, really top notch.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a mea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these guys wanted to do it again the
next year and they were bringing in money
[SPEAKER_03]: people who were just drug dealers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't feel good about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like the people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't like the fact that they wanted to
upscale so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all became the money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was more interested in the actual
growing and seeing what happened and all
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next year, they bought 140 acres
further away from where we originally
[SPEAKER_03]: grew.
[SPEAKER_03]: And went at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was back in California when I got a
call in July to come out there and help
[SPEAKER_03]: them and I didn't really want to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I relented because a few of the
people, they had sunk everything they had
[SPEAKER_03]: into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in fact, they had to rescue them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was hard to believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had gone through a whole year of
growing this very successful crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And didn't seem to have learned anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they went from a place that we
were growing in like bottom land,
[SPEAKER_03]: really rich, beautiful soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we had to do nothing to the soil
really.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could put your hand in it and just
reach this beautiful soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was really easy to grow there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So where did they buy this land?
[SPEAKER_03]: They bought it at another 1,000,
1,500 feet higher where the soil was rocky
[SPEAKER_03]: and sandy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And additionally, New York State that year
had a drought.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, I come and look at the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have no nutrients and no water.
[SPEAKER_03]: No water, they're not growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, I kind of remedied that and got
them growing well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometime in late August, I had to come
back to Oakland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I said, you know, I'll be back and
we'll be ready to harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: This crop would have been over a ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: Would have been over a ton.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as I was flying back, they got busted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they lost everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of them ended up in jail,
partly because New York didn't understand
[SPEAKER_03]: growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: At that time, they didn't understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: The year before, I was standing in this
wonderful field.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the guys came out and he showed
me a local newspaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: The headline was that they estimated that
the New York State marijuana crop that
[SPEAKER_03]: year would be worth a half a million
dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm thinking, it's worth more right
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's how little they knew about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when they got busted the next year,
they didn't end up in jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just lost everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: They lost a fortune.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were lucky back then, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were lucky for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I mean, I never got busted in my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never been arrested.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of it had to do with luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of it had to do with the fact
that I didn't personally sell marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't sell anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made money from my writing and my
photography.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other was that I didn't accept all
these offers that come to Hawaii,
[SPEAKER_03]: come to here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the growing for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll make a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that wasn't really my interest so
much.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really was fascinated with the plant,
the botany.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the way I went.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hope you enjoyed it.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
