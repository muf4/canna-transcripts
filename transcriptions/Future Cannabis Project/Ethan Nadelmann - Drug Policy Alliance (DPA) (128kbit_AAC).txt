I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to introduce someone who really
doesn't need a lot of introduction in this
[SPEAKER_00]: crowd, but I'll just do that for a moment
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: He is called by the Rolling Stones the
real drug czar, the point man for drug
[SPEAKER_00]: policy reform in this country and
increasingly nationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Formerly a professor at Princeton,
25 years ago he started to really get
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in drug policy and over 20 years
ago he started what is now the Drug Policy
[SPEAKER_00]: Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's been here since the beginning,
you know, I'm new to some of you,
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been with DPA for five years,
but Ethan goes all the way back to Prop
[SPEAKER_00]: 215 and before and he's been here and kept
a large presence in California for over 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years and I'm so honored and touched to
introduce my boss, my director,
[SPEAKER_00]: really a drug policy reform warrior,
Ethan Nadelman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you very much Lynn,
that was wonderful and Lynn's been doing
[SPEAKER_01]: an amazing job is heading up DPA's effort
in California on this, not just on
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana but other things as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before I get going and I should say if
somebody here wants to give me a five
[SPEAKER_01]: minute warning because there's no clocks
and I don't have a watch so it could be
[SPEAKER_01]: like running into the debates before I
finish here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let me ask you, how many of you have
heard of Prop 19?
[SPEAKER_01]: Raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you don't know what Prop 19
is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, you see all that, about 25% of the
hands, how many of you know what Prop 215
[SPEAKER_01]: is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Raise your hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of you don't know what Prop 215
is?
[SPEAKER_01]: Raise your hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because just so you know, 215 was the
medical marijuana initiative in 1996 in
[SPEAKER_01]: California and I apologize because I
realize in talking with you here,
[SPEAKER_01]: you ain't, a movement audience,
most of you are people in the money making
[SPEAKER_01]: side of this, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so part of why I'm up here is that I
want to be able to talk to you not as just
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe fellow stoners and not just talk to
you as people looking to make money in
[SPEAKER_01]: this new and emerging and booming green
rush of a legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm hoping that I can be talking to
you so that when I say to you fellow drug
[SPEAKER_01]: policy reformers, you think that's me,
that's you, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me say why this is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason why, the reason why these
opportunities exist today, the reason why
[SPEAKER_01]: you're here, the reason why there's a
legal marijuana industry for medical and
[SPEAKER_01]: hopefully for non-medical beginning after
election day, the reason why this is
[SPEAKER_01]: happening around the country, that none of
this transformation was driven by people
[SPEAKER_01]: who wanted to make money in this industry
trying to change the law so they can make
[SPEAKER_01]: money legally, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: None of it was driven that way,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand, and also by the way,
this didn't emerge also because of some
[SPEAKER_01]: new invention, some new tech thing that
just popped up and all of a sudden we got
[SPEAKER_01]: this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like that, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This movement, your opportunities exist
here today, the reason you are here today
[SPEAKER_01]: is because a small number of people like
me, like Rob Campy at Marijuana Policy
[SPEAKER_01]: Project, like our friends at Normal,
like Graham Boyd or a few others,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the people we work with went out there
beginning over 20 years ago to raise money
[SPEAKER_01]: from rich guys who had no financial
interest in this area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not making money in it illegally,
had no hopes to make money illegally,
[SPEAKER_01]: but who became engaged in trying to end
marijuana prohibition because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling that marijuana prohibition was a
monumental disaster for this country and
[SPEAKER_01]: for this world, and that arresting 700,000
people a year, putting tens of billions of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars into the hands of gangsters on
this side of the border and across
[SPEAKER_01]: internationally, doing things like ripping
people's property because of asset
[SPEAKER_01]: forfeiture laws and taking their property
away because they found a little weed or
[SPEAKER_01]: some money they thought was for weed,
that dragging women through the child
[SPEAKER_01]: custody courts because they tested
positive for weed when they gave birth or
[SPEAKER_01]: when they had a little baby with no
indication of harm to a child,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That drug testing people in American
society and saying you can't hold a job
[SPEAKER_01]: simply because you like to smoke weed,
not on the job but the night before,
[SPEAKER_01]: the week before, that all of this was a
disaster, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that it should not be allowed to
continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more than that, more than that,
it wasn't just about marijuana for most of
[SPEAKER_01]: the people I'm talking about, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're the guys, you look at
the guys who put the money up early on,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, George Soros and who's still
putting it up, you know, Peter Lewis,
[SPEAKER_01]: John Sperling, somebody said George
Zimmer, George Zimmer's a men's warehouse
[SPEAKER_01]: guy, John Sperling's University of
Phoenix, Peter Lewis, progressive
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance, George Soros, famous
philanthropist and financial investor,
[SPEAKER_01]: and a range of others, none of them were
getting into it just so that they could
[SPEAKER_01]: get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them liked to get high,
some of them didn't give a damn about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a notion that not just the war on
marijuana and marijuana use, was
[SPEAKER_01]: problematic, but that the entire drug war
was fundamentally wrong, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it meant was that even though we
understood and most of us understood that
[SPEAKER_01]: the answers with cocaine and heroin,
methamphetamine and psychedelics,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, et cetera, was not necessarily
gonna be the same as marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't gonna be looking to make an
alcohol-like model for these drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, some people feel that way and all
of us think that maybe that's the way it
[SPEAKER_01]: should be on some days, but by and large,
that was not the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was the idea that this
prohibitionist war on drugs was not just
[SPEAKER_01]: about marijuana, but everything else,
just the wrong thing for this country and
[SPEAKER_01]: the world, that taking America from 50,000
people behind bars in 1989 drug charge to
[SPEAKER_01]: half a million as of a few years ago,
that putting more people in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States behind bars on a drug charge than
all of Western Europe put behind bars for
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, and they have 100 million more
people than we do, that driving America's
[SPEAKER_01]: incarceration rate up to the highest in
the world, more than the Russians,
[SPEAKER_01]: more than the Chinese, more than anybody,
the highest incarceration rate in the
[SPEAKER_01]: history of democratic societies.
[SPEAKER_01]: America today, with barely 4% of the
world's population, but over 20% of the
[SPEAKER_01]: world's incarcerated population,
and that increase driven overwhelmingly in
[SPEAKER_01]: the 80s and 90s and early 2000s by the war
on drugs, that that had to end.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why is marijuana so pivotal in all
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a few reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first reason, the first reason is that
the area where we could accomplish the
[SPEAKER_01]: greatest reform was on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could take marijuana, unlike the other
drugs, where we have to talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalizing, rolling back mandatory
minimum sentences, having a less harsh
[SPEAKER_01]: drug war, a kinder, gentler drug war,
learning from the Europeans, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with marijuana, we could actually take
this thing out of the prohibition system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's why in 1996, when we did the
first Prop 215, the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative, the other initiative we did
was a treatment instead of incarceration
[SPEAKER_01]: initiative for people struggling with drug
addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those were issues where we saw that a
majority of Americans who had been seized
[SPEAKER_01]: by the drug war of the late 80s and all
the hysteria could say, wait a second,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can see it's gone too far when it comes
to throwing people in jail who seriously
[SPEAKER_01]: have a drug addiction and aren't hurting
other people, and we can see it's gone too
[SPEAKER_01]: far when we're telling sick people that if
they want to use this medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're a criminal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where this stuff came from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please understand that as we're moving
and as we're moving this market in this
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly awkward way and difficult,
challenging way from an illegal market to
[SPEAKER_01]: a legal market, understand the origins of
where your opportunities emerge from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand that you can all make money in
this stuff without having had to invest a
[SPEAKER_01]: penny in changing the laws to get where we
are today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Understand also that we're standing on the
shoulders of pioneers who led this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: I remember back 20 years ago when this
local activist on HIV and marijuana,
[SPEAKER_01]: Dennis Perot, in San Francisco,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically, if Dennis had not gotten
that thing going, drafting 215 for all I
[SPEAKER_01]: know on the back of a napkin, I would not
have come in then and raised the money
[SPEAKER_01]: from the big guys and get this thing and
make California the first state in America
[SPEAKER_01]: to legalize medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going back six years ago to Richard Lee,
I mean, Richard leads Hootspa with getting
[SPEAKER_01]: out there and saying, I'm going to try to
legalize marijuana in 2010, and I and Bob
[SPEAKER_01]: Campy and other leaders were saying,
no, this is too soon, Richard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a presidential election year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when Richard said, I want to do it,
I want to do it now, it's the right thing
[SPEAKER_01]: to do, we said, we'll help you on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, typically, when you run a ballot
initiative and you lose, you lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with respect to Prop 19 six years ago,
that initiative lost by seven points.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, in fact, it transformed the national
dialogue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, literally, in six months,
we went from having people from
[SPEAKER_01]: journalists and others saying,
ah, legalize marijuana never happened to
[SPEAKER_01]: people going, how come you didn't win?
[SPEAKER_01]: Somehow, a consciousness shifted at that
moment, and so Richard Lee will always
[SPEAKER_01]: deserve historical credit for having been
a catalyst, even with his loss in opening
[SPEAKER_01]: this thing up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the other piece of this, is about,
as we move forward, one of my fears,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we try to end the broader drug war,
is not to leave the rest of this drug
[SPEAKER_01]: policy reform movement behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, most people, with marijuana,
part of the reason we focused on medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana back in 20 years ago was because
the majority said it was time to end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of the reason was because the large
majority of illicit drug use in America
[SPEAKER_01]: used nothing but marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are a range of reasons for
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half the drug arrests in America are on
marijuana, although not half the people
[SPEAKER_01]: incarcerated are drug law violations.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you look at people going behind bars
and spending years behind bars for low
[SPEAKER_01]: level cocaine and heroin and meth
offenses, that is not right either.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter how much you hate those drugs,
that's not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my fear now is that as we move forward
with legalizing marijuana, let's not leave
[SPEAKER_01]: behind our commitment to rolling back this
broader drug war.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Drug Policy Alliance already
positioned where we're beginning to say
[SPEAKER_01]: our 20-year commitment to marijuana
legalization, we've been in a pivotal
[SPEAKER_01]: leadership role throughout with the first
seven medical marijuana initiatives and
[SPEAKER_01]: many of the state legislative efforts,
and we've had a hand in all four of the
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization efforts that have been
succeeded in the United States and in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: and in Uruguay, but we know is that as
this thing picks a momentum of its own,
[SPEAKER_01]: our mission is going to be to some extent
to try to end the broader drug war.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for example, most importantly,
to advance the notion, which is already
[SPEAKER_01]: commonplace in Europe and other parts of
the world, that nobody but nobody should
[SPEAKER_01]: lose their freedom or go to jail simply
for possessing any substance for their own
[SPEAKER_01]: use, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, whether you're a recreational user
of coke or an addicted user of heroin,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it might be, we don't know how
we're going to make it available legally
[SPEAKER_01]: or whether it's going to be maintenance
programs like you got in Europe,
[SPEAKER_01]: but what it does mean is the notion that
nobody but nobody should be losing their
[SPEAKER_01]: freedom or going to jail simply for that
little bit they got in their pocket or
[SPEAKER_01]: they're using, whether recreational or
addicted user, that's a core principle
[SPEAKER_01]: because it taps in to what is our
underlying most core principle,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is that we ultimately must have
sovereignty over our own minds and bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: That core principle is absolutely vital.
[SPEAKER_01]: No matter what, the same way as the First
Amendment doesn't just protect good speech
[SPEAKER_01]: or gentle speech, it protects ugly speech
and despicable speech, and we have to hold
[SPEAKER_01]: onto that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we begin to get in an era where
elements of political correctness and
[SPEAKER_01]: protecting everybody, so we have to
sacrifice the First Amendment,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you don't sacrifice the First
Amendment because when you start to
[SPEAKER_01]: sacrifice the most offensive forms of
speech for all sorts of rationalizations,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you begin to sacrifice other types of
speech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same, hey, I'm a good old
marijuana psychedelics guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love my weed, psychedelics been good to
me, profound, spiritual experiences,
[SPEAKER_01]: never much cared for cocaine, I gotta
admit.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me it was like having too much coffee
and post-nasal drip.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I understand, some of my friends
became poets when they did cocaine,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the fact of the matter is that core
principle of sovereignty over our own
[SPEAKER_01]: minds and bodies has to hold not just for
the drugs that we love, but the drugs that
[SPEAKER_01]: we hate and the people who consume them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's another, there's another piece
to this, was when you look at the origins
[SPEAKER_01]: of drug prohibition in this country,
when you look at who's been
[SPEAKER_01]: disproportionately decimated by this drug
war, arrested, targeted, punished,
[SPEAKER_01]: incarcerated, it is overwhelmingly people
of color, black people and brown people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Goes back to the first, even Asian people,
the first anti-opium laws were about
[SPEAKER_01]: Chinese minorities coming to California
and Nevada in the 1870s and 80s.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first anti-cocaine laws were about
blacks storing cocaine in the South in the
[SPEAKER_01]: early 20th century.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first anti-marijuana laws were about
Mexican-Americans mixing migrants in the
[SPEAKER_01]: teens and the 20s in the West and the
Southwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at the origins of these laws are
steeped in racism and racial prejudice and
[SPEAKER_01]: racial stigmatization.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when you look at who's getting,
you look in California where for many
[SPEAKER_01]: years not one white person was prosecuted
on a crack of fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: No offense, even the white people,
lots of white people were doing crack,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But not just where they were looking.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my state of New York where we had these
notorious Rockefeller drug laws and you
[SPEAKER_01]: had 95% of the people behind bars for
selling or possessing cocaine and heroin
[SPEAKER_01]: were black or brown, but that was not true
of 90% of the people possessing or using
[SPEAKER_01]: that drug, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know with marijuana that almost any
place in America that if you were to
[SPEAKER_01]: randomly stop 100 black kids, 100 brown
kids, 100 white kids and look in their
[SPEAKER_01]: pockets, roughly the same percent would
have a little weed in their pocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in every city in America the black kid
is two to 10 times more likely to get
[SPEAKER_01]: busted than the white kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: The brown kid is probably two to five
times more likely to get busted than the
[SPEAKER_01]: white kid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that on some level, I mean how can it
be that you're black, white, brown,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing the same thing but that
person is the one who's gonna get shafted,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's gonna get shafted because he
lives in a black neighborhood where you
[SPEAKER_01]: got tons more cops there or alternatively
he's walking through a white neighborhood
[SPEAKER_01]: and people are going what are you doing
here, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean damned if you do, damned if you
don't on this sort of stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So understanding is I'm talking to this
mostly beautiful white audience here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but let's understand and there have been
millions and millions of white people but
[SPEAKER_01]: then slammed and killed and hurt and
damaged by this horrible drug war as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But understand that the disproportionate
impact on this makes this a particularly
[SPEAKER_01]: venal public policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you have a book out there by
Michelle Ziena called The New Jim Crow,
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding that the war on drugs is a
new Jim Crow from slavery to Jim Crow to
[SPEAKER_01]: the modern day war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are all part of this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that brings me here to California
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in New York by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very proud of my California team for
all the work they're doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this initiative and I have to say I'm
very thankful to one of my new favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: billionaires, Sean Parker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I mean that guy, to my knowledge
he is not invested or planning to invest
[SPEAKER_01]: in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I've sat down and been talking about
this, I've known him for about eight,
[SPEAKER_01]: nine years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about this stuff,
it's about good governance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about smart public policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about moving America and the world in
the right direction, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That his commitment to doing this and the
partnership that we've had with him has
[SPEAKER_01]: been absolutely pivotal to making the
possibility that California is gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: legalize marijuana six weeks in a day from
today very, very real.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'll tell ya.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am, I'm nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because part of my job to be nervous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a naturally nervous person.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean the fact is when those polls
came out a couple days ago, first the PPIC
[SPEAKER_01]: poll and then the field poll with
different methodologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But each one of them showing 60% support
for legalizing marijuana for Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't had the experience of having
numbers that good just six weeks to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now my job is not to get overconfident.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell you not to be overconfident as
well, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And quite frankly, any one of you can even
give five bucks to help this thing over
[SPEAKER_01]: the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I'm pouring millions of dollars
into this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm raising it all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm depriving the rest of my organization
of other resources to do this sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether you wanna go to the website
CRMR and do it, whether you wanna go to
[SPEAKER_01]: our back table of drug policy and make a
tax law, do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do something, just a little something,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just have a little skin in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have that feeling that when that thing
wins on election day, you can say I gave
[SPEAKER_01]: just a little bit to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just do it because it's the right thing to
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a little bit, little bit,
little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not gonna cost you a lot, but you're gonna
feel good that you did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe me, you're gonna feel good that
you did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll tell you why else.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of the initiatives, I think some
of you know the lay of the land right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got initiatives up in Arizona and
Nevada and Maine and Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_01]: DPA, Drug Policy Alliance, Work with
Marijuana Policy Project and local
[SPEAKER_01]: activists to draft these things around the
country.
[SPEAKER_01]: MPP with local activists been taking the
lead on the fundraising in these other
[SPEAKER_01]: states.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the polling in almost all these states,
most of the polls, most of the time,
[SPEAKER_01]: show more people in favor than against.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we know is that's no guarantee of
victory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially six weeks out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially when there are rumors of
Sheldon Adelson or Adelson pouring
[SPEAKER_01]: millions of dollars into the campaign
against Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not sure if that's true yet,
but we think it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just bought the local paper,
which went from being pro-legalization to
[SPEAKER_01]: anti.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he put a million dollars in against
the medical marijuana initiative in
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got some opioid manufacturer
trying to get into some part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis pharmaceutical stuff,
pouring money, half a million dollars into
[SPEAKER_01]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you got some crazy woman in Virginia
who thinks all marijuana users are
[SPEAKER_01]: terrorists, pouring over a million dollars
into California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not as if this is just gonna be a
walk in the park.
[SPEAKER_01]: We gotta win, well, we have to win
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the no-lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to win it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine how terrible it would be if we
lost it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to win it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the rest of these things, we gotta win
a few of these other ones as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Florida's looking good, but there's real
money on the other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Missouri broke my heart, because if we got
in that just a little screw up on the
[SPEAKER_01]: signature collection, we were about to
make it and the numbers were great and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not gonna be on the ballot,
I'm sad to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Arkansas, this is the new world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two initiatives, both trying to make it on
the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: One trying to sue the other to get them
out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one that I don't like is the one,
it'll be that step forward, but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: basically guys just trying to make a lot
of money for themselves and not caring
[SPEAKER_01]: about the broader policy stuff and just an
ugly game.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's part of what we're getting into.
[SPEAKER_01]: We almost had that happen in Maine as
well, but we were able to get both sides
[SPEAKER_01]: to get together and just do one
initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: North Dakota popped up, gonna have medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they should've called us first,
because they drafted this initiative and I
[SPEAKER_01]: hope it wins, but it wasn't as good as it
could be.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Montana, they're trying to fix
something in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is gonna be the year of marijuana
come election day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five legalization initiatives,
three or four medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think we can win all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm reassured by the fact that in all four
states that won, Alaska, Washington,
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado, and Oregon, in every one of
them, the final tally, 55% in favor of
[SPEAKER_01]: three of those states and Alaska a little
less, was higher than we expected in the
[SPEAKER_01]: late polls.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm hoping that there's that thing lurking
out there that's gonna be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's why I feel special about
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just that you guys were first
with 215.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel bad you didn't go first with
legalization, but you got your moment now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact of the matter is the market here
is more than double the size of all the
[SPEAKER_01]: four other states that have already
legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact of the matter is that all eyes
are on California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be a very blue state, but all eyes
are still on California.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some other things going on with
this initiative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apart from the fact that it is the most
thoughtfully designed initiative ever to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen in the marijuana field,
apart from the fact that one of my key
[SPEAKER_01]: colleagues, Tamar Todd, who's been the
lead drafter of many marijuana initiatives
[SPEAKER_01]: around the country, basically interviewed
hundreds of stakeholders from Humboldt to
[SPEAKER_01]: LA to industry to government to what have
you and got it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apart from the fact that even many of the
people who were competing with Prop 64 to
[SPEAKER_01]: get their own initiative are now joining
hands on 64 and saying we gotta win this
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm very grateful for the folks who
are willing to do that after the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was almost like being in a primary
battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all saying you come out of the
primaries, everybody's gotta get behind
[SPEAKER_01]: the one-on-one, but that's really
beginning to happen now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's some other stuff going on in
this initiative that's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that it's the first statewide
initiative on marijuana to be endorsed by
[SPEAKER_01]: the Statewide Medical Association,
California Medical Association,
[SPEAKER_01]: unprecedented.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that it's got the endorsement of
major environmental groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them just came out a couple days
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also unprecedented in that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The support we're getting from unions and
others, absolutely pivotal.
[SPEAKER_01]: From civil rights groups, absolutely
pivotal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what else is special?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not just about legalizing weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also about sentencing reform and
about social justice and about human
[SPEAKER_01]: rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: This initiative basically says that if
you've ever been convicted of a drug
[SPEAKER_01]: felony, that cannot be the sole basis of
excluding you from getting a legal license
[SPEAKER_01]: in the new legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is pivotally important given the
grossly disproportionate way that people
[SPEAKER_01]: of color have landed up with criminal
convictions for doing the same thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: white people have been doing for a long,
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the first initiative that
basically says, I think it's the first
[SPEAKER_01]: one, if you've ever been convicted of any
marijuana offense that would no longer be
[SPEAKER_01]: an offense under Prop 64, you can apply
even if you're still behind bars to have
[SPEAKER_01]: that offense expunged or removed from your
record.
[SPEAKER_01]: This initiative, I believe, is the first
one that says if you are under the age of
[SPEAKER_01]: 18 and you get picked up with weed,
you may get an infraction and have to do a
[SPEAKER_01]: little community service or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you turn the age of 18,
that offense you got before you were 18 is
[SPEAKER_01]: automatically wiped off your record.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hundreds of thousands of people in
California have been hurt by these laws
[SPEAKER_01]: and have these things hanging around their
records.
[SPEAKER_01]: This initiative is the first one that says
up to $50 million after a few years is
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna go specifically to help those
communities that have been harmed by the
[SPEAKER_01]: drug war.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 60% of the money is gonna go to help
kids and not bullshit stuff, but stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: that we wrote in there to make it real.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 20% of that stuff is gonna go for
environmental and not just cleaning up the
[SPEAKER_01]: mess that some growers have made over the
years but even trying to invest in smart
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental stuff, parks, maintenance,
that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And 20% is gonna go for local law
enforcement but only in those communities
[SPEAKER_01]: that actually are allowing the retail sale
and production of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other reason I care about this
thing, it's not just that when this passes
[SPEAKER_01]: in California Election Day that it's gonna
reverberate throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna reverberate globally.
[SPEAKER_01]: About a year and a half ago I was on a
plane going from San Francisco to Mexico
[SPEAKER_01]: City and I looked to my right about an
hour before I landed and there's sitting
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerry Brown and his wife.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last time I knew Jerry Brown when he
was the mayor of Oakland and then we had a
[SPEAKER_01]: really vicious fight on television right
before a ballot issue in 2008.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hadn't seen him since then.
[SPEAKER_01]: Went over, said hello, he remembered the
vicious fight, but we put that behind us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You wanna see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go on YouTube and type in the words either
rude debate or really rude debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: What pops up is me and Jerry being
unfriendly with one another.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I said, are you gonna see President
Pena Nieto down there?
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you gonna say if he asks you
about legalizing marijuana in California?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, what should I say?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, well, the fact is we're gonna get
on the ballot and it's probably gonna win.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana's gonna be the damn nation of
civilization and society.
[SPEAKER_01]: I look at him, are you crazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Half people know Jerry Brown said he used
to smoke and the other half don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the truth is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have confirmation right here that he
used to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who the hell knows what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I had a bad trip sometime.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact of the matter is he did go.
[SPEAKER_01]: He did meet with President Pena Nieto.
[SPEAKER_01]: President Pena did ask him what he thought
and Jerry Brown said, I think it's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be on, I think it's gonna win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And said nothing bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're hoping he continues to say
nothing bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the fact is it's gonna be a
billion dollars in tax revenue and this
[SPEAKER_01]: guy's legacy is solving your state's
budget crisis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gotta look promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that there's been some law
enforcement buy-in and other stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that gotta be promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact is you go down to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I asked my Mexican friends and allies
and government people, what's it gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: take to change the drug war in Mexico and
the whole thing, 100,000 dead in the drug
[SPEAKER_01]: wars in Mexico, last 10 years,
last five years?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say when California legalizes
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll say, what about Washington,
Colorado?
[SPEAKER_01]: They say that helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about Oregon, Alaska?
[SPEAKER_01]: That helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: But California, if you do Texas too,
that'd be big.
[SPEAKER_01]: But California, right, it is gonna
reverberate in Mexico, in Central America,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Caribbean and in Latin America.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working with our Latin American
allies to try to roll back the drug war
[SPEAKER_01]: there and they keep banging their heads
and this peace agreement that's gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: happen in Columbia between the FARC,
the left-wing guerrillas who have been
[SPEAKER_01]: involved in drug dealing and the
government looks very promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: But quite frankly, even in Latin America
now, they wanna know what's going on with
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical marijuana from Brazil to Columbia
to Mexico to Costa Rica to Chile is the
[SPEAKER_01]: issue that's moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're seeing how the medical
marijuana issue back to the late 90s,
[SPEAKER_01]: late 2000s helped to transform the
dialogue in our country and to change the
[SPEAKER_01]: face of marijuana and educate people who
are closed on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they see that's the way things are
moving as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: People in Jamaica where they're trying to
inch their way towards legalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're still scared of what the US
government will do to them in one way or
[SPEAKER_01]: another, California goes, it gets very
hard for anybody to start rolling this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff back at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still not gonna be 100% in the bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bigger events have been turned around in
the past, but it's going to be huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that when we go to the United
Nations and are talking about are we gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: keep cannabis in these international
conventions that we have that much more
[SPEAKER_01]: traction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that when Canada hopefully moves
forward to legalize marijuana next year,
[SPEAKER_01]: and God bless Justin Trudeau, we need
leadership like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta tell you, you look around the
world now, you look at that bastard Putin,
[SPEAKER_01]: the biggest mafiosi in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at Chinese leadership,
Xi is just becoming a dictator.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at Erdogan in Turkey.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at what's going on in Hungary and
in Poland.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look at the mess in Brazil and
practical civil disorder in Venezuela.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean you look at this ugliness going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I gotta say, I look around and say,
who's good out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Justin Trudeau's at the top of my list.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kinda like the Pope too, even though
he's kinda closed on this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And truth be told, we slammed President
Obama in his first term, and his people
[SPEAKER_01]: would say, if we get a second term,
we'll be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I gotta hand it to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not take for granted the extent to
which the White House and the Justice
[SPEAKER_01]: Department have allowed this stuff to
proceed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was not inevitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the fact that they still have a DEA
saying bullshit all the time and the
[SPEAKER_01]: National Institute of Drug Abuse doing
bullshit all the time, and that Obama's
[SPEAKER_01]: kinda letting that whole conflict play
out, but the fact of the matter is what's
[SPEAKER_01]: opening up here, notwithstanding what the
letter of federal law, is a credit to this
[SPEAKER_01]: administration, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I'm not supposed, let me take off my,
how much time do I have left by the way?
[SPEAKER_01]: A few more minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I won't go through as long as you're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let me just take off my drug policy
alliance hat here and my drug,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and just speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally for a second about the
spectacle that's gonna happen tonight and
[SPEAKER_01]: over the next six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a drug policy perspective,
there is no question but that Hillary is
[SPEAKER_01]: better than the other guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it did not reassure me that Governor
Christie, who's been mixed on these
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an office in New Jersey,
he's been mixed on this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You never know, like the last week ago,
okay, medical marijuana or PTSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But meanwhile, he's in the primary saying
smoke your weed now, because if I become
[SPEAKER_01]: president, I'm gonna bust you all,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so he's unreal, but the thought of
him as a potential attorney general
[SPEAKER_01]: candidate or something, not promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sheldon Adelson, I saw he just screwed
Trump, you only get him five million,
[SPEAKER_01]: a hundred million, he's pouring into the
Republicans, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact that Adelson was the first
major Republican donor to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll back that guy, and Adelson meanwhile
is pouring, the only guy pouring seven
[SPEAKER_01]: figures money against marijuana reform,
right, not promising.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that his VP is Mike Pence from
Indiana, who has been the far evil side on
[SPEAKER_01]: the drug war.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, finally as governor, he finally
agreed to allow a little needle exchange
[SPEAKER_01]: where a whole ton of people, basically
white people, started getting HIV and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that, and so he really had to
do something, but he's been a nightmare as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't know if it's Trump,
you know, he's a New Yorker, he doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: give a damn.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I think he did 20 years ago,
said let's legalize all drugs,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then he'll say something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, whatever comes out of his mouth,
you can't count on anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can flip-flop any which way,
but the people around him and the people
[SPEAKER_01]: he'll appoint, not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hillary, she doesn't have this in her,
you know, I mean Obama was more cool with
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but Hillary is going to Democratic
fundraisers and saying I promise you I
[SPEAKER_01]: will be at least as good as Obama was on
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's important, that's important,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: She's willing to sign on to stuff about
ending the drug war in a big way.
[SPEAKER_01]: She gets the problems of mass
incarceration, she gets some of this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, she's paying attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And look, Gary Johnson, Libertarian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, Gary, we opened an office in New
Mexico back in January 2000 when Gary was
[SPEAKER_01]: governor of New Mexico, and he and I
became fairly close, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a Libertarian Republican governor,
wanted to move drug policy reform in the
[SPEAKER_01]: right direction, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically the Democratic legislature
hated him because he was vetoing all the
[SPEAKER_01]: spending bills, and we opened up to work
in a bipartisan way with both of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gary Johnson signed a whole host of
things, from giving back former felons the
[SPEAKER_01]: right to vote, to all forms of diversion
programs, to getting behind our medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana bill, which only passed some
years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it may well be Gary Johnson
increased state spending on drug treatment
[SPEAKER_01]: by 50%, that Libertarian cost-cutting
governor, and I think we brought out the
[SPEAKER_01]: best in Gary, he did the right stuff
there, he did the right stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact of the matter is,
there's an election happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you live in a non-swing state,
you're in California, you're in New York,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're in Mississippi, you're in whatever
it is, vote for Gary, vote for Jill Stein,
[SPEAKER_01]: vote for whoever you want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you live in a swing state,
there's a real choice now, a real choice,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's about drug policy,
and don't get me going on my personal
[SPEAKER_01]: views about the future of the country in
this world, and you know, so I'll leave
[SPEAKER_01]: that as.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to my drapey hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, going forward,
[SPEAKER_01]: my hope is that this industry,
as it grows, as it becomes more dynamic,
[SPEAKER_01]: can become a model of a legal industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now mind you, there's tactical reasons for
it to do that, because this thing is not
[SPEAKER_01]: in the bag as yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if this thing goes south, if all of a
sudden there's a whole lot of bad
[SPEAKER_01]: products, on the market, if all of a
sudden we have major increases in
[SPEAKER_01]: adolescent marijuana use and things like
that, we got a problem on our hands,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If all of a sudden there's all tons and
tons of marijuana being produced legally,
[SPEAKER_01]: but shipped out of state across state
lines to states that have that,
[SPEAKER_01]: we got a problem on our hand, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that the Obama administration gave
the states that legalized a qualified
[SPEAKER_01]: green light to proceed, but there's a
whole bunch of conditions, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We know that they said, hey listen,
the 1970 Federal Control Subs Act says,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's in the interest of drug policy,
but advancing public health and public
[SPEAKER_01]: safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana legalization, to keep moving
forward safely, has to continue to be
[SPEAKER_01]: about advancing public health and public
safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how we succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think because of the origins of
where this all came from, remember,
[SPEAKER_01]: this has basically never happened before.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has never been a social justice
movement in American history.
[SPEAKER_01]: That resulted in the emergence of a legal
industry worth tens of billions of dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at the other social justice
movements that we sometimes model
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves on, or whose shoulders we step
on as we move forward, gay rights,
[SPEAKER_01]: civil rights, women's rights, all of those
movements as they proceeded in America had
[SPEAKER_01]: significant economic consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no one of them created a brand new
industry worth tens of billions of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: The closest analogy historically is the
repeal of alcohol prohibition,
[SPEAKER_01]: but even there, that was essentially just
re-legalizing a market that had been legal
[SPEAKER_01]: just 15 years before.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are doing something unprecedented and
truly new.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is truly special.
[SPEAKER_01]: The benefit that will happen almost
automatically is that people getting
[SPEAKER_01]: busted, especially black and brown people
getting busted for drugs, that that
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity is just not gonna be there for
them to get busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that as we move forward to
legalize marijuana in the states where a
[SPEAKER_01]: majority support that, we cannot forget
about what's happening in the South and
[SPEAKER_01]: other parts of this country where you
still have people serving many years
[SPEAKER_01]: behind bars for a second or third
marijuana possession offense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot forget about the half the states
where marijuana is not even legal for
[SPEAKER_01]: medical purposes as yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot forget about the millions of
Americans continuing to be victimized in
[SPEAKER_01]: the workplace or the courts in all sorts
of ways, and disproportionately victimized
[SPEAKER_01]: if you are poor, if you are young,
or if you are a color.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot forget about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you're making the money, remember that
piece and fight for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanna make this pitch to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about as you move forward,
making a promise to do just one good
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one good thing to make legalization
of marijuana a better thing for society
[SPEAKER_01]: and the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by what I mean by one good thing,
I mean something that does not help
[SPEAKER_01]: directly or even indirectly, maybe
indirectly, indirectly, but does not help
[SPEAKER_01]: your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means the notion of tithing one,
two, five, 10% of your sales or your
[SPEAKER_01]: profits to helping advance this cause
further.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means making a commitment to diversity
in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means making a commitment to setting up
some little mentoring program so that
[SPEAKER_01]: people who might not otherwise have a
chance to get into this industry can get
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means taking real pride in the quality
of your product and in the way you try to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that the young people are not
getting involved in this stuff and that
[SPEAKER_01]: you are really being careful and
responsible about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make that commitment to yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can tell me later if you wanna do
whatever, but just make the commitment to
[SPEAKER_01]: do one good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just one good thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how many of you know what the
word mensch means.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mensch is a Yiddish word.
[SPEAKER_01]: It basically refers to a man or a human
being, and what it really refers to is a
[SPEAKER_01]: human being who uses their head and their
heart in the right ways in life,
[SPEAKER_01]: to treat their fellow human beings
decently, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said TV programs, what's your vision of
a drug policy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Legalization, it's not just all drug
legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we need to think about it,
arguments for it, but no, it's more subtle
[SPEAKER_01]: than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you talking about just a kinder,
gentler drug word?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm talking about is the mensch-kite
approach to drug policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about a way of dealing with
drugs and drug users and drug markets
[SPEAKER_01]: that's about doing the right thing,
making this thing fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of a small as beautiful guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would just as soon not see big alcohol,
tobacco, pharmaceutical, consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: companies take over this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see the microbrewery market or
the vineyard market be a dominant modality
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see us get to the day when
maybe we could have farmers markets in
[SPEAKER_01]: some parts of this country with some
quality controls, but I'd like to see
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see this industry be
reasonably taxed in a productive way so
[SPEAKER_01]: that basically the illicit side is
essentially fading away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see us work side by side while
the pharmaceutical companies are producing
[SPEAKER_01]: their isolated products from the cannabis
plant in ways that are gonna help people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to see us do all these things in
the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come election day, you know what to do,
but don't just vote for Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the rest of the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another initiative that Jerry
Brown's actually behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never thought I'd be getting behind Jerry
Brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prop 57, which is about parole reform and
juvenile justice reform, putting fewer
[SPEAKER_01]: people behind bars.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you pull the lever for 64,
pull the lever for 57 as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we get into implementation,
be at the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand you gotta protect your
interests, but do it in the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just to conclude, we are now beginning the
second generation of the global drug
[SPEAKER_01]: policy reform movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've gone from 215 and 96 legalizing
medical marijuana to over half the states
[SPEAKER_01]: legalizing marijuana to California about
to legalize marijuana six weeks from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And create a whole new model for how to do
this thing right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are turning the country and we're
beginning to back away from mass
[SPEAKER_01]: incarceration, but if we hit the tipping
point of marijuana legalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: we barely hit a turning point when it
comes to ending mass incarceration in this
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody say, where we are in mass
incarceration, we've hit a turning point,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's like turning around an ocean
liner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never actually said that on an ocean
liner, but it means that even when you
[SPEAKER_01]: point that in a new direction,
it takes time to turn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it means when we're talking with
people who use drugs, no matter what that
[SPEAKER_01]: drug is, no matter how much you hate that
drug or had a bad trip with that drug,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not gonna demonize people simply
because they use that drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they use that drug and don't hurt
anybody else, it's none of the
[SPEAKER_01]: government's business or even their
employer's business so long as they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they're struggling with addiction,
it means don't just whack them over the
[SPEAKER_01]: head and lock them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't throw them into some drug court
which is gonna keep trying to chip them up
[SPEAKER_01]: and put them in there for longer if they
can't be clean, clean, clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means let's do this the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So listen everybody, best of luck on
election day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it happen, make it happen,
make lots of money, do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
