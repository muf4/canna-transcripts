[SPEAKER_00]: And speaking about other, you know,
cannabis solutions is Big Pharma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Dr. Ethan Russo is here to talk on the
three echelons of cannabis commerce,
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical development, standardized
cannabis supplements, and artisanal
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Ethan, you talk about a peaceful
coexistence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you explain that to us and what that
would mean to us as a collective?
[SPEAKER_01]: First, by way of introduction,
yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a neurologist, but I've been an
organic farmer since 1974 when I was a
[SPEAKER_01]: grad student at UC Davis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, while I was in practice in
Montana, I ran a thing called BAFO,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Blackfoot Organic Fruit and Flower
Operation, and sold the most expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: organic vegetables you can imagine at the
farmers market in Missoula.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are three echelons of activity
in terms of how cannabis is produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: The model that you probably will not be
emulating is the pharmaceutical model.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that, I like to say that there are four
pillars of true medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a graphic here.
[SPEAKER_01]: By now you've probably all read the
100-page PDF that I sent, but anyway,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is just a little analog
demonstration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the four pillars of a true medicine are
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Safety, self-explanatory, standardization.
[SPEAKER_01]: That might require a little more
explanation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you show absolute chemical consistency
over time?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a prerequisite of a
pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the one that's often ignored is
the fourth one, called accessibility,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's a combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it available, number one, but number
two, is it affordable?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if it's not, if we're talking
about biological medicine, the things they
[SPEAKER_01]: advertise on TV and they hope you're not
listening when they're two paragraphs of
[SPEAKER_01]: rapid-fire side effects that they
describe, most of those medicines are in
[SPEAKER_01]: the 50 to 60K per year range in cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, you're dealing in a much more
reasonable level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So beyond the pharmaceutical model,
which is generally a 10 to 12-year
[SPEAKER_01]: proposition and somewhere between 800 and
1.1 million and 1.2 billion expenditure,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is the case that you can make a
botanical medicine that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical, approvable by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been done with Epidiolex,
98% pure CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would have been a lot happier if that
had been an extract with full flavor and
[SPEAKER_01]: capabilities in the medicine, but I don't
work at that company anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're not likely going to be going
for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If anybody's interested in genuine
pharmaceutical production, we can talk
[SPEAKER_01]: more later.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second echelon of activity would be
material that's still pretty standardized.
[SPEAKER_01]: But would say be sold on the supplement
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this could be any number of
products that are derived from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably not so much straight flour,
but any kind of extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it could be a topical.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be oral.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be some of the products that
we've seen people bring today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is a growth area.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clearly, a lot of you might know people
like Horizon Herbs and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of those people, especially in
southern Oregon, had big enough operations
[SPEAKER_01]: that they were able to put out their own
tinctures commercially and this kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, again, requires a lot of
bureaucratic rigmarole to do properly,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's below the pharmaceutical effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally is the third.
[SPEAKER_01]: The artisanal, for lack of a better term.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, it's not the case that everyone has
an expert herbalist in their neighborhood
[SPEAKER_01]: and can vouch for, you know, this batch of
material is really strong, so you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: be very careful with it, as opposed to
it's good for this condition and not so
[SPEAKER_01]: much for that condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for you that have been doing this a
long time, I'm sure you have good ideas
[SPEAKER_01]: about what you have and what it's good
for, and that hopefully can also succeed
[SPEAKER_01]: in the current difficult market.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you do have to distinguish yourself in
some way, and I'll be talking a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: about how to do that later, particularly
with regards to different components of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis on what their therapeutic
benefits are and how they can be leveraged
[SPEAKER_01]: in a patient population.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
