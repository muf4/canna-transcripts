[SPEAKER_00]: What I always found interesting was like
you know centuries of tradition and then
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's like what if I did this and it
led to kind of this like every day I'm on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram I see some new person and I
don't mean this in a bad way like being
[SPEAKER_00]: inspired and just loving it and being like
I love doing this and then you know you
[SPEAKER_00]: have everything from I actually brought
some of Ben's winning solvent list that he
[SPEAKER_00]: had given me two weeks ago so it's also
kind of like innovation in almost like
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: He came yesterday to the event.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah no no that's why when he posted that
picture I was like she's in LA he was like
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah and I was like all right but so can
you give kind of of the quick backstory of
[SPEAKER_00]: could be because it's two things one is
kind of the automated almost like an
[SPEAKER_00]: automated dry sift but then were you the
first person to do it in ice water too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the first person to do in ice water
but to figure out that the bags was the
[SPEAKER_01]: simplest way to do it in ice water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So other people were doing it just loose?
[SPEAKER_01]: No they were they made this big machine
that was all made of steel and wood and
[SPEAKER_01]: cost a bloody fortune and had to ship down
six down to Australia which cost even more
[SPEAKER_01]: of a fortune and the problem was they'd
all be made in Czechia or Yugoslavia and
[SPEAKER_01]: at the bottom where there was this plastic
funnel they all exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is this what he won for?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the banana OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean so if you think of when you
were in like India what was that 40 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago or 30 years ago which is you know
either a brick or a temple ball to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the innovation and consistency that you're
seeing now like are you excited to see
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of people playing with?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's excellent it would not be
right if people were still only using the
[SPEAKER_01]: dry sift in the bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very good thing that the innovation
is happening whichever direction it's
[SPEAKER_01]: taking it to solvent to rosin I must say I
prefer the rosin to the solvent but it's
[SPEAKER_01]: moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know in any industry they don't build
houses like they did a hundred years ago
[SPEAKER_01]: even the doctor has a lot more happening
for him to use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with this also it's going to evolve and
I don't know exactly where it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be going but I feel kind of funny and
proud to be the kind of beginning of it or
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah with that machine because that was
the first mechanized system to separate
[SPEAKER_01]: the clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was in what year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually I invented it in 92, 93 but I
didn't open a company until early 94.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this year actually at the New Year's
Eve will be around for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you first did it and then you
showed other people were they like that's
[SPEAKER_00]: genius?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we first did it basically I built a
machine for myself because I wanted some
[SPEAKER_01]: good hash and I lived in India for 14
years and traveled Pakistan, Afghanistan,
[SPEAKER_01]: Nepal, Kashmir so I knew how hash was made
in different regions and then came back to
[SPEAKER_01]: Holland and suddenly the whole city is
filled with coffee shops that sell weed
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'd never encountered weed to smoke in
the 23 years I had been smoking hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the hash producing countries?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I find that interesting that they don't
smoke the flour at all in any of those
[SPEAKER_00]: countries?
No.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way from Morocco all the way to
China and there's definitely in the
[SPEAKER_01]: northern whole area they'll smoke hash
maybe in places like Thailand and South
[SPEAKER_01]: India there will be some weed being smoked
but because when in 64 I started smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: in Amsterdam there was also no weed there
was only hash and it came from the sailors
[SPEAKER_01]: you know they traded with Lebanon Pakistan
and brought some ash along for themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: to sell and they got to Amsterdam and
that's how we got first hash so I never
[SPEAKER_01]: tasted weed on all my travels there was
always only hash and I must say I did I
[SPEAKER_01]: think one time try and smoke the Manali
weed and thought it was awful compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: the hash so that was the one time only.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all right so you create kind of the dry
sift and then who did you first see
[SPEAKER_00]: washing?
[SPEAKER_01]: No the first news about water came from
the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like do you remember who was doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Morrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was into the terpenes like ten years
before anyone else had hardly heard of
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the first one that I got word that
he was using water but it was just in a
[SPEAKER_01]: glass and there was no mention of ice and
you just put water and your product in
[SPEAKER_01]: there and stirred it up a bit and we did
it made a big mess in the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing this with Annie Rican who used
to work for the High Times and there were
[SPEAKER_01]: actually some crystals because the
crystals are heavier heavier than plant
[SPEAKER_01]: matter so they will always sink at the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: But by the time we got all that water and
plant matter out it was negligible what we
[SPEAKER_01]: retrieved.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from that slowly slowly then this
machine came out maybe about six months
[SPEAKER_01]: nearly a year later and that because it
showed it had a stainless steel bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: with a like a stirrer like a pancake
stirrer on it and then a screen and then
[SPEAKER_01]: this plastic funnel with a cute little
bottle hanging at the bottom and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: great except all of them broke and I was
just racking my brains how can I do this
[SPEAKER_01]: system through the screen in the water
with ice by then we'd figured that out and
[SPEAKER_01]: just stick it in an envelope and my career
started as owning a boutique so I knew all
[SPEAKER_01]: about cloth and clothes and sewing so how
to get a screen horizontal in a bucket
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah you make the cloth that hangs over
the bucket so I stitched the very first
[SPEAKER_01]: ones myself that I've now donated to a
mobile hash museum in Holland and so yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: and then later on actually we ourselves
were using the washing machine and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: my last product in this line because
washing machines were invented to wash
[SPEAKER_01]: your dirty socks clean and for a washing
machine to have plant material in there
[SPEAKER_01]: with ice and everything it does a perfect
job you know it washes those crystals off
[SPEAKER_01]: and they end up in the runaway water and
that you can catch in the bags and so you
[SPEAKER_00]: created the bags and what what was the
reaction to kind of that innovation where
[SPEAKER_00]: people like that's also genius like you
are you need to smoke more weed and come
[SPEAKER_01]: up with more ideas no no no the first time
I remember we had a booth I think it was
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe in Switzerland or even in Holland I
forget and I'd hung the whole booth with
[SPEAKER_01]: bags and every single person walked by
they knew me from the pollinator from the
[SPEAKER_01]: dry sift machine and they just thought I'd
gone mad and they didn't see at all how
[SPEAKER_01]: these bags work they just saw all these
bags hanging there but then slowly slowly
[SPEAKER_01]: the magazines caught on and wrote about it
and Soma was a great lover of the bags
[SPEAKER_00]: originally so that really helped promote
it yeah very cool and and then when I
[SPEAKER_00]: think of kind of innovations and
consistency was there like a good decade
[SPEAKER_00]: where was mostly just people doing ice
water hash and making temple balls and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you like when did you first start ice
water hash you don't make bricks and
[SPEAKER_00]: temple balls it's too precious well I
thought like Frenchy makes temple balls
[SPEAKER_01]: right he definitely uses ice water well
that's not old and traditional and all my
[SPEAKER_01]: travels in Afghanistan Pakistan I never
saw anyone use water apart when they had
[SPEAKER_01]: sifted the crystals sometimes they'd spit
in it sometimes they'd put a little water
[SPEAKER_01]: in it just to knead it together but I
never ever saw it personally anyway I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess my question is when when the kind of
ice water first came on the scene yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: what was kind of the end consistency
because now there's a variety of
[SPEAKER_01]: inconsistencies it should come out like
that and if they are not greedy and wash
[SPEAKER_01]: too long or shake too long because that's
when the chlorophyll starts coming into it
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say stop way before it starts
going green and it should look I like
[SPEAKER_01]: caviar and this in the temperature of LA
has melted somewhat so it's kind of all
[SPEAKER_01]: together but you can still see the
separate crystals and if it was still dry
[SPEAKER_01]: if it had been kept in the fridge the
whole time it would look like caviar you
[SPEAKER_01]: can see if you have a microscope or nearly
with your eye you can see it's just built
[SPEAKER_01]: up of little crystals where on the top you
know if it's pressed it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: smooth but here you see the crystals okay
and I think it's just melted in the heat
[SPEAKER_01]: okay that's why it's all together now
smells good though it's very nice so so
[SPEAKER_01]: who I voted for him and I didn't even know
and he was so nice because Ben who came to
[SPEAKER_01]: the show he was the one who had made it I
know yes but then they had yet to be here
[SPEAKER_01]: to something so he couldn't go to Miami so
I was so sad and he said it was his first
[SPEAKER_00]: prize ever so you kind of innovated on the
equipment side yeah and then a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people copied you a lot of people copied
me and some of them make you feel it used
[SPEAKER_01]: to make me very mad and then I remembered
I used to have a friend in the clothing
[SPEAKER_01]: business in New Delhi when I lived in
India and he always used to say to be
[SPEAKER_01]: copied is the best compliment you can get
so I kind of have to make do with that and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not worth it to wind myself up about
it because the only one who suffers from
[SPEAKER_01]: that is me right you know so that's just
plain stupid to sit there and wallow in
[SPEAKER_00]: your shit well so in terms of your
business focus now is what percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: your time are you focused on kind of
selling the equipment and then you're also
[SPEAKER_00]: running the dabidu stuff and how many
dabidus are there let's say let's say 2019
[SPEAKER_00]: how many are there Miami just happened
you're about to go to yeah this year
[SPEAKER_01]: though just be five because we didn't it's
difficult to find a location to do it in
[SPEAKER_01]: Holland now because in the Netherlands
extracts are illegal so even rosin they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't see that it's not really an extract
that is just so hash is illegal and no
[SPEAKER_01]: hash like this and made with water because
it's not so solvent lists extracts are
[SPEAKER_01]: okay solvent is not okay so the thing is
that no business at the moment wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: rent to us to do this because they're
scared of losing their license you know if
[SPEAKER_01]: they let us be there with all the solvents
and rosin and a few hundred people so we
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't found a place in Holland oh
because that dab sorry dabidu also has a
[SPEAKER_00]: solvent category right yeah okay yeah
there's three categories so even though
[SPEAKER_00]: you're I mean do you smoke salt like do
you smoke live resin also no I smoke the
[SPEAKER_01]: the I prefer this water hash to any other
thing but if somebody handed you some
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrocarbon I've I've taste you'll try it
I'll try definitely I'll try or not I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't like when it starts tasting of
chemicals you know that but nowadays that
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they do clean it better because
it's not so obvious so as you I mean it's
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of interesting because you and I
think like Nick and even like Ben and
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys you're all kind of travel the
world and so you get is my best student he
[SPEAKER_01]: came to me right in the beginning and we
sat for days that's what I really like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know and he went far beyond goes beyond
what I did so so what what has he done
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're like proud of your student
like what what things have you seen him do
[SPEAKER_01]: where you're like the way he said he's
taking up and he just only makes he
[SPEAKER_01]: refuses to do any second grade he only
wants to make top grade stuff and for sure
[SPEAKER_01]: he does it with a lot of care and more
care than most people at home will have so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's definitely a much better quality and
it's interesting because hash as a
[SPEAKER_00]: business if you want to adhere to those
high standards you kind of by default have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a small business because there's not
enough quality source material yeah to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the levels up all the time yeah yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: and so is this your preferred like you
like to smoke spliffs basically yes
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's how I started in 64 and
that's how everybody smokes in Europe so I
[SPEAKER_00]: lived in France for two years and
everybody smokes joints spliffs yeah no
[SPEAKER_00]: and coming from the US where you're
ripping tubes you know you're you're bongs
[SPEAKER_00]: and protopipes and baddies and joints
these dabbing rigs it would knock me over
[SPEAKER_00]: the head but then interestingly if I
offered them flour like here let's roll a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint they'd be like whoa that is way too
powerful for us I don't smoke it pure they
[SPEAKER_01]: also had some tobacco to their flower yeah
right yeah that's European way so and I
[SPEAKER_01]: started smoking like that 55 years ago and
still smoking and how many and but do you
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke tobacco by itself or you ever like I
just need it so it's always used to yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: but and so now you just smoke spliffs and
how many do you think you smoke a day well
[SPEAKER_01]: at the moment I'm on a program to lessen
the tobacco is that my doctor's order no
[SPEAKER_01]: no no no no my my own self-imposed yes no
according to my doctor I'm fine and
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy and he refuses to give me any kind
of piece of paper than for medical use but
[SPEAKER_01]: so every packet of tobacco I buy these
European packets I give myself point one
[SPEAKER_01]: gram less for that whole packet so at the
beginning of the year I was up to five six
[SPEAKER_01]: grams a day and now I'm down to 1.7 gram
of tobacco a day but the same amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: hash per day I'm not trying to cut the
hash right but yeah for sure it's less and
[SPEAKER_01]: out of that 1.7 how much hash do you go
through in a day probably at least a gram
[SPEAKER_01]: or so I never really looked at it that
much but from that 1.7 gram I can make
[SPEAKER_00]: eight little joints and are you still
making hash are you kind of all your
[SPEAKER_00]: students and former students are giving
you what they make and you just sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: in Amsterdam I have to go to the coffee
shop and buy it and I can't even afford
[SPEAKER_01]: the best quality they make you buy it and
I can't even afford to buy their best
[SPEAKER_01]: quality hash like this one man they are so
much money that's crazy sometimes they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: give me some and a lot of former people
who bought my equipment and live in
[SPEAKER_01]: Holland are forever wanting to show me how
wonderful their new product is coming
[SPEAKER_01]: along so I do get yeah most of it well
tell me this what I was getting up before
[SPEAKER_00]: with kind of a crew of you who who
traveled the world you're almost like a
[SPEAKER_00]: touring band that gets to experience
different scenes and cultures so like can
[SPEAKER_00]: you tell me about the scenes you're seeing
I mean you're you've I mean you're only in
[SPEAKER_00]: LA for like a day but like you know Miami
the Netherlands you know Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_00]: Barcelona you're about to go to where in
Bogota no no I could fly to Monteria and
[SPEAKER_01]: then my girlfriend she's waiting at the
airport and drive me straight to the boat
[SPEAKER_01]: because the Dabidu is on an island and
because of coming here I'm arriving two
[SPEAKER_01]: days later in Colombia so but this way at
least I'll be there no no actually I'll be
[SPEAKER_01]: there for the beginning of the Dabidu just
have you been to Colombia oh yes several
[SPEAKER_00]: times so tell me about the scene that
you're seeing whether it's the cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: scene the hash scene the social scene in
these different or cities yeah I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: like cities much if there is any spare
time I prefer to go out in the woods or
[SPEAKER_01]: the wild or something and see something of
the countryside but I think everywhere now
[SPEAKER_01]: this whole idea of making ash is just
growing quite explosively yeah the other
[SPEAKER_01]: day somebody gave me my best compliment
ever I guess Mila started making ash and
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole world followed but I think with
this machine it did start also not only
[SPEAKER_01]: copied me but got people got other
inventions on the road and you know the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole all the equipment for the extracts
all that came along the dab rigs and the
[SPEAKER_01]: dab rigs some fantastic dab rigs but I'm
not really a dabber for me it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: smoking two old joints in one puff right
and then also although now I've learned
[SPEAKER_01]: how to get around that the way that people
cough after taking a dab sometime my 74
[SPEAKER_01]: year old lungs can't deal with that maybe
once but not too often the way some people
[SPEAKER_01]: go and then say that was a good one yeah
they embrace the cough like the more
[SPEAKER_01]: painful the cough the better it is for you
exactly well I don't want those painful
[SPEAKER_00]: coughs anymore so so all right but talk
about like I'm dying to go down to
[SPEAKER_01]: Colombia so talk about the scene down
there they'll be waiting for me so the
[SPEAKER_01]: thing is wherever I travel I've already
got like sometimes there's a whole group
[SPEAKER_01]: of people waiting at the airport tomorrow
I know because it's all last-minute
[SPEAKER_01]: arranged they'll be my girlfriend but I've
never had to arrive in the place and look
[SPEAKER_00]: for a hotel let me put it like that so but
but who are some of the people like Nick
[SPEAKER_00]: lives in NorCal he's a friend of yours
who's down in South America that you love
[SPEAKER_00]: that that you respect as a hash maker as a
cultivator as a friend there is definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: quite a bunch of them there I mean all
these people people who have put in time
[SPEAKER_01]: and energy to put together a dab a do I
love them you know without them it
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't be happening and I know how much
work it is to put on the thing like that
[SPEAKER_01]: together then I know Al Gatto from
Colombia already since 89 when he phoned
[SPEAKER_01]: me from Medellin and said I'm phoning you
from Medellin and I want to order the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest pollinator dry surf machine you
got I said okay I need a credit card and a
[SPEAKER_01]: address and sure enough five minutes later
he calls back credit card and this guy has
[SPEAKER_01]: grown so much weed in South America by the
way it took him five months to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: credit card the five minutes oh five
minutes later
[SPEAKER_01]: and then first he was growing in Colombia
and he showed me this beautiful footage of
[SPEAKER_01]: how he's riding to his mountainside they
grow mountain sides on there and his horse
[SPEAKER_01]: just lovely and then he moved to Mexico
Brazil and I think he but wherever he
[SPEAKER_01]: moved to and started growing he needed my
machines he was making hash quite a big
[SPEAKER_01]: way and he's a close friend he where's he
live now he lives in Colombia so he's back
[SPEAKER_01]: in Colombia yeah he was in Barcelona for a
while but he's Colombian I think he feels
[SPEAKER_01]: at home in Colombia and I'll be staying
with him after that I would do for a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've got a girlfriend there and her
kids are the same age as my granddaughter
[SPEAKER_01]: so she it works or she has a marijuana
farm now supposedly working for the
[SPEAKER_01]: government I haven't seen her so for a
year so we'll see but I'll stay there and
[SPEAKER_00]: who are kind of some of the old-school
people from the Amsterdam scene that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're still in touch with like like Ben
Ben drunkers from sensei are young all
[SPEAKER_01]: those guys from these seed companies
because we'll he still lives in Amsterdam
[SPEAKER_01]: right I mean we were all kind of more or
less there from the beginning so every
[SPEAKER_01]: high times cop we'd run into each other
every spanner base we'd run into each
[SPEAKER_01]: other some of these guys I saw more away
from Amsterdam but we all known each other
[SPEAKER_01]: for like 20 years 25 years now so most of
them are still going strong some of them
[SPEAKER_01]: have dropped along the way some of them
are living on tropical islands now can't
[SPEAKER_00]: be bothered don't need to so talk about
kind of the corporatization of it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: just of cannabis but like for example the
high times event last night when you first
[SPEAKER_00]: were on the high time scene it was
probably a lot different people than
[SPEAKER_00]: you're seeing there today we're like now
it's kind of like finance guys who own it
[SPEAKER_01]: and run it and are basically co-opting
kind of but I was at grow expo in Holland
[SPEAKER_01]: a few months ago and everybody's also
walking around in suits with ties on and
[SPEAKER_01]: no hemispheres changed no atmosphere you
talk to CEOs instead of someone who's
[SPEAKER_01]: enthusiastic about his nutrients before
you go up to a booth and he'd say oh man
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to try my stuff you get the best
puns ever now you're having to deal with a
[SPEAKER_01]: CEO it's just different and maybe for me
personally I preferred it the old way but
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah I mean that's the world times change
and I watch TV here the last couple of
[SPEAKER_00]: evenings and it's just boggling what's all
going on so besides Nick who are kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: some hash makers that yeah this guy though
he makes also great cash but so does Ben
[SPEAKER_01]: you know and actually in Miami it was
quite a bit quite difficult in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: because none of them were really bad you
know and so you're trying to pick from all
[SPEAKER_00]: good entries well one was better than the
other but but when you're judging I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: like to judge I'm such a bad judge how are
you consuming it are you are you putting
[SPEAKER_01]: in a split of each type and put a number
on it and then smoke a bit of each one and
[SPEAKER_01]: then decide which one I like best but like
how many entrants were there for this they
[SPEAKER_01]: were only five okay so you're not smoking
like 30 splits sometimes but usually
[SPEAKER_01]: actually I don't fart I just like to be
the hostess and talk to people and hang
[SPEAKER_00]: out with them but they got me on so each
judge gets to smoke it and however they
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer to smoke it so if I'm a split
smoker if I'm a dabber if I'm on whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: most of them dab it most of them dab it or
yeah so but like I said I'm such a bad
[SPEAKER_01]: judge I don't really like to be a judge I
went through those five and decided which
[SPEAKER_01]: one was worse than which one was best went
through them again and completely changed
[SPEAKER_01]: my mind you know and then after the third
time I had to come to some decision and
[SPEAKER_01]: the first one was quite obvious but it was
especially about the two that came after
[SPEAKER_00]: that so getting back to like the
traditional hash producing countries
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think a lot of what people talk
about is kind of the Dutch seeds basically
[SPEAKER_00]: like Genghis Khan impregnating all the
females and mixing and creating hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: bastards in all those countries so like
what were some of the experiences that
[SPEAKER_00]: really stand out for you in terms of like
I was in the mountains of this region and
[SPEAKER_00]: we smoke some hash and it was just the
most amazing thing I've ever had and and I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't find it since then like is there
something that you can't find today that
[SPEAKER_01]: well I must say about that I really kind
of feel bad that all these people are
[SPEAKER_01]: taking their homey seeds to Afghanistan to
everywhere and I'm sure in the end the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole world will just be like one standard
if it goes on like this because like in
[SPEAKER_01]: Manali Valley it's a valley so if somebody
planted 20 cookie plants or a white widow
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever it's going to affect all the
plants in the whole valley in the end
[SPEAKER_01]: might take a couple generations but it
will so I find that very sad but I did
[SPEAKER_01]: have one of my best experiences there in
the same Manali Valley in the 60s late 60s
[SPEAKER_01]: when I got there we used to hang out with
many of the sadhus the holy men with their
[SPEAKER_01]: hair on top that smoke chillings all day
long in respect for Shiva and they took us
[SPEAKER_01]: up into the mountains to rub but they all
rub up there so they're making charas yes
[SPEAKER_01]: and I didn't like in the valley you had
all these big green plants like meters
[SPEAKER_01]: high they weren't into that and they took
us up and we found two of these like a
[SPEAKER_01]: little dell in the mountainside that was
like a little hollow and it had been
[SPEAKER_01]: filled with snow the whole winter and
underneath the marijuana plants had
[SPEAKER_01]: survived now they weren't shooting up
meters high they were like bonsai so
[SPEAKER_00]: crinkly and woody and knobbly this is
during harvest season like in October
[SPEAKER_01]: November or this is like February no no
this was in October okay and the buds
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't very big either they were like
this size and each plant would have quite
[SPEAKER_01]: a number of buds anyway we rubbed the hash
there and then with the sadhus they made
[SPEAKER_01]: the chillum immediately so I realize also
that's probably some of the few times that
[SPEAKER_01]: I've smoked hash so freshly that THCA is
still very much there anyway we smoked a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of chillums up there and walking
down that mountain it was like an acid
[SPEAKER_01]: trip the way the brook was bubbling next
to us it was and the way the colors were
[SPEAKER_01]: it was just amazing yeah that was the but
and the other thing I always say the joint
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm smoking right now is the best because
all the rest is in the past or in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future so have you gone back to some of
those regions and visited old friends in
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah you know cashmere and no in Manali
like I used to go trekking a lot with my
[SPEAKER_01]: kids because they all went to school there
so in the summer we'd go trekking and this
[SPEAKER_01]: is like in the 70s or yeah in the 70s 80s
and a lot of times we went with this one
[SPEAKER_01]: guy who owned five or six horses and put
all the food and the tents on there and
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd walk and he's in my book and so I
sent him a book and it actually made it so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's so nice he can't read English but
he can look at the pictures and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: picture of him in there yeah well I guess
the question I'm asked or I'm going to ask
[SPEAKER_00]: is what do you think's the future for
those people right like these are because
[SPEAKER_00]: now you have all these like I mean here in
LA yeah you have all these young kids
[SPEAKER_00]: making hash and it's a global market like
is there any and the other question are
[SPEAKER_00]: those people doing some of the are they
still dry sifting or are they all making
[SPEAKER_01]: ice water hash now too no I went because
my sister decided to make a documentary
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was about me so we went back to
some of these old places and actually met
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the same people but they're still
doing exactly the same that they were like
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 years earlier so they're still dry
sifting yeah yeah they're still rubbing
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah or right in there they're rubbing but
the thing is what I realized when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: there 30 35 years ago nothing had changed
in 500 years there was more change in
[SPEAKER_01]: those 35 years than there had been in the
preceding 500 you know when I we went
[SPEAKER_01]: there there was just walking paths from
one village to the next now there's roads
[SPEAKER_01]: buses electricity more schools more
hospitals but all the young kids there
[SPEAKER_01]: want to get into the tourist trade and
drive around in a Jeep forget about that I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to be in a Jeep and anyway it's very
sad because a lot of the tradition will
[SPEAKER_00]: get lost this way do you still smoke dry
sift yes and how would you like when do
[SPEAKER_00]: you like dry sift like do you just
appreciate both and they're both great
[SPEAKER_01]: like ice water versus dry sift or tell you
for me what the difference is maybe French
[SPEAKER_01]: you're negative or time have different
opinions but for me when you make if
[SPEAKER_01]: people like the aroma and with a smell and
the taste is most important to them when
[SPEAKER_01]: they smoke they should take dry sift
because I believe probably a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes are on the outside of the tricone
and so all the water soluble ones will get
[SPEAKER_01]: washed off in the water the sad part of it
is in the dry sift that very quickly the
[SPEAKER_01]: little sticks will start coming through
the screen also and you can do a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: work and remove them but if I smoke it
like that it kind of tastes fuzzy now with
[SPEAKER_01]: water hash there's not as much many
terpenes there's no sticks it tastes less
[SPEAKER_01]: it smells less but it's stronger so I
prefer that so but but they each have
[SPEAKER_00]: trade-offs right like there's there's no
holy grail one has more flavor and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes the other is pure and just has
more strength it is a bit like that
[SPEAKER_01]: probably if you mix the two you'd get the
perfect thing but I just like it like this
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's stronger than the dry sift
although I must say in Miami Cuban Cuban
[SPEAKER_01]: grower growers wife send me some dry sift
that she had made and that was very good
[SPEAKER_01]: but it was so good there was definitely no
little sticks in it and in the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: it melted just like this and got just like
this now do you if people are gifting you
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff everywhere are you traveling with it
okay so you know it is I never do so
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever whatever you whatever you don't
you'll give to these two lucky or three
[SPEAKER_00]: lucky guys over there well I have no idea
what what to do with it no no they
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't get it I'll leave it with Duggee
or something and at the moment I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know if I've got to last me through to the
time I leave a dubby I only have like two
[SPEAKER_01]: three spliffs left otherwise if I had more
I would give you some I'm sure Doug has
[SPEAKER_01]: plenty at his house yeah but I need to
roll a spliff before I get on the thing to
[SPEAKER_01]: this cab to go to the airport and I don't
like to bug him the whole time I want
[SPEAKER_01]: another smoke you already gave me I'm sure
you would be I'm sure Doug would be
[SPEAKER_00]: honored to share some of this okay I'll
give you his you've already got some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that oh you're gonna get oh thank you yeah
because you're right if I do need another
[SPEAKER_01]: junk when I'm up there I don't have it
this is Cuban growers wife no no that I
[SPEAKER_01]: already finished in Miami oh here it is
and this is who this is from Doug oh Doug
[SPEAKER_01]: made this yeah well I don't know if he
made it he was the one that gave it to me
[SPEAKER_01]: okay so at the moment I've got some of
this and some of that so now you have it
[SPEAKER_01]: that's good well thank you I have some of
this left and if it ain't enough you're
[SPEAKER_00]: right Doug will happily well you can call
