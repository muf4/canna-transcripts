[SPEAKER_00]: all right next round of autos heading over
to Tom's house the Humboldt seed company
[SPEAKER_00]: magic melon auto femme boom so I just
actually these things popped quickly but
[SPEAKER_00]: let's just make life easy what's up what's
up taproots
[SPEAKER_00]: okay you guys are all done done done
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean these all
[SPEAKER_00]: these pretty much all popped I don't see
any ones that didn't pop is a good
[SPEAKER_00]: germination rate 100% it's a good number I
think there were 12 seeds so I need to
[SPEAKER_00]: make some more solo cups so it's a 10 pack
there are actually 11 seeds in there and
[SPEAKER_00]: every single one popped
[SPEAKER_00]: just to feed Tom's voracious weed appetite
I'll give some to other people a little
[SPEAKER_00]: magic melon auto all right that might be
the last one and that's it little silk
[SPEAKER_00]: we're pretty much done for the day with
you
[SPEAKER_00]: so I put all 11 seeds and solo cups each
cup is just in a super mix which pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much has no nutrients and I was going to
inoculate it with some mycorrhizae but
[SPEAKER_00]: what I realized is that in the non-active
side of my compost tumbler is the side
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm not adding new food scraps to I
don't know if you can see yeah right there
[SPEAKER_00]: we got some mushrooms growing so I'm just
gonna harvest some of this stuff and put
[SPEAKER_00]: it in each solo cup
[SPEAKER_00]: so I'm just gonna take this and break it
apart and put a little bit in every cup
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of hard with one hand but anyway you
get the gist and then I'll put some water
[SPEAKER_00]: around them but I mean there's some
mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_00]: there you got some bugs breaking down the
compost
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'll do a better job once I can use
two hands but there's my fungal activity
[SPEAKER_00]: in a mix that doesn't get started anyway
stuff just smells like rich earth it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: very satisfying smell
[SPEAKER_00]: all right so I'm just finishing kind of
crumbling up the mycorrhizae
[SPEAKER_00]: let you
[SPEAKER_00]: hang out in the shade so actually I'm just
gonna put the rest in with my winter
[SPEAKER_00]: squash that I just popped
[SPEAKER_00]: like three quarters of the way it comes
composted material chicken bone put that
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the composter or actually we'll
just put you we'll see you when we see you
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway so this is now has some fungal
activity keep it moist moist moist baby
[SPEAKER_00]: you you you you you
