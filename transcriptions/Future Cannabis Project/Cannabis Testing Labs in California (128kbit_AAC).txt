[SPEAKER_06]: We have some of the most amazing minds
right now in the world of testing,
[SPEAKER_06]: and I just wanted to introduce everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have Addison Demora.
[SPEAKER_06]: Addison is the co-founder of Steep Hill
Laboratories.
[SPEAKER_06]: He co-founded in 2008 and for seven years
served as this Chief Business Development
[SPEAKER_06]: Officer until leaving the company in 2015.
[SPEAKER_06]: During his time at Steep Hill,
Mr. Demora focused on overseeing
[SPEAKER_06]: marketing, sales, and bridging the
company, branding for the company.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a brand ambassador and a face of the
company, Addison cultivated many
[SPEAKER_06]: relationships and strategic partnerships
throughout his time at Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: Through developing strong relationships
with growers, breeders, processors,
[SPEAKER_06]: edible producers, and brokers,
Demora's efforts helped make Steep Hill
[SPEAKER_06]: the world leader in cannabis science and
testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Addison worked closely on Steep Hill's
expansion into multiple states,
[SPEAKER_06]: with the company now holding laboratory
space in over eight states combined.
[SPEAKER_06]: While Demora no longer oversees the
day-to-day at Steep Hill, he still holds
[SPEAKER_06]: the claim to being the company and works
with Steep Hill in many projects to date.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have Swetha Kahl.
[SPEAKER_06]: Am I saying your last name right,
Kahl?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_06]: Swetha currently serves as the Chief
Scientific Officer at Canalysys,
[SPEAKER_06]: a state licensed ISO IEC 17-025 accredited
cannabis testing laboratory that seeks to
[SPEAKER_06]: empower customers through technology and
integrations, big data analytics,
[SPEAKER_06]: and access to information.
[SPEAKER_06]: Prior to joining Canalysys, Swetha worked
at Allegren where she was responsible for
[SPEAKER_06]: drug development efforts, including
analytical method development.
[SPEAKER_06]: Formulation research, stability studies,
new process development, and optimization
[SPEAKER_06]: of processes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Swetha brings more than a decade of
technical leadership and experience from
[SPEAKER_06]: academia and the pharmaceutical industry
and emerging field of cannabis testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Her experience working in highly regulated
pharmaceutical industry provides valuable
[SPEAKER_06]: insight to the rigorous testing of
regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have Mr. Antonio Fraser.
[SPEAKER_06]: Antonio Fraser is the Director of
Operations at Canalysys, the first ISO
[SPEAKER_06]: licensed cannabis lab in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whoa.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the leading market shareholder for
California.
[SPEAKER_06]: He met Canalysys President Aaron Riley
while playing football together at Furman
[SPEAKER_06]: University.
[SPEAKER_06]: While he earned his bachelor's of science
degree, he also holds a BS in materials
[SPEAKER_06]: engineering from Clemson.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fraser began his career in nuclear quality
engineering for the Tennessee Valley
[SPEAKER_06]: Authority, certifying and verifying final
construction of nuclear components.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow, that is a really impressive,
impressive resume, Antonio.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just really like to say thank
everyone for coming out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we had a few questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: That got brought up, but I wanted to open
it up to you guys first because this was a
[SPEAKER_06]: round table.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we did want to offer insight.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys had any specific questions you
wanted to ask, we can go ahead and get
[SPEAKER_06]: into that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or we have three questions that were
brought together through the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we any questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: No questions to start.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So our first question that we have is what
do you feel will be the biggest challenges
[SPEAKER_06]: that cultivators and manufacturers will
encounter under the new testing
[SPEAKER_06]: requirements?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I really want to open it up to anybody
who feels passionate about talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: that or if there's something that you
really think that stands out to you as far
[SPEAKER_06]: as where the struggles and where the pains
are going to lie in this transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mind going.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I think what was interesting is a
few years ago when we were moving towards
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, everyone was up in arms about
what testing labs are going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottleneck and all of this talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now it actually is licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Licensing is the largest bottleneck we
have right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the biggest challenge right
now is people are investing in build-out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And payroll.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're just waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're waiting for their licenses in
different stages of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to be the largest
challenge I think in not even the next six
[SPEAKER_01]: months, probably in the next couple of
years, is people just waiting for that
[SPEAKER_01]: whole process to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the struggle is going to be
really magnified for smaller businesses,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is unfortunate because this industry
started off with a lot of passionate
[SPEAKER_01]: people with small mom pop businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unless you have some good financial
backing, it's going to be hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: subsurvive the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to survive waiting that whole process
of your licensing and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apart from that, I think the largest
challenge that we've all had, and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: testing labs, it magnified, is we had
different regulations that dropped on us
[SPEAKER_01]: every six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm hearing that there's rumors
that there might be another package that
[SPEAKER_01]: might drop our way about regulations in
the next few months again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yayas.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: The regulations, as far as licensing is
concerned, I can only imagine what it's
[SPEAKER_06]: like in your world.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've worked in regulations on every other
thing but testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can only imagine what you guys have
to go through to be able to get the
[SPEAKER_06]: certifications that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just say making the industry a
little more reasonable, coming from other
[SPEAKER_00]: industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just the challenge is just there's
so much waste, so much extra cost,
[SPEAKER_00]: no improv certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no standardization, whether it be
of standards themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So labs are doing different things and
saying the instruments off of different
[SPEAKER_00]: standards and just making it chaos for,
especially like she said, producers and
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers who don't have a lot of
money to lab shop and to test all day,
[SPEAKER_00]: every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: There could be a lot smarter processes
involved that are mimicked all across the
[SPEAKER_00]: other industry, whether it be CCV fail
rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, 100% pass or CCV makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just extra cost and it's really
difficult to operate that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, just making it more sensible.
[SPEAKER_06]: 100% fail rate?
[SPEAKER_06]: Please explain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your quality parameters, 100% of your
analytes have to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for all the pesticides that,
I'm sorry, have to pass, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for all the pesticides that we test
for, every run, if any analyte fails or
[SPEAKER_00]: falls outside of the plus or minus 30%
range, you cannot release that batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although that analyte may have not hit,
it may have not been an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And other industries, they account for
that by saying if you don't see that
[SPEAKER_00]: analyte, it doesn't have to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't see it, if you know that
there's nothing present, if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: non-detect, there's no reason for that
quality analyte to have to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would make us, oh, a lot less
reruns and repreps and things like that
[SPEAKER_00]: that add extra cost to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think what he's referring to is
that for every batch that we have to
[SPEAKER_01]: analyze, there's 20 samples in a batch,
you have to do at least four QCs,
[SPEAKER_01]: which are internal quality control
samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of those run probably five or six of
those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And out of those, everything has to fall
within a certain specification,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if anything comes out of it,
you have to rerun that entire batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way it works in other industries,
I come from the pharmaceutical industry
[SPEAKER_01]: and also an FDA and EPA, is that you can
run control charts, which means that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can track what are typical recoveries for
these guys, even if there are outside
[SPEAKER_01]: those parameters, as long as they're
predictable and you have data on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, we're not dealing with a
lot of scientists at the BCC, so we end up
[SPEAKER_01]: having to have these strict, they're
essentially regulators that tell us,
[SPEAKER_01]: nope, the regulation says 70 to 130 has to
be there, there's no leeway, there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding, there's no scientific
discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can talk about the 800 pound gorilla
that's sitting in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is maybe six or seven examples of
what the real problem is, and it's the
[SPEAKER_03]: BCC.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't know shit about cannabis
testing, they have an ego, they don't want
[SPEAKER_03]: to go and, in every state it's the same
way, they all have an ego because they
[SPEAKER_03]: used to be the guy that worked in the
health department and now he got this new
[SPEAKER_03]: gig doing cannabis and he wants to,
I read high times and I fucking know what
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the problem is that these guys are
there and they're in charge and they have
[SPEAKER_03]: this ego and they don't want to look at
other states that have failed and figured
[SPEAKER_03]: out these problems, and at the same time,
I promise you right now, they're not gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: come rescue you, they're gonna wait for
attrition to occur and let the labs all go
[SPEAKER_03]: out of business and screw each other and
fall apart, because they get to sit there
[SPEAKER_03]: with their hands up with no liability,
they have no infrastructure, they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know what the fuck they're doing,
and it's ultimately making everybody from
[SPEAKER_03]: the laboratories to the, like the process
that he spoke about.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a producer, I mean I'm lucky
enough to have been in the lab end and
[SPEAKER_03]: then said fuck this, this is cool,
you guys do this, awesome, like oh the
[SPEAKER_03]: plugs are covered, the babies won't
electrocute themselves, all right,
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome, and jump back into the other end
of it, which is the fun part, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: making products and growing cannabis and
doing that shit, so now I get to see this
[SPEAKER_03]: end of it and you're literally just,
you're a victim if you're the lab owner,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're a victim if you're the whatever,
licensed owner, because the BCC doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: know what the fuck they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not gonna pull their head out
of their ass anytime soon, so it's up to
[SPEAKER_03]: the, what I would suggest everyone to do
is scale down, just fucking do it like you
[SPEAKER_03]: did when you trapped, scale down,
build up, put money back in, do it as safe
[SPEAKER_03]: as you possibly can for the period of
time, because like she said, either big
[SPEAKER_03]: investors don't wanna come in,
if they do they wanna take everything,
[SPEAKER_03]: or leverage it so that when you fail they
take it, so the real trick is keep doing
[SPEAKER_03]: what you do, keep going to bed early,
getting up early, or going to bed late,
[SPEAKER_03]: getting up early, grinding, grinding,
grinding, and building the business,
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's what it's gonna take,
and that's what you have to do to get
[SPEAKER_03]: through, because you're not getting any,
you're not getting air help, air survival
[SPEAKER_03]: help from the planes above, because
there's no fucking planes above,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not gonna back you up,
they wanna see you die, so they could
[SPEAKER_03]: literally like Fortnite, jump up and take
all your shit and bounce out, like they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't care, and they're gonna let us rip
each other apart, they love it,
[SPEAKER_03]: they literally love it, and the difference
between NorCal and SoCal, that is the
[SPEAKER_03]: most, because I was in NorCal for a long
time, so I know a lot of the owners and
[SPEAKER_03]: the business guys up there came down to
SoCal and got into it down here,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's insane the difference, like what you
get away with as a producer in NorCal to
[SPEAKER_03]: SoCal, and I don't understand why they're
not on the same page, but then I do,
[SPEAKER_03]: because their heads up their ass and
they're not gonna be on the same page,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's ridiculous, it is, but it's the
BCC, they're fuckers, they're not gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: get their head out of their ass,
go ahead, and one more thing though,
[SPEAKER_03]: this panel, I hope it doesn't turn into,
no offense, like a science fucking panel,
[SPEAKER_03]: where you're just, we're sitting here
understanding analytics and other stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then everyone out there is like,
okay, so anyway, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough, fair enough, I'm not going
that route, I promise, but to his point,
[SPEAKER_00]: I love his perspective, because he's been
in the lab as well as a producer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think that's the key, is that
honestly, you have to talk to your lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to educate it, I mean,
we're seeing a lot of good brands starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to educate, make good media and marketing
material to explain some of this stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I encourage you, because when the BCC
opens up for comment, they take them
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty seriously, I mean, I was kind of
flabbergasted by just some of the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that made it, and when they explain why,
it's because some guys submitted it from
[SPEAKER_00]: his, I mean, I don't know who this guy
was, but like literally somebody submitted
[SPEAKER_00]: some insane rules, and they just took it,
believed it, and ran with it, because no
[SPEAKER_00]: one else said don't do it, so really,
you're gonna have to speak up,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna have to become educated,
educate about what's going on,
[SPEAKER_00]: speak to your lab, ask them what their
problems are, because I promise you,
[SPEAKER_00]: we will talk to you, and we will ask for
your help, and we will try to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: you to accomplish and tread these weird
and ever-shifting waters that is
[SPEAKER_00]: California cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, and I mean, it's not just the BCC,
I think it's all the regulators,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, the regulator's perspective on the
cannabis industry is still- Don't get me
[SPEAKER_01]: started on the labeling, those dudes,
they're- Yeah, but I'm just saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: the regulator's perspective on the
industry is that it is, they still come up
[SPEAKER_01]: from it, that it's a criminal sort of
point of view, and it's a very hostile
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of relationship, and the only way
you're gonna survive is by looking out for
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself, and so the way I say it is you
have to trust each other and you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: trust the labs, too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry tends to have this sort of
adversarial relationship with labs,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we really just sort of break that
barrier and encourage more transparency,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most of the labs now are willing
to share information, willing to share
[SPEAKER_01]: data, use them as a tool, there's a lot of
scientists that are at the disposal that
[SPEAKER_01]: can show you a few things, and we also
would like to learn more about the other
[SPEAKER_01]: side of it and about production,
and when you come together and do that
[SPEAKER_01]: collaborative kind of thing is when you
get really good products that are
[SPEAKER_01]: high-quality and are safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think from the customer side,
having been from the lab side and then
[SPEAKER_03]: coming over, what the customer really
wants is labs to be honest about the fact
[SPEAKER_03]: that they're imperfect and they make
mistakes, and then the customer needs to
[SPEAKER_03]: understand that until everything is
completely machine-automated, you have
[SPEAKER_03]: human error, and you're never gonna get
around it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my approach to it, running Lacturnus
and having the licenses and building this
[SPEAKER_03]: facility now, when I was there,
I just worked with, found four of the best
[SPEAKER_03]: labs because one of them's gonna be really
good at handling volume, another one's
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna be really good at picking up shit
when it has to go really quick,
[SPEAKER_03]: another one's gonna be great, and you just
juggle them, and then you're testing them,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're homogenizing test samples and
testing their business, but having,
[SPEAKER_03]: like he said, having interaction with
them, but I think from the lab end,
[SPEAKER_03]: what lab owners need to do more is admit
openly, 100%, that it's not gonna be
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect, things are gonna get messed up,
and then discount and credit people back,
[SPEAKER_03]: because even me working with Steep Hill,
and I'm not at Steep Hill now,
[SPEAKER_03]: I have trouble getting them to credit
back, and I'm like, what the fuck are you
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in that completely, and I do
agree about the honesty, but I know,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I've done this, and I've done this
repeatedly, is the other side has to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand as well, because people just
walk away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like, hey, there was this error,
this error might have been internal,
[SPEAKER_01]: it might have been external, but this is
the explanation for it, and people usually
[SPEAKER_01]: are like, well, then I'm just leaving.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the truth is, if you wanna build a
business model, you have to build in an
[SPEAKER_01]: error rate, you have to build a fail rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we actually do actually credit back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We guarantee all our tests, so we do
guarantee.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like what this is similar to where
we are right now with software,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the cannabis world of software,
we're at a place where it's like,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're really trying, POS systems,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're really trying to have a great POS
system, but we're all learning in the
[SPEAKER_06]: process.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it seems like we've got all the
infrastructure, and it works really great
[SPEAKER_06]: with my QuickBooks, but there's this one
function that's not as great, because when
[SPEAKER_06]: we built this software, we had this one
focus, or we had the other focus.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I really think that the testing world,
like Addison was saying, we have the
[SPEAKER_06]: strengths, and we're all kind of growing
together as we develop this industry,
[SPEAKER_06]: and kind of figure out what the standards
really are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right, because standards are kind of a
relative term in the world that we're
[SPEAKER_06]: actually dealing with, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: The standards that we're comparing and
contrasting against.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think, I mean, this is kind of a
segue to my next question.
[SPEAKER_06]: With the standards and all of that,
what do you think needs to be addressed in
[SPEAKER_06]: the regulations as they stand right now?
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously, not that their heads are up
their asses, but if we could have a point
[SPEAKER_06]: as to what, if you were like, hey,
I think, my, for instance, is I don't
[SPEAKER_06]: quite understand what the world of the
difference between a sublingual pill or a
[SPEAKER_06]: pill you swallow being one is a
concentrate and one is an edible,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So as a testing person, please explain to
me how, if I put it on my tongue and it
[SPEAKER_06]: dissolves, that it is considered an
edible, but if I swallow a whole pill,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's considered a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you treat that?
[SPEAKER_06]: If I came to you as a question,
like, how would you tell me?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I don't have a good answer for that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you be honest?
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe the person that made the rules head
is up their ass.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, actually, that specific rule was
actually put in to help people who have
[SPEAKER_01]: made ethanol-based tinctures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had to have a separate section so
that people who had ethanol in there
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't held to the ethanol standards in
solvents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they had to make the special
category for tinctures to allow people who
[SPEAKER_01]: made ethanol-based tinctures allowed to
sell it on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the reason for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But mine, and I'm gonna get a little
technical just for two seconds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but my worst one is still that we have to
fail category one pesticides based on
[SPEAKER_01]: limit of detection.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had to change, like I would do a
magic one and change that, that would be
[SPEAKER_01]: the one regulation I would love to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would you change it to?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would change it to an actual action
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason right now that we have to
deal with this issue is that we might have
[SPEAKER_01]: the most competent labs here, and
hopefully we do, right here, and each of
[SPEAKER_01]: our limits of detection of each of these
labs would be totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so now you're actually increasing lab
shopping, because someone's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, if I fail, at .03, and this person's
LOD is this, and this is this,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna go with this lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're almost rewarding people who
have less sensitive instrumentation,
[SPEAKER_01]: less sensitive methods, and so the people
who invested into it and tried to get it
[SPEAKER_01]: as right as possible end up getting
screwed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've heard this a lot about our lab
where they're like, you know, I would love
[SPEAKER_01]: to use you for R&D, but just for
compliance, I'm not gonna take the risk,
[SPEAKER_01]: because your LODs are too low.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you need is an actual action
level, which makes a level playing field
[SPEAKER_01]: for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be my one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree with that, love that,
and I wouldn't even want to change the
[SPEAKER_00]: rule, I just want more transparency.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would love the BCC to report on who's
actually sending reports to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're having new labs,
lab shopping, and we found out through
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation that a lot of these COAs that
are being submitted with product aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually being submitted to the BCC,
so therefore some labs aren't under as
[SPEAKER_00]: much scrutiny as the labs that are
compliant, sending their reports up and
[SPEAKER_00]: being vetted every single night as they
submit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just different things like that
that I know we talked about prior,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it will fix itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Metric should handle that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metric should hold more accountability,
but that's a hard thing to really sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, even from a lab, it's like,
oh, we're gonna regulate harder,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's a hard thing to really talk
to your clients about and really get them
[SPEAKER_00]: excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're gonna make you test more,
we're gonna take more of your money.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps the consumer safety and it helps
the industry, but there's nothing that as
[SPEAKER_00]: a lab you can really go out there and hold
your head on, because it's not really
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be a friendly sell to everyone
that's got to spend more money when Metric
[SPEAKER_00]: comes online.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's coming and it will help,
but right now, if you just simply just let
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone know who's reporting COAs,
who's actually doing it right,
[SPEAKER_00]: which labs are participating in the
ecosystem, I think that'll change a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things, because labs will be able to use
that to say, well, yeah, you left me
[SPEAKER_00]: because we had a problem, but the lab you
went to isn't reporting COAs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really compliant, they're
halfway compliant, and when something
[SPEAKER_00]: happens, it's gonna come back to you,
because you chose to go to this less
[SPEAKER_00]: equipped laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the same vein, I feel like the BCC
should have a public list of they are,
[SPEAKER_01]: we hear through rumors and other clients
that there's certain labs that are not
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to do regulatory compliance,
or the BCC says, yes, so and so,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're pulling so and so's license.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be nice to have a little more
public database about this, so that
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone knows which labs are okay and
which don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the same, on the same vein,
I wish they would publicize some of their
[SPEAKER_01]: audits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us have been audited extensively,
and for months at a time, and they'll keep
[SPEAKER_01]: going back and forth, and it's almost
worse than if you can survive an ISO
[SPEAKER_01]: audit, so I almost wish they would
actually, we get a little bit of like,
[SPEAKER_01]: we survived this, or like the BCC says,
audited us, and then that way people know
[SPEAKER_01]: when they're differentiating which labs
have been audited and which haven't been
[SPEAKER_01]: audited.
[SPEAKER_06]: Addie, do you want anything that you would
change?
[SPEAKER_06]: Besides heads up assholes, minus heads up
assholes.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's like, whole thing, burn the whole
thing and change the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I wouldn't say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there are things, there's a lot of
stuff that they are doing well,
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's a lot of stuff that I think
people that own companies, the problem in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis that I have mostly is that
everyone says they're working hard and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're fucking not.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my biggest issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a little unfair.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone?
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a bunch of immigrants that are
trying to get into the United States that
[SPEAKER_03]: work very fucking hard, and I see people
that do what they say they're gonna do and
[SPEAKER_03]: bust their ass, and then I see a bunch of
people who make money and start to get
[SPEAKER_03]: real fucking comfy and start chewing on
the car and running their mouths and not
[SPEAKER_03]: diversifying their business and trusting
other people and bringing them in and
[SPEAKER_03]: actually running a business correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see a lot of people in cannabis that
spend more time on Instagram than they do
[SPEAKER_03]: running their fucking business and
listening to their employees.
[SPEAKER_03]: My point is there's a ton of fucking
people that have these companies that want
[SPEAKER_03]: to bitch and complain and blame the BOE
and blame the labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blame your fucking self.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your shit to work, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it like you did before you got this
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do it like you did when the cops were in
the Riviera Mirror and whatever else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grind, motherfucker, because if you don't,
you're not gonna have anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one's gonna save you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope the point is getting through,
that the BCC's not gonna save you,
[SPEAKER_03]: that your competitor's not gonna save you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get to fucking work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see hash makers, nicotine right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see hash makers that make good hash that
have better work ethic than the CEOs of
[SPEAKER_03]: other fucking companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: The wannabe Grant Gardones that are
fucking, I'm on that fucking jet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck your jet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your jet cost your company a bunch of
money that you're blowing, that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: lying about.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love this one now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, we pay to have a big display in your
store and then we sell you shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the shit doesn't sell and we tell our
investors that that's our marketing money.
[SPEAKER_03]: What the fuck are you doing, dude?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not working hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's bullshit.
Work hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's a good segue to what Sveta
said earlier, which was the lack of
[SPEAKER_06]: preparation for the long haul.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see this time and time again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do due diligence for investment
companies and I basically just rattle the
[SPEAKER_06]: cages of these businesses.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things I see more often than
not is they need less than a year of bleed
[SPEAKER_06]: money.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, oh, you think you're gonna be
making $500,000 a year, nine months,
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 months, 11 months in, and then it just
continues on this projection of straight
[SPEAKER_06]: up.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not realistic.
[SPEAKER_06]: They think we're tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've even seen labs with the same types of
pitch where they're like, oh, we're gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: be testing everybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, okay, let's be realistic.
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't just a computer that spins once
you get the program and it just operates.
[SPEAKER_06]: This isn't tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is still human beings.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is still people.
[SPEAKER_06]: People cost money, training.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of this infrastructure is a lot of
work.
[SPEAKER_06]: In your opinion, if somebody was asking to
invest, get an investment, start a testing
[SPEAKER_06]: company, how many years in the red do you
think you need to ask for?
[SPEAKER_06]: One, maybe two, three years?
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel bad for anyone who wants to start a
testing lab right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't do it if I had to do it right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have people hitting me up to go to China
to make testing labs, to test components
[SPEAKER_03]: before they come to the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I had 10 bucks for every one,
I'd have more money than everyone in the
[SPEAKER_03]: room.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's insane how much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Listen, it's not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't start a testing company.
[SPEAKER_01]: A testing company you're looking at,
you have to get your annual permitting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to do build out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're looking at two to two and a half
million initially with probably no money
[SPEAKER_01]: through the door for a year at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're competing with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're competing with people who have been
in the game for a while and who are ISO
[SPEAKER_01]: accredited, who know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have a year's head start on you,
which again, I'm not discouraging anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the money, please go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also the fact that right now the
compliance market is flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The number of tests that if you look at
just the BCC's compliance market,
[SPEAKER_01]: the number of tests that you see are being
tested every month, it's literally just
[SPEAKER_01]: been flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been no movement for the last six
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 1,200 to 1,500 tests per month.
[SPEAKER_03]: The black market grows where no testing
exists.
[SPEAKER_06]: It almost won't unless it's forced.
[SPEAKER_06]: In Colorado, I worked for a school and we
had all these classes.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had cultivation, manufacturing,
legal, all this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Legal and compliance, 10 students.
[SPEAKER_06]: How to grow weed, 150 students.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was like, really, you don't care
whether or not you lose your business.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not the interest.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not until we get to a point of where
they're really pushing on you that people
[SPEAKER_06]: start to pay attention and make sure that
they're going with the right lab.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, they can shop you guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: In six months, hopefully, fingers crossed,
once we start getting these numbers put
[SPEAKER_06]: into metric, it'll be much more visible
where it's like, no, you're going with the
[SPEAKER_06]: company that in your mind was doing well,
but look at these numbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not doing well.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are getting placated on them giving
you some numbers that they wanted.
[SPEAKER_06]: I also have seen companies go down and
then go back up in the way of their
[SPEAKER_06]: variances.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this something that they realize that
their machines need to be tested or fixed
[SPEAKER_06]: and then they calibrate and then we go
back?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this something that happens in a lab?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there a variation that the lab will
experience?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I feel like I've worked with
companies where I'm like, everything's
[SPEAKER_06]: great, and then one day it's totally
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's happening right now because
people aren't regulated well enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once everything settles in,
you'll have to report your changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's just unregulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of stuff you can get right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can get away with doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at some point, that won't be tolerable
in the BCC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will hopefully have the means to
figure out how to- You generally see that
[SPEAKER_01]: when people don't have redundancy in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're dependent on just one or two
instruments and your instruments go down,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I talk about that $2 million
investment, I'm just talking for one set
[SPEAKER_01]: of instrumentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you really want to stay ahead of the
curve, you have to have two sets of
[SPEAKER_01]: everything at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, redundancy is the key if you don't
want to see those fluctuations from- All
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a laboratory and if you're going
to start a laboratory, what you do is you
[SPEAKER_03]: sell machine runtime.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because everything else is bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to a lab, here's how it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll help you bust every lab in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to a lab and they have one set
of equipment, the time it takes to take
[SPEAKER_03]: your samples and prep them is X amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 24 hours in the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: The time it takes to then run the machine
to load it up and run the machine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, big buddy, show me what you got.
[SPEAKER_03]: The time it takes to do that, that takes a
certain amount of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's machine runtime.
[SPEAKER_03]: The time it takes to take the information
out of there, decipher it, break it down,
[SPEAKER_03]: put it back over.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's all this time.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they only have one set of equipment and
they're selling at the lowest price and
[SPEAKER_03]: they have a ton of customers, that's not
going to end well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The volume catches up to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be honest, that's what steeple was.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking idiots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Stupid as shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pissed me off.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what are you guys doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: If this was a grow room, fucking everyone
would be dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'd have no money.
[SPEAKER_03]: The point is if you're not paying
attention to your business and doing it
[SPEAKER_03]: correctly, no matter what it is,
you know what the real issue is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Human beings, people.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to work hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're fucking lazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't want to do what you got to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Gary Vee.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, Gary Vee.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the other thing too is- Nobody cares,
work harder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look it, right now I'm starting to go and
getting really interested in biohacking
[SPEAKER_03]: and human biohacking and human
optimization and all this cool shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a whole entire industry of people
that are in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you get to these people, coming from
cannabis, you meet these people and these
[SPEAKER_03]: people don't lie.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're fucking nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's totally different.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you talk to them about CBD,
it's just everyone in cannabis is this
[SPEAKER_03]: creepy burnt out maverick that wants to
fucking rip everyone off and they can't be
[SPEAKER_03]: honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, no, I mean the good people aren't,
but the other people are.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can somebody mean this right now,
Addison, the creepy burnt out maverick?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying, they don't want to be
honest and they're not honest with
[SPEAKER_03]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like our industry is this fucking
weird place where shady shit can go down
[SPEAKER_03]: and no one says anything about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like-
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to make a point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was making a point.
[SPEAKER_06]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the entire industry's problem
is that you have bad gut health and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: making horrible decisions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bad gut health.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone take better care of your guts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Too much sugar.
That's all.
[SPEAKER_06]: We only have a couple more minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does anybody have any questions about
testing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Saman, yes, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: It isn't that hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You shouldn't have any issues with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We build our own in-house limb system and
it's tied to every calibration.
[SPEAKER_01]: How often do you have to calibrate?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, wait, I wanted to understand the
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is no requirement for how many
times you calibrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of us end up calibrating multiple
times a week because our QCs have to fall
[SPEAKER_01]: within spec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your QCs fall out of spec if your
calibration is not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So think of it more from an industrial
point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're running your things.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have certain specifications to meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that specification fall out of it,
you have to do adjustments to make it come
[SPEAKER_01]: within spec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, validation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the validation of- Yes, we do have
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at the regs, there's this
whole section on validation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to put all that package together
for initial validation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time they ask, we'll get them for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done it like every six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: They change your parameters.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a point, your cardiac controls go out
of spec the more you test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us, we were calibrating once a
week, then it was multiple times a week
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're testing more stuff and the
stuff is dirtier or it could be stranger
[SPEAKER_00]: matrixes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just depends on what you're testing.
And your standards for those always have
to be all the same, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiple internal standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: So each method has their own internal
standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they have 10, 15 internal
standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, more internal standards actually
help you stay within spec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we're all playing a game of how
do we stay within spec as long as possible
[SPEAKER_01]: because you want to increase that
capacity, which means that the way to
[SPEAKER_01]: increase the capacity is to run less of
those internal QCs and more of the
[SPEAKER_01]: customer samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then that means you need those QCs to
pass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's this recurring cycle you have
to keep.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the whole point of a quality
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's interesting because I was on
another panel about looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: extractors we're talking about,
that internal check.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, we need this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything that they're saying,
we've been doing this for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And things have to be within spec.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not within spec, it's a cyclical
process that you keep checking and
[SPEAKER_01]: rechecking to stay within that spec.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's almost like the rest of the
industry is now catching up to what we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing, which is why I'm saying that
collaborative kind of sharing of
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to know how to write a good
SOP, talk to your lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been writing this for ages.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: My quick question for you is, why did you
ask that question?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason why I asked you that question
is because when you asked your question,
[SPEAKER_03]: I put my mic down and I said to the two of
them, the reason why he's asking that is
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's the greatest fucking lie
that every lab tells their customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bad science.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bad science.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's the standards, the fucking
standards, the calibration.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have them.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what you don't understand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just be the one to say this to
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every fucking lab that wants to be
successful, if you want to stump a lab,
[SPEAKER_03]: are you ISO 17 025 certified?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because all of the things you're talking
about, it's already there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if what you're saying, I can already
tell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at you, young man, and I can see
how you've been tainted by these lies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody lied to use them on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's horrible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll hug you when we get done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think of it this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Think of a lab this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you look at a factory, and there's
conveyor belts in a factory, and every
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking thing's moving in a different
direction, and those conveyor belts are so
[SPEAKER_03]: tightly worked that a package falls off,
goes to the next, comes through.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what a lab really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if anything's out of fucking line,
the package shoots off the other end.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear this, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to hear about the order of
magnitude difference.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do want to know.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to address this, because this is
probably like the elephant in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not even.
[SPEAKER_01]: This affects potency.
[SPEAKER_01]: This affects potency as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do want to address this.
[SPEAKER_03]: 800-year-old question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the biggest questions that
testing labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't use alcohol, because it sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: It only holds so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do want to explain this.
[SPEAKER_01]: The instrument errors are under 1%.
[SPEAKER_01]: The errors due to repeatability in any of
these methods are actually under 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: The largest source of error is actually
from sample collection and sample
[SPEAKER_01]: preparation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are your largest source of error.
[SPEAKER_01]: So homogeneity is actually one of the
largest issues in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say that I sent four different
things to four different labs and got four
[SPEAKER_01]: different results, they're probably all
correct in that small sample that you
[SPEAKER_01]: sent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in this industry, we have a lack
of understanding on what's a
[SPEAKER_01]: representative sample of a two-liter
batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're sending me one mil of a 200-liter
batch, and you're expecting that to be
[SPEAKER_01]: representative of that entire batch.
[SPEAKER_03]: And other industries don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They take huge samples from massive
amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if a lab tells you that it was a
calibration error, that's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: patently incorrect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your calibration from week to week should
not drastically change your results.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the whole point of those QCs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they still reported it, and then it was
a calibration error.
[SPEAKER_00]: And alcohol is trash.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we take our lab very, I guess,
short-sighted kind of platform in the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole cannabis industry to something that
we can leverage to advance science,
[SPEAKER_02]: advance product development, and really
create an ecosystem of brands and products
[SPEAKER_02]: that actually do really good for people,
and we know that they do good for people,
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than just for testing purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that's simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The customer has to demand it,
because then the brands will start testing
[SPEAKER_00]: more.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start getting this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start carrying.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll stop lab shopping.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a customer ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as the customer starts demanding
this information, they want to know,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they will not buy the product unless
they do, then everyone will play ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every other industry has followed the same
path.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, from alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alcohol is an interesting one,
actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think about alcohol right now,
right when he was talking, I was thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: about alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how did it go for alcohol?
[SPEAKER_03]: What were those years?
[SPEAKER_03]: What did those years look like after
alcohol was regulated?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the reason they went back and opened
it back up was because people were going
[SPEAKER_03]: blind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're like, all right, we got to
regulate this because people are going
[SPEAKER_03]: blind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they went and fixed that shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how long, if anyone in the room knows,
how long did it take?
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took 10 years of solid figuring out and
trying to figure out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point, you had FDA labs and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: My issue with the doctors, honestly,
there's honest doctors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I see doctors who are like, we need to do
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doctors need to stop sitting there and
allowing pharmaceutical companies to
[SPEAKER_03]: control shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once they stop doing that,
then they could be more fucking honest
[SPEAKER_03]: with the public.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we could say, oh, hey,
let's have a relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: But until then, the public itself knows
what's going on with pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we know right down to the opiate
epidemic that linked in with going to Iraq
[SPEAKER_03]: and taking fucking fields of opiates.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the doctors are the ones that
prescribed it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are all the doctors now?
[SPEAKER_03]: The doctors aren't getting in trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: The pharmaceutical companies are kind of
getting in trouble.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as I'm concerned, when it comes
to doctors, when they're asking these
[SPEAKER_03]: things, they know how it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: They already know how it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're doctors.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're dealing with the FDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're dealing with other shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to turn towards cannabis and be like,
hey, where's the this, this, and this?
[SPEAKER_03]: How long did it take for alcohol?
[SPEAKER_03]: How long did it take for these other
things?
[SPEAKER_03]: We want it more than anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the labs want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wants it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to take, just like right
now, you're watching raids going up in
[SPEAKER_03]: Northern California.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're supposedly raiding guys that are
not in compliance, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I hear different stories.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the fact that they're doing that and
putting money into it, it will change
[SPEAKER_03]: things next year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just takes that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like, the doctors, man,
don't even get me started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting back to a little bit of what you
were saying about what would it take to
[SPEAKER_01]: not be transactional, that's going to be
like an industry psyche change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what are you saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, it's impossible for labs to
lock down contracts that are longer than a
[SPEAKER_01]: few months.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you need long-term contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: In most other industries, you have
year-long contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have this year-long contract with
all these agreements, with all these
[SPEAKER_01]: specifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how you build that
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people need to understand that you
have to build.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone had asked me, if I had a scientist
on my side, if I'm an extractor,
[SPEAKER_01]: how would you account for dealing with lab
testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, the best way to do is,
in your process, in your budget,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to budget in some level of
failures and some level of errors.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to account for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: To say that your tolerance is zero is a
recipe for disaster as a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have to account for it and then
deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now in the industry,
this is not just true for the labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like this is most supply chain
relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to be longer relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: People need to start demanding longer
contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the only way you can actually
build a relationship of trust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because now you're locked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, well, I'm locked in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Might as well see how this works and how
to improve each other along that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the best way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because otherwise, you follow other
industries where you start standardizing
[SPEAKER_00]: how you make the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also what helps analytical labs
in other industries, is that you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: your testing is made probably by A,
B, or C, so you have a good idea of how to
[SPEAKER_00]: test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why you require a long
relationship so you can get used to
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can start understanding how it works
on your machines and how you extract it
[SPEAKER_00]: and what it means on your equipment on
this day versus that day, this throughput.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that stuff matters in an analytical
lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most analytical labs report ranges,
not numbers, because there's variability
[SPEAKER_00]: in this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's just so many things that
make so much more sense in other
[SPEAKER_00]: industries because they've already been
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've already done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a big ass of cannabis to do it
in year zero or three or five.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm new to it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as everyone plays ball and doesn't
try to circumvent what we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: accomplish.
[SPEAKER_06]: With that said, I really think that the
labs need to be aware as somebody who's
[SPEAKER_06]: never, like I said, I've been every other
part of this industry, every other
[SPEAKER_06]: division.
[SPEAKER_06]: The thing that we live in is fear in real
life as business owners.
[SPEAKER_06]: We live in fear that tomorrow's not going
to come.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these contracts literally terrify us
because we live on a month to month in our
[SPEAKER_06]: minds and are barely coming out of this
mentality of I have enough to cover Q1.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have enough to cover Q2.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're getting out of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so contractually binding ourselves to
anybody has terrified us.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, let's talk back to the beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can build that in though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh no, I understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in these businesses, we're at a point,
like we were saying with the investments,
[SPEAKER_06]: we're at a place where we're bridging that
gap, if you will.
[SPEAKER_06]: As testing facilities and as people that
are coming most of the time from science
[SPEAKER_06]: and analytical worlds, you guys have a
very strong understanding of the long
[SPEAKER_06]: game.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are long game people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Science are long game people.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what your job is, is to figure out
next year.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what science is about.
[SPEAKER_06]: Weed, unfortunately, as an industry,
we are just getting to the thought,
[SPEAKER_06]: even the thought of a long game,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're like right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I, you know, I encourage everyone,
this is kind of the end of our wrap up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I encourage everyone to understand that
these two worlds are kind of coming
[SPEAKER_06]: together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the scientific world has existed in a
way of regulation where when we ask
[SPEAKER_06]: questions like Saman, who's a
manufacturer, is actually the question.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've come into science from cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: He's come into being like one of the
smartest people I know in the world,
[SPEAKER_06]: extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Through this passion and this mindset
versus this long game, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: Ivy League education of like how a lab is
supposed to be run, which is a totally
[SPEAKER_06]: more evolved mindset professionally,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what we need to do is we need to
bridge that gap.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what this whole conference was
about, was really bridging that gap
[SPEAKER_06]: between the scientists and the people in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'd say this is a poignant example
right here where we have two completely
[SPEAKER_06]: different worlds that need to come
together and much better understand each
[SPEAKER_06]: other because they're right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do need long-term contracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're 100% correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as somebody who has told every one of
these guys no on a contract, I will tell
[SPEAKER_06]: you that I am wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm 100% wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to sign contracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: We all do because this is true.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is how we create data.
[SPEAKER_06]: Data sets are not going to exist without
our ability to create consistencies.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're only going to do that if you're
working with the same team over and over
[SPEAKER_06]: and over again so you can even see
consistent.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you know how good you are if you
jump around from lab to lab to lab and
[SPEAKER_06]: everything's a little bit different
everywhere?
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: You find one person and you work with
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: At least for a long enough time to figure
out what this is.
[SPEAKER_06]: We actually created a meme today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's, are you my data?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's a little microchip and a bunch of
information off to the corner.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's like, are you my data?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because realistically, that's what this is
all about, is bringing all that data and
[SPEAKER_06]: bringing this to the culture of cannabis
so that we can make the two live together
[SPEAKER_06]: in harmony.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you guys for coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm so appreciative of all of your time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you all for coming out.
Thank you.
