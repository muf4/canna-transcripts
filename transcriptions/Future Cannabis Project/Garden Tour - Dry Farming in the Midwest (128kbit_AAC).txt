[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, my name is Cody and I want to give
you guys my version of a garden tour We're
[SPEAKER_00]: about 45 minutes south of Chicago in the
Midwest and I just want to share some
[SPEAKER_00]: views I'm not trying to show off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't pretend to be any kind of
authority I don't think any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: growing style like I don't think my style
is better than any other I just want to
[SPEAKER_00]: show what works for me at least what's
working this season where I am and I Don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully somebody out there needs to see
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know maybe a couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't So sure that this style would
work where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd like to see a video like this So I
do want to say thank you to future
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis project.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are an outstanding resource The
content you provide the speakers the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations there bar none, especially
when everybody's stuck indoors So thank
[SPEAKER_00]: you so much for allowing me to contribute
and I just really appreciate it All right
[SPEAKER_00]: Now one thing that's always been
fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always been important is genetics
Selections and who's making those
[SPEAKER_00]: selections.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've always mentioned breeding
Everybody's Lines that I choose to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: they all seem to have very big heart They
put it forward with passion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to help people and those are
things that I personally align with So
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what I choose to grow I also have
been hobby breeding for a couple years now
[SPEAKER_00]: And then actually Rizzo AK reached out
when he saw a male I selected and I got to
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborate with him So we have some stuff
in testing But yeah, it's such a blast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't Don't know how to explain how
exciting it is when something you make
[SPEAKER_00]: gets Grown by a friend that is in need
Yeah, hopefully hopefully more good things
[SPEAKER_00]: to come from that if you see I've got
different size plants here part of that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be When they were transplanted a
lot of these smaller ones here
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically are for the breeding
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have going they are cuttings that have
been tried and true and Like this season I
[SPEAKER_00]: found a really nice royal wedding male
right here We have two royal wedding
[SPEAKER_00]: females both from seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are sisters And row wedding is from
Emerald Mountain legacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't know who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please go look them up They're doing
fantastic out here Now I am dry farming
[SPEAKER_00]: and when I say that just mean I do not
have irrigation and I'm not watering I did
[SPEAKER_00]: give them three solo cups of water when I
transplanted and I also inoculated with
[SPEAKER_00]: mycorrhizae and Also use some super warm
for ass, but I'm not convinced those two
[SPEAKER_00]: steps are entirely necessary However,
they do seem to be happy they might be
[SPEAKER_00]: best-looking plants in the garden You tell
me Definitely very very happy cannot wait
[SPEAKER_00]: to see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I plan on doing some fresh frozen help
friend and his family Let's kind of say
[SPEAKER_00]: you know this one got knocked down and the
cage Sort of ripped open the stem there
[SPEAKER_00]: now I took curry powder made a paste with
some water and put that inside where it
[SPEAKER_00]: was split and it seemed To heal right over
it's just antibacterial Antipathogenic and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something I picked up from rising
moon farms If you don't follow rising moon
[SPEAKER_00]: go check him out He's also a breeder he's
a grows hemp he grows cannabis See what
[SPEAKER_00]: else this is mother's milk from Bodhi It's
going to be in a poly OG crossed
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachia You have sour dub
[SPEAKER_00]: Gorilla glue rest in peace Josie
Strawberry banana og This
[SPEAKER_00]: is nor kill dosy dose and
[SPEAKER_00]: a paradise circus Just let her do her own
thing This is the mountain cut of
[SPEAKER_00]: trapezoid cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: Can touch briefly on what I did for IPM
this season I leaned heavily on lost coast
[SPEAKER_00]: plant therapy with weekly applications and
once the pistols went from lashes to more
[SPEAKER_00]: like palms as my friend would say I
Stopped spraying and started to lean on
[SPEAKER_00]: These green lace swing eggs that are on
these hangers here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Very minimal you will see some pests
you will see some damage this plant One
[SPEAKER_00]: that I really liked looking at It's really
pretty she seems to be just soaking up the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun But this plant is black lime reserve
across the chem 91 death star I Got these
[SPEAKER_00]: as a seed at the organic regenerative
conference from buckwheat And that dude is
[SPEAKER_00]: an amazing artist.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a breeder It's a grower I Check him
out go on IG Underscore underscore
[SPEAKER_00]: buckwheat and look for green triangle
Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again This tent does not have much
going on I'm not really sure what
[SPEAKER_00]: happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is GMO on the back and right away I
was going to lean heavily in this tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what was gonna be my main thing
and Immediately could tell something was
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I let it go I sprayed with plant therapy
just kind of want to see what would happen
[SPEAKER_00]: here Someone can chime in tell me what is
the deal I appreciate it Right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have another gorilla glue Looks like
it's starting to show seeds here Nice Okay
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant sister It's another royal
wedding But it has a totally different
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf morphology Kind of likes to emphasize
the middle three And she's definitely the
[SPEAKER_00]: furthest along the flower It's starting to
really smell just really nice We had a day
[SPEAKER_00]: of clouds and a little bit of rain and
then last night it rained so they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking pretty happy right now Here we
have another paradise circus Some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: big ones were actually mom Where my mom's
I should say?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had power outage for four days and
Decided to do a round of cuttings and put
[SPEAKER_00]: these bigger ones outside thought it'd be
easier to take care of the smaller ones So
[SPEAKER_00]: far so good Sour dub This one's
interesting this is a bag seed That's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be valley girl valley girl is SFB
og cross face off og I believe and So far
[SPEAKER_00]: so good
[SPEAKER_00]: Always check the lowers and everything so
far nothing Right home about don't see any
[SPEAKER_00]: Signs of Unhappiness, but maybe I got
lucky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it just isn't unhappy yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those things can sure hide Here Two
different Panama pupils, it's mass medical
[SPEAKER_00]: strains you gave out some freebies last
Year friends split the pack and gave me
[SPEAKER_00]: half And so far so good This one is
obviously tighter Flower structure looks
[SPEAKER_00]: more like what I see pupil pictures look
like so maybe it'll turn purple as we get
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler here and this one has more of a
Maybe a cherry sort of a smell kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp smell So very pretty Really like the
smell also really like how the leaves will
[SPEAKER_00]: track the Sun Come in the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be just drooped down like it needs
water Come in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's angled totally sideways same with the
evening and sort of middle of the day like
[SPEAKER_00]: this It's just all over So that's very
cool to watch Then you know what guys I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that brings us to What I might be
the most excited about I don't know.
