[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Brian Hesterman with Inspire,
and I'll be hosting today's webinar and Q
[SPEAKER_02]: &A session.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we learned in part one, growing
cannabis inside a sealed room is a highly
[SPEAKER_02]: complex interdisciplinary challenge that
bridges engineering with biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: A plant is not just a biologic organism,
it is also a physical object that is
[SPEAKER_02]: subject to the same physical laws that
govern matter, such as the law of
[SPEAKER_02]: conservation of energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: As such, energy and indoor plant
environments is neither created nor
[SPEAKER_02]: destroyed, but rather converted from one
form to another.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, when light is provided to a
plant, a small amount of that energy is
[SPEAKER_02]: absorbed by the plant's leaves for
photosynthesis, and much of that energy
[SPEAKER_02]: gets converted into evaporation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we maintain an optimal water
balance and manage plant evaporation to
[SPEAKER_02]: ensure production outputs and quality are
maximized while lowering costs of
[SPEAKER_02]: production through efficiency and
reductions in labor?
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer to that question is,
it depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every project is different in a multitude
of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is no one-size-fits-all approach,
and there is no single manufacturer that
[SPEAKER_02]: can build the right system for every
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's presentation is part two of our
two-part series, and we'll be focused on
[SPEAKER_02]: the engineering side of the equation,
the system and how control is achieved.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll cover general HVAC system
considerations, HVAC system types and
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions, HVAC components, and we'll
touch on design and implementation if we
[SPEAKER_02]: have time.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be new content for some and
review for others, and the goal is to
[SPEAKER_02]: provide a solid foundation of important
environmental control requirements that
[SPEAKER_02]: should be considered and how INSPIRE can
help your project with a diverse lineup of
[SPEAKER_02]: purpose-built HVAC systems and controls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, just to quickly set the stage for
the presentation, this talk will focus on
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental control for indoor
cultivation only, not greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: While many of today's concepts still apply
to greenhouses, greenhouse environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: control strategies are for another talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also dealing with sealed grow rooms
where we have complete control over all
[SPEAKER_02]: growth parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no outdoor air normal operation,
and the air within the room is fully
[SPEAKER_02]: recirculating, and that's mainly because
we're supplementing the air with CO2 to
[SPEAKER_02]: maximize carbon assimilation and the
growth rate of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: These sealed rooms can be either single
level or multi-tier, and the focus of
[SPEAKER_02]: today is on cannabis, but a lot of the
core concepts that we've covered today can
[SPEAKER_02]: also apply to any other crop that has
grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today's webinar will be presented by
INSPIRE's Adrian Giovenco, and INSPIRE's
[SPEAKER_02]: lead applications engineer and product
specialist, Joji Singh, will be joining
[SPEAKER_02]: for Q&A after the presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without further ado, I'll hand it over to
Adrian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Adrian, take it away, G.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Brian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great to see you all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for joining today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got a lot to cover, so we're going
to jump right in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is part two, the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to drop off camera for this
portion to save bandwidth, but we'll come
[SPEAKER_01]: back on for the Q&A.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our primary objective is to design,
sell, and commission mechanical systems
[SPEAKER_01]: that serve indoor plant environments and
allow for optimum plant performance,
[SPEAKER_01]: secondary metabolite production,
and long-term profitability.
[SPEAKER_01]: These facilities are true manufacturing
factories that produce high-quality food,
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational products, and medicine on an
industrial scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: With homage paid to a book that we draw
inspiration from called Plant Empowerment,
[SPEAKER_01]: we view our role as supporting plant
balances, not controlling air conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real art of good growing is to support
the plant in maintaining its balances in
[SPEAKER_01]: such a way that all factors for growth are
optimal at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here to build on our part one
webinar where we broke down all the needs
[SPEAKER_01]: of cultivation and curing spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we've shared, we must not do this
in a vacuum, which is why everything we do
[SPEAKER_01]: here needs to be squarely focused on all
the important plant-focused topics that we
[SPEAKER_01]: covered in part one.
[SPEAKER_01]: With this solid foundation, let's spend
some time exploring the process by which
[SPEAKER_01]: the most appropriate mechanical systems
are sized, selected, and controlled to
[SPEAKER_01]: serve these cultivation and curing rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Based on what we learned in part one,
the mechanical systems need to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to do all of the things shown on
the slide in each room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dehumidify, cool, heat, humidify,
enrich with CO2, clean the air,
[SPEAKER_01]: distribute the air for homogeneous air
environment, and most importantly,
[SPEAKER_01]: collect cultivation room-level data so
that we know what is working, what needs
[SPEAKER_01]: attention, and how we can use feedback
from the plants to optimize production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can one system do all these things in
an integrated fashion, or do you need
[SPEAKER_01]: separate pieces of equipment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's dig into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For decades, HVAC equipment has been
designed to keep humans comfortable,
[SPEAKER_01]: thus the term comfort cooling systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subsequently, specialized process and
manufacturing environments developed to
[SPEAKER_01]: require specific environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since people feel temperature more than
humidity, and since we generate heat,
[SPEAKER_01]: the majority of HVAC systems are designed
to cool only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, most process environments
produce a lot of heat, think data centers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these process-oriented solutions also
tend to be more sensible cooling-centric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indoor plant environments are special in
the sense that they have living and
[SPEAKER_01]: breathing organisms that happen to be
immobile.
[SPEAKER_01]: So consistent ratios of temperature and
light on a day-to-day basis is key to
[SPEAKER_01]: performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while you may not feel it in a forest,
plants are giving off virtually all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture that their roots uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each plant or tree is an evaporative
cooler.
[SPEAKER_01]: This dehumidification heavy load is a big
reason why the mechanical systems that
[SPEAKER_01]: serve them must be specialized.
[SPEAKER_01]: On top of the large moisture removal
requirement, these rooms also have a very
[SPEAKER_01]: dynamic load profile between lights on and
lights off periods, and the beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: stages of vegetative growth to the end of
the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the flowering cycles, which dominate
the facility space needs in these
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities, the load can be completely
flipped 180 degrees every 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a concept from part one that's
worth repeating, and much like the law of
[SPEAKER_01]: minimum for plant growth, the productivity
of an indoor cultivation facility is
[SPEAKER_01]: determined by its greatest limiting
factor, or its most underperforming
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our experience, the greatest limiting
factor for most indoor facilities today is
[SPEAKER_01]: their mechanical systems, or their ability
to control the temperature and humidity of
[SPEAKER_01]: their rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: The improvement of mechanical systems
presents the greatest opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: maximize the productivity for indoor
cultivation businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is exactly why Inspire was
founded, to develop and deliver
[SPEAKER_01]: purpose-built systems and controls that
are assets and valuable tools for growers
[SPEAKER_01]: and not a liability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now on the next slide, let's explore some
of the specific differences between the
[SPEAKER_01]: two types of facilities and systems,
comfort cooling HVAC and HVAC and
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidification system meant for indoor
plant environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the left side, you'll see the
attributes for the HVAC systems for
[SPEAKER_01]: comfort cooling, and on the right for
indoor plant environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: This whole conversation starts with the
need for both temperature and humidity
[SPEAKER_01]: control, also viewed through the lens of
VPD, rather than just temperature control
[SPEAKER_01]: only.
[SPEAKER_01]: As such, plant-centric sequence of
operations are required to respond to the
[SPEAKER_01]: needs of the living organisms,
whose needs are constantly changing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and to manage the rest of the items on
this list.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sensible heat ratios are very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50-50 cooling and dehumidification versus
85 or 90% and 10 to 15% dehumidification,
[SPEAKER_01]: in which requires airflow in the coils to
be sized appropriately.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have high number of air changes in the
sense of how these spaces view air
[SPEAKER_01]: changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are 100% recirculating systems,
but we are changing out the air every two
[SPEAKER_01]: to three minutes in a 20 to 30 air changes
per hour rate versus two to three air
[SPEAKER_01]: changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very dynamic load between day
and night, and that requires variable
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity control, both on cooling,
reheat, airflow, where fixed capacity is
[SPEAKER_01]: okay in many cases otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And reheat is required in order to deliver
room-neutral air conditions and keep the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants in conditions optimal for growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we eliminate dehumidifiers,
we're needing to reheat that air back up,
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas in comfort cooling applications,
you can deliver much colder air.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this case, CO2 is plant food and
costs money to introduce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thus, air economizers are typically not
applicable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biofiltration and air cleaning is
extremely important and must be included.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state laws differ, but universally,
strict lab testing requirements and lack
[SPEAKER_01]: of ability to use pesticides on this crop
because it is ingested can lead to large
[SPEAKER_01]: crop loss resulting from pests and
pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like everything in this unique
application, the whole process is
[SPEAKER_01]: interconnected by creating a culture of
clean and improving the cleanliness of the
[SPEAKER_01]: air environment within effective
biofiltration systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can reduce or eliminate preventative
sprays and the labor costs associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now that we know what functions are
required and how the needs differ from
[SPEAKER_01]: typical comfort cooling to process cooling
systems, let's take an important sanity
[SPEAKER_01]: check with regards to the cultivation
business needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the complex and multidisciplinary
challenge that we are faced with as an
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental system architect,
so to speak, designers and builders,
[SPEAKER_01]: and with so many different types of system
variations to consider, we must base our
[SPEAKER_01]: decision making process on the most
important factors first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Key performance indicators or KPIs are
used to set the baseline targets,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they must be continuously tracked
starting from the first cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like to recommend using the second
flower cycle as the true test of the
[SPEAKER_01]: benchmarks that were set, since it is very
challenging to load test these spaces and
[SPEAKER_01]: commission them properly with plants and
real load before bringing in your first
[SPEAKER_01]: run and starting to cultivate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we suggest for our clients to really
try to simulate that load in the space as
[SPEAKER_01]: best as possible during the commissioning
process, but it's not always practical.
[SPEAKER_01]: What of these attributes do cultivation
businesses need to succeed?
[SPEAKER_01]: We regularly poll cultivators and cannabis
business owners, and out of this long
[SPEAKER_01]: list, the attributes that come back on the
top of the list are quality, consistency,
[SPEAKER_01]: speed to market, lowest operating cost,
safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the point of reduced cost of
production, it is very important to not
[SPEAKER_01]: forget about building efficiency into your
facility from the start and taking
[SPEAKER_01]: advantage of CAPEX offsets from the
utility or state to help improve
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency and reduce cost of production.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where indoor and vertical farming
industry can truly participate in the
[SPEAKER_01]: triple bottom line concept that
sustainable facility design can be good
[SPEAKER_01]: for business, good for the environment,
and good for the consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's spend a couple of minutes digging
into these details around efficiency and
[SPEAKER_01]: incentives for offsets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dehumidification is an energy intensive
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: The HVAC dehumidification systems can
comprise up to 50 to 60% of the total
[SPEAKER_01]: facility energy consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as that's rolled up, that total energy
accounts for 20 to 40% of your operating
[SPEAKER_01]: costs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The HVAC portion of the energy accounts
for your total of 20 to 40% of your total
[SPEAKER_01]: operating costs in a cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And investing in efficient HVAC and
dehumidification systems lowers your
[SPEAKER_01]: operating costs per pound in perpetuity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Efficient systems are what you need to
weather the storm of price compression and
[SPEAKER_01]: supply and demand imbalances, which are
guaranteed to happen as state markets
[SPEAKER_01]: mature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most existing facilities today are not
built to make it through these challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: By investing upfront, you can keep your
costs down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't expose yourself to these risks by
doing it right the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The utility and tax incentive programs
offer free money and are only getting
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Custom rebates are available now in all
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prescriptive rebates are coming in many
geographies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peak demand reduction incentives are very
significant right now in California for
[SPEAKER_01]: the next year and in a number of other
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: This could be as simple as scheduling your
light cycles outside of the peak demand
[SPEAKER_01]: hours or implementing controls retrofits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Combined heat and power or CHP systems can
gain both tax incentives and utility
[SPEAKER_01]: rebates for the same project, which is a
real win-win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see more and more cultivation
facilities taking advantage of CHP systems
[SPEAKER_01]: as they can, in many cases, be the most
financially viable solution to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: project financed and built within a
reasonable timeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plus, we get all of our reheat for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: The utility incentive programs are
developing fast to stay apprised of
[SPEAKER_01]: programs in your area and connect with the
utility providers early.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let's not forget that we don't design
efficiency into the overall system just
[SPEAKER_01]: for the sake of efficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: We must focus on the plant productivity
first and then find ways to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a little foreshadowing for what's to
come today, but since we embrace an
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated design approach, from the
pre-construction stage, we actually can do
[SPEAKER_01]: both of those successfully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that we've got all the business level
needs ranked, we have to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: those track with mixing in sustainability
and efficiency and the KPIs and all of
[SPEAKER_01]: that we just discussed, we have to make
sure that that is all going to jive with
[SPEAKER_01]: the system considerations that the owner
and client are looking for and the
[SPEAKER_01]: building and site design constraints,
which you see system considerations on the
[SPEAKER_01]: left and design constraints on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Capital costs and operating costs are
extremely important.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to get it right the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: HVAC is typically the largest capital
investment on a project, and it is also
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the most expensive to retrofit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are really so many different
competing factors here, whether you go
[SPEAKER_01]: through level of control, efficiency,
sustainability, like we just discussed,
[SPEAKER_01]: the reliability, durability, complexity,
maintenance requirements, who's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: maintain it, how is your phasing set up
for future phases and build out?
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you focused on GMP cleanliness
standards?
[SPEAKER_01]: All of that has to be transitioned into
how we're actually going to apply this
[SPEAKER_01]: into this particular building or site.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these design constraints are what the
engineers, MEP engineers and architects
[SPEAKER_01]: and other design professionals have to
work with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: These that you see on the screen are some
of the the items that we see most often
[SPEAKER_01]: overlooked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Space and structural limitations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have enough utility?
[SPEAKER_01]: Power, gas are the biggest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Water is also very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: CO2 availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: Property line and neighbor complaints,
both odor control and noise related,
[SPEAKER_01]: can sink a project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Biofiltration and pest exclusion needs to
be considered and very, very, very
[SPEAKER_01]: seriously in areas that are agriculturally
dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the controls, integration,
air distribution, uniformity, how we're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting the facility together all take
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, all of these items have to be able to
meet the building and energy code
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a really multidisciplinary
challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's been said before, but it's worth
repeating that it's imperative to get this
[SPEAKER_01]: done right the first time because of how
costly and challenging it is to retrofit
[SPEAKER_01]: the HVAC systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start looking at some different
types of systems that are used commonly in
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first place to start here is with what
we call non-integrated systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: These can also be called conventional,
non-integrated, decoupled or legacy
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: During prohibition, cultivators were
forced indoors to hide from law
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And due to that illegality, they could not
engage engineers or commercial HVAC system
[SPEAKER_01]: providers or HVAC technicians to design
and install mechanical systems to control
[SPEAKER_01]: these spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this really led to a do-it-yourself
mentality and propensity for using what
[SPEAKER_01]: was available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And specifically, we're talking about
off-the-shelf residential people comfort
[SPEAKER_01]: cooling systems used in conjunction with
standalone dehumidifiers and oscillating
[SPEAKER_01]: wall fans.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this gear can be bought at a local
hydra shop or home depot.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the cooling equipment, it can be
packaged rooftop units, split systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: mini splits, VRF systems, or two-pipe
chill water fan coils.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these systems are cooling devices and
control off of a thermostat only.
[SPEAKER_01]: Standalone dehumidifiers are required then
to augment these HVAC units.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're heating only based on
rejecting the heat of compression from the
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidifier into the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the AC units now have to be sized
appropriately to remove this heat rejected
[SPEAKER_01]: by the dehumidifier, which is roughly 30%
additional.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several issues persist with this type of
system configuration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Suboptimal control in this relative
humidity spike at lights off every night
[SPEAKER_01]: where powdery mildew and botrytis can
develop.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see uncontrolled microclimates and
uneven airflow and poor air mixing in
[SPEAKER_01]: these spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're inherently inefficient based on
that 30% extra heat load to remove from
[SPEAKER_01]: the dehumidifiers, as I mentioned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these systems are really fighting
against each other because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: challenging to control.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's pathogen risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are risks with this type of design,
since your technicians will be working on
[SPEAKER_01]: the mechanical equipment above the canopy,
as you see in the picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And condensate leaks are routinely
dripping into the plants, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: common opportunity for water molds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sanitation between the cycles is also very
challenging to achieve, since there's so
[SPEAKER_01]: much equipment in the room and so many
surfaces to clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these all challenges really beg the
question, can we do it better?
[SPEAKER_01]: As experienced HVAC engineers,
we know that we have the technology to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why wouldn't we?
[SPEAKER_01]: Some say that the first cost savings and
many small redundant units are worth the
[SPEAKER_01]: trade off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The data tells us otherwise, and the
industry is maturing too quickly to not
[SPEAKER_01]: take advantage of today's technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's get into how we can mitigate these
challenges and hit the mark with the owner
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements for their business
operational efficiency that we discussed
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier and maybe make it a high
performance and sustainable system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now quickly before we move past
non-integrated systems for the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation, I do want to mention that
for the hundreds and thousands of rooms
[SPEAKER_01]: across North America that are already
built with these systems, HVAC controls
[SPEAKER_01]: retrofits and sub-canopy airflow systems
may be some of the best ways to get
[SPEAKER_01]: reliable data and better control from
these existing systems and to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: apply a plant-centric sequence of
operations, put together an action plan to
[SPEAKER_01]: supplement additional capacity if the
systems are undersized, and utilize open
[SPEAKER_01]: source architecture for control systems to
be able to integrate into future retrofits
[SPEAKER_01]: of the full HVAC systems as additional
capital becomes available.
[SPEAKER_01]: These controls and airflow retrofits can
often be supported by the utility rebate
[SPEAKER_01]: programs that we touched on, which really
helps to offset those investment costs
[SPEAKER_01]: further and improves the ROIs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's dig into integrated systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we graduate to what we term
integrated HVAC and dehumidification
[SPEAKER_01]: systems or HVACD, which highlights the
importance of dehumidification in this
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see these also being called reheat
systems based on the use of hot gas
[SPEAKER_01]: reheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that case, the heat is recovered off
the compressor that would have been sent
[SPEAKER_01]: out to the condenser to be rejected.
[SPEAKER_01]: The HVAC system is integrated to ambient,
and this is a DX or direct expansion
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll go into those more depth in a
moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydronic systems are another type of
integrated system, but we must be specific
[SPEAKER_01]: with our language and naming conventions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four-pipe hydronic system versus a
two-pipe hydronic system, which is
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated a four-pipe and two-pipe is a
cooling only supporting a non-integrated
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll get into more of this in a moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: As HVAC engineering professionals,
we know that a well-engineered system is
[SPEAKER_01]: the best solution when faced with such a
multifaceted design and construction
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: A properly designed integrated system
provides cooling, heating, and
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidification in a single engineered
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since all of this is happening in
integrated air handling units,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can treat all the air in each room for
pests and pathogens on a continuous basis
[SPEAKER_01]: and keep the grow room clean with no
foreign materials to clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember that air is being exchanged every
two to three minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: With an integrated system, we get the
benefits of a tightly controlled and
[SPEAKER_01]: homogeneous air environment with
controlled transitions between photo
[SPEAKER_01]: periods.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get to pick up inherent efficiency
gains in the 30 to 40% range compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: non-integrated systems by removing
standalone dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We focus on the systems being right-sized
and reusing energy and water in any way
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really sounds too good to be true,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But we can balance all these spinning
plates with a simple and elegant system
[SPEAKER_01]: design.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, I thought it would be good to
quickly examine two rooms from a recent
[SPEAKER_01]: client side-by-side study.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an example of an integrated HVAC
system on the top left versus a
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional non-integrated system on the
bottom right and what the control trends
[SPEAKER_01]: look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is two different flower rooms,
both in week four using LED lights,
[SPEAKER_01]: both in a two-tier racking system the same
week in June of last year at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Note the relative humidity spikes of 15 to
20% every time the lights go out,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a critical transition point in
these dynamic spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: The relative humidity line is the purple
line in the trend on the bottom right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see much tighter control of
relative humidity through these
[SPEAKER_01]: transitions with the integrated system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Note the speed to the control points or
how quickly set points can be achieved.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the most important part of this whole
story is that the one on the bottom right
[SPEAKER_01]: was getting 28 grams a square foot of
sellable flower and the one on the top
[SPEAKER_01]: left is getting 55 grams a square foot
consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got double the yields with
integrated environmental control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now let's go from here to talk about the
different types of integrated systems that
[SPEAKER_01]: we deploy as a comprehensive solutions
provider.
[SPEAKER_01]: This type of system is called DX,
which stands for direct expansion.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the type of home air conditioner
you likely have.
[SPEAKER_01]: It contains the full refrigeration circuit
in each unit or system.
[SPEAKER_01]: This can be a split system or a packaged
unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can come in an air-cooled variety with
the air-cooled condenser or a water-cooled
[SPEAKER_01]: condenser.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in general, air-cooled DX is the most
common system that we see today due to
[SPEAKER_01]: lower first cost, technician familiarity,
and shorter lead times.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we see it transitioning to
hydraulic systems and will continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: transition more as the market matures into
true manufacturing facilities at scale
[SPEAKER_01]: that need to prove they manufactured their
products at facilities that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: validated by regulatory bodies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We advocate for our clients to be ready to
meet GMPs if they so desire from the
[SPEAKER_01]: minute they turn on their facility and we
enable them to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We offer our Canopy, Canopy Plus and
Preservation product lines in both
[SPEAKER_01]: air-cooled and water-cooled DX systems to
meet our clients diverse needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see a few different form
factors installed in these pictures from
[SPEAKER_01]: left to right.
[SPEAKER_01]: DX package unit on the left to a
water-cooled energy recovery system in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle to an air-cooled DX split system on
the top right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And remember, these are all integrated
systems, but just in different flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now let's look at the other type,
hydronic systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terminology here, like I mentioned,
before is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are called chilled water or hot
water systems or hydronic systems,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you hear the terms four-pipe or
two-pipe thrown around.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you see in the diagram on the top
right is four pipes, where you have,
[SPEAKER_01]: in this case, you have six pipes because
it's a water-cooled chiller, but on the
[SPEAKER_01]: load side to the air-handling units,
you have four pipes, two for cooling,
[SPEAKER_01]: two for heating, chilled water and hot
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: A two-pipe system is only going to provide
you one or the other at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be more in the
non-integrated camp or a four-pipe system
[SPEAKER_01]: would allow you to do integrated control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now these chillers and the chiller plants
can be air-cooled or they can be
[SPEAKER_01]: water-cooled.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can be electrically driven or they
can be gas-driven.
[SPEAKER_01]: And heat recovery is available on all of
these types of chillers, which means we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't need to pay money or use resources
for reheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: These systems are very customizable to
meet your site needs as far as space
[SPEAKER_01]: considerations and phasing, and better
precision control is available via
[SPEAKER_01]: modulating water valves, which really
allow for infinite variable capacity
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Optimization opportunities exist for
sizing an overall system and for your
[SPEAKER_01]: facility because you can size your plant
based on the block load of your facility
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than the peak load, which allows
you to shave 20 to 30 percent of the total
[SPEAKER_01]: capacity off of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's an opportunity for phasing,
particularly with modular chillers and
[SPEAKER_01]: pumps, which allows for additional
redundancy as well as you build out your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We typically see these systems being
chosen when the total facility size
[SPEAKER_01]: reaches maybe 300 to 400 tons total.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I want you to take note of the
gas-fired chiller on the bottom of the
[SPEAKER_01]: slide with a partner of ours called
TicoGen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This animal uses natural gas to produce
chilled water with no middleman and
[SPEAKER_01]: business owners that proactively
understand their utility rate structure
[SPEAKER_01]: and the relative costs of electricity,
gas, and water in comparison to each other
[SPEAKER_01]: can make the best financial decisions,
and many times those projects end up
[SPEAKER_01]: including a gas-fired chiller plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's compare and contrast what we just
learned about these two types of systems
[SPEAKER_01]: quickly, both integrated but different.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the left we have the attributes related
to DX systems and the hydronic systems are
[SPEAKER_01]: on the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about the individual DX circuits
per room and per unit and the many
[SPEAKER_01]: distributed DX circuits to maintain versus
consolidation and fewer at a chiller
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about good control versus
precise control.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talked about redundancy and how it can
be applied where a direct expansion on a
[SPEAKER_01]: room-by-room unit basis you would need an
additional unit on every single room
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than building in redundancy into
the chiller plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do have a lower first cost for
direct expansion systems but the return on
[SPEAKER_01]: investment breaks even really at about 15
to 20,000 square feet of canopy and
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities of any size larger should
always be looking at hydronic systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both systems required skilled mechanical
technicians to maintain and both systems
[SPEAKER_01]: need engaged and experienced design and
construction and maintenance teams.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not just something for one type of
system or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again you're only as good as your weakest
link so don't let that be your HVAC system
[SPEAKER_01]: or your HVAC service company.
[SPEAKER_01]: Retain on a service side, retain a yearly
contract with your service company so that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can handle routine preventative
maintenance and be available for
[SPEAKER_01]: emergencies at the best rate and can
prioritize availability.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the ways, are these the only
real ways you know we talked about these
[SPEAKER_01]: two different main types of systems,
are there other ways that we can meet this
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's important to talk about you know
there are other proven technologies out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no free lunch though right and
there's trade-offs with all of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Inspire we pride ourselves in a brand
agnostic approach that specializes in
[SPEAKER_01]: finding the right system and HVAC and
controls system for each project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It requires continuous improvement and
innovation so we're always evaluating all
[SPEAKER_01]: types of technologies to determine what
our clients can benefit most from.
[SPEAKER_01]: But technologies need to be more than a
great idea or conceptual opportunity for
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency or other benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order to be commercialized and used on
these facilities we must be sure they're
[SPEAKER_01]: proven for this special application of
indoor plant environments and that they
[SPEAKER_01]: can be cost-effective, serviceable,
reliable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave to say we're very picky about what we
implement in the field and our clients
[SPEAKER_01]: look to us to be their subject matter
experts, gatekeepers and sort of a safety
[SPEAKER_01]: net.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only look to support new innovations
when we can see positive results in
[SPEAKER_01]: third-party verification and see the
systems run in person.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that said there are several proven
dehumidification technologies on the
[SPEAKER_01]: market that we have found to offer varying
levels of opportunity for sustainable and
[SPEAKER_01]: high performance design.
[SPEAKER_01]: All four of the types of energy recovery
devices shown on this slide have a similar
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency improvement over baseline but
all have unique pros and cons.
[SPEAKER_01]: After careful consideration and field
trials our Canopy Plus line utilizes the
[SPEAKER_01]: water-to-water runaround coil concept to
recover warm room air which pre-cools the
[SPEAKER_01]: dehumidification coil and then
subsequently reheats the air off the coil
[SPEAKER_01]: as the first stage of reheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: This results in increased efficiency for
the system of 30 to 50 percent over brute
[SPEAKER_01]: force cooling and tighter control with
both air-cooled DX, water-cooled DX or
[SPEAKER_01]: four-pipe hydronic systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest word of caution with any new
technology is the mandate that you see it
[SPEAKER_01]: in real life and can truly validate the
performance and claims with third-party
[SPEAKER_01]: data.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of third-party testing data,
I thought this would be a good transition
[SPEAKER_01]: into one of the places where we see a lot
of snake oil in the cannabis industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: honestly the whole HVAC industry now that
we've just lived through a pandemic and
[SPEAKER_01]: that is in air cleaning devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to share the technology we trust
for our plant environment What you see
[SPEAKER_01]: here is a photocatalytic oxidative air
cleaner or PCO for short.
[SPEAKER_01]: This air cleaning panel reduces the risk
of pests and pathogen contamination and
[SPEAKER_01]: failing lab tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since cultivators must pass third-party
quality assurance testing and provide COAs
[SPEAKER_01]: along with their sellable product,
it's imperative to monitor and regulate
[SPEAKER_01]: the relatively high particulate pest
pathogen VOC loads within these spaces.
[SPEAKER_01]: Particulate capture filters of mercury
13-14 range will typically catch particle
[SPEAKER_01]: size one micron and larger and we don't
forget to actually change those filters on
[SPEAKER_01]: a regular basis or hire a service
contractor to change them on a schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: But PCO air cleaners are the primary
active biofiltration solution that we
[SPEAKER_01]: incorporate in our systems in conjunction
with those passive filters.
[SPEAKER_01]: These can be in-room units or in-duct
systems or in-unit systems and typically
[SPEAKER_01]: duct mounted is chosen since we're already
bringing all the air through these systems
[SPEAKER_01]: in the ducting system every two to three
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Third-party testing data and validation is
required for all air cleaning technology
[SPEAKER_01]: to be considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in addition to the recirculating units
serving cultivation and curing spaces,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can apply this air cleaning technology
into separate supply and exhaust fan
[SPEAKER_01]: filter units that are used to introduce
clean outdoor air or purge gases and
[SPEAKER_01]: handle odor control, rebalance the gas
mixture of air in the sealed room,
[SPEAKER_01]: or use it as an economizer sequence if the
outside air conditions may be available.
[SPEAKER_01]: One spot we see this most effectively used
in is in an emergency mode to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring in outside air as a backup for any
mechanical system failures that need time
[SPEAKER_01]: to repair.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we offer all these different ancillary
items with our integrated systems as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as a la carte.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now speaking about sub canopy air moving
devices, I wanted to talk about airflow
[SPEAKER_01]: and air movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: When discussing airflow in a cultivation
or curing room, we must consider all air
[SPEAKER_01]: moving devices serving the space as a
complete system, even if they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: physically connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: In an integrated system, the main air
handler or air handlers are used to
[SPEAKER_01]: condition and circulate air as a component
of a heating, ventilating, and air
[SPEAKER_01]: conditioning system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The air handler connects to duct work that
in turn distributes the conditioned cool
[SPEAKER_01]: dry air throughout the grow space before
it returns to the air handling unit.
[SPEAKER_01]: The movement of air through an indoor grow
space is imperative to maintaining a
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without proper airflow, plants may not be
able to evaporate water at optimal levels,
[SPEAKER_01]: stunting photosynthesis and carbon
assimilation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Furthermore, areas of high humidity are
prone to pest infestation, mold,
[SPEAKER_01]: or mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our goal is to create homogeneous
airflow throughout the entire grow space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fortunately, we can't solely rely on the
HVAC system for the in-room airflow since
[SPEAKER_01]: we're designing that system based on
maximum moisture removal as a means of
[SPEAKER_01]: making the system as cost effective as
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, great care consideration should
be taken when designing the supplier and
[SPEAKER_01]: return air duct configurations within room
layout and in-room airflow devices because
[SPEAKER_01]: the room performance depends on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The duct work approaches and designs
differ between single-tier and multi-tier
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sub-canopy airflow systems must be used in
multi-tier gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see a CFD modeling of the
sub-canopy system that we offer in the
[SPEAKER_01]: middle of the page.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top canopy air movement devices should
also be considered.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unit performance depends on a good duct
work design and installation and in-room
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow devices that are designed together
for optimal performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen many, many different rooms in
operation and can help provide suggestions
[SPEAKER_01]: for best practices in an over-the-shoulder
type fashion in collaboration with the
[SPEAKER_01]: mechanical engineers when we become
engaged in projects and equipment has been
[SPEAKER_01]: purchased.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CFD models in the middle of the screen
show one such design concept that we
[SPEAKER_01]: support.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this scenario, we're introducing the
supplier into the working aisle on the
[SPEAKER_01]: right-hand side and sending it down the
racks with sub-canopy airflow fans and
[SPEAKER_01]: tubes for the return air grills to pick up
at the other end of each tier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And return the air to the air handling
units.
[SPEAKER_01]: We typically see rack lengths of less than
40 feet being best for reducing
[SPEAKER_01]: microclimates and dedicated return air
grills locations for each tier rack really
[SPEAKER_01]: help bring, move the air through the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with so many different permutations of
system configurations and ancillary items
[SPEAKER_01]: to integrate, how do we know that the room
operation will be consistent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the answer is with accurate data
collection to inform a plant-centric
[SPEAKER_01]: controls and sequence of operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've discussed throughout the
presentation today, typical factory
[SPEAKER_01]: control sequence are not applicable to
this industry as they're designed for
[SPEAKER_01]: people comfort.
[SPEAKER_01]: We require specialized sequence of
operations for cannabis and other indoor
[SPEAKER_01]: plant environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has taken us aggregating and optimizing
the control strategies over the past six
[SPEAKER_01]: plus years with a multidisciplinary task
force comprised of plant physiologists,
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled engineers, HVAC engineers,
crop scientists, biologists, and the many
[SPEAKER_01]: channel partners who serve the space to
develop what we believe to be the first
[SPEAKER_01]: true plant-centric sequence of operation
available today in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, we implement this standardized
controller with embedded sequence of
[SPEAKER_01]: operation on all of our air handlers,
both hydronic and DX.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these can also be deployed in a
retrofit solution for non-integrated
[SPEAKER_01]: systems or onto existing integrated air
handlers for lower cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the sensor data is collected with
multiple aspirated sensor boxes per tier
[SPEAKER_01]: and located within the plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This data is aggregated in our controllers
and connected throughout the facility with
[SPEAKER_01]: a simple ethernet-based LAN, which
connects the field devices and allows for
[SPEAKER_01]: cloud-based control, monitoring,
and alarming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the sequence of optimization
strategies are many.
[SPEAKER_01]: Intelligent set-point ramping,
smooth transitions, speed of change,
[SPEAKER_01]: negative and positive temperature
differentials, cold air dumps,
[SPEAKER_01]: gas composition resets, room
pressurization control.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've really only scratched the surface
with crop-steering techniques that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: implemented through the plant's
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And back to an important concept from part
one, genotype or genetics plus environment
[SPEAKER_01]: equals phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone is after the next hot phenotype.
[SPEAKER_01]: Environmental control is a fundamental
building block to grow better cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: to do it more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is the critical first step in a
comprehensive integrated pest management
[SPEAKER_01]: program that reduces pathogen pressure and
labor expenditure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Integrated control is the best form of
crop insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really only have one chance to do it
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be the difference between
building long-term asset value and going
[SPEAKER_01]: bankrupt, frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The industry is really on a knife's edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Competition is increasing, prices are
plummeting, margins are shrinking,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can't afford to do it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't afford not to spend the money on
environmental control.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why Inspire focuses exclusively on
indoor plant environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our team's passionate plant and
engineering intimacy combined with a
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse lineup of purpose-built
environmental control solutions helps
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure your cultivation environment is not
your limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to take this moment to thank the
individuals and companies who are helping
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry grow better crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lighting providers providing the necessary
photons, automated fertigation companies
[SPEAKER_01]: that have allowed us to fine-tune drybacks
and mineral balance, racking providers
[SPEAKER_01]: that optimize room utilization,
data collection, monitoring, and control
[SPEAKER_01]: systems that allow us to see the impact of
precision control in real time,
[SPEAKER_01]: the education and media partners for
sharing knowledge to the industry on the
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges of day-to-day cultivation,
the genetics providers that develop great
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivars, and the multidisciplinary
consultants that help bring entrepreneurs'
[SPEAKER_01]: visions to life.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk a lot about integration of
temperature, humidity, and CO2,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's the integration and understanding
of all of these people, partners,
[SPEAKER_01]: and systems that make cannabis businesses
successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, let's open it up for some
questions.
Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Adrian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of good info there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got a question here I think that
should be directed to you, Joji.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do outdoor conditions and geography
impact unit selection and performance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question because
outdoor environments play a big factor in
[SPEAKER_00]: not just determining what style of units
we kind of consider for the job,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also what components we're going to
select for the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this becomes really
important in environments and geographies
[SPEAKER_00]: with extreme weather conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, let's take the Northeast
as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: Northeast, as we know, during winter
times, they can go below freezing,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then during the summers, they can go
above 90, sometimes even up close to the
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to determine, do we have
the right components to actually handle
[SPEAKER_00]: those extreme condition swings and have an
operational units?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you don't have the right
components selected for such swings,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to see a drop in your
performance for the system and then a drop
[SPEAKER_00]: in environmental control for your rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So making sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've even seen units just stop
working, right, when it gets to low
[SPEAKER_02]: ambient temperatures and even very
performance that suffers terribly.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the high side, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure like, as a lot of the
listeners probably know, like keeping the
[SPEAKER_00]: right sort of pressure and temperatures
throughout the systems is extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that becomes very suspect to,
I guess, dropping off during these low
[SPEAKER_00]: ambient and high ambient conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so being able to kind of predict that
and combat that beforehand when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing your unit selection is extremely
important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got another one here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the gotchas you've run
into coming into projects early versus
[SPEAKER_02]: late?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I'll direct that one to
Adrian.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I tried to pepper a couple of them
in there throughout.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot that we run into.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could talk about operational and
maintenance and things like that
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the like, hey, make sure you
change your filters routinely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We find that to be something that happens,
that doesn't happen on a routine basis
[SPEAKER_01]: enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that can really impact your
performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we see more on the design side,
if we're sort of looking at it from that
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective, we see scope gaps really
rampant between different providers of
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think really effectively maybe not
taking advantage of the construction
[SPEAKER_01]: management and general contractor trade
that exists really for that reason,
[SPEAKER_01]: to truly try to eliminate scope gaps on
projects as early as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because those professionals are out there
and exist and would do wonders on helping
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep a project on time and on budget
and avoid unnecessary and very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very costly and challenging change orders
that end up happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see many facilities that don't have
enough power.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can be, it depends on where you're
at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some utilities say, great, we'll have it
for you in a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Others say, great, we'll have it for you
in a couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's your financial situation like
at that particular site or building over
[SPEAKER_01]: those couple of year period that you're
waiting for the utilities to bring you
[SPEAKER_01]: that power?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the other reasons that we
see combined heat and power plant
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities being, combined heat and power
systems being utilized at these types of
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities more often, because you may
have gas available where you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And structural limitations and
deficiencies is another huge one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think we recently had a project,
it was a $6 million project and they found
[SPEAKER_01]: out that they were gonna have to make $2
million of structural upgrades to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the project work and then they
said, well, that's not gonna work for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go find a different building and
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that money was down the drain
upfront.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are just a couple that come to
mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Joe, do you have anything else to add
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think one that really stood out to
me was just facilities that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: utilize their overall square footage,
like their square footage for the building
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they're limited on how much
clearance they have for the units,
[SPEAKER_00]: like alongside the building.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen that kind of come up a bit that
people sometimes overlook.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd also add issues, lots of issues
around sizing the HVAC systems as well
[SPEAKER_02]: around the latent insensible, the reheat,
the supplemental heat, whether or not to
[SPEAKER_02]: use humidification at early stages of
stage flower, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a transition from veg to flower
where the humidity conditions change and
[SPEAKER_02]: you can shock the plants or in early stage
flower, you don't have enough humidity
[SPEAKER_02]: coming off of the plants, enough
evaporation coming off of the plants to
[SPEAKER_02]: give the units sufficient load.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think Adrian and Joe, you guys could
talk more specific about this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but being able to, just accommodating the
life cycle of the plants and going from
[SPEAKER_02]: room to room, there are lots of
considerations that need to be made as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, high level, you need to be able to
provision for humidifiers in your
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering spaces in order to do that VPD
match from veg over to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another one that I neglected to
mention and just thought of was the
[SPEAKER_01]: importance of tight room construction,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that we've talked about here
about environmental control can only be
[SPEAKER_01]: done if you have tight room construction
and we're not losing air into external
[SPEAKER_01]: environments, either through the
construction of the room itself or through
[SPEAKER_01]: the duct work, joining the air handling
unit systems to the room itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, yeah, the assumption with all of
this is that you've got good construction
[SPEAKER_02]: and if you've got infiltrations and
exfiltrations of heat or moisture,
[SPEAKER_02]: or CO2 or whatever else, then the
performance of your room and your facility
[SPEAKER_02]: is gonna suffer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, let's see, another one here related
to the conventional non-integrated stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it possible to get good control of the
environment with mini splits and
[SPEAKER_02]: dehumidifiers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Joji, why don't I toss that one to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man, that's actually a great
question, especially where the current
[SPEAKER_00]: space and how a lot of our current
facilities are set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alone, these units can definitely provide
moderate control to their local
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say local, I mean the square
footage that you usually see on these
[SPEAKER_00]: specification sheets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of think of, you can kind of
think of it like a hemisphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each individual standalone or mini split
is controlling their own hemisphere rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than controlling the room as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inherently, that's where I guess the
lack of performance comes from is that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not truly integrated and they're
controlling for their own local
[SPEAKER_00]: environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas integrated systems, they see the
unit, I mean the room as a whole and are
[SPEAKER_00]: controlling accordingly to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, one thing that I wanna say is a lot
of our customers or customers in the space
[SPEAKER_00]: that have this system already in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say system, I'm talking about like
mini splits and dehumidifiers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is possibility to get that
integrated control after the fact with a
[SPEAKER_00]: controls retrofit, with a more
plan-centric sequence of operation to
[SPEAKER_00]: integrate all those individual units as
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're kind of making that a bunch of
little random split systems, dehumidifiers
[SPEAKER_00]: and integrating them into one whole
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's not as great as a truly
integrated package system or a hydronic
[SPEAKER_00]: system would be, but it's definitely that
next step up between the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I answer that to you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a comment or a question in the
chat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's somewhat tangentially
related to this that it might be good to
[SPEAKER_01]: address, which is how long does the
humidity spike last in that non-integrated
[SPEAKER_01]: system?
[SPEAKER_01]: And were all the other parameters held
constant between the integrated system
[SPEAKER_01]: such that the difference in yield can be
attributed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, first off, the short answer is
yes, we did everything that we possibly
[SPEAKER_01]: could to make those two rooms
side-by-side, really keep that as the only
[SPEAKER_01]: control variable between them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inherently, there may be some other noise
in that, no doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many differences that go on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even on a plan when you design a facility
with eight identical flower rooms,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you go and you build that
facility and you think, I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've built them all identically,
you'll end up with some small changes and
[SPEAKER_01]: differences between all those rooms too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first off, it's just very challenging
to do that in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other piece of it is we would love
to do more truly scientific research and
[SPEAKER_01]: have the ability to be very, very certain
about these types of situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, there's not much money and
propensity for it in the cannabis space
[SPEAKER_01]: presently based on the illegality of it
federally and how the funding sources for
[SPEAKER_01]: universities work that have controlled
environment agriculture and indoor plant
[SPEAKER_01]: environment type programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were at a conference last week where
there's a lot of these folks speaking and
[SPEAKER_01]: presenting research and things,
and it is starting to loosen up little by
[SPEAKER_01]: little.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully we're gonna make good
progress here over the next year or two in
[SPEAKER_01]: that in the hopes of really being able to
do true testing one side, one to the
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in specific to the first part of that
question, that humidity spike lasts for
[SPEAKER_01]: about an hour, typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can be one to two hours is what we
normally see in those situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can definitely answer more detailed
questions on that further offline if you
[SPEAKER_01]: like.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, lots of structural challenges with
growing cannabis, particularly on the
[SPEAKER_02]: federal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 total states now have legalized
recreational adult use for above 21.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're definitely at the critical mass in
this country, and you can see it really
[SPEAKER_01]: internationally as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope that that really starts to open
up money for more research and
[SPEAKER_01]: development.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep, yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: For now, we're all doing as much as we
possibly can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna take this one in the chat I
think is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you run into building department
jurisdictions that push for providing
[SPEAKER_01]: outside air as part of, in this case,
Title 24, which is a California energy
[SPEAKER_01]: code requirement?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do they typically treat the rooms as
process rooms and allow for the 100%
[SPEAKER_01]: recirculation?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this actually is going to be
specifically addressed in the code change
[SPEAKER_01]: that's coming in less than two months.
[SPEAKER_01]: In January, 2023,
[SPEAKER_01]: the CEA in general, indoor plant
environments will become a covered process
[SPEAKER_01]: under California Title 24 energy code,
which I think will be the first time
[SPEAKER_01]: across the country that this process load
will actually be required to be covered in
[SPEAKER_01]: the energy code.
[SPEAKER_01]: And previously up until now, we've just
been calling it a process room and having
[SPEAKER_01]: an exemption for the economizers from the
current code.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with this becoming a covered process,
there are some other stipulations that you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to meet around reusing or utilizing
waste heat and basically trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: minimize the amount of reheating heat
energy that's used of new energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a result of it becoming a covered
process, they're now they're understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: this sort of nuance that goes against the
code, the way California's code is set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is an exemption for
economizers written in to this new code
[SPEAKER_01]: language to allow you to not have to worry
about it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just to kind of add to that age,
the heat requirement or the reheat
[SPEAKER_00]: requirement is 75% of your annual usage
should come from onsite heat recovered
[SPEAKER_00]: methods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and the comment from Jason is great
because there's other potential reasons to
[SPEAKER_01]: use outside air in cultivation spaces,
which his comment was that you can use
[SPEAKER_01]: some outside air to purge ethylene,
which is a gaseous hormone which
[SPEAKER_01]: accumulates in sealed plant environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another place where we'd love to
see more research and development to
[SPEAKER_01]: really help inform the way that these
systems are constructed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the ability to bring in outside
air and we treat all that air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really just more about when should
we do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why should we do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How often should we do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That sort of a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully that helped answer some of those
questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're up on the hour right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our resource page is a page on our website
that we're really proud of.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've dropped a lot of information on what
we've learned over the last five to six
[SPEAKER_02]: years and lots of good resources there to
brush up on both plant related and
[SPEAKER_02]: engineering related material as it relates
to CEA, which by the way, stands for
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled environment agriculture,
if anybody was wondering.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think maybe we should cap it off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right now, but if anybody has any follow
up questions, please feel free to get in
[SPEAKER_02]: touch with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're available anytime.
[SPEAKER_02]: Always love to talk and really appreciate
everybody spending time with us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great to see everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all for the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And see you soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, thanks again everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye guys.
Bye.
