[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a strong enough case,
you don't have to go all the way through
[SPEAKER_00]: trial because you can file some earlier
motions and submit some earlier defense
[SPEAKER_00]: that may be able to avoid going to trial
or you can bring enough evidence to show
[SPEAKER_00]: the other side that they're not going to
win.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can file certain motions to avoid
going to trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get to the place that you can show
them, look guys, if you force me to,
[SPEAKER_00]: the result of this is going to be that you
walk away with an invalid patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to cost us both a lot of money,
but you're going to walk away with an
[SPEAKER_00]: invalid patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, can any one person endure the cost of
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good news, bad news, it's a good news,
bad news thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody is going to be the target of
litigation that's that expensive unless
[SPEAKER_00]: they themselves are creating an economic,
big enough economic target, but if you
[SPEAKER_00]: create a coalition, and that's why I'm so
big on creating, we need to have a mutual
[SPEAKER_00]: defense so that whoever is that first
target has a hell of a lot of support
[SPEAKER_00]: behind them, and that's why this
litigation that's happening in Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: has me troubled because I'm not involved
in it myself, but I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see the whole community coming up
to say, no damn way, no way is this case
[SPEAKER_00]: going to turn out the way it's going to,
it could possibly turn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, you know this one I'm talking
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's United or True.
[SPEAKER_00]: United Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and it's basically a patent that
claims any liquid formulation that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, it's at least 95% of one cannabinoid,
either CBD or THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't even have to be,
it doesn't even have to be pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the bare minimum for FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the bare minimum for FDA standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 95% is like, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the defendant filed an initial
motion to get the case dismissed on the
[SPEAKER_00]: basis that this is a product of nature and
shouldn't be patentable in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: place, and that was thrown out because the
judge in this case considered that that
[SPEAKER_00]: purification took it beyond being a
product of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think they're going to lose on
novelty grounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got to lose on novelty grounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been purifying things for way
before, whatever the date of this patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so, but what I don't see is a
coalition of the entire community standing
[SPEAKER_00]: behind this defendant saying, we're going
to kill this patent dead just for the
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes of showing that there's a
coalition behind defendants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would think so, but maybe not,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I honestly don't think we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's probably only about a couple
dozen of us who know about the case
[SPEAKER_01]: really.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even those like, I know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've made exactly zero posts about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mostly because like I know about it,
but I don't know about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not a patent lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really know what's going on to the
level of detail that you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you sue someone, when you sue someone
for patent infringement, if you win,
[SPEAKER_00]: great, you get some damages.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might also intimidate everyone else
into taking a license.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you lose because of, on the basis
of patent invalidity, your patent is gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't sue anyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't sue anyone again with that,
for that patent, at least as to the claims
[SPEAKER_00]: that get invalidated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it would be if, I mean,
and I, I'm not, I have to, I have to say
[SPEAKER_00]: this carefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not expressing a legal opinion about
that patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't analyzed it as a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm, I'm, I'm echoing the sentiments of
the community that say there's no damn
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to be really clear about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a legal opinion, but what I,
what I am saying is that if, the patent is
[SPEAKER_00]: invalid, the whole community ought to be
standing up to say, let's invalidate that
[SPEAKER_00]: patent now before it gets asserted against
anybody else in the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be a community benefit with it,
with a capital C and a capital B and there
[SPEAKER_00]: ought to be a D in there somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and, and that's, that's the,
that's exactly the kind of coalition that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that ought to exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think any of us knew that we were
getting involved in an agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: industry that has been subsumed by an
information economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were, we were pot farmers and most
of us were pot farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like most of the people who I learned how
to grow weed from did not have internet
[SPEAKER_01]: connection like until the last couple of
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were not an information economy
was not something we had prepared
[SPEAKER_01]: ourselves for.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were worried about cops, the state,
the cost of coming into compliance,
[SPEAKER_01]: thieves.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we were not thinking in terms of like,
okay, how am I going to secure my data?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they going?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are they going to take my IP and
leverage it against me?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was just not in the vocabulary and
the vernacular of a cannabis farmer about
[SPEAKER_01]: five months ago, six months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, exactly.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Perfect.
