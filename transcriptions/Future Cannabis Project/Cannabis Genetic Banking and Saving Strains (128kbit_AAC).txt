[SPEAKER_00]: It made me realize the vulnerability of
what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I was going into the hospital,
I was just like, man, who's going to fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: with my stock?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know the crew is going to water,
but what do they do with my genetic stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Fundamentally, what do you do with all the
material you've worked with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do you do with the stuff that you
spend all these years on?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what made me realize,
whoa, we need to be able to start figuring
[SPEAKER_00]: out how to bank stuff and how to get
people to work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do you expand the circle you're
with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, it's like, are you career?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're not, I don't want to
even talk to you on this level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you don't catch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really catch the amount of work
that went into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's like, I want your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want your shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's not what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not looking for anybody's shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got plenty of my own shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been moving stock for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a problem moving genetic
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have a problem acquiring genetic
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the people that I started out in
breeding and all these different companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that I fed them to, I didn't screw them
when I gave it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, listen, I'm going to give you some
killer shit that's going to let you move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was basically based off I thought
you were a good person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, if I play with you,
I just have to hang out with you for a
[SPEAKER_00]: while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to have lunch with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see how you treat people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see how you treat your workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see how you treat the fucking
waiter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're a dick there,
you're going to be a dick to me,
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight up, everybody's a superstar now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's got a scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's going to do the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't mean shit to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, I've been around money my whole life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were all career criminal black
market guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we made a lot of fucking money when
money was to be made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And throwing it around in big long Ziploc
containers that you were pulling out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the trucks that you had hidden in the
yard, that lets you become immune to cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so money is a tool now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's less disposable money now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not in any kind of economic bad
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I own all my shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm the sole owner of all my
investments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I partnered with Parker and the
guys that you met.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because they have a stunning facility
and they asked me to come in and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, would you be able to be our partner
on this operation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just said, hey, it would allow me to
shut down my other facility, turn it into
[SPEAKER_00]: another form of entity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can combine that as a combined
aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now, because I can hold multiple
permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys can hold multiple permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: I already have all permits in play.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's adjust the permit so that we can
team up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not have redundant shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need to have my own nursery and
then operate your nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just operate your nursery and then
I'll go at it with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Parker is successful from tech
industry in terms of putting together
[SPEAKER_00]: money packages in tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gets into cannabis, but the kid's sharp
and he's a work demon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my other partner is aerospace
engineer from Los Alamos weapons lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a basically Elon Musk where he
can't put Velcro shoes on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he can split an atom with a butter
knife in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a good staff that I
brought in that I've been existingly
[SPEAKER_00]: working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put the new dispensary together at that
new facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a beautiful facility right on
the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a new mega lab going in
for distillate crude production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a whole facility going in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have another processing
manufacturing facility we're building on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ike Ridge we already own too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have all these pieces in play and
it's all happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it lets me play different too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I have opportunities to work with a
lot of people and I turn it down because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you guys are looking at short
term money and what am I going to do next?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, you're going to get paid,
but I'm already paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not broke now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you offering me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's like these people hold the
money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had an offer from the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew Franco, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But Franco flies in and says, hey,
my boss wants you to do seed production
[SPEAKER_00]: for us because we're going to pay you
$100,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started laughing and I'm like,
you know, I got a giant outdoor farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You realize a hundred grand is a single
pull off of debt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you going to make me commit to a
year of work for a fucking hundred K?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, no, you don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hundred K.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I says, I don't think you understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a hundred K in a paint bucket right
here on the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're different guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a little different guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Franco laughed and he ended up
getting a bunch of genetics from me and
[SPEAKER_00]: went back to Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Franco and I maintained a pretty
good friendship.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he would send me a genetic material
from Europe and I'd send it back to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he dies of malaria.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it let me understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked him, why don't you do this in
Africa where you can screw them over?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, we tried, but the Africans
nationalized our operation and screwed us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I said, that's exactly what you
deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I see right now is the
same abusive stuff and everybody's waving
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I go to a lot of these lectures,
people have me come in and they don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: me to talk about cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want me to talk about state of mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tell people, don't mortgage your
house right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't mortgage your house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then have an investor take 52 points
off your dollar to play because that is
[SPEAKER_00]: your margin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all you're going to do is get wage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as you don't achieve it,
they'll cut you out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, you'll be part owner of a company
that you will not get paid on because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to sink the goddamn thing
like a ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to me, I'm just like, this is a
disastrous situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I've been here my whole life,
I have an emotional problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually connected to these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: These aren't cats.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just hustle with, these are cats I lived
with, enrolled with, and did business with
[SPEAKER_00]: and all over the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we come up to LA to meet individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to some of these monster operations
and the cat walking out the door is dudes
[SPEAKER_00]: I already know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like, holy fuck, we already
know each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've trafficked for years together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're cracking up because I didn't
know they had the new operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they wanted to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, Hey, can you bank genetics for
us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you take genetics from us and then
give them back to us in micro form in
[SPEAKER_00]: clonal level so that we can shut down our
nursery operation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can work in these capacities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm like, listen, we'll figure it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the main point of it is to find
out, can you have a workable relationship
[SPEAKER_00]: with other people that are in the same
situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't intend to go anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's trying to retire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm retiring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone said, when are you going to move
from Humboldt?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, never.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other question was,
when are you going to get out of weed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, when I'm dead, when I'm dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter how many times I had to fight a
case, I never gave up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter how much crap I went
through, I never gave up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because fundamentally, I love what I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the people that do it at this
kind of level.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're normal people that are abnormal in
your hunger.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a regular person who's abnormally
driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't have any intention to screw
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I do business people, I'm like,
look, you can vet me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you want to do business,
we can be friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not trying to forge a relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one with my kids and my old lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relationship with me is over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you know me now, check me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check me out in a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the same dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Check me out in five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the same dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still got the same crew for 20 fucking
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how I know it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the same guys I'm rolling with now
are the same guys I was rolling with then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can meet new people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everybody nowadays is so transient.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is very myopic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I only see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I didn't want to work at
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's not real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just makes it almost impossible to
have any success when you're in those
[SPEAKER_00]: situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no one's looking at it as a long-term
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't realize this is global
situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, Humboldt County, I had an ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got access to the governatory office
when all the permitting came on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a kind of neat situation when
Gavin Newsom came to my greenhouse to hang
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he comes to LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: He comes to Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: He comes to my greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they sealed off my whole facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cops came out with guns and
protected us while we had lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the county supervisors were trying
to get in, but they weren't invited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't let them in the gates
because I pretended.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, it's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have the discussion ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it did is it allowed me to work
on all the permitting structures,
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery structures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this, I had my hand in all these
permit pieces so I could try to help
[SPEAKER_00]: create the levels and layers that were
needed for the people in my region to
[SPEAKER_00]: still succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you can't do 1,500 square foot
of canopy, which is what you have
[SPEAKER_00]: available, that means you're not even
allowed to be in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even though we're larger than that,
that's only because we grew from our lower levels.
