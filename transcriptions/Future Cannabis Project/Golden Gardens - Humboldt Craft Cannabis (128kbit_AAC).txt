[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'm here with Jill from Golden
Gardens Farm and we're going to be talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about her farm a bit and checking out her
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, hi Jill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glad to be here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, tell us a little bit about your
background with cannabis and how you got
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, my husband has a degree in
horticulture and landscape design from
[SPEAKER_01]: Michigan State University and he started
growing in college.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we met in 2011 in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: My background is in construction
management and together we realized we
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to get out of the rat race and the
corporate jobs that we're in and we
[SPEAKER_01]: together had the experience to start
cultivating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we started indoors in San Francisco
and the East Bay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And had the opportunity to move up to
Humboldt when legalization came around,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was great.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were a bit more interested in or we
were excited about being outdoors and
[SPEAKER_01]: gardening a plant is awesome, but we were
walking into a concrete building every day
[SPEAKER_01]: still under fake lights with de-hues and
CO2 emitters and air conditioning and so
[SPEAKER_01]: we ourselves wanted to be gardening
outside in the garden and how much more
[SPEAKER_01]: would the plants like that do?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we jumped on the opportunity to come
up here and have been here since.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: What draws you to farming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just the freedom of not being
attached to the corporate jobs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I get that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there something else you like about
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also farming not only cannabis,
but having the ability up here to grow our
[SPEAKER_01]: own food, farm vegetables, work with the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really a soil farmer if you're a
farmer or a gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But working outside and in nature and with
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having hands in the soil, touching the
plants, being active and in it is hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: explain, but it can be very stressful
owning your own business, but it can also
[SPEAKER_01]: be very meditative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just putting on a podcast or music and
just connecting with the plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: figuring out what they need, what they
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, anything unique about your farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it an interest in microclimates,
challenges?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're at about 1,800 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Relatively high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a very small farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: My husband and I and we have one employee
out there full-time, which allows us to be
[SPEAKER_01]: very hands-on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go through and touch every plant
multiple times through its life.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have beds, but we have fabric side
beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we actually do three runs a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do a spring, a summer and a fall run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having the fabric beds allows the beds to
breathe when it's not necessarily hot
[SPEAKER_01]: outside and then you can still water
consistently and it dries out.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the springtime, I used to do some
springtime runs too, like March,
[SPEAKER_00]: April, and they're very challenging with
temperature and moisture levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In April, when the daylight is about 12,
12, that's when we start our first run,
typically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some cultivars do better than others in
the spring, we've found, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are a bit more robust and tend to not
necessarily notice the cold at the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning of their life and then by the
time that they're harvested in June,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's warm and dry outside.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like, I mean, intuitively,
when you say that, I think about more,
[SPEAKER_00]: for lack of a better word, indicatometer,
broadleaf, you know, like Afghan varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: that are just used to the cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like that's true or not?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't noticed that in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't go through a lot of varieties
because of our size.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can't have many cultivars or we don't
have enough material of each, so we can
[SPEAKER_01]: only have a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's a unique challenge for you
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a unique challenge and just keeping
up with the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we still have to grow something
high in THC to have it move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, your options are kind of limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we have found the best is the longer
the flower cycle, the better it does in
[SPEAKER_01]: the spring, probably because it has more
of its life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the later, oh, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the later, by the time it's
flowering, week five, six, seven,
[SPEAKER_00]: eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, you know, the development of those
flowers can rapidly expand and if it's
[SPEAKER_00]: already warmer out, then that's the right
time for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: A shorter strain in the spring is not
good, although we do pick a shorter week
[SPEAKER_01]: strain for our fall run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: A six to seven week strain because now
it's finishing when it's getting cold and
[SPEAKER_01]: the light's decreasing outside more and
more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you feel like there's any other,
like do you have any interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: management practices just regarding,
you know, methodologies you use,
[SPEAKER_00]: like in terms of inputs or?
[SPEAKER_01]: We get our... Say that again?
[SPEAKER_00]: Been working on any developing things?
[SPEAKER_01]: My husband has the horticulture major,
so he kind of, he understands the science
[SPEAKER_01]: of it and that's where I've learned most
of the science of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do get our soil tested and have
amendments made to the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we fight a lot, you know, as a farmer,
like I said before, you're a soil farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it all starts in the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We fight a lot of molds, mildews,
bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of that stuff can be fought if you
treat your soil correctly and they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a place to breed and develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So speaking of your farm and flowers,
let's check out some of these flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You brought two samples for us today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got an apple fritter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, an apple fritter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd think I'd see more of these strains
as I go around.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these, funnily enough, some of these
are first forming, so that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Apple fritter is a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It grows on our property really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it smells good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We used to grow sherbert and those sweet
strains and this grows very similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's just sticky to the touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's already like tacky, like sticky,
sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one came out of our fall run
actually, so we harvested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man, it's got some nice purple hues to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really almost has that apple-y.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost smells like my wife's making
like green apples into a pie or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was, was this dep?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or out?
Well, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dep.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have a full dep farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have the PUC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pineapple upside down cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a shorter life cycle, so it does
good for us in the fall and the cold at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the flower's life makes colors
come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got that pineapple smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's so loud.
[SPEAKER_00]: The turps are so loud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that one is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they ever do any product concentrate
processing with this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you guys just sell flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: We just sell flowers, so I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never know.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's another year ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do you guys sell locally or do
you have products around the state?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we wholesale.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions we've been asking
everyone, if you could change one thing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the industry, whether it's like their
education or regulation, what would that,
[SPEAKER_00]: what would that be?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the biggest thing for me right now
would probably be consumer education and
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I don't think any of us really
understand what this plant fully can do,
[SPEAKER_01]: but just to understand right now it's so
much about THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And personally, coming from indoor,
now moving to outdoor, you see how much
[SPEAKER_01]: more the terpene profile gives the plant
its full potential, full expression,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how much more important that can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how you can have a very low THC plant
that has the terpene profile that speaks
[SPEAKER_01]: to what you need or what you're feeling,
and it can be the best strain you've ever
smelt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even minor cannabinoids, like other
minor cannabinoids.
For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a lot of research that's
going into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a podcast, Kiss Organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you know this guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A while back had an episode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I could remember which one it was,
but it was a scientist lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think they were out in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm probably wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically the study was they did a
blind study where people smoked weed and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were doing high THC weed and
basically, you know, 15, like a 30% THC
[SPEAKER_00]: versus a 15% with minor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And higher terpene levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they showed that consistently people
chose the lower THC weed because it just
[SPEAKER_00]: made them feel better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was better body high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in general well-being, better feeling
of well-being overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we've got a lot of ways to go
with that, but hopefully we can get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And education's key.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should talk more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'd be interested in helping with
figures yourself out.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a big way to do that is what many
people have say is farmer to consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: sales.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you think about the vegetable
industry and how you go to farmers markets
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can talk to the person that grew
what you're buying and you're about to
[SPEAKER_01]: consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if we could have cannabis
farmers markets, that's the best way to
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe not the best way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great way to educate the customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they can now talk to the farmer,
the gardener who grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a great goal to strive for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me think.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one more thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you want to talk about it,
but do you have anything that makes you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to, you know, single out your product
against like a corporate model?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what do you think makes your product
better than, you know, just like mass
[SPEAKER_00]: produced weed?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would think the biggest thing is the
love and care we put out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's me and my husband.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in our front yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one worker and we're all out there
across from each other, looking at the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, caring about what the plants need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Individual needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll go out there to our employee and I'll
be like, I may be the owner, but these
[SPEAKER_01]: ladies are the boss.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they need goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if they have a different
schedule, we cater to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows in the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks for your time today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You too.
