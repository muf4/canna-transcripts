[SPEAKER_09]: We will open it up to the much-awaited Q
&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm speaking not only for myself,
but probably other small businesses who
[SPEAKER_00]: can't get a license because there's no
license available.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm told that I'm having to wait,
so I have to be illegal before they get
[SPEAKER_00]: their act together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I don't see any hope because they
say that sometime in early 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, wait, I'm not waiting for 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and the question is, well,
what's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm saying, what is happening with that
and where's the fight with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're saying about small businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm a small business and it's
becoming successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, where's the hope in that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or not the hope, the reality of it
happening soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the fight about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Battleships don't turn on a dime.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to take a few years to go
through the rulemaking process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Proposition to 2015 was passed 19 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did not provide for lawful commercial
activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took a lot of work to get that
legislation passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to take a little bit longer to
get the nuts and bolts written.
[SPEAKER_02]: A law is usually about 60 pages and then
it turns into four, five, six hundred,
[SPEAKER_02]: seven thousand pages of regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to take a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: The initiative is not going to change
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The initiative is going to have a
timeline, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regulation still takes time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, yeah, there's going to
be a delay.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least there's light at the end of the
tunnel now.
[SPEAKER_02]: At least there's a tunnel now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It took 19 years to get here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need to do it all at once.
[SPEAKER_02]: How are we fighting for the small
businesses?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, our sponsored legislation
this year was a cultivation bill to create
[SPEAKER_02]: a new license type for subsistence
farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We lower tax rates, segmented marketplace
so that there is independent opportunity
[SPEAKER_02]: in each segment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have a long list of
demonstrable commitment to small business
[SPEAKER_02]: owners.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it will be undermined,
frankly.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys, too, can follow.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like Nathan to chime in here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just real quick.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you can do while you're waiting is
get involved.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the local governments are where
you need to be right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is the waiting game.
[SPEAKER_06]: And because a solid ordinance takes about
18 months to work at your local
[SPEAKER_06]: government.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so while you are waiting, you are
operating a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the majority of both our members
still operate in the gray and black market
[SPEAKER_06]: because they just don't have the options.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so what you need to do is to reach out
to your local governments now and start
[SPEAKER_06]: working with them to help them craft these
ordinances.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when 2018 comes around, you have your
local approval to operate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you can just jump in and grab
your your state license after that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And certainly being here, being part of
the conversation is a big part of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just wanted to point, if you don't know
Jackie McGowan, I'm going to call you out,
[SPEAKER_11]: Jackie, sitting behind you.
[SPEAKER_11]: She has a really great group on Facebook
about California and what's going on
[SPEAKER_11]: locally.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm just saying, if you want to hook
into other people in your area that may be
[SPEAKER_11]: also working on it so you can strategize
together, it's just a great way to find
[SPEAKER_11]: all the updates.
[SPEAKER_11]: And she does a great job with it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So check that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey, guys, my my question is based on a
conversation I've had with each and every
[SPEAKER_07]: one of you for the last year plus.
[SPEAKER_07]: Assuming this does pass, what are the
actual steps that will be taken for that
[SPEAKER_07]: hard work to make sure that the
legislators and the regulators do not
[SPEAKER_07]: screw this up and that only prevent only
10 percent of existing operators from
[SPEAKER_07]: converting into the new system in the new
world long term?
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say being involved now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, that's key.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, they are there.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the regulatory agencies are having
scoping meetings up and down the state
[SPEAKER_06]: talking to the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, both of our groups have sent out
announcements to our own membership to get
[SPEAKER_06]: them involved, to attend those hearings,
to be engaged with the regulators,
[SPEAKER_06]: because one thing that is different with
what's going on right now, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: someone has I've been in working on local
cannabis policy for about six years and
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never been in a place before where
I've had regulators so willing to work
[SPEAKER_06]: with us where they want to know how how
how we operate.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are begging us for for white papers.
[SPEAKER_06]: They are begging us for data because they
are come to us and have been honest and
[SPEAKER_06]: said, we don't know how this works.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have to be diligent in engaging
our local regulators consistently with
[SPEAKER_06]: credible members so that they write the
best rules possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to point to some specific
policy steps that we will need to take if
[SPEAKER_02]: this is successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: First and foremost, California is an
export marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are overproducing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do not need an unlimited scale type
five license.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact that that is in the proposition
in and of itself shows a disconnect from
[SPEAKER_02]: reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to be constraining and reducing
our productivity if and until export sales
[SPEAKER_02]: are available.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not the type five needs to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, we need to restore market
segmentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to protect against conglomerate
ownership that can dominate entire supply
[SPEAKER_02]: chains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Current law provides those protections.
[SPEAKER_02]: The proposition removes them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are specific policy changes that we
need to make in order to ensure that the
[SPEAKER_02]: marketplace creates enough opportunity for
licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thirdly, I think the whole proposition 64
is skewed a bit larger than it needs to
[SPEAKER_02]: be.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cottage cultivation bill that we
introduced had a cap at 2500 square feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's real life.
[SPEAKER_02]: 10,000 square feet was the number that the
growers picked as a small grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: not a cottage grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole thing is sort of pushed bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a bigger marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see some growth, but not the type of
growth in the market that's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: required to keep everybody on a path
toward being a business owner,
[SPEAKER_02]: not a criminal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've got some real work to do.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, from our perspective, we're looking
at vulnerabilities around the social
[SPEAKER_11]: justice.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we need to make sure that we protect
the rights of people with drug felonies to
[SPEAKER_11]: get licenses.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to make sure that we protect some
of the other reductions we've done in
[SPEAKER_11]: penalties if the legislature decides that
they want to try to take that away.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we need to just be very clear what our
vulnerabilities are.
[SPEAKER_11]: And due diligence.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the hardest thing to say ever.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think I've ever said that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Due diligence.
[SPEAKER_11]: To make sure that we protect what we work
really hard to put in there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're in Sacramento now, but we're going
to have to be there even more than we are
[SPEAKER_11]: now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And not just us and the people that work
in the policy world, but the people that
[SPEAKER_11]: are now part of a legal industry are also
going to have to show up continuously and
[SPEAKER_11]: advocate for themselves as well.
[SPEAKER_16]: Hello, good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_16]: My name is Dionysus Hernandez.
[SPEAKER_16]: And from the talk, I've heard that there's
a message that there is no urgency,
[SPEAKER_16]: that we're overproducing marijuana.
[SPEAKER_16]: But in the state of California,
there are 4,800 barriers to people with a
[SPEAKER_16]: criminal record, even people with
misdemeanors.
[SPEAKER_16]: So even people getting misdemeanors today
can't get employment, can't do a lot of
[SPEAKER_16]: things, can't get money for education.
[SPEAKER_16]: So one thing, if you can talk about this,
Amanda, is the urgency around getting
[SPEAKER_16]: people that are incarcerated criminals.
[SPEAKER_16]: Right now there is a handful of people
that are in prison, not too big,
[SPEAKER_16]: but thousands of people are currently in
our county jails.
[SPEAKER_16]: So can you speak to the urgency on that?
[SPEAKER_16]: Because people's lives are at stake.
[SPEAKER_16]: And every day that goes by that we don't
do something, that's another day that
[SPEAKER_16]: someone has to be in jail, in prison.
[SPEAKER_16]: And that's another day that your taxes go
to pay for that.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I think you bring up a good point.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's obviously the social justice
impact, but there's a financial impact
[SPEAKER_11]: too.
[SPEAKER_11]: It costs a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_11]: To jail people, a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so you're right, it's not that 50% of
the prison population in California is in
[SPEAKER_11]: there for marijuana, but even if it's just
a small percent, that's still thousands of
[SPEAKER_11]: people because we have a very big
population.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if Prop 64 passes, the day after it
passes, people who are in jail for things
[SPEAKER_11]: that are no longer arrestable offenses
will be able to petition to get out.
[SPEAKER_11]: People will be able to petition to get
their records reduced and get their
[SPEAKER_11]: sentences reduced.
[SPEAKER_11]: They'll be able to apply to get their
records expunged.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's no time limit on this.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just want to mention to those of you
that are familiar with Prop 47,
[SPEAKER_11]: there was a three year time limit for you
to do this activity.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's no time limit.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then one other thing about the
expungement that I think is important,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's a nuance that I didn't even really
recognize the importance of until a little
[SPEAKER_11]: while ago, was that the burden is on the
state to prove that what you were doing
[SPEAKER_11]: was illegal at the time you were doing it,
not on you.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what this means is that if you were
arrested, say, 10 years ago for growing 10
[SPEAKER_11]: plants, and that's felony cultivation
right now in California.
[SPEAKER_11]: Growing marijuana is a felony.
[SPEAKER_11]: Then it says felony cultivation on your
record.
[SPEAKER_11]: When you go to get that expunged,
the state has to prove that you had more
[SPEAKER_11]: than six plants at the time of that
arrest.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't have to prove that you had less
than six plants.
[SPEAKER_11]: And given that six plants is legal,
chances are you're going to get that
[SPEAKER_11]: expunged.
[SPEAKER_11]: And something we're seeing in real time
right now are that DAs are putting their
[SPEAKER_11]: cases off until after November 8.
[SPEAKER_11]: If what the person's being charged for
will no longer be a crime because they
[SPEAKER_11]: don't want to take the time and energy of
the courts to process the case.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it hasn't even passed, and it's already
having an impact in terms of criminal
[SPEAKER_11]: justice reform.
[SPEAKER_16]: I want to add one more statistic.
[SPEAKER_16]: Sorry, I just want to add one more
statistic.
[SPEAKER_16]: In the state of California, there's about
a million people that have marijuana
[SPEAKER_16]: offenses on their record from previous
offenses.
[SPEAKER_16]: So there's people incarcerated,
but there's currently people that are
[SPEAKER_16]: barred from an education and employment
because of previous marijuana offenses.
[SPEAKER_15]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_15]: My name is Morgan Humphrey.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have a question for the gentleman in the
middle, because I'm sorry I don't know
[SPEAKER_15]: your name.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I was just wondering, do the people
who are still facing misdemeanor charges
[SPEAKER_15]: and still facing criminalization,
do they not matter?
[SPEAKER_15]: Or are their needs not as important?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because myself, as a black woman,
I don't have a medical marijuana card.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't have a medical need for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I like to use marijuana
recreationally.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I still risk going to jail.
[SPEAKER_15]: I still risk losing time from work and
possibly losing my job if I get arrested
[SPEAKER_15]: for it.
[SPEAKER_15]: So do my people and my friends,
do we not matter?
[SPEAKER_15]: Because we're not a small business
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're just people who want to use
recreationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let me explain who my members are.
[SPEAKER_02]: My members, 30% of our board are people of
color.
[SPEAKER_02]: 40% of our board have been arrested.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the very community that is
currently in jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the very community that is
currently being impacted
[SPEAKER_02]: disproportionately.
[SPEAKER_02]: This isn't an us and you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the same community here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact of the matter is we're allowed to
have differences of opinion and
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're allowed to view the potential
outcomes differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course we matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a rec card either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a medical need.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm exactly where you are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been arrested.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've dealt with this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So have a vast majority of my friends and
family.
[SPEAKER_02]: Believe it or not, this isn't something
that breaks cleanly along race lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that breaks cleanly
along any of these lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Proposition 64 has a lot in it that is not
what Amanda is describing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big up to DPA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a great job on the social justice
issues and the criminal justice issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: The unfortunate reality is that the
economic justice component was overlooked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Justice is a whole concept.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion it's indivisible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, of course you matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, of course we matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot in this thing and we can
have a conversation about how to clean it
[SPEAKER_02]: up afterwards if it passes and how to make
sure that we achieve these goals if it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just wanted to clarify that when I speak
about me being, it's not because,
[SPEAKER_15]: not only because I'm a black woman,
but also because I'm not in the industry.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have no stake in the economic impact of
it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't plan to ever be in the industry,
but I do want to have my freedom
[SPEAKER_15]: regardless of whether I use it or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do the small business owners not
matter?
[SPEAKER_02]: Should the 20,000 small business owners
who won't be licensed?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never said that consumers didn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_10]: So my question really actually,
it kind of relates to more or less the way
[SPEAKER_10]: that I view this and I'm still very kind
of neutral on my position with the
[SPEAKER_10]: initiative on a lot of different
fundamental levels.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I feel like we're in such a time of
unknowns in California and there's
[SPEAKER_10]: somebody I've been operating every single
day in a world that's really evolved a
[SPEAKER_10]: lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're still at a point where we're
waiting on a thousand pages of regulations
[SPEAKER_10]: from the Bureau of Cannabis that we do not
know, I don't know whether I'm going to
[SPEAKER_10]: support or they could be very overreaching
in a way that we really need to make a
[SPEAKER_10]: change.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's almost like if we're on a boat
and we've got one rescue boat to like get
[SPEAKER_10]: off, to get to the island.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're just selling it out before we
know if we have the gas to get to the
[SPEAKER_10]: island.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the initiative process being that
rescue boat, if these thousand pages,
[SPEAKER_10]: because MRSA was not perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there is language within the current
law that looks to be like it could be
[SPEAKER_10]: overreaching and overreaching on a level
that's never been put to any other
[SPEAKER_10]: industry on the planet Earth.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we really need to use the people's law
for its intentions and make sure to
[SPEAKER_10]: preserve that point.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if we do get to that position,
it's going to be real difficult to
[SPEAKER_10]: recreate that rescue boat with everybody
that would buy in and would create the
[SPEAKER_10]: campaign and the funding already bought in
to 64.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what is the option if that is our
scenario?
[SPEAKER_02]: We could have probably let this play out
and seen what things looked like before
[SPEAKER_02]: using this tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very difficult tool to recreate
once it's used.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's passed in the legislature is
still subject to judicial review.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can still be dealt with in the courts.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can still challenge the basic 215
rights, arguably rights, that were
[SPEAKER_02]: granted.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's certainly, I think, fair to say that
yes on adult use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone here is yes on adult use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Timing and specifics matter.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I just want to add, I think one of
the things that we're really going to get
[SPEAKER_11]: to help us make sure that we do create the
image we want to see is that once we're
[SPEAKER_11]: legal, and we were just talking about this
during lunch, is that we're going to have
[SPEAKER_11]: allies that we've never had before.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to have the anti-GMO people
and the fair trade people and the small
[SPEAKER_11]: business people and the herbal medicine
people and the folks that have been
[SPEAKER_11]: circling around us with a lot of interest
for a while, but a lot haven't taken the
[SPEAKER_11]: plunge because we were still doing
something that was illegal.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I think the ability to go and lobby
someone that works to preserve heirloom
[SPEAKER_11]: seeds for tomatoes and say, hey,
we want to do the same for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now it's legal here that they're going
to be like, OK, yeah, we'll work with you.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're already seeing that with
criminal justice organizations that do
[SPEAKER_11]: reentry work, like Planning Justice,
that helps folks who are getting out of
[SPEAKER_11]: San Quentin get jobs in urban farming.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're like, yes, let's work with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's make cannabis part of what we're
doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're going to gain allies.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not going to have to work in so much
isolation anymore.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that that's really going to
open up opportunities for innovation and
[SPEAKER_11]: for creating this image.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because there's a lot of folks out there
that care about this stuff as it relates
[SPEAKER_11]: to other products.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we haven't been able to fully engage
with them yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I understand the criminal justice
components of ALMA.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my question is really more industry
related.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear not enough about the progress that
the Medical Cannabis Regulation Safety Act
[SPEAKER_01]: made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's almost like it kind of goes on
the wayside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can we talk about not pitting them one
against the other?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're both progress.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the main difference in terms of
how it affects industry, small business?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is your ideal vision for the
industry related to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is sort of at the core of our issue,
full disclosure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lauren is one of our board members.
[SPEAKER_02]: So she's been party to this conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a few key distinctions between
current state law to regulate the medical
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry and the industry
regulations that are proposed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to preface my quick synopsis of
them by saying nobody here is arguing with
[SPEAKER_02]: the social and criminal justice pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take a minute to ask why the differences
that I'm about to point out exist and what
[SPEAKER_02]: the outcomes of them will be.
[SPEAKER_02]: First and foremost, the current state law
for medical production is limited
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is limited at one acre per license.
[SPEAKER_02]: The regulators are working on what the
overall cap on cultivation will be.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a finite marketplace here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a finite number of acres that
will produce every gram that we need.
[SPEAKER_02]: The proposition opens the floodgate to
much larger consolidated enterprise.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we are talking about industrial hemp,
if we are talking about export markets,
[SPEAKER_02]: if we are talking about a marketplace that
we don't have, sure, we're going to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: different conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now we have to deal with an
in-state market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those business owners, those people
that are going to jail, the three text
[SPEAKER_02]: messages I've got today of folks that are
in handcuffs right now, it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily going to change for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there may not be room to
participate in the regulated marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, the market segmentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently you have to sort of choose one
silo out of five within the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's disruptive to a lot of current
businesses, but it does ensure that there
[SPEAKER_02]: are more licensed opportunities for more
individual businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, those are more humans that won't be
criminals anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very human issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: The social and criminal justice stuff,
again, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But why do the industry regs look
different?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that you've hit the nail spot
on the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were business owners that were not
satisfied who felt like they had lost in
[SPEAKER_02]: the legislature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this initiative is unfortunately in
part being used as a tool to repeal those
[SPEAKER_02]: protections.
[SPEAKER_11]: Do you want to go first?
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah, I just want to say that the licenses
available in Prop 64 don't replace the
[SPEAKER_11]: licenses available in MCRSA.
[SPEAKER_11]: So MCRSA sets out a licensing structure.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're not licensed under MCRSA,
you're illegal.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right now the penalty for growing in
California is a felony.
[SPEAKER_11]: If Prop 64 passes, it becomes a
misdemeanor.
[SPEAKER_11]: And a whole new set of licenses are
available in addition to the licenses
[SPEAKER_11]: given under MCRSA.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now, Prop 64 was actually conceived before
MCRSA was even passed.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we sat on it to wait until the last
minute so that we could model as many of
[SPEAKER_11]: the license categories after MCRSA with
the same regulating bodies in order to
[SPEAKER_11]: make it as seamless as possible,
with of course adding the microbusiness
[SPEAKER_11]: license at the bottom, which is under
10,000 square feet, vertical integration
[SPEAKER_11]: under one license, and the tier five,
which comes online potentially in 2023 if
[SPEAKER_11]: it's determined that at that time we need
more cannabis produced in the state of
[SPEAKER_11]: California.
[SPEAKER_11]: I would say that another difference is the
absence of the mandatory distributor that
[SPEAKER_11]: is in MCRSA, but is not in Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now you may call that being able to more
easily vertically integrate.
[SPEAKER_11]: It is definitely a difference from how we
regulate alcohol, but it does allow people
[SPEAKER_11]: to be their own distributor.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I would say that that's also a
difference.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we do have the ability to add license
types.
[SPEAKER_11]: So for example, if cottage cultivation
passes and that becomes a license type,
[SPEAKER_11]: we would love to see that added to Prop 64
licenses.
[SPEAKER_11]: In fact, in the city of Oakland,
we have that as a rider, that if that gets
[SPEAKER_11]: passed, we wanna see that added into what
the city of Oakland is doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: So absolutely, I think that they were
meant to be companions to each other,
[SPEAKER_11]: but really to open it up to people to have
more options in terms of the type of
[SPEAKER_11]: businesses that they want to have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead, Nate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I have a few thoughts on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: First of all, reality is the concept of we
just passed this last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Shouldn't we let this play out first?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's sort of a false argument because the
reality is the only reason we got medical
[SPEAKER_06]: regs passed last year was because they
knew the initiative was coming and the
[SPEAKER_06]: state wanted a chance to actually have a
say in how that would look.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember in the governor's office when
they were pushing back on me and saying
[SPEAKER_06]: they were gonna veto the bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were gonna veto the whole bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: The staff was recommending a veto.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, why?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're gonna have an initiative last year.
[SPEAKER_06]: I looked at the governor's chief deputy
and I said, do you want an option in how
[SPEAKER_06]: that initiative looks?
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you just gonna allow the, are you
gonna allow the initiative drafters to
[SPEAKER_06]: draft their own bill and make it look how
they like?
[SPEAKER_06]: Or does the state wanna have a say in it?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's what we got.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was one of the big reasons why the
governor signed it last year and why we
[SPEAKER_06]: got so many votes to pass it, because they
knew the initiative was coming in the
[SPEAKER_06]: first place.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other reality is the protections in
that bill weren't really protections.
[SPEAKER_06]: The local governments didn't wanna allow
vertical integration, not because they
[SPEAKER_06]: cared about small businesses, but because
they didn't want the industry to have any
[SPEAKER_06]: sort of influence.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they told that to us, to our face.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't want you guys to have any sort of
influence in government.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had the California police chief lobbyist
look at me and say, we don't want you to
[SPEAKER_06]: become as big and strong as the tribes
are.
[SPEAKER_06]: We wanna keep you small so we can keep you
in control.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we did fight to get those things
taken out.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also did fight to have mandatory
distribution, which was a corporate
[SPEAKER_06]: interest, pushed into it at $20,000 a
month in lobbying.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's reality.
[SPEAKER_06]: We fought to get that taken out,
cuz we thought that small farmers should
[SPEAKER_06]: have the ability to go direct to market if
they wanted to.
[SPEAKER_06]: They shouldn't be forced to use
distribution company.
[SPEAKER_06]: We luckily got amendments added in which
allowed small farmers to have their own
[SPEAKER_06]: contracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: They still have to use part of the
distribution for something, but most of
[SPEAKER_06]: our small businesses don't support that
concept.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they wanna be able to go direct to
market if they have that option.
[SPEAKER_06]: The reason we supported it was cuz the
mandate to use a distribution company was
[SPEAKER_06]: taken out.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's why we supported it in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm gonna hold my nose and vote for this.
[SPEAKER_17]: Even though I think that there's so much
onerous and there's so many things that go
[SPEAKER_17]: on between the testing and the
transportation and all the other people
[SPEAKER_17]: that are involved are getting their
fingers in their pie that it's gonna keep
[SPEAKER_17]: a black market alive.
[SPEAKER_17]: So how are you gonna deal with that?
[SPEAKER_17]: Cuz we wanna get rid of the cartels.
[SPEAKER_17]: We wanna get rid of the murdering in the
world.
[SPEAKER_17]: We wanna set this as a precipice where we
have come to the top and we're downhill
[SPEAKER_17]: and going all the way.
[SPEAKER_17]: But it's so onerous.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's not like alcohol.
[SPEAKER_17]: And it should be closer to alcohol because
alcohol is so much more deadly.
[SPEAKER_17]: It just doesn't make sense for me.
[SPEAKER_17]: The other thing is the fact that it seems
like it's throwing medical cannabis under
[SPEAKER_17]: the bus.
[SPEAKER_17]: And to me that is the most important
thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I don't understand why we don't keep
Prop 215 in place while doing this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll answer that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So first of all, I wanna explain about
Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_11]: So Prop 215 basically says if you get
caught with marijuana and taken to court,
[SPEAKER_11]: you can use your doctor's note as an
excuse.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's the only right it gives.
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't give the right to have
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_11]: It doesn't give the right to have an
industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: It just gives you an immunity defense in
court, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: Prop 215 is preserving that right is part
of the intents and purposes of Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_11]: Meaning that if everything else falls to
shit, patients will still have the right
[SPEAKER_11]: to use that excuse in court if they have a
doctor's recommendation.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that will not change.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that is what Prop 215 says.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now as was mentioned before, Prop 64 is
designed to create a market for
[SPEAKER_11]: non-medical adult use.
[SPEAKER_11]: Meaning individuals that like to use
cannabis and are adults, but are not
[SPEAKER_11]: medical patients.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we don't think those people should go
to jail.
[SPEAKER_11]: We think that they should have access to
safe product.
[SPEAKER_11]: We think they should have places to use
those products.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we think that that entails ensuring
that they have an industry to serve them.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I will 110% admit, like I did before,
that we are way over-regulating cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: as compared to other products because of
fear around cannabis that we will see
[SPEAKER_11]: dissipate once the public gets more used
to having it in society, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're definitely gonna see that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, well patients still have their
rights.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean if you need to have more than an
ounce on you in your person, you can still
[SPEAKER_11]: be a patient.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can still have the same condition you
had last year.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can still go to the same doctor.
[SPEAKER_11]: None of that's changed.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're either Prop 64 or MCRSA.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're somebody that needs to grow more
than six plants, you can be a patient.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if your locality allows for that,
you can still do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're really trying to open up access for
individuals.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's nothing in Prop 64 that's gonna
negatively impact patients.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gonna give them more options.
[SPEAKER_11]: And there's nothing that prevents adult
use stores from charging patients five
[SPEAKER_11]: cents for a gram of weed.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean that's completely legal.
[SPEAKER_11]: So as these charity programs are gonna
have a chance to evolve, they're gonna
[SPEAKER_11]: have a chance to even be more
philanthropic and community-based,
[SPEAKER_11]: and their options are gonna increase.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's really what we're trying to
do while still preserving the medical
[SPEAKER_11]: program as much as we can, but MCRSA is
gonna go ahead and change that anyway.
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, and then the last thing I'll say is
this is also California.
[SPEAKER_11]: We over-regulate everything.
[SPEAKER_11]: Even things we think are completely safe
and benign and wonderful, we have way too
[SPEAKER_11]: many regulations on.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mean that's something to think about
when you're getting into business in
[SPEAKER_11]: California.
[SPEAKER_11]: Whether you're gonna be in a cannabis
business, or whether you're gonna be in a
[SPEAKER_11]: solar business, or whether you're gonna be
in a cookie business, you're gonna have to
[SPEAKER_11]: go through more regulations and hoops in
this state than probably any other state
[SPEAKER_11]: in this country.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so again, that's the nature of doing
business in California, and that's the
[SPEAKER_11]: nature of doing business with a product
where there's a lot of stigma.
[SPEAKER_11]: We won't probably change the
over-regulation thing, but hopefully we'll
[SPEAKER_11]: change the stigma thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, I just wanna follow up between
MCRSA, or what are they calling it?
[SPEAKER_17]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_17]: It just seems like it's handing off the
ball to the pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_17]: Because of the restraints on this,
it just seems like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_17]: do you have any comments about that?
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I mean, a lot of things seem a
certain way, and a lot of us have feelings
[SPEAKER_11]: about things because we don't like big
pharma, and we don't like big alcohol,
[SPEAKER_11]: and we don't like big tobacco.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have values, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: And we see that as mass production.
[SPEAKER_11]: We see it as making things generic.
[SPEAKER_11]: We see it as giving jobs to the wrong
people, putting things in the wrong
[SPEAKER_11]: places.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a value that we have as the
cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I'm trusting that because you're up
here asking this very question,
[SPEAKER_11]: that when it comes to deciding what we
want the landscape to look like,
[SPEAKER_11]: and what we're gonna advocate for,
and the policies we're gonna advocate for,
[SPEAKER_11]: the businesses that we're gonna support,
where are we gonna put our cannabis buying
[SPEAKER_11]: money?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's gonna be driven by our culture.
[SPEAKER_11]: And if we as a culture reject the idea
that we want something that's mass
[SPEAKER_11]: produced and stamped and shipped out to
market by somebody that's getting no wage
[SPEAKER_11]: and is undocumented and getting taken
advantage of, we won't buy those things,
[SPEAKER_11]: right?
[SPEAKER_11]: We have control over this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I wanna go back really quick to
something Steve D'Angelo said during his
[SPEAKER_11]: opening keynote, which is that we,
now see if I can get this right,
[SPEAKER_11]: we need to cannabinize corporations more
than we corporatize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the two things are going to be together
because we live in America.
[SPEAKER_11]: But we have an opportunity to change the
way we do corporations by who we are as a
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis culture, rather than letting
corporations take us over and turn us into
[SPEAKER_11]: people we know we aren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll just say we absolutely do and those
provisions are in current state law.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanna quickly speak to the fact
that mandatory distribution is a
[SPEAKER_02]: protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: For small businesses, I need to clear the
record up on this because the
[SPEAKER_02]: misinformation is pervasive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without a control point in the supply
chain, audits are too inefficient for
[SPEAKER_02]: regulators to complete.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 2014 proposal that we opposed,
that the industry association supported
[SPEAKER_02]: had language that said there will be a
limit on the number of licenses issued,
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent with so many other states that
have brought regulatory frameworks online
[SPEAKER_02]: in the last few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: In order to get to the point where we
started with an unlimited number of
[SPEAKER_02]: licenses that would be whittled down over
time, it was necessary to impose a control
[SPEAKER_02]: point in the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we love it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's better than an arbitrary limit on
the number of licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting with a small number and trying to
expand it over time, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to bring cannabis culture to
the corporate world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love if we had a small business
global economy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to happen if we start with
a finite number of licenses because those
[SPEAKER_02]: will be owned, consumed, regulatory
capture will take place and it will be
[SPEAKER_02]: just like any other marketplace that we're
dealing with where small businesses can't
[SPEAKER_02]: break in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it or not, it was a small business
protection because it allowed us to move
[SPEAKER_02]: the needle to an unlimited license
starting point.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, Nate, I want you to go ahead and
chime in on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I gotta be honest.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not an accurate portrayal of what
happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That language was taken out at your
request and you still stayed opposed to
[SPEAKER_06]: the bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said you would support it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That language was taken out.
[SPEAKER_06]: You still stayed opposed to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never saw the language that removed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never put it, can show you the past public
version of the bill.
[SPEAKER_06]: The author of that bill, she's right
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's also my lobbyist now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sure she would have some opinions on
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The reality is those caps are put on
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Originally that language was put in for
caps.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were working on that bill before that
was put on because a farmer at a
[SPEAKER_06]: stakeholder meeting bragged next to the
California Narcotics Officer's lobbyist,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's 30,000 farmers in the Emerald
Triangle alone.
[SPEAKER_06]: He had a heart attack and shifted language
the next day trying to say there could be
[SPEAKER_06]: some sort of cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: No hard numbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We were opposed to that work to get it
taken out.
[SPEAKER_06]: The bill died before the final version of
that language could be put in and that's
[SPEAKER_06]: the reality.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay, so clearly there's a bunch of
history behind this and that's why there's
[SPEAKER_09]: four more to this back in the green room
when I was still trying to figure out what
[SPEAKER_09]: an ounce was.
[SPEAKER_09]: You guys are passionate.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's just to move on to the next
question.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know a lot of people in jail for
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_12]: Not necessarily the use of it though,
not adult use.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm wondering how many people,
for example, in 2016 are actually going to
[SPEAKER_12]: jail for using it because when I talk
about this issue with my friends,
[SPEAKER_12]: that's what comes up.
[SPEAKER_12]: Who's actually going to jail right now for
smoking a joint?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because I see people smoking that all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_11]: Depending on where you live and who you
are, your risks about getting in trouble
[SPEAKER_11]: for casual use vary greatly.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now I think one of the biggest risks in
terms of just use, because use is
[SPEAKER_11]: primarily a ticket in most cases,
is the ability of police to approach
[SPEAKER_11]: uncertainty.
[SPEAKER_11]: And ask for your ID and run that ID.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're two people sitting there
smoking a joint, one has a warrant and one
[SPEAKER_11]: doesn't, and the odor of marijuana makes
the cop approach and ask for ID and runs
[SPEAKER_11]: the ID, the person with the warrant is
going to be picked up for that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, it may not be marijuana
possession they're getting picked up for,
[SPEAKER_11]: but the marijuana possession in use was a
catalyst for that involvement with the
[SPEAKER_11]: criminal justice system.
[SPEAKER_11]: And then the second thing I'll say about
that is the difference between possession
[SPEAKER_11]: with intent to sell, because this is also
important.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when a cop picks somebody up and they
have marijuana on them, it's up to the cop
[SPEAKER_11]: to decide if they were just possessing
that marijuana or if they were going to go
[SPEAKER_11]: do something else with that marijuana
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's completely subjective.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so as you can imagine, a lot of the
times the things cops will use to say it
[SPEAKER_11]: was possession with intent to sell,
or you have two different strains on you,
[SPEAKER_11]: or you have an empty baggie, or you have a
bunch of cash on you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now if this was handed out equally among
racial lines, then we might say,
[SPEAKER_11]: well, this is just a flaw in the law and
it should be more subjective.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the fact is, is that blacks are five
times more likely to get that felony,
[SPEAKER_11]: which is what possession with intent is,
no matter how much you have, even two
[SPEAKER_11]: grams, possession with intent is a felony,
and just possession, which is a ticket.
[SPEAKER_11]: So two people with the same behavior,
both with quantities that would be legal
[SPEAKER_11]: under Prop 64 if they're adults,
one would get a ticket and one would get a
[SPEAKER_11]: felony.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we talk about possession,
and use not necessarily being the risk.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's what happens once someone comes and
stops you and starts investigating you for
[SPEAKER_11]: that use that ends up ending up in an
arrest or something more serious than a
[SPEAKER_11]: ticket.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's kind of that catalyst,
that entry point for police.
[SPEAKER_12]: So currently that's what I thought.
[SPEAKER_12]: People do just get a ticket if they're
caught.
[SPEAKER_11]: With nothing else.
[SPEAKER_11]: So if you're caught and you get charged
with possession, so let's say the cop
[SPEAKER_11]: decides that you weren't trying to sell
what you had, so you get a ticket.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's probably the least that happens to
you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Now if you can't pay that ticket,
then you could get a warrant, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So something else may happen to you.
[SPEAKER_11]: But what we're saying is that for other
people, it's usually not as simple as just
[SPEAKER_11]: getting a ticket.
[SPEAKER_11]: For other folks, it's usually a more
invasive process that includes running
[SPEAKER_11]: IDs, sometimes being detained,
being searched, anything else that's in
[SPEAKER_11]: your pockets is being counted against you.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's really about taking marijuana away
as a tool for cops to go after people for
[SPEAKER_11]: other things.
[SPEAKER_11]: To stop a group of young men of color and
ask them what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: Empty your pocket, show me your ID.
[SPEAKER_11]: That tool is what we're trying to take
away.
[SPEAKER_11]: And as Nate mentioned, the cops aren't
very happy about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that we talk about economics
being a reason for law enforcement
[SPEAKER_11]: opposition, but I think this is it.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it's because they love that tool,
and it's really easy to just go around a
[SPEAKER_11]: vulnerable community, smell weed,
and just point to people and ask them to
[SPEAKER_11]: give you their license.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they don't want to get away with
that tool because you approach a cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: consumer, they're docile, they're unlikely
to be armed, and they're unlikely to fight
[SPEAKER_11]: back.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so they're using that against us in
order to go after certain communities.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's where the trouble in what we
currently have still exists.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the simple answer is zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero people are currently incarcerated for
possession or use in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was released very recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The systemic racism in our society isn't
going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Public consumption is still a ticket to
harass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still not going to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if we were convinced that this
would address those issues, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I don't want to put Nina on the
spot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nina is one of our members who speaks very
passionately about how the specific
[SPEAKER_02]: provisions in this initiative are not
actually going to deal with these systemic
[SPEAKER_02]: racial disparities.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just isn't going to change that
underlying situation, especially for folks
[SPEAKER_02]: that are still possessing with intent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, that community of small business
owners that is so much at the crux of this
[SPEAKER_02]: issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the liberalization of policies
that we have seen, we really need to deal
[SPEAKER_02]: with reality, with the actual people that
are in jail cells, not with a common
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding that unfortunately doesn't
mesh with reality.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just real quick, when I went to the
academy, it still happens to this day,
[SPEAKER_06]: they actually trained you on how to arrest
people for possession for sale when they
[SPEAKER_06]: only had a joint on them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was trained by the narcotics sergeant at
Sacramento County.
[SPEAKER_06]: What you do is you take the weed over
here, you find the extra cash in their
[SPEAKER_06]: pocket here, see if you can find baggies
over here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that training goes on to this day.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like it ended in 2002 when I went
to the academy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's why you don't see a lot of
arrests for possession, because they train
[SPEAKER_06]: on officers on how to actually get them on
felonies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like we need to train our law
enforcement better.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, I just want to say that no one has
ever claimed that legalizing marijuana is
[SPEAKER_11]: going to stop the police from being
racist.
[SPEAKER_11]: Legalizing marijuana is not going to stop
the police from being racist.
[SPEAKER_11]: A deep dive into look at the culture of
policing and sanctions against racially
[SPEAKER_11]: biased policing is what's going to make
our police not be racist.
[SPEAKER_11]: But this is another block between them and
people of color.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's not perfect, but it's there.
[SPEAKER_11]: And right today, it's not there.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not there right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And prohibition is real.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it's what is the status quo.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're not talking about a future where
we get to have a world where no one's
[SPEAKER_11]: getting in trouble, and then maybe we
legalize it and create this industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a world right now where people are
getting in trouble.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know there's a lot of folks in this
audience who are activists that are
[SPEAKER_11]: constantly in contact with people who are
in jail right now for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: And they want to know, how come these
people are building this industry,
[SPEAKER_11]: and everyone's talking about this,
and I'm sitting in jail?
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, they want to know that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what are we going to tell them?
[SPEAKER_11]: That we need to wait?
[SPEAKER_11]: That people aren't really getting in
trouble, so we're going to wait a couple
[SPEAKER_11]: more years?
[SPEAKER_11]: I just don't think that's fair.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you can say what you want about what
this will or will not do.
[SPEAKER_11]: But the fact is that if it lets one person
out of jail and to return to their
[SPEAKER_11]: families, I'm sorry, but that's worth it.
[SPEAKER_11]: Because the criminal justice system is no
freaking joke.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know people who have been in jail
for marijuana in a cell with people who
[SPEAKER_11]: have killed other people.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's not right.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's not right to put people in our
community in jail with people who are
[SPEAKER_11]: violent.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we need to stop it.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_11]: We just need to stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to say I've been listening to
this conversation for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the reoccurring themes that I see,
it seems to be an excuse to push what is
[SPEAKER_05]: fundamentally agreed upon by all of you as
being a bill that is imperfect in the name
[SPEAKER_05]: of social justice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've seen a misrepresentation of law
as far as like, well, what if I'm just a
[SPEAKER_05]: small time user and I go to jail because
of that?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we all know, really, come on.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't go to jail for small level
possession.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I guess my question, my concern,
is I was just at a actually convention.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I saw what was happening in the
pharmaceutical lobby there where we've
[SPEAKER_05]: seen the EpiPen pushed up as far as cost
many, many, many times, which is a
[SPEAKER_05]: necessary minimum medicine for many
people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've seen not only that, but diabetes
medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, the pharmaceutical
executives were actually complaining
[SPEAKER_05]: across the table all of the different
medicines that were being available.
[SPEAKER_05]: And these are the already legal medicines
that are on the table are actually being
[SPEAKER_05]: priced out of the market by huge amounts
of money that are coming into this
[SPEAKER_05]: industry and buying it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm saying if the bill is imperfect
and allows any potential for a corporation
[SPEAKER_05]: to come and buy the rights to it and
control the industry, then what we're
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at in the long term, actually very
short term, with the amount of money these
[SPEAKER_05]: people have, is pricing the people that
really need this medicine out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: market, making it completely unavailable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it doesn't matter really how many
people are sitting in jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: We aren't talking about people that lost
their lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's jail.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're actually talking about people that
actually lost their lives and died because
[SPEAKER_05]: of lack of access to this medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you feel like the organization as
it stands now is able to actually,
[SPEAKER_05]: can you explain to me how this bill can
possibly protect against those other
[SPEAKER_05]: interests that we are dealing with in a
very real way in the medical community
[SPEAKER_05]: with all other kinds of drugs?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you tell me how this bill might
actually be able to protect the current
[SPEAKER_05]: industry and or the patients from that
reality that we are currently experiencing
[SPEAKER_05]: in the medical production, medicinal
production?
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, I can't tell you how it
does because it does the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: It actually expedites that business
culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: It opens the door to those types of
ownership models.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great that we are getting folks out
of jail, cleaning up their records.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of these things are laudable.
[SPEAKER_02]: The truth of the matter is social and
criminal justice, priorities, very
[SPEAKER_02]: important ones, took these economic
justice provisions hostage.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not going to prevent that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to protect against that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually worse than current law with
regard to industry rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: With regard to keeping diversity of
products, with keeping the supply chains
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have now intact.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to protect against that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have a different perspective on that as
well.
[SPEAKER_11]: Well, we already have MCRSA, which has a
whole licensing structure for medical.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so medical companies will be licensed
in the medical system.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to address the big pharma boogeyman
because we have no evidence that
[SPEAKER_11]: pharmaceutical companies are starting to
develop cannabis for the raw plant
[SPEAKER_11]: protocols and all of that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I know that, you know, oh,
I don't think Sue's not here anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would just add a 40,000 acre legal
cannabis grove for producing THC in
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: 40,000 acres financed by pharmaceutical
companies.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, I'm talking, right.
[SPEAKER_11]: No, no, no, that's not what I'm saying,
though.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's not what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm saying that in our medical market in
California right now, right, we do not
[SPEAKER_11]: have, because that's what the claim is,
right, is that we're going to start
[SPEAKER_11]: licensing for medical and we're going to
see pharmaceutical companies come in and
[SPEAKER_11]: take the licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm saying is that, you know,
with that amount of money on the table,
[SPEAKER_05]: what's going to prevent it?
[SPEAKER_11]: Right, for medical.
[SPEAKER_11]: You're talking about medical development
of medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, I want to make the distinction.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a set of medical cannabis
regulations and if concerns about the
[SPEAKER_11]: pharmaceuticalization of that medicine,
concerns about the corporatization of that
[SPEAKER_11]: medicine is a medical cannabis issue and
that is something that we have,
[SPEAKER_11]: right now, we're making rules about,
right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So this is the time, right?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's the time to go to the Food and Ag
meetings.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's time to go to the public health
meetings.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is all happening right now and voice
exactly the concerns that you're voicing
[SPEAKER_11]: because they're making the rules for
medicine in this state under cannabis
[SPEAKER_11]: right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: What we're saying is that there are people
that want to access cannabis but are not
[SPEAKER_11]: patients.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're trying to create something for
them that will run alongside what we have
[SPEAKER_11]: for patients.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that in terms of pharmaceutical
involvement, what we need to do is be
[SPEAKER_11]: impacting our medical cannabis regulations
to ensure that that's where it holds true.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, people that are already working in
medical cannabis, this is part of their
[SPEAKER_11]: activism right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just real quick, Prop 64 actually
prohibits a licensee from advertising
[SPEAKER_06]: their product as a medical product.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you have a license under Prop 64,
you can't sell it as medicine whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there would be no benefit to any sort
of big pharma boogeyman.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other reality is as long as it's
federally illegal, most corporations that
[SPEAKER_06]: have any sort of type of federal
contracts, it's going to make it difficult
[SPEAKER_06]: for them to get into the industry as a
whole.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why you're not seeing all the
pharmas.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why it's going to be difficult for,
say, Walgreens to get a license for this
[SPEAKER_06]: because they have a federal license to
sell their drug.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as long as it's federally illegal,
we are going to have a head start to be
[SPEAKER_06]: able to sprint as quickly as possible to
establish the brandy, to establish the
[SPEAKER_06]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is going to be a sprint because
those moneyed-in interests are there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll give you a couple of different
perspectives there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a couple of quick questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, in reference to what you were just
saying, Nate, something interesting from
[SPEAKER_03]: Washington was when, and I don't know if
it still exists, but as soon as I-502
[SPEAKER_03]: rolled in and there was retail cannabis,
somebody that was walking into a
[SPEAKER_03]: recreational dispensary wasn't allowed to,
or the workers at that establishment were
[SPEAKER_03]: not even allowed to engage or talk about
any aspect of the medicinal effect of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis or a certain phytotherapeutic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because since cannabis and medicine and
recreational are kind of intrinsically
[SPEAKER_03]: connected, is California going to,
if ALMA passes and there's rec shops,
[SPEAKER_03]: is it going to be something like that
where there not just can't be any claims
[SPEAKER_03]: on a product about medicinal benefit,
but are the people at the shops not even
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be able to talk about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: What type of predictions or considerations
do you see being put in place with either
[SPEAKER_03]: of the bills around other types of models
that have existed, like the Wham model in
[SPEAKER_03]: the philanthropic giving model to serve
poor and low income and to specialize and
[SPEAKER_03]: focus in these certain areas?
[SPEAKER_03]: And is that something that's going to go
away as everything becomes profitized and
[SPEAKER_03]: for profit, et cetera, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_11]: According to FDA, you can't put on there
like this is going to cure this disease
[SPEAKER_11]: and you're not allowed to make any medical
claims.
[SPEAKER_11]: There is absolutely nothing that's going
to prevent people from educating people
[SPEAKER_11]: about cannabis at every point in the road.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think now that we're getting to the
point where the public is listening and
[SPEAKER_11]: they're like, oh, this cannabis thing,
maybe this is something that we could
[SPEAKER_11]: really stand behind we're the ambassadors.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's going to be up to us to ensure
that the new people that come on board,
[SPEAKER_11]: you know, don't have their marine doubt
experiences, that they're educated about
[SPEAKER_11]: how to use properly.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that that's going to be a
really important part of implementation
[SPEAKER_11]: and something that I'm actually excited to
participate in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually going to not speak to the
first one and only to the second one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that the Wham model is most
accurately described as a consumer's
[SPEAKER_02]: cooperative, which unfortunately three
types of co-ops are not authorized under
[SPEAKER_02]: current law or under Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to work on that either way,
which is a great opportunity for me to
[SPEAKER_02]: briefly remind everybody that vote your
heart, vote your conscience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't attack people that disagree with
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need each other more the day after for
things like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay to be neutral.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neutral is not the same as opposed.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that spirit, come upstairs and join us
at 530, seven minutes ago for a reception
[SPEAKER_02]: refreshments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be a community again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's remember that we're all in this
together because that, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_02]: is what matters most.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's all keep telling the truth about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hi, thanks.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have a different perspective.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a local government attorney.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just wanted to note the difference
between MCRSA and Prop 64 in that under
[SPEAKER_14]: MCRSA, it's a dual licensing scheme where
you need a state license and a local
[SPEAKER_14]: license.
[SPEAKER_14]: Under Prop 64, you only need a state
license, but you cannot operate if it's
[SPEAKER_14]: banned in that local jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_14]: So right now, these local jurisdictions
are exploring their regulatory options.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it's really a shame when there aren't
balanced, substantive, objective
[SPEAKER_14]: discussions on these topics.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I've seen thus far when councils
and commissions are discussing this are
[SPEAKER_14]: very one-sided arguments as far as the
audience goes, just very re-fermentist
[SPEAKER_14]: type stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: So to the extent I would recommend getting
out there and allowing for more balanced
[SPEAKER_14]: discussions on this.
[SPEAKER_14]: And my question is, with local taxes,
we have a lot in November that are going
[SPEAKER_14]: to be considered in anticipation of Prop
64.
[SPEAKER_14]: Is there a real fear that excessive
taxation may fuel the black market?
[SPEAKER_11]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think getting the price and the tax
right is something that we look at other
[SPEAKER_11]: industries.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's one of the big controls we have over
tobacco and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I mean, of course, the concern is that
if you make the tax too high, you fuel the
[SPEAKER_11]: illicit market.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you make the tax too low, then people
over-consume.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you have to try to find that middle
ground.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we will.
[SPEAKER_11]: We will.
[SPEAKER_11]: There's a whole sector of academic
research just on alcohol price elasticity.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's just on how do we fix the price of
the tax just right to get the outcome we
[SPEAKER_11]: want in terms of public health.
[SPEAKER_11]: And luckily, in Prop 64, there's $4
million allocated every year to a UC
[SPEAKER_11]: institution to do public health
implementation research.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we can look and see, did use go up?
[SPEAKER_11]: Where did it go up?
[SPEAKER_11]: Where are things being concentrated?
[SPEAKER_11]: Something we didn't talk about.
[SPEAKER_11]: Who's getting licenses in the industry?
[SPEAKER_11]: And are we ensuring that people that are
diverse and people that have been most
[SPEAKER_11]: impacted are also getting licenses?
[SPEAKER_11]: This is all part of the implementation
work that will be funded by the
[SPEAKER_11]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I'm not going to ask any usual
questions or repeat myself.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everyone knows how I feel about people not
being able to smoke in their cars or
[SPEAKER_13]: public consumption and all of those
things.
[SPEAKER_13]: However, something that I'm confused about
with 64 is why hemp is regulated with
[SPEAKER_13]: cannabis within that bill.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's just confusing to me because I don't
understand the strategy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or are we going to be able to split it up
so the industrial hemp can have its own
[SPEAKER_13]: regulation and then cannabis can move
forward?
[SPEAKER_13]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we actually had a hemp bill that was
passed a few years ago in California,
[SPEAKER_11]: SB 566 by Senator Leno.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it basically said as soon as it's able
to be under California law, that we're
[SPEAKER_11]: going to go ahead and add hemp to whatever
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think that's probably why it just got
added in the definition.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's like we're basically changing the
definition of what is legal behavior and
[SPEAKER_11]: what is illegal behavior.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so we're adding that license
cultivation is now legal of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_11]: of hemp.
[SPEAKER_11]: License manufacturing is now legal of
cannabis and of hemp.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there are definitely differences in
how it needs to be regulated, not just in
[SPEAKER_11]: terms of access and things like that,
but pollen spread and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So again, going back to really getting
excited about having these allied
[SPEAKER_11]: organizations that before maybe weren't so
engaged with us, like farming
[SPEAKER_11]: organizations and people that really
believe in hemp, there's a huge hemp group
[SPEAKER_11]: out there that's ready to embrace this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so yes, I think that it will be very
easy to place that where it's more
[SPEAKER_11]: appropriate as we learn more about what
that looks like in the context of
[SPEAKER_11]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's excellent.
[SPEAKER_09]: That will conclude this session.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you all for attending.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you for being here for the great
dialogue.
Thank you.
