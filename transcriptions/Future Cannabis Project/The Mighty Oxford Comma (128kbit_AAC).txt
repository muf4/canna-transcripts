[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these guys have already heard my
rant about the use of an Oxford comma in
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulations, which is in the
regulations, it says, cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates, you know, suppositories,
capsules, whatever, vape cartridges,
[SPEAKER_00]: comma, inhalable products, it's
parenthetical, shatter dab wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they put it in that second part
in the regs, they didn't put vape
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridges, comma, inhalable products,
shatter dab wax, they just put inhalable
[SPEAKER_00]: products, shatter dab wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the argument happening now is that
might be what you mean, but Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Public Health, that is not what you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying so hard to read and
understand in the English language and the
[SPEAKER_00]: use of commas and all of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Julie's get the comma woman,
and I love it because I use that argument
[SPEAKER_01]: in our letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my argument is that there is a
difference between a product and a
[SPEAKER_01]: container of that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot use the oil that is in the pen
without the vape cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot, and the BCC tells me,
I cannot bulk oil, test the oil before it
[SPEAKER_01]: goes into the vape cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I must test what?
[SPEAKER_01]: The final form of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless the product is bulk oil and then
the container is the vape pen cart,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not at all the way that it is set
up in the regulations, then there is no
[SPEAKER_01]: way that that vape pen cart is deemed to
be a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm gonna get out my crystal ball,
I'm just gonna tell you guys, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where it's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we're gonna have to put universal
symbols on cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no doubt they're gonna bring back,
the little stamp maker is gonna lobby to
[SPEAKER_00]: put the stamps back on the edibles so you
know the difference between a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate and another chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're gonna go all the way down the rabbit
hole, because especially since if people
[SPEAKER_00]: in Laguna Beach are getting CUPs to open a
CBD store and they're gonna sell vapes,
[SPEAKER_00]: guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your law enforcement's gonna wanna know on
visual perception, is that a CBD vape or
[SPEAKER_00]: is that a THC vape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now we're starting to fork into
CBD good, THC bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's happening.
