[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for that intro.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was so sweet of you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it's pulling up, I'll tell you,
this is Dodger.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a Labrador that works at our
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: His job is to comfort the patients that
are stuck there smoking weed all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's got an important role with our
clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: He travels with me everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So OK, I think we got this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to take a minute to load
the pictures probably.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll just jump right in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you guys know, our studies are
focused on flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know today you're going to hear a lot
about all the wonderful derivatives that
[SPEAKER_00]: are coming out of cannabis flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our studies try to focus on actual dry
buds material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing FDA controlled trials,
trying to understand the medical benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: of smoked and vaporized flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our effort is to really try to put
flour through the entire FDA drug
[SPEAKER_00]: development process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're doing nonprofit drug development
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really difficult to find partners
that want to do this, because you can
[SPEAKER_00]: imagine most of these companies are
focused on trying to isolate cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: things that they can actually patent and
make money from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying to basically keep flour
in the nonprofit realm, because it can't
[SPEAKER_00]: be really patented easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're doing that because we believe
that flour certainly is the least
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive, because you don't have to do
all the processing after.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still the most popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the data in all these legal
states, people still migrate toward
[SPEAKER_00]: natural flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that it will also, if we can get
flour through the FDA process,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll open most doors for other
botanical medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work with MAPS, and many of you know
they're a nonprofit that spearheads all
[SPEAKER_00]: this psychedelic research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for us, trying to pave the way for
other plant-based medicines like
[SPEAKER_00]: psilocybin and ayahuasca and all these
important potential medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, the ultimate goal is
to try to persuade health insurance
[SPEAKER_00]: companies to pay for flour the same way
they pay for other pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why getting flour through the
FDA process is so essential in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve that goal of making insurance
companies add that to their formularies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many of you know we're probably best
known for this clinical trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do all sorts of different studies,
which I'm going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this study has been really crucial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because first thing, many of you probably
don't know, we have not had a new drug on
[SPEAKER_00]: the market for PTSD in 18 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you believe that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The first and only medicines that were
approved were Zoloft and Paxil back 18
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nothing else has emerged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these other drugs that we use as
physicians, we employ all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs off label.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've never been tested officially,
formally for PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the challenge is when you're
treating PTSD, you're trying to attack
[SPEAKER_00]: this whole constellation of symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might report some insomnia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put them on some sleep meds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they report this depression,
anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them on SSRI or other
antidepressants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see how these guys just keep
snowballing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the way modern medicine is
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a different prescription that
attacks each different target symptom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys end up on sometimes 10,
12 different prescriptions all to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why we became so curious
about the potential of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: the idea that this complex plant and the
pleiotropy that results from that,
[SPEAKER_00]: that the opportunity to target multiple
organ systems in the body with this one
[SPEAKER_00]: intervention is so exciting to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we embarked on this trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I wanted you to be aware that this
study, even though we did finally complete
[SPEAKER_00]: it this year, it took us 10 years to get
to the finish line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the sad reality of trying to
do clinical trials in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you dare say you want to study
efficacy of cannabis, how effective is
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis at treating a certain illness
like this, those studies get into a
[SPEAKER_00]: permanent review process typically where
they almost never emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason ours did was because
we got so much media coverage along the
[SPEAKER_00]: way that pressured the government to help
us kind of hurdle these obstacles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see we ended up having this
crazy saga which many of you, we thank you
[SPEAKER_00]: so much for following us through this
drama because it's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we got fired from the university where
we actually had IRB approval from the
[SPEAKER_00]: university to do the study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were doing an FDA approved,
fully funded study and they rejected us,
[SPEAKER_00]: terminated us, but this was a huge gift to
our study because ultimately we ended up,
[SPEAKER_00]: let me see if I can, but yeah,
we ended up getting tons of media coverage
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these celebrities coming out of
the woodwork to defend us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like many of you know Andy Weil.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of my attendings at the
university.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a department chair of integrative
medicine at the medical school at
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Arizona and he wrote this
public letter condemning his own
[SPEAKER_00]: university president for doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're really grateful to have folks
like him and John Oliver, all these folks
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out trying to help us because they
realized this was really an attack on
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific freedom when they tried to
suppress this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ultimately we ended up in our own
private institute and that's what I wanted
[SPEAKER_00]: to point out to you guys is that you can
do this work totally independent from any
[SPEAKER_00]: university or hospital.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work through a private IRB system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have no, so then we're not beholden to
the politics, the ugly politics in the
[SPEAKER_00]: university.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took me seven years though to get this,
what they call, the scientists call this
[SPEAKER_00]: the golden ticket because it allows you
the privilege of purchasing cannabis from
[SPEAKER_00]: our federal government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so seven years, I finally got the
approval, moved to order eight kilos of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis which was required for our study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And suddenly I'm thinking surely this
would come by like armored truck or
[SPEAKER_00]: something, but there's the FedEx guy shows
up at my door.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has no idea he's even transporting
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, why all these cameras here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, well, this is really historic
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We waited so long for this, but I was so
disappointed to open up this cooler and
[SPEAKER_00]: see, basically this was frozen cannabis
sitting in the lockers of the research
[SPEAKER_00]: triangle, frozen for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you open up these sandwich bags,
they have no information on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't tell you anything except the
CBD to THC ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So normally when I do clinical trials,
I always get a drug master file that tells
[SPEAKER_00]: you all the properties of the study drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not, but there's zero transparency on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not get access to the drug master
file despite us suing before sending FOIA
[SPEAKER_00]: requests, all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is also another thing that
handcuffs scientists because we have no
[SPEAKER_00]: idea what's really in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also, we have our own analytical,
a DEA license to do the analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we decided we wanted to send it out to
an independent lab so nobody would fault
[SPEAKER_00]: us for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see this is the material,
this is pictures on the top from years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of you know, Ethan Rousseau sent me
these pictures of his study drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see how depressing this is that
this is the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's basically a concoction of stems,
sticks, seeds, leaves, and some flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, flowering tops.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the most recent batch that we
got on the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see what happened was we
started criticizing the government about
[SPEAKER_00]: this, you know, all this extraneous plant
material weighing down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because remember, in clinical trials,
you issue study drug to patients by
[SPEAKER_00]: weight, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they may get two grams a day,
three grams a day, but if half of the
[SPEAKER_00]: weight of the study drug is all of this
junk and not the actual flowering part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant, then you see how that already
sabotages your study from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after all this criticism, they didn't
like scientists criticizing their study
[SPEAKER_00]: drug, and they said, all right,
we're gonna grind it into a powder,
[SPEAKER_00]: so now you can't even discern what's in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very clever of our government.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still know, you can still see all
the fragments in there that show this is
[SPEAKER_00]: no better than, you know, Mexican ditch
weed, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see, when we sent this out to
these independent labs, we ended up
[SPEAKER_00]: finding excessively high levels of mold in
all the batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we went back to NIDA and University of
Mississippi and said, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what was your mold testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ours was over 100,000 CFU of mold in all
the batches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, oh, we've never tested for
mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, wow, this is really,
you know, mystifying that they've never
[SPEAKER_00]: thought, I mean, they're growing outdoors
in Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a formula of all the humidity
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a formula for growing mold,
but they never tested for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And only when we brought this to light,
we shared our summary report.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended up doing three different rounds
of independent testing, all showing
[SPEAKER_00]: sky-high levels of mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sadly, this is the only federally
legal supply.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about that, that every single
study done in the US that was looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: flour has been forced to use this lousy
study drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wanna just give you some good news,
though, is that, so after 10 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: we finally got the 80th veteran through
the clinical trial, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we screened almost 6,000 veterans for
the study and finally found that 80 that
[SPEAKER_00]: met all the criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's just pages and pages
of inclusion and exclusion criteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's the binder for the 80th
patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had only four dropouts in the study,
which is a real testament to the
[SPEAKER_00]: resilience of these veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just were so determined.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would never resign unless we forced
them to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did have a couple patients that had
some adverse events.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is interesting, too, that the FDA
still requires that binder's like 1,000
[SPEAKER_00]: pages, and still we have to do everything
on paper, spend hours and hours
[SPEAKER_00]: transferring this to an electronic
database.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see how laborious these trials
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately,
[SPEAKER_00]: sadly, I can't share the results of the
veteran study yet because we haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: published all the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have unblinded everything, and we're
pulling this into a manuscript now that
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully will be submitted to JAMA later
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can tell you that the results are
exactly what you would expect from smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: moldy, diluted cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sad to say that I'm not sure people
are gonna be eager to read these results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see later, but I think that this
is what spurred on, we've been trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: find a law firm to help us sue the DEA for
years over this monopoly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those of you who aren't aware,
University of Mississippi has enjoyed a
[SPEAKER_00]: government-enforced monopoly for now,
since 1968.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's 50 years that they have had the
only Schedule I license as a bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every clinical trial that we or any
scientist do, all the universities in
[SPEAKER_00]: California here, CMCR, UCSD, all these
groups have been forced to buy this
[SPEAKER_00]: substandard plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though you're surrounded by some of
the most beautiful flower in the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're buying that powder that green
powder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it makes me concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pierre just mentioned the National Academy
of Science report, and we all know that
[SPEAKER_00]: that report only showed efficacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said that there was only strong
evidence to support cannabis for pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: nausea and vomiting, and spasticity of MS.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you think about all these other
conditions that patients are reporting,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're getting benefit from everything
from epilepsy to inflammatory bowel
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was not scientific evidence to
support their use, and that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: surprise any of us, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we see how these studies have been
undermined by this low-quality study drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see how studies have been subverted by
being forced into fixed dosing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the things I was most
proud of in this trial that we just
[SPEAKER_00]: finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: This veteran study was the first one,
I'm aware, that the FDA allowed us to do
[SPEAKER_00]: patient self-titration, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So these PTSD patients need to be able to
adjust their own dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't force them into taking 20
milligrams twice a day, whether they need
[SPEAKER_00]: it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be absurd, and that's what
happens with these previous clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trials, is we've forced people,
and many times take way more than they
[SPEAKER_00]: need, then they get tons of side effects
that kind of eclipse any therapeutic
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit that we're able to document.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where I think these studies have
gone wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully, all the clinical trials going
forward, if any of you out there are
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about doing clinical trials,
I would really urge you to keep on this
[SPEAKER_00]: train of patient self-titration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Demand that your FDA, the FDA was very
oppositional with this idea initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took us months of back and forth with
them before they finally embraced it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But believe me, their paradigm is
astounding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was established by Big Pharma,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what they know is fixed dosing
models.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to push them to rethink that
paradigm and let us look at botanical
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine with a different paradigm now,
that patient self-titration should be the
[SPEAKER_00]: rule of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've had, you know, many of the
veterans in the study didn't even,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, some days, you know how the PTSD
fluctuates, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some days you are good, some days are bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some days they don't need any medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other days they know, oh, I'm going to
Walmart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got to pre-medicate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know this is going to be brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the idea is we want to give
patients the power to decide when they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to medicate, how much they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these patients, you know,
they were required to bring back their
[SPEAKER_00]: unused cannabis each week.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would weigh what they used each day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I could see that a lot of these
patients only needed a few inhalations at
[SPEAKER_00]: night to help them initiate sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay asleep all night, suppress their
nightmares and flashbacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd wake up in the morning feeling
refreshed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't even need often any study drug
in the daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, you know, the nighttime dose was
adequate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the whole point is give them the
power to adjust the dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I'm going to leave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're probably short.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to just explain to you what our
next steps are because of the results of
[SPEAKER_00]: this veteran study.
[SPEAKER_00]: It spurred us on even further to demand a
change from the DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what many of you probably read in
2016, the DEA announced that they were
[SPEAKER_00]: going to finally end the monopoly and
license other growers for research.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was on the federal register.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a legit announcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But since then, three years later,
they have not moved forward one inch
[SPEAKER_00]: toward doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have 30 applications sitting on the
desk of the DEA for three years that have
[SPEAKER_00]: not been processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took our application fee,
$3,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: They processed my credit card,
but not my application.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we were so lucky to find
this law firm that has no relationship to
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're people that just heard me speak at
South by Southwest and they were so
[SPEAKER_00]: outraged by this suppression of scientific
freedom and they said, you know what,
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll take this pro bono.
[SPEAKER_00]: They spent months researching this and
submitted the petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's actually not just against the DEA,
but we're also targeting the attorney
[SPEAKER_00]: general whose office seems to be the
primary culprit here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supposedly the DEA wanted to move forward,
but the DOJ and attorney general said,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, you're not to process those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this DEA monopoly is really the final
barrier to doing legitimate cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: clinical trials in the US.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's held us back so much because you
can see the menu here is so limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our study, we basically got to look at
high THC batch, a batch of high CBD flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: a batch of one to one THC to CBD,
and placebo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the menu you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet here in the real world,
patients obviously have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of phenotypes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a mountain of anecdotal evidence
from patients that this is helping them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the problem is this is not
bearing out in these clinical trials
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the disappointing study drug
and the fixed dosing model is really
[SPEAKER_00]: harming the outcomes of these studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a real conundrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this catch 22, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because here we're trying to reform public
policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need data in order to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there are thousands of controlled
trials that have already been published in
[SPEAKER_00]: peer-reviewed journals eluding to the
efficacy of cannabis for certain
[SPEAKER_00]: illnesses, but certainly not close to
enough to persuade the medical community
[SPEAKER_00]: or health departments.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also snobbish about we need
randomized controlled trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the gold standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anything short of that is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the challenge with PTSD,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that PTSD, all the data so far has been
conflicting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a ton of observational studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have showed cannabis benefits PTSD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have shown it's harmful, that it
makes patients aggressive, it promotes
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis dependence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's all these reasons why people
were hanging on this trial, hoping that
[SPEAKER_00]: this data would, finally, the first
randomized controlled trial in the world
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at this thought, finally,
we'd have a definitive answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is the challenge for all of
you who are in this movement to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep the pressure on the DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DEA has already received over a dozen
letters, bipartisan letters from Congress,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have not even felt the need to
respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DEA feels apparently they're not
accountable to anybody because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: even respond to letters from Congress,
not even a formal one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was pretty amazed by that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we move forward with the
litigation, because we realize we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: wait on them to act.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've heard references from the new
attorney general Barr saying, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to get on that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to do something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we all know that all these bills are
just stagnating, waiting for, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what they're waiting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like nobody's interested in solving
the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully we'll find a sympathetic
judge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the meantime, I wanted to point out
this is actually a two-front war we're
[SPEAKER_00]: creating here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one front is this litigation against
the DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second front is this opportunity,
which is importing cannabis from a foreign
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our government seems to have no problem
with US scientists sourcing cannabis from
[SPEAKER_00]: other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't want any other domestic
manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can bring in flour from Canada,
as soon as the Canadian LPs prove that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have GMP-grade flour, then I will
have the green light to import their
[SPEAKER_00]: flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will finally break this monopoly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you'll notice, many of you have
read how UCSD is importing cannabis oil
[SPEAKER_00]: from Tilray for that tremor study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just be aware that that oil, cannabis oil,
there's no monopoly around cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was broken years ago, remember,
when GW was allowed to bring in Sativex
[SPEAKER_00]: for clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that monopoly ended years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The monopoly that exists is just around
flour right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not allowed any flour to enter
the US externally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not allowing any other domestic
growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our hope, is this trial was
supposed to be, I wanted to just point out
[SPEAKER_00]: something interesting here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking at late stage cancer
patients, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to evaluate, this is one,
looking at quality of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second study we're doing is looking at
breakthrough pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're gonna be evaluating smoked
cannabis flour compared to fentanyl,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because fentanyl, like the nuclear bomb of
opioids, we use it so reflexively with our
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact is that, in a pilot study we
did in Montreal, we found that smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: flour performed way better than fentanyl
and just came on so quickly and patients
[SPEAKER_00]: got relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do this trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have FDA approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue now is that the flour that I was
preparing to import from this LP in Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: suddenly found the presence of three
mycotoxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something I wanna point out,
is even these giant, this is a giant,
[SPEAKER_00]: LP, multi-billion dollars, they have the
financial resources to do the best
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial agriculture in the world and
yet they're not paying attention to the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of their medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this study was supposed to start in
January and here we are, they still
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't been able to remediate the flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just wanna mention that this is the
frustration for us as scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are highly dependent on these groups
because we don't, we're a non-profit,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't have money to pay for these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to wait for them to do this,
but I just wanna say that some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate behemoths are just so focused on
the money play and they forgot about the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of the medicine and taking care of
sick people and it just makes me sad that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're in this state now where we're so
dependent on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanna bring that up and then my final
slide, I just wanna mention there are all
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of interesting things that come out
that are generated through these trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though we weren't studying opioid
substitution in our study, we weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: studying erectile function, but the
veterans were reporting to us that both of
[SPEAKER_00]: those things were happening during the
three months and keep in mind,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is even with this really substandard
plant material, that they were noticing
[SPEAKER_00]: that they weren't, as we're lying on their
opioids, many of them reported completely
[SPEAKER_00]: weaning off opioids during the course of
this three-month study.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was exciting phenomena and then
this was the other thing, that we had so
[SPEAKER_00]: many young veterans coming in on Viagra
because that was, that's what the VA does.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pummel you with all these psych meds
that cause you to have no erectile
[SPEAKER_00]: function and then they throw in some
Viagra for good measure and so it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can imagine how demoralized,
these are like 30, 40-year-old veterans
[SPEAKER_00]: already on Viagra.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think their life is over and so this
was an exciting discovery too that many of
[SPEAKER_00]: the vets were noticing that they no longer
needed the Viagra during the time where
[SPEAKER_00]: they were using the smoke flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that was my final slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping to do a trial on this subject
as well and we're looking for partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some interest from Canadian LPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you've heard of Zenibus is
one of the LPs up there that is headed up
[SPEAKER_00]: by a urologist who's already agreed to
fund this trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're hoping, but the good thing about
them, what I was impressed by in Canada,
[SPEAKER_00]: Pierre can probably touch on that,
is that they're willing, there's like a
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborative competitiveness where
certainly all the LPs are fighting to
[SPEAKER_00]: dominate but they're also willing,
like Zenibus was willing to allow us to
[SPEAKER_00]: source flower from all the different LPs
because all of them have different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties that could be valuable and they
get that and so they're willing to fund
[SPEAKER_00]: the study and not necessarily insist that
their flower has to be the only one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was really impressed by that and I'm
hoping someday in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: we can achieve that kind of collaborative
spirit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I know we're short and I don't
know, do we still have time?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh question, you think so?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh good, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, let's see if anybody got a
question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Two points, lovely talk, thank you very
much.
[SPEAKER_06]: Number one, regarding this, here's one of
the issues, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It may well be the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: It may be a toxin that's doing this,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: You just don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hence the need for better controlled
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you'll allow me one anecdote,
so you said about having to give fixed
[SPEAKER_06]: dose, you're absolutely right and what
I've been doing of course is titrating up
[SPEAKER_06]: and I stop when there's some sort of
adverse effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: But in one of my patients with Parkinson's
disease who had osteoarthritis of the hip,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is the hip I was treating,
we went up to about one ml of oil twice a
[SPEAKER_06]: day and she said, frankly doc,
it's not working, my pain is the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: We said, well okay, we'll just titrate
down.
[SPEAKER_06]: I got back down to .7 twice a day and she
said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[SPEAKER_06]: stop, stop, because you know what?
[SPEAKER_06]: My tremors are coming back now that you're
titrating down.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go back up because I feel so much better
on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have to keep that spirit open of
openness and looking for things and to
[SPEAKER_06]: your point, titrating is so important when
using this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is crucial and I think that's what
people are discovering is that they need
[SPEAKER_00]: often a lot less cannabis than they
thought even though typically in these
[SPEAKER_00]: studies we're giving them two or three
grams a day just to give them enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: use what they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the time these patients are
reporting needing less than a half gram a
[SPEAKER_00]: day and that just goes against that
attitude from the prohibitionist that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you give them too much that they'll just
abuse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact is sick patients just want to
feel functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not trying to get stoned and I
think these studies hopefully will dispel
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of these myths.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you so much for the talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: This was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm wondering why you all are
investigating smoking as well as
[SPEAKER_04]: vaporization besides maybe just cost and
familiarity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there any reason that you are looking
at both ends of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am actually really frustrated by this
veteran study was actually supposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: randomize people into a smoking arm or a
vaporizing arm, but we decided we had an
[SPEAKER_00]: agreement from tiller ray to do our
vaporizer arm of the study and that they
[SPEAKER_00]: would fully fund it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was six years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still haven't finished the trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have like, I don't know, two or four
patients enrolled and it's just been a
[SPEAKER_00]: really anemic effort and I'm really
depressed about it because we would now be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to have data from both if they had
finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this shows you they're happy to
waive the trial in front of their
[SPEAKER_00]: investors and brag about how they're doing
all this important research.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact is when it comes to they had
a chance to be involved in this,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Andrea can speak to this because she
knows how tough it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: These big corporations are so dependent on
shareholder satisfaction and it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard and they're constantly, you know,
holding this up and waving it around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when it comes to really
executing, they don't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing that we heard from veterans
was and many of you in the audience can
[SPEAKER_00]: probably speak to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have time after, please come
talk to me because I keep hearing from
[SPEAKER_00]: people that they insist that smoking is
just so much more robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically I'm very anti-smoking in my
internal medicine practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really hard for me to embrace this
initially.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I recognize this is a legitimate
delivery method.
[SPEAKER_00]: The studies that we had, 30 years of
safety studies from NIDA still have not
[SPEAKER_00]: uncovered any long-term harms from
smoking, no lung malignancy or emphysema.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've embraced this, but I'm curious
about why patients are talking about how
[SPEAKER_00]: vaporizing is good, but smoking is just
much more robust and it seems to activate
[SPEAKER_00]: all these molecules in the plant that
aren't really activated by vaporizing,
[SPEAKER_00]: which only gets you to whatever,
400 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something in the combustion
that takes it to another level for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and I think that's why it's still
preferred by so many people, but not
[SPEAKER_00]: optimal when you're dealing with the
medical community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, anybody else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not there, I know we're probably new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you touched on, actually both these
talks touched on how important titration
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that often goes hand in hand with the
idea that there may be a bimodal dosing
[SPEAKER_01]: response curve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something that this new study is
gonna be addressing or has addressed?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish, I wish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have, but I know what you're
saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody's so curious about this biphasic
response and we're not gonna get to,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is just an FDA phase two trial so
it's kind of early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Early phase drug development studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm hoping when we get to phase three
we'll get into more of the nitty gritty of
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but it's a really good point you
raised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi Sue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for your contribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick question, when you do your trials,
do you survey your participants if they
[SPEAKER_03]: consume other medication, other
prescription medication?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you suggest that they don't and only
consume cannabis through your trial?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do have to wash off cannabis for at
least two weeks prior to starting the
[SPEAKER_00]: study which screens out tons of patients
right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're semi-dependent on it,
they automatically walk away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was actually really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even people that were regular users found
the drug holiday, the two week tolerance
[SPEAKER_00]: was beneficial because it sort of helped
resensitize their receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why even with this low
quality cannabis from the government,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were getting some good responses
because they were so sensitive to it even
[SPEAKER_00]: though it was so diluted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not allowed to use any external
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once they enter the study, they're done
with any, and we have ways of testing for
[SPEAKER_00]: that to make sure that they're only using
ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happens is, oh, in terms of
other, so the other pharmaceuticals that
[SPEAKER_00]: patients were on, we asked them to
maintain everything the same, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So if they were already on a cadre of
different, as long as it wasn't things
[SPEAKER_00]: like steroids, stuff that would reduce
inflammation or chemo, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically, if they were on psych meds,
they were required to stay on whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: they were taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were in psychotherapy,
getting cognitive behavioral therapy,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were required to stick with that
throughout the trial, not change anything
[SPEAKER_00]: because that could definitely confound our
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that was the best way to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, imagine if I was trying to take
people off Paxil, Zola, all these drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: that have such significant withdrawal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you try to take somebody off of Paxil,
they're in withdrawal for months after
[SPEAKER_00]: that, and that could really muddy the
waters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we asked people to just remain on
exactly what they were taking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you don't know?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you guys want to go to lunch.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, Dr. Sissler.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, there.
[SPEAKER_05]: In terms of the litigation, I'm a lawyer,
so I'm going to ask the litigation
[SPEAKER_05]: question.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the status of the litigation?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, what phase is it in?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in general, not just regarding
the litigation, but is there anything that
[SPEAKER_05]: the folks in this room can do in terms of
advocacy, civil disobedience?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything that you would recommend
to kind of put additional pressure on the
[SPEAKER_05]: federal government?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tell you what I think,
and then I may try to connect you with my
[SPEAKER_00]: attorneys.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this Texas law firm, Yetter Coleman,
they filed the petition a little over a
[SPEAKER_00]: month ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometime in June, we submitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've not had any response yet from
the court, which concerns me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm worried.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how this works, if a case can
go stale over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so right now, what we're doing,
the way that I'd say, if there's one call
[SPEAKER_00]: to action I have for everybody today,
is if you have connections with elected
[SPEAKER_00]: officials who care about this,
we may be able to submit some amicus
[SPEAKER_00]: briefs, I guess it's called, where they
could show their support that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we could put pressure on the
courts to acknowledge this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because right now, we have a commitment
from Jared Polis, the governor in
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, has agreed to write an amicus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, IAVA, the Iraq-Afghanistan
Veterans Association, they have agreed
[SPEAKER_00]: because they already have policy about
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And American Legion is also evaluating
this for amicus support.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'd love to get other governors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to identify states where
taxpayer dollars are going to fund trials
[SPEAKER_00]: using Mississippi cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly here, you're in danger of
that because you have all new research
[SPEAKER_00]: money coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody in your California
universities that are trying to do
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled trials will be forced to buy
the cannabis from Mississippi instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: using your own state-licensed cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you guys have a real,
your governor has a real basis to argue
[SPEAKER_00]: that we need to end this monopoly so that
you don't waste any taxpayer dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: studying this and getting lousy outcomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anybody knows Newsom or any of the
other congressmen, certainly I think an
[SPEAKER_00]: amicus from a congressman's office could
be valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, thank you for that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll connect you with my... We have
time for one more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much, Dr. Cicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really appreciate your information.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somebody had mentioned earlier that you
have a registry, a patient registry,
[SPEAKER_00]: a very large one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened was we got funding from
Colorado State University to build an
[SPEAKER_00]: international registry that would
basically be independent of the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: so that it could get because the data
could be published later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had IRB approval in advance so that
the data, again, could be publishable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened was the funding for
the... So we had a vendor in Colorado that
[SPEAKER_00]: was supporting the... That created the
platform for me and we were collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: data and then our funding ran out and the
platform has now gone dark.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know this is heartbreaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we're doing is trying to seek out
other partners because this is so
[SPEAKER_00]: important that we have... The reason I was
pursuing the registry because I'm so
[SPEAKER_00]: desperate to get data from people using
real world flower and even though it's
[SPEAKER_00]: survey data, it's still important because
it helps us see trends when you get to the
[SPEAKER_00]: larger...
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we have 10,000 patients in the
registry, we'll see trends that can help
[SPEAKER_00]: us fuel control trials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, if you know anybody who's
interested in providing funding,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to rebuild the platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: The good thing is we already know how to
do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the structure in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just need to reopen it and probably
work with a vendor that's not gonna be so
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive because that was just too
costly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might actually have somebody for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: A good friend of mine who's a chief
clinical officer, former chief clinical
[SPEAKER_02]: officer from Providence Health and Human
Services, as you know, is a very large
[SPEAKER_02]: healthcare system, had also suggested the
same thing and I might hook you up with
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's a great outcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
Thank you.
