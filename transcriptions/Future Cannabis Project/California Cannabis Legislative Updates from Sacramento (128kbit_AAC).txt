[SPEAKER_03]: We are going to talk about what is going
on in the legislative and regulatory
[SPEAKER_03]: landscape in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: To start off, I thought it would be nice
to summarize just where we are in the
[SPEAKER_03]: process with the regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might recall last time we were here,
Pamela and I yelling at you passionately
[SPEAKER_03]: to comment during the 45-day comment
period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lori Ajax at one event had said that she
anticipated getting about 1,000 comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we got 4,000 comments I heard that
she reviewed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well done.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 1,800 of them were about delivery.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now they're in the process of,
maybe Max you could help describe where we
[SPEAKER_03]: are in that process and what the next
steps are.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two processes going on right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got the regulatory process which has
been going on in fits and starts the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we also have the legislative process
which we're at the very end of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll start with the legislative process
briefly because that has just been
[SPEAKER_00]: wrapping up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bills have a two-year life cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: That life cycle starts after an election
and it ends at the following August or
[SPEAKER_00]: September of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the second year of a two-year
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: All bills had to be passed by the
legislature by the end of August.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the governor has one month,
has until the last day of September to go
[SPEAKER_00]: and sign or veto those bills that are
currently pending.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's taken action on one bill thus far
which was the electronic funds transfer
[SPEAKER_00]: bill saying that if you're paying your
taxes and you're paying them in cash you
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be penalized for that because
you're in cannabis because you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: banking access.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a good bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an easy bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: He signed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one bill he's signed thus far.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of smaller ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a veto.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're really waiting for the big list,
the big set of them that Pam's excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about and we can touch on that in just a
moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's, we're in action in the next 11
days or 13 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: On all of those bills, simultaneously
we've got the regulatory process going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just had a 45-day public comment
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: That period closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're now at is a question of will
there be or what will be the next comment
[SPEAKER_00]: period because there will be changes to
the regulations and when there are changes
[SPEAKER_00]: and when there are substantive changes in
particular there has to be an additional
[SPEAKER_00]: comment period.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're anticipating another comment period
either somewhere between mid-October and
[SPEAKER_00]: the start of November, somewhere around
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the important date is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The emergency regulations were only
authorized for one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the emergency regulations that have
been in effect since the first week of
[SPEAKER_00]: December of last year have to be replaced
by permanent regulations by the first week
[SPEAKER_00]: of December of this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so keeping an eye on that week,
from there we're just working backwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working backwards on when the
comment periods will be, how much review
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be because they have to be
approved and finalized by that first week
[SPEAKER_00]: of December.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cancel your Thanksgiving plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year the regs came out the Thursday
before Thanksgiving.
[SPEAKER_05]: At MJ Biz.
[SPEAKER_00]: At MJ Biz.
[SPEAKER_05]: So every California person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, and in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone was in Vegas on their phones,
on their laptops looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations when they came out last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably around that time for the
final version too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back to legislation, Pam,
do you want to talk about some of your
[SPEAKER_00]: favorites?
[SPEAKER_06]: We talked about 1459, which is I think one
of the most important bills.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had an interesting iteration because it
took the shape of a previous cultivation
[SPEAKER_06]: bill that was gutted and repurposed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's so important about 1459 is that
temporary permits, which is what
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody's been using to operate on,
expire and can no longer be issued as of
[SPEAKER_06]: December 31st of 2018.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was part of 64 that was voted in by
the voters.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: That means that the state has how many
people know how many annual permits the
[SPEAKER_06]: state has issued so far?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big goose egg, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: None.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are nearing the back half of the
year, more than the back half of the year,
[SPEAKER_06]: and there's no state permits.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a myriad of reasons.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them may have to do with a little
thing called metric that we talked about.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what does that mean is that all these
cities and counties are moving forward
[SPEAKER_06]: with their process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some operators are currently operating.
[SPEAKER_06]: If on the 31st we don't have a fix to
that, that either means that certain
[SPEAKER_06]: operators that need priority are going to
have maybe 90 day runway or others who are
[SPEAKER_06]: closer to being issued more towards
December would have 120 days.
[SPEAKER_06]: Given that we're going to be at 365 days
potentially without any issuance of an
[SPEAKER_06]: annual, that starts to put everybody in a
line that if you don't have an annual
[SPEAKER_06]: permit, you can not operate.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that grinds the entire industry to a
halt.
[SPEAKER_06]: 1459 would give what is affectionately
being called a provisional annual license.
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: That would mean that if you have a state
temporary permit in your hand by December
[SPEAKER_06]: 31st of this year, you would then be
entitled to get a provisional annual.
[SPEAKER_06]: With that provisional annual, you would be
allowed to operate without a vested right,
[SPEAKER_06]: but throughout the process of the year to
get through fire, planning and building,
[SPEAKER_06]: CEQA, the California Environmental Quality
Act, which will rear its ugly head in this
[SPEAKER_06]: industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only are you going to need CEQA level
review at your local level, but because a
[SPEAKER_06]: second discretionary action is happening,
an agency is giving you another permit,
[SPEAKER_06]: they and specifically the Bureau of
Cannabis Control, who when you read the
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations had very robust CEQA
parameters, they're going to be looking at
[SPEAKER_06]: that CEQA document.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they don't think let's look at the
city of LA, we can look at the city of
[SPEAKER_06]: Long Beach and we can look specifically at
the city of San Diego.
[SPEAKER_06]: None of those cities went through a land
use entitlement process.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was no discretionary action taken by
a local jurisdiction that allowed for some
[SPEAKER_06]: level of CEQA review.
[SPEAKER_06]: Their ordinances may have been CEQA
reviewed or CEQA exempted for the city of
[SPEAKER_06]: LA, like to use the January or July 1 of
2019 CEQA exemption that exists right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that means that the BCC can say,
all right, you have an existing facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are always exceptions to the
exemption.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what California loves.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you went beyond your footprint,
if you did something more aggressive,
[SPEAKER_06]: the BCC can say, well, then we want our
own CEQA review.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in their CEQA language, in the
proposed draft regulations, permanent
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations, they said, you write us a
check.
[SPEAKER_06]: We tell you how we want you to do CEQA and
you pay us to administer that process.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a former CEQA lawyer, I will tell you
that CEQA can cost tens, if not hundreds
[SPEAKER_06]: of thousands of dollars and take six,
nine, twelve months or longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this provisional annual is critically
important.
[SPEAKER_06]: It also puts you on the hook for metrics.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the other part about temporary licenses
and why temporary licenses aren't
[SPEAKER_06]: something that can move forward into 2019
is we really all need to start getting on
[SPEAKER_06]: board with track and chase.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're supposed to be doing it paper
versions.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, every time something happens and
something moves throughout the supply
[SPEAKER_06]: chain, you're supposed to send a paper
manifest or an email manifest up to the
[SPEAKER_06]: BCC, which somehow goes into their general
mailbox and is diverted into the right.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to ask where those go,
but you just send them in because for five
[SPEAKER_06]: years after the fact, they can go back and
look at that and guarantee you enforcement
[SPEAKER_06]: actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know they're auditing them right
now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't think they don't go somewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: They do into a black hole that can then
cause you issues later.
[SPEAKER_06]: So with that provisional annual,
you are responsible to pay your fees for
[SPEAKER_06]: the whole year upfront.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are responsible to do track and trace
and you are responsible to not let what is
[SPEAKER_06]: happening in Sacramento and Oakland
happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go through your local land use process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do not think that this license,
like your temporary license to some,
[SPEAKER_06]: is an entitlement not to go through the
rest of your entitlement process.
[SPEAKER_06]: It means you are actively engaged in both
operations and both those operations and
[SPEAKER_06]: critical opportunities that allow you to
keep operating.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we wait with bated breath for that to
get passed, which is my most important
[SPEAKER_06]: point.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, if you're restructuring,
this is an important bill for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can restructure and then get a
provisional annual without losing your
[SPEAKER_06]: potential priority status, which is also
something important for those that were
[SPEAKER_06]: operating maybe as a sole proprietor or as
an MBC that would like to convert and not
[SPEAKER_06]: potentially have that issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just on 1459, you know, to be clear,
this bill was gotten amend.
[SPEAKER_00]: We anticipate it will be signed because it
was worked with very closely by the
[SPEAKER_00]: governor's office.
[SPEAKER_00]: And requested initially by the local
governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Local governments said we don't have
enough time to issue these local licenses
[SPEAKER_00]: to get through building planning,
get through fire approval.
[SPEAKER_00]: So give us more time beyond the temporary
license process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why we do think it will go and
get signed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is for all licensing authorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the one thing, there's one thing there
that I caught on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have a right to a provisional.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a temporary, the state may
grant you a provisional, but it's more,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to necessarily be sort of
like applying for your provisional.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's sounding more like it's going to be
a, your temp is expiring and we will grant
[SPEAKER_00]: you a provisional which has a one year
timeline on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you probably don't want to be granted
that provisional until December,
[SPEAKER_00]: frankly, if you can get it because you
want it to last as long as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just that it isn't necessarily going
to be something that you're applying for
[SPEAKER_00]: in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more an extension of the temp
licensing process.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you are working with a local
jurisdiction where I think we're going to
[SPEAKER_06]: see an uptick in what the local
jurisdictions are able to do, you want to
[SPEAKER_06]: make sure I think with the provisional
annuals that they have a bifurcated
[SPEAKER_06]: process because this is something that
we're running into with some of our
[SPEAKER_06]: clients where they try to unify it for
expediency.
[SPEAKER_06]: They can't grant, you're going to want
them to issue something akin to a business
[SPEAKER_06]: license that can be conditioned upon going
through a land use entitlement process.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they merge them together, they're not
going to be able to condition them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if they have to make CEQA findings,
even if you're going to try to do a notice
[SPEAKER_06]: of exemption or you're going to try to do
a mitigated neg deck, you still have to go
[SPEAKER_06]: through all of those 18 analysis areas
that are within the California
[SPEAKER_06]: Environmental Quality Act.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you may not be able to complete an air
quality analysis, a traffic analysis,
[SPEAKER_06]: those two being the biggest in that time
period.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if they can bifurcated out and issue
you something that they can condition
[SPEAKER_06]: while you go through the secondary process
or an RFP, that's something that you can
[SPEAKER_06]: engage with your local jurisdiction in if
they haven't quite gotten to the point of
[SPEAKER_06]: issuance and 1459 is passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one thing I heard also on that topic
was potentially a registry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Nevada County is looking at a
registry perhaps or the advocates will
[SPEAKER_00]: push for a registry because to go get
people on the list to go and say under
[SPEAKER_00]: your registry, you can go and apply for a
state temp, have it be non-operational,
[SPEAKER_00]: but having the state temp before the end
of the year grants you that opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: for the provisional.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's much more valuable to get a
state temp on December 31st even compared
[SPEAKER_00]: to trying to start through an annual
license process on January 1.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I imagine getting a state temp is
going to be especially challenging for
[SPEAKER_03]: people in localities such as Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_06]: That may be difficult, but do you know
that the BCC last year issued permits on
[SPEAKER_06]: Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and on New
Year's Eve, which I think they will be
[SPEAKER_06]: doing again, which means that I will be
spending holidays at the computer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the main thing with 1459 was that it
took care of two important issues with the
[SPEAKER_03]: state, which is one that they needed to
get revenue from the license holder.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since you don't pay your licensing fee
with the temp, they needed to get that
[SPEAKER_03]: annual license fee revenue coming into the
state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then two was the issue of the biggest
thing with the rollout and track and trace
[SPEAKER_03]: is going to be getting enough people to
get on it at the same time for it to have
[SPEAKER_03]: any meaning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if they just started piecemeal issuing
annuals now and you're the first person on
[SPEAKER_03]: track and trace, the system is useless
because you're just inputting everybody
[SPEAKER_03]: else's paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's the idea that you've got a
tracked cultivator getting through an
[SPEAKER_00]: untracked distro to a tracked or untracked
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a mixture of several.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a mix thereof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're deleting and creating tags
and there's no accountability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be rolled out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we've actually been suggesting
and arguing is that they're, not Jan 1
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, more like March 31 or April 1,
ideally, and not saying that we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to get this, but there should
be no more temps in the system when track
[SPEAKER_00]: and trace gets turned on so that everyone
can be and is required to be in the system
[SPEAKER_00]: when it does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it could happen, but they could turn
on much earlier and have to deal with that
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of mismatch in the consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But an ideal, a more ideal situation would
be wait till everyone can actually be in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Since metric is designed to go from zero,
like a traditional farming crop that
[SPEAKER_07]: Franwell is known for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that we'll find that,
I mean, I've heard that the state will
[SPEAKER_03]: probably have a lot more receptivity to
other fixes and issues when track and
[SPEAKER_03]: trace is implemented, because issues which
they're incredibly resistant to tackle
[SPEAKER_03]: right now, such as sampling and stuff like
that, becomes much more visible and
[SPEAKER_03]: controllable when they're actually is a
robust track and trace system happening
[SPEAKER_03]: and measuring every single little piece of
everything going around.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the other top line issues,
do we want to talk about 2020 right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're at, we're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just came from Hall of Flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just came from Hall of Flowers,
but that was at a fair ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So AB 2020 by Bill Quirk is a bill that's
also pending before the governor
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially would expand the number of
licensed or number of eligible venues.
[SPEAKER_00]: For onsite consumption, special events,
the bureau created the special event
[SPEAKER_00]: license in through regulations,
you know, for the in in the emergency
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There wasn't really a statutory basis for
it, but it goes and helps provide for
[SPEAKER_00]: additional consumption opportunities,
retail sale opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, by statute, it was limited to the
degree of the consumption itself was
[SPEAKER_00]: limited to fair ground areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what this bill goes and does is
expand the eligible locations for
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not just fairgrounds and district
ag associations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also could be wherever essentially a
city goes and licenses it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is a restricted access to 21
plus, no minors going and seeing the smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: and a couple of other conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it's a bill that it's anticipated
to be signed and it will go help cause an
[SPEAKER_00]: explosion of licensed events.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a licensed event is not necessarily a
compliant event.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Pam went to play with the more
compliant events she's seen just earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: this week.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, it just flew in from the Hall of
Flowers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was really interesting to see how a
compliant you can do a compliant event
[SPEAKER_06]: that has what I will say the version of
sampling because you still had to pay for
[SPEAKER_06]: your sample being very important.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was one centralized retailer that
everything went through.
[SPEAKER_06]: Interesting to note, it was not a retailer
that was located in Sonoma County or Santa
[SPEAKER_06]: Rosa.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it will be interesting to see where
those tax that the tax implications happen
[SPEAKER_06]: there with a retailer not based within the
county or the city where the embed was
[SPEAKER_06]: handled.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you got little tickets and you went up
and you had to pay a dollar plus the
[SPEAKER_06]: excise tax.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also a little weird since sometimes the
excise tax is embedded into the cost of
[SPEAKER_06]: the should be.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that is still how it went.
[SPEAKER_06]: This will sort of help.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think what we've seen more recently is
these pop up events.
[SPEAKER_06]: That occur and how does product get to
such an event because it cannot come from
[SPEAKER_06]: the manufacturer or the cultivator.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to go through QA QC.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to go through a retailer so that
the taxes are taken out and then it goes
[SPEAKER_06]: to the event.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this will kind of help streamline
getting events in more locations,
[SPEAKER_06]: which may then help operators to
understand that they need to be compliant
[SPEAKER_06]: while they're doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is if it's held at a licensed
facility that the city allows,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's going to be a lot more robust
regulation that goes within that because
[SPEAKER_06]: it's unfortunate with the level of pop up
events that I've been seeing.
[SPEAKER_06]: What would happen if track and trace were
truly online?
[SPEAKER_06]: And you had to account for how these
samples got to an event and didn't go
[SPEAKER_06]: through those proper channels and just
came.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a retailer, you're a manufacturer
and you bring your manufacturing product
[SPEAKER_06]: to a private venue.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't matter that that's a private
venue and isn't then eligible for going
[SPEAKER_06]: through the event license rhetoric.
[SPEAKER_06]: That product is still licensed product and
needs to follow their correct supply
[SPEAKER_06]: chain.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm hoping that 2020 does more to
instill an idea that you can have more
[SPEAKER_06]: events that therefore are responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think also there's other challenges
there with a special event license in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of the fee per event is a
thousand dollars and is there a 10 event
[SPEAKER_00]: cap as well as in the regulation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a proposed cap of 10 events per year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did it get diluted to four?
[SPEAKER_00]: There was talk about that on some of the
2641 stuff, but not in 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're still, well, I don't think we
are in a statutory cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sidebar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately there needs to be other changes
to the event language.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we appreciate the fact that this
language is being moved in, there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: just big questions on how events or NIF
events will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of that's tied into if everything
has to be sold by a licensed retailer and
[SPEAKER_00]: move through the supply chain by a
licensed distributor to that retailer,
[SPEAKER_00]: what incentive is there for retailers to
take a chance on brands they don't know?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have to have purchased that
product, if you have to have possession of
[SPEAKER_00]: that product for it to be at the event at
the booth of the manufacturer or
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator, it's going to disincentivize a
desire to go and allow emerging brands to
[SPEAKER_00]: go and be at these events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, and that's why there was
some discussion and movement on the bill
[SPEAKER_00]: 2641 earlier this year, which did not make
it through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was held in appropriation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's committee near the end of the year,
which will have allowed some degree of
[SPEAKER_00]: farm direct consumer direct access by
licensed producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even the underlying issue there is
there's just some structural issues with
[SPEAKER_00]: events and with running events through
distro and through retail that I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to address before we can have a
successful fix like 2641 or like something
[SPEAKER_00]: else is just we'd have more discussion
about how to make events work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in some of those same issues go
through the whole supply chain,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I was just discussing today,
how is a small cultivator or manufacturer
[SPEAKER_03]: supposed to attract a distributor without
the ability to provide them with a sample
[SPEAKER_03]: of their product?
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean you want to try something before
you commit to buying it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No need.
[SPEAKER_03]: No need.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do want to talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: We wanted to save some time on this
portion for any questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: That people have, but just to burn through
some other important ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's SBA 29, which is the compassionate
care license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's not compassionate care license.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they need to change the name of the
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, it's going to let licensed
retailers go and designate product for
[SPEAKER_00]: compassion.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's designated for compassion,
there can be no compensation for product
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been designated for compassion,
but you will not owe your sales and use
[SPEAKER_00]: tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: You will not owe your excise tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's designated at a producer level,
you will not owe your cultivation tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is truly a compassionate operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is not a way to get revenue to cover
the costs of doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for those that are either it's product
that's been sitting on the shelves for too
[SPEAKER_00]: long.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the way to go and not be taxed on
giving that product away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, the compassion license bill
SBA 29 by Senator Wiener the bill goes and
[SPEAKER_00]: expands who's eligible for compassion to
be not just people with ID cards and their
[SPEAKER_00]: caregivers, which is current law,
but statutorily expands it to be those who
[SPEAKER_00]: have a have a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's very exciting the opportunity
to go and be able to give cannabis to just
[SPEAKER_00]: two recommendation holders and not the
limited ID card holder universe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then allow businesses not to be taxed
and not be penalized for that
[SPEAKER_00]: compassionate activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We think that this is not the end of the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would hope that some of these you
may be able to be tax deductible in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future or there could be other
implications and incentives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was definitely a big fight for
compassion that we're hoping will get
[SPEAKER_00]: signed in the next two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there is SB 311 was the
distributed distributor transfers,
[SPEAKER_03]: which was just one that somebody realized
this was necessary.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you may know, the way that the
regulations work now is it's the last
[SPEAKER_03]: distributor to distribute that test the
product has to be the one to deliver it to
[SPEAKER_03]: the retailer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a distributor, if a retailer wanted to
or if a manufacturer wanted to had 1000
[SPEAKER_03]: products and wanted to give 100 to 10
different distributors, each distributor
[SPEAKER_03]: would have to test that product rendering
it unprofitable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this will allow distributors to
transfer to each other so that the one
[SPEAKER_03]: that test it can then can then transfer to
another distributor so you can have those
[SPEAKER_03]: distributed to more retailers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without having to retest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the big question we have with this
one, and I don't have an answer on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the bill is an urgency clause.
[SPEAKER_00]: Urgency clause means it takes effect
immediately.
[SPEAKER_00]: This type of idea of distro to distro
transfers was included in the bureau regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say 5307, but I'll have to look
later.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was it was in the bureau regs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the question is, even though the bill
takes effect immediately, the regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: have not been updated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would not be comfortable going
and advising clients to do these distro
[SPEAKER_00]: distro transfers with a COA unless there's
a signing statement or some other
[SPEAKER_00]: indication from the bureau from the
governor's office.
[SPEAKER_00]: They intend this to go and sort of
supplant the existing emergency
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations and allow for this activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully we will be able to do this
sooner.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if not, first week of December,
it would likely be included.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to leave enough time for questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So does anybody out there have a specific?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: A manufacturer or a grower have to send to
the distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when he sends to the distributor,
then the distributor has to test the
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's essentially now if you will send
the same product to another distributor,
[SPEAKER_02]: the same product, then again, the other
distributor also need to sample the same
[SPEAKER_02]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So SP 311 that we're just discussing would
go and address that issue by allowing the
[SPEAKER_00]: first distributor that gets the product
its final form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wouldn't be able to necessarily use
it for, you know, flour versus flour or
[SPEAKER_00]: versus stuff that's turned into carts or
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the first distro test its final form
can go and keep that certificate of
[SPEAKER_00]: analysis and transfer to distributors
downstream so that if you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, 100 units up in Humboldt County,
that they get tested up there and then
[SPEAKER_00]: move down to move down to Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 25 units are sold in the SF Bay
Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those would have to get tested
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other 75 go down to L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 50 are sold in the L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last 25 go down to San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of having to test it four
different times, it would all be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: be tested and kept with that first test up
in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the distro to distro, that's more of a
supply chain question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distro to distro transfers really solving
the issue of not having to test it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Repetitively and cost prohibitively.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if your distro does not have a
statewide infrastructure, you'd have to
[SPEAKER_00]: use multiple distros.
[SPEAKER_00]: Transport fee, QA fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least there won't be an additional
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the testing backlogs we've been
getting, this will be good to not recreate
[SPEAKER_00]: that problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the three of you seeing,
distributor to distributor, in the market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like are you seeing them charge other
distributors for that transfer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they can't do it yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bill hasn't been signed, so it's not
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do it for non-COA product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean like pre-COA product they can.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, but if it's pre-COA product,
then you're just paying a transport fee
[SPEAKER_06]: and then you're going to ultimately pay
the COA fee.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully that distributor has statewide
reach.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise you're going to be paying
multiple.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all depends on what your needs are,
what your target markets are, and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: costs look like, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd imagine you're going to have,
I mean, you could see a pathway for
[SPEAKER_03]: regional distributors, especially in areas
like up north where you might not have,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially when you have smaller growers
or smaller manufacturers where you need
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody to take that first chance or the
first leg of the visit, those are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: create a real good marketplace for a
regional distributor who's going to kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of take your product and rep it and get it
to the next phase of possibly then going
[SPEAKER_03]: to a statewide distributor that could save
you money in the great, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: expanse of getting it throughout in the
retailers throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think at that first level of jumping
it to getting it to market, you're going
[SPEAKER_03]: to have real niches for people to bring
new products to the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: It depends on what your footprint is,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: When you're first releasing a product,
typically you're going to try to do it in
[SPEAKER_06]: a market share that you can control versus
trying to saturate the entire market at
[SPEAKER_06]: first.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's about business dynamics and
growing your business, scaling up as to
[SPEAKER_06]: what that's going to be like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause if you also then just do a straight
to market strategy and try to saturate the
[SPEAKER_06]: state, can you scale up and provide the
state?
[SPEAKER_06]: So sometimes it's going to behoove you to
use a regional distributor to get your
[SPEAKER_06]: name out there first and then,
you know, expand to markets that you think
[SPEAKER_06]: that you would do well in.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may not want to be in every single
retailer across the state.
[SPEAKER_06]: You may want to target.
[SPEAKER_03]: So any other questions in the last few
moments?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of the, it could be a state,
it could be a city and so forth that will
[SPEAKER_01]: allow, you know, the testing research and
so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think 18% of the testing and so forth is
really not going through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say there's only 24 businesses
that's allowed and that could be the
[SPEAKER_01]: number.
[SPEAKER_01]: 24 businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's going to be so many
operations in terms of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: operations, possibly from the edibles and
cultivation and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shouldn't there be, have you guys or state
or anyone really look at some,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe we need to increase that number
because there's a lot of companies that
[SPEAKER_01]: will need to be tested and a minimum
amount of business operations may not be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to get through things as good as
possible or may not do the actual testing
[SPEAKER_01]: properly where it does come back,
you know, on a sales sample.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your turn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, we got problems,
Delora, with testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, January 1st, January 1st,
we're already, we're looking at the issue
[SPEAKER_03]: of the number of testing labs and who can
pass phase two.
[SPEAKER_03]: January 1st, we move into phase three.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many labs are prepared to do phase
three testing right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: One.
One.
[SPEAKER_00]: May, wait, which one do you think is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Rumor has it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to forget their name.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it Crestor?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not SC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might have one lab in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's rumored to be one in the state
that's ready for gen one testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in phase two testing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phase three testing or gen one testing
adds in heavy metals, adds in mycotoxins,
[SPEAKER_00]: adds in some residual water content.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there one more?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's something that begins with an M,
I think that I can't pronounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, the mycotoxins or?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, there was a mycotoxins and there was
a, anyway, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you were, if you were a forward
thinking manufacturer or cultivator and
[SPEAKER_03]: you're like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to make sure right now that my
products are ready for January one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get phase three tested right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm ready to go and back stock.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't, you can't be prepared for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, anticipated labs that are saying
they'll be ready by January one,
[SPEAKER_03]: 15, maybe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many are we at now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trying to pull up the actual number
of labs on my line.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these are these pieces of equipment I
think are always important to note.
[SPEAKER_06]: So expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what happens if this one lab or maybe
upwards of 15 get it and their equipment
[SPEAKER_06]: goes down.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as Julie always likes to point out,
you can't then send your sample somewhere
[SPEAKER_06]: else.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like if it's at this testing lab,
one of the 15, let's hope or one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that piece of equipment, which is so
expensive and we know that expensive
[SPEAKER_06]: equipment fails, ask hospitals,
they go through this all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're able to send samples out so that
you don't lose a life.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is using a distributed distributor
transfer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Previously, there's no lab to lab transfer
where they can be like, Oh dang,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you do this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is anyone asking for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it sounds like they're asking for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, because one of the things was it was
also that even if it's the same lab,
[SPEAKER_03]: so a lab like Steep Hill that has multiple
locations, the way that it was,
[SPEAKER_03]: they couldn't transfer it to another of
their own location.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully that part gets settled.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lab to lab to a different lab might just
make somebody's brain explode.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hopefully at least a lab would be able
to send it to its own remote location if
[SPEAKER_03]: they didn't have the piece of equipment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as you're saying, yeah, it would make
sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm sorry, the other thing that I
would say is that obviously we're having
[SPEAKER_03]: this huge problem of labs and you send it
to the same lab three times and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: different results.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as much as there's an urgency to say,
Oh my God, we need more labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I for one would have concerns of the fact
that they will issue a license to a lab
[SPEAKER_03]: before it's accredited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let me debunk that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of those, the highest percentage of
those fails was the label claims.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's important to read into that,
that it's not like, Oh my God,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's all poison.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's that most of it is not hitting that
10% window.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of label claims, which is an incredibly
difficult target to hit, especially when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're dealing with low dose items.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a 60, 60% were label.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: 60% of the fails were of label claim
failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: Label claim failures can be from being
outside of the percentages, or it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: having a claim of medicinal benefits or
impacts that can, that they're not allowed
[SPEAKER_00]: to go into 60% of the 20% failures,
60% of those were label claim.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of it was, I mean, some was
pesticides, some was ingredients,
[SPEAKER_03]: some, you know, there was a breakdown in
one of the things, but like you're saying
[SPEAKER_03]: for the public at large, where everybody
only reads the headline and goes,
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, California is poisoning
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's terrible.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is a good opportunity to bring
back our original panel, which is the
[SPEAKER_06]: comments.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when those 15 days come, these critical
15 days, and you don't see that they've
[SPEAKER_06]: addressed testing or any of these other
concepts that we talked about that are so
[SPEAKER_06]: important, it is that they hear from the
operators and the public that says,
[SPEAKER_06]: look, this is a concern to us.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to address it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the last time that you have to
be citizen empowering and tell them you
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to address the right thing,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And get in there where we want a
compassion license.
[SPEAKER_06]: If the compassion bill passes and they
don't do a compassion fee reduction to
[SPEAKER_06]: allow licensees that maybe go through a
social equity program to not pay the same
[SPEAKER_06]: fees at the state level that everybody
else pays, that's your window.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we get some of these bills passed
that give you more of a foundation to make
[SPEAKER_06]: the ask, then make the ask.
[SPEAKER_06]: So don't think it's over.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that that can be understated
because it's going to be 15 days possibly
[SPEAKER_06]: during Thanksgiving where people aren't
paying attention.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need to pay attention to the last 15
days we're going to have before we have to
[SPEAKER_06]: make legislative action to fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the one thing I'll say is that,
and this will feel a bit shameless,
[SPEAKER_00]: the public comment period is always,
those are always times for the public to
[SPEAKER_00]: weigh in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they will try to do a mass market
approach and where they are required to
[SPEAKER_00]: review and respond to comments.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a registered lobbyist.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my job as a lobbyist to go and talk
to and interface with regulators and have
[SPEAKER_00]: private discussions and try to go work on
these questions during the times that
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't the public comment periods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that my attorney friends here also
go and have these private conversations
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good attorney will be able to go and
have that engagement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the public comment period is
important, but also having, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: lobbying or consultant or legal counsel
that is actually going to work with you on
[SPEAKER_00]: talking to and engaging with the
regulators on your questions is critical
[SPEAKER_00]: as opposed to, because anyone can go and
submit public comments, but it's about
[SPEAKER_00]: following through between the comment
periods to hammer your point home is
[SPEAKER_00]: really how to go move the needle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've all, I think folks remember
the disappearance of the acreage cap
[SPEAKER_00]: between the CEQA document and the
regulations that came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The emergency rigs that came out two days
later, Monday was there, Thursday was
[SPEAKER_00]: gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's lobbying.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, and you see that suddenly a retail
store can have windows that are open to
[SPEAKER_03]: the public and everybody can see what's in
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's lobbying.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you can make a delivery order out of
your trunk in a car anywhere in
[SPEAKER_03]: California, that's lobbying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I got the drive-through licenses.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lobbied for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you can do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: What makes our job easier sometimes is to
see that groundswelling of support,
[SPEAKER_06]: but strategically you want to be working
with your consultants, with your
[SPEAKER_06]: attorneys, and then also making public
comment because it's the trifecta of that
[SPEAKER_06]: coming together that forces action.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to see you, Courtney.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are we doing on time?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're up.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, take it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Take it.
