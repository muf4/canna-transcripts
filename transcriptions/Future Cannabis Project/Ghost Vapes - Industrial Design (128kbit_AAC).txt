[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't you tell us what's on the menu
today?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're finishing out, we're extending the
month by a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we really feel about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel very good about how inexpensive it
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: The container looks awesome though.
[SPEAKER_02]: The container feels like classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the lightest thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, it is not high-end.
[SPEAKER_06]: It feels very, very light and inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you compare that to quality,
that's glass.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is like 20 times the weight of that
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then this is, I believe, also a brand
of THC Design called Resin, and its
[SPEAKER_02]: crescendo is the strain.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's only going to get better.
[SPEAKER_06]: And louder and bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice, nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, however, the most difficult lid
to get off because it's a teeny tiny thing
[SPEAKER_02]: and uses a pressure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it looks like it's taped shut as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, trust me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Except for that part?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, it's not taped shut.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's child-proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's child-proof in the sense that if
your hands are at all oily, it's almost
[SPEAKER_02]: impossible to get them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're already high, just give it
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, you have to just leave the lid off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably just do this head-to-head.
[SPEAKER_04]: So while he's struggling with that,
I'd like to turn our attention to the head
[SPEAKER_04]: of engineering, who's this guy right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I thought would be cool is to have a
conversation about industrial design.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the trade-offs that go into product
development and the MacGyvering of
[SPEAKER_04]: solutions to make something happen that
you want to happen that doesn't currently
[SPEAKER_04]: exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you kind of talk about the product
development process of developing the
[SPEAKER_04]: Ghost Vape?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you hand me the Ghost Vape,
please?
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless your hands are too oily from all
the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you want the constructed one or the
unconstructed one?
[SPEAKER_06]: The constructed one is perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Deconstructed or fully constructed?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's your baby.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's our baby.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's very iconic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the shape, the form, there's
nothing out there like it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that in and of itself, from an
industrial design standpoint, is a goal,
[SPEAKER_06]: definitely, to get something where people
first don't know what it is, and then they
[SPEAKER_06]: start to become familiar with it enough to
know that, wow, that's a ghost.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can recognize that immediately.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is kind of like the visual
recognition we have from this form and
[SPEAKER_06]: shape.
[SPEAKER_06]: A couple really cool things about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: One is that the device just fits in your
hand.
[SPEAKER_06]: So comfortably, the ergonomics of this
make you, even no matter how you hold it
[SPEAKER_06]: in your hand initially, eventually you
find the right spot because it just leads
[SPEAKER_06]: your hand to the right position.
[SPEAKER_06]: And part of that is due to this cutout
here for your thumb, which when you're
[SPEAKER_06]: vaping and there's a little button that's
kind of like disguised in that surface,
[SPEAKER_06]: but you can feel it really nicely.
[SPEAKER_06]: And most of it is that your hand is in the
perfect position when you're ready to vape
[SPEAKER_06]: and when you're activating the vape
button.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the other part I love about this
design is that the rounds and the shape of
[SPEAKER_06]: this make you want to play with it a
little bit, make you want to just move
[SPEAKER_06]: your thumb around on there until you find
the perfect spot.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's very, very comfortable in that
position.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing that I really like about
it is this belly in the front here,
[SPEAKER_06]: which actually has a technical purpose.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, really helps you grab it so that I
know exactly where my fingers are going to
[SPEAKER_06]: go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's almost like the handle of something
that's really comfortable to hold.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my thumb goes there and that's just,
you know, that's just perfect.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what is the technical purpose of that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the center part is what actually we
have patents on and does all the air
[SPEAKER_06]: handling and the cooling and the heating
of the flow through the device.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you draw here, you're actually
pulling air through this heat sink and
[SPEAKER_06]: down through the outer collar of this
basically a pipe.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when it gets down to where the heater
is, it actually preheats by moving back
[SPEAKER_06]: and forth across where the heater is
located, preheating your air.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it goes through the cannabis in
the crucible.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then it does the same thing in reverse
up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: It actually cools down.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this tunnel is the right size to be
able to deal with that airflow,
[SPEAKER_06]: the crucible inside with the material in
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the preheat and the cool down cycles
are just right and balanced so that you
[SPEAKER_06]: can get a really good cool draw from it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the draw is very, very cool and
comfortable versus other things that might
[SPEAKER_06]: be a little bit harsh or sometimes it's
hard to even quantify it, but it feels
[SPEAKER_06]: like it's just a little bit harsh in the
throat.
[SPEAKER_06]: This doesn't do that just because it's
cooling, cooling the vapor down before it
[SPEAKER_06]: gets to your mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the compromise is that you're exposing
this feature from the insides.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really a pipe so some of it has to be
exposed underneath or the shape of it
[SPEAKER_06]: requires the outer enclosure to be the
shape.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, it works perfectly because that's
where your fingers go naturally.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the benefit of this shape and
that's the technical limitation if you
[SPEAKER_06]: want to call it that that we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's also extremely easy to get this
heat sink out and to clean it,
[SPEAKER_06]: which I really love about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's funny because as soon as you open
this, it may not be intuitively obvious as
[SPEAKER_06]: to how to take this out because it's meant
to integrate really well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I found that the best way is just
really to push the green area and it just
[SPEAKER_06]: comes right up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's one of the struggles,
I think, because that part of this device
[SPEAKER_06]: is not as intuitive as I would have liked
it to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: But once you know it, it's super,
super easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you don't come from a background of
developing vape devices.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when the challenge is laid in front,
were you a vaporizer smoker?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have experience with lots of
different vape products and like I could
[SPEAKER_04]: do it better?
[SPEAKER_06]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had personal experience in the category.
[SPEAKER_06]: For years, I've been either smoking
because I didn't know of vaporizers or
[SPEAKER_06]: using a bong or something like that,
joints.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I knew nothing about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: My background and my whole professional
career has been in consumer products.
[SPEAKER_06]: Product design.
[SPEAKER_06]: So anything from computer joysticks to
Lego, to water pitchers, coffee makers,
[SPEAKER_06]: things that are very high touch products
sell in amazingly large volumes and
[SPEAKER_06]: integrate technology in a really
meaningful and interesting way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with this, you now know what the
homework assignment is.
[SPEAKER_04]: What did you like start researching and
reading up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like talk about the process of what was
the mandate?
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it like?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have a price point?
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you have a product size or weight?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think what it all comes down
to is trying as much of the competitive
[SPEAKER_06]: units that are out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to give everything a shot.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether or not you think you know it,
you have to use it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't look at anything and assume
either by the way it looks or by what
[SPEAKER_06]: you've heard on the market that you know
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yeah, there's a lot of background
research.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can we talk about what you liked?
[SPEAKER_04]: What products were you trying out and what
were you like, oh, this is kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: ingenious or I could improve on this part.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think, you know, each one has its
own limitations, as ours does as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there are some limitations here
and there, but I'm trying to think of what
[SPEAKER_06]: might jump out as being, you know,
something that was... Like as an example
[SPEAKER_04]: for me, the first dryer vaporizer I ever
tried was the Vapir.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember the one that was like it had a
long straw at the top.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you guys ever try that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think so, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and they were for me the first one
and I was like this thing is brilliant.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I think the first one I really
tried and again, I'm a relative newcomer
[SPEAKER_06]: to the category, but I think the one I
tried was the Pax just because everyone
[SPEAKER_06]: was talking about it and it seemed very
consumer product-y.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, very like a consumer product and
so I used it and you know compared to
[SPEAKER_06]: smoking a bowl, there's a lot of
convenience there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But one of the things I really didn't like
is the flavor and the taste.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just kind of, you know, it didn't... the
flavor to me kind of tasted burned or I
[SPEAKER_06]: guess I've heard people say popcorn-y and
that's kind of what I tasted as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as you disassemble a product like
that, did you identify like why it has a
[SPEAKER_04]: burnt taste to it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why was that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think there's a lot of... the way
that the material is heated up has a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: to do with it and the fewer... the less
contact you can have of hot surfaces with
[SPEAKER_06]: the cannabis itself, the better because as
soon as you heat things up, the contact
[SPEAKER_06]: just burns things.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just going to be like leaning up
against a really hot engine of a car.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're gonna burn yourself.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the weed suffers from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where the ghost is different is that we're
actually just sending hot air.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's true convection and convection is...
the heat is actually distributed into the
[SPEAKER_06]: air and the air goes through all the parts
of the consumable that's inside there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not a hot surface touching any of
the... The way to look at it, probably the
[SPEAKER_02]: best example for this in this specific
case here, is the difference between an
[SPEAKER_02]: electric stove and a gas stove.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the PAX is an electric stove and that
with electric stove, you turn it on,
[SPEAKER_02]: the coils take a while to heat up,
it heats your pan up, and then once
[SPEAKER_02]: you've...
[SPEAKER_02]: once you're done cooking, you turn that
off, but the coils take a while to cool
[SPEAKER_02]: down, the pan takes a while to cool down,
everything has to take time to cool down.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the PAX.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's any conduction vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the PAX.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Mighty.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the Solo.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's every other vaporizer on the market
except maybe the Firefly.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ghost, being an on-demand vaporizer,
is much more like a convection stove where
[SPEAKER_02]: you put your pan down, you turn it on,
gas comes on, heats immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you're done cooking, you turn the gas
off, heat dies immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because we're using a medical grade
ceramic crucible, that heat dissipates
[SPEAKER_02]: from the crucible, which is what we're
cooling the flour in, that heat dissipates
[SPEAKER_02]: from the crucible very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as soon as you turn the heat off,
as soon as you let go of that button,
[SPEAKER_02]: you stop drawing, you stop applying heat
to the flour and makes it extremely
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient, which is probably the... I
think it's the only device that I've ever
[SPEAKER_02]: used that has that same kind of
functionality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by the way, while we're talking about
this critical functionality, let's pack
[SPEAKER_04]: that with some... What are we gonna start
with first?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do the gift.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start with some CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start light, because I think this is
my favorite demonstration of the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is actually a great example of the
biggest problem that I have with the
[SPEAKER_02]: ghost, which is that I am incapable of
grinding a single crucible worth.
[SPEAKER_06]: You have to just grind a hell of a lot
more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because no matter how tiny of a nug I
grab, it's always too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually don't know if I have... Do
I have an empty crucible?
Oh, heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Empty crucible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so a great example is if you try to
use... If you were to try to grind for
[SPEAKER_02]: like a joint or a bong or anything,
this amount would just not be enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like a teeny tiny little nug.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this teeny tiny little nug will
probably be a little bit too much for a
[SPEAKER_02]: crucible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a tenth of a gram is a lot smaller
than you ever imagined, particularly when
[SPEAKER_02]: you grind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I personally like to use our
Phoenician grinder that we have branded
[SPEAKER_02]: here, because it gives a very kind of
coarse, loose grind, which is really ideal
[SPEAKER_02]: for convection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so can you actually talk about the
coarseness of grind and different... Why
[SPEAKER_04]: is a coarser grind better versus a finer
grind?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you think about it, what Steve was
describing about the airflow is because
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not baking, because we're not
heating the actual oven that the material
[SPEAKER_02]: is kept in, because we're heating it by
drawing air across it, if you grind too
[SPEAKER_02]: fine or you pack too tight, there's no
space for the air to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so typically, if you grind it too fine
or pack it too tight, what you'll end up
[SPEAKER_02]: at the end is a hot crucible and no vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll find nothing coming out of the end,
but the crucible itself will be very hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that means that the air has nowhere to
go, and it's just getting stuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you grind it really loose,
and you pack it nice and loose,
[SPEAKER_02]: it gives that air plenty of space to
travel over the flour, to transmit its
[SPEAKER_02]: heat, to heat it up, to create that vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really even distribution is what we're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I personally like this grinder as
well, because it's got this nice rounded
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom that happens to perfectly fit the
contours of our crucible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a nice... Do you want to get
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a nice, loose grind.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to just straight out of the
crucible, straight out of the grinder,
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to just kind of scoop it up pretty
loosely, give it a nice little brush off
[SPEAKER_02]: the top there, it's not too much,
pack it nice and loose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can kind of see that it's packed
pretty loosely in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can see space around it, and that's
ideal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're satisfied with that packing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm pretty satisfied.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have high hopes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got really high hopes that this is
going to produce a lot of vapor for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I see my device here?
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things that I like about the
crucible system as well is that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: prepack a bunch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have this nice little crucible
dispenser.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't bring that.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we'll bring you one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the on-the-go... They've been so
popular, we had such a hard time keeping
[SPEAKER_02]: them in stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: We finally have them back in stock,
and we're sending them all out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whose idea was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really not sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just whoever first said, oh,
I want to have a whole bunch of these with
me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to be able to prepack,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: During my day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So whoever said that was the one who
invented it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like Steve was saying, once we actually
load the crucible in here, if you notice,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are tiny, tiny perforations on the
bottom of it and on the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And those are specifically so that the air
can travel through the flower and not get
[SPEAKER_02]: caught there and not heat the crucible too
much and not heat it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the air is going to be superheated
down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to draw it up through the
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to go up through the heat sink.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we're talking about comparison to
other devices, that heat sink is probably
[SPEAKER_02]: the biggest difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, when I tried the packs myself,
the thing that bothered me the most was
[SPEAKER_02]: that that mouthpiece got really hot,
really fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like after one draw or so, I felt... I
remember feeling a tingling on my lips.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, that's a strange feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I realized that it was because
the whole device was getting too hot with
[SPEAKER_02]: one hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this, because of the heat sink and the
fact that the mouthpiece is actually
[SPEAKER_02]: separating, separated from the rest of the
device.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like one of those no heat pan
handles, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The mouthpiece never gets hot,
even at high temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where's my phone?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're going right into the app.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, because the reason I'm going
into the app here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have five presets, preset
temperatures of 338, 362, 392,
[SPEAKER_02]: 405, and then 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe those are the five.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, hilariously enough, actually,
because we're converting from Celsius,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's all based in Celsius and
we're converting, it is impossible to set
[SPEAKER_02]: it to 420.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a huge oversight, but we'll fix
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the downside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every vaporizer that's based on the
Celsius temperature scale can't hit 420,
[SPEAKER_02]: just because of the conversion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, so I will connect it to my app.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I want to connect it to the
app is so that I can set the temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically for Mersenne and Limonene and
Pinene, which are at a very specific
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature that I have saved to my phone
in a fantastic little graph that I keep
[SPEAKER_02]: track of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Pinene is at 311 degrees is when that
terpene vaporizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mersenne is at 334 and Limonene is at 349.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I'm going to do is I'm going to
set this, my custom temperature here,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can set the custom temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to set the temperature here
to 311 in my first temperature here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to get us mostly Pinene.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's at lowest temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because it's a convection vaporizer,
your lungs are part of the machine,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the volcano is going to use a fan
to blow the air across it, but here we're
[SPEAKER_02]: using our lungs to draw it across.
[SPEAKER_04]: So interestingly, I was using this with
Cameron, Jody, and Andy from Fiddler's
[SPEAKER_04]: Greens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your expectation is you're going to blow
out this huge billowy puff of smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't, which I think from an end user
standpoint, you're like, is it working?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're high as fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you guys talk about that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I think perception wise,
people are expecting that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, is this thing now?
[SPEAKER_04]: I kept thinking I needed to crank up the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm actually really glad you asked that
because this is something that I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: like a passion project of mine most
recently, which is there isn't a ton of
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: Surprise, surprise.
[SPEAKER_02]: People haven't done research.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would argue that if you're getting
the flavor and if you're getting the
[SPEAKER_02]: effect, it kind of doesn't matter if
you're getting visible vapor, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're just saying is that you're
used to blowing out a cloud, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're blowing out a cloud,
you're likely at a very high temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: and are vaporizing pretty much everything
all in one go, which is a huge waste,
[SPEAKER_02]: or you're combusting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you're using a poorly
constructed conduction vaporizer,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're combusting, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to get to a too high of a
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that case, you're actually
producing smoke, not vapor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think there's an end user education
because that's the perception.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're like, this must not be working
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other thing, too, is as soon as you
start exhaling and all that vapor goes
[SPEAKER_06]: out, that's vapor that you're not
consuming.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're just bringing into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: None of it has actually attached or very
little of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you're exhaling back out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's some element of less vapor is
actually better in that you're retaining
[SPEAKER_06]: more and you're consuming it in a more
delicate way.
[SPEAKER_06]: We will get vapor at higher temperatures
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you'll even get vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll even find at the lower
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: I found that this is right now at 311
degrees, which is a common temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: that you don't get any vapor from.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even on just the second puff,
I already got some vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of it is a matter of the cure of
the flow or how moist it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you have to dry it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people grind their flour and then
let it sit out for an hour before they
[SPEAKER_02]: actually vape it because you want to give
it a chance to dry out.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is pining.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this tastes very much like pine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes if you hit the right
temperature, particularly with this flour,
[SPEAKER_02]: the biggest downside is that if you hit
the temperature between pining and
[SPEAKER_02]: limonene, which is about 338, which is our
lowest preset, you get this almost
[SPEAKER_02]: pine-sol flavor because you get the lemon
and the pine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good flavor, but it also has a
reminiscence of...
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, did someone just take a dump
into my smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I poisoning myself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I accidentally just drink some
pineapple?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are you being a Vapog?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I was going to ask, are we going
to... Is it going around the circle?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know about this.
[SPEAKER_06]: The circle is very small, I think,
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: The circle is a dot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to hit the pining?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to set it up?
[SPEAKER_06]: Pining?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me just do what you were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hit the pining first, then we'll set it
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can also do this really fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can temperature step.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can start at the low temperatures,
take one long 15-second draw, then step it
[SPEAKER_02]: up to a slightly higher temperature,
take another 15-second draw.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to talk about getting big
clouds, if you start at these lower
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures...
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, see?
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is still at 311 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not changed the temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still at 311.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the fourth or fifth hit?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's the fourth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so with flour that's really dried
out or kind of old stuff, you'll find that
[SPEAKER_02]: it vapes at the lower temperatures very
easily, sometimes too easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's usually because it's very dried
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I found that a lot of my old stuff
that I've had for a long time vapes at
[SPEAKER_02]: just about any temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: But good stuff that's well preserved,
well cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed you've got the Boveda packets.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you use those to keep that... Yeah,
so if you use those to keep your flour at
[SPEAKER_02]: a good moisture level, chances are pretty
good that before you put it into the ghost
[SPEAKER_02]: or any vaporizer, you're going to want to
either let it dry out a bit or hit it at a
[SPEAKER_02]: really low temperature to activate it
more.
[SPEAKER_06]: So are we boosting this baby now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's give Daniel a try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, hi Daniel.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to go all the way around?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to try?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: While I'm doing this, give me some more,
let's hit the industrial design part of
[SPEAKER_04]: the conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we talked about the crucible and the
heating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a challenge that took a long time
to find a clever solution to.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, in a lot of these devices,
I think the layout is fairly
[SPEAKER_06]: straightforward on a lot of these.
[SPEAKER_06]: The air is going to pass through a heater
and then pass through the material and
[SPEAKER_06]: then go into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think where it becomes difficult is
managing the firmware and figuring out
[SPEAKER_06]: what the temperature set points are going
to be.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's not as glamorous as you might
think, but that's where most of the
[SPEAKER_06]: challenges come in.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you drive the heater with the
batteries you have to consume the least
[SPEAKER_06]: amount of power, but provide the most
longevity and have the most efficient
[SPEAKER_06]: thing?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a balance in engineering about proper
use of the battery, I think.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we want to be right sized as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So consuming the battery in the right
amount to deal with someone's expected
[SPEAKER_06]: session use.
[SPEAKER_06]: How many times are you going to pass it
around before you exchange the bowl?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there's a lot of science and
engineering that goes into that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: From an ID perspective, a lot of it's all
about ergonomics.
[SPEAKER_06]: And balance.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the other important part of this
is, for instance, the front enclosure on
[SPEAKER_06]: this device is all cast zinc, which adds a
forward weighting to it and balances very
[SPEAKER_06]: well so that when you're holding it in
your hand, it just feels right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of the times weight contributes
to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the reason you use cast zinc or is
that just a bonus?
[SPEAKER_04]: It also has to do with temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: So talk about what is cast zinc good for?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why does one use cast zinc?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, good question.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think a lot of it is durability for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of plastics that can do
that, but zinc is very bio neutral.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very safe material.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's also super strong and it adds the
right amount of weight.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you think about making it out of
aluminum, that wouldn't be as heavy and
[SPEAKER_06]: wouldn't give it that quality feel.
[SPEAKER_06]: It also is very, very durable.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we were to make this out of,
say, plastic and you dropped it on the
[SPEAKER_06]: ground in cold weather, it would probably
likely be a brittle failure.
[SPEAKER_06]: This material is strong everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when we design something, we have to
anticipate all the use and all the abuse
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are going to drop it out of their
pocket.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are going to leave it in their cars
overnight or even on the dashboard
[SPEAKER_06]: underneath their window.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you design a product, you have to
think about all those edge cases because
[SPEAKER_06]: they're not as uncommon as you think
they'd be.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's just something that you have to
design for, that people are going to abuse
[SPEAKER_06]: the product.
[SPEAKER_06]: What happens when they do that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Hopefully they get to use it another day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's the goal of the design team.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, so some of this leads into having to
make trade-offs when you develop a product
[SPEAKER_04]: of things you want to maybe put in it,
like materials or features.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you also want to hit a price point.
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you talk about something that you
wanted to do, but you had to leave on the
[SPEAKER_04]: idea floor because you couldn't hit the
price point you wanted to hit for the
[SPEAKER_04]: market?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would have to say that where there's a
bit of product improvement that could
[SPEAKER_06]: happen on this and that where I think you
use the word compromise, I think that's a
[SPEAKER_06]: reasonable word here, is that the
interface was initially thought of to be
[SPEAKER_06]: simple.
[SPEAKER_06]: With one button, you can get everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, with that simplicity has a little
bit of user interface issues.
[SPEAKER_06]: And while certainly it's easier for people
who are programming it, it's that one
[SPEAKER_06]: button and how long you hold it and in
what order is critical.
[SPEAKER_06]: And give you the right output.
[SPEAKER_06]: The user these days wants to just push the
button and go.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they want it to know they want it to
be as smart as they are.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want it to anticipate everything that
they want without saying it.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's kind of what our devices do now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, we took the route of one
button does all and it really does a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of things that many vapes don't do just
from the button alone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most vapes need the ones that are app
connected need that app to give it that
[SPEAKER_06]: additional versatility.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the I think the the biggest
comparison is the Firefly is the only
[SPEAKER_02]: other real convection vaporizer out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after using it, they also only have a
single button, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that button, all it does is turn it on
and off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all it does is start the start the
temperature increasing and stop the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature from increasing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you're required to use an app.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't want to have to use your
app, you're kind of out of luck.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's right.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, sometimes I just want to sit on my
porch and, you know, use my ghost vape.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't want to have to worry about
where my phone is.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I don't care what the phone is.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I'm here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm ready to vape.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to relax.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why should I get my phone?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have the ability to of adjusting
many, many things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, that's important what the
device does without an app at all,
[SPEAKER_06]: without being app enabled.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people don't want to attach their
device to an app.
[SPEAKER_06]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it has to be as capable there as it is
with the app.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I like is that you can use the
app to set it, and then you don't have to
[SPEAKER_02]: use the app.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can use the app to set the two
custom temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once you've set them,
you don't have to use the app again.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just switch to those custom
temperatures and know that they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I've got one of the custom
temperatures set to whatever 349 right
[SPEAKER_02]: now, which is the liminine, which we're
going to hit next.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I've got the other custom
temperature set to 428, which I always
[SPEAKER_02]: like to clean up any bowl I like.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, I think another let's not
say compromise, but design selection has
[SPEAKER_06]: been the battery.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, the batteries are super capable,
has two 18650 cells in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what you can do is integrate the cells
themselves into the device and close the
[SPEAKER_06]: door.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some people do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people, you know, but what we decided
to do was make this a custom battery
[SPEAKER_06]: integrated with the back so that you're
really using the least amount of wall
[SPEAKER_06]: thickness that you need to make the
plastic do what it needs to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are a lot of different ways of doing
this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in this case, it's an extremely
ergonomic and and nice touch.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, those decisions aren't easy
for any designers or developers.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's so many options out there on which
way to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: You really have to think about usability
and, you know, refurbishment.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, just there's a lot of different
considerations to battery selection.
[SPEAKER_06]: How long you want it to last, you know,
we decided to make ours last a hell of a
[SPEAKER_06]: long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, and so that's that's what
we have here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something that maybe is slightly bigger
than than others.
[SPEAKER_06]: But again, with the ergonomics,
you don't feel it as much.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it really gives you the the feel of a
super capable device.
[SPEAKER_06]: And and it gives you, you know,
you know, vaping as for as long as you
[SPEAKER_06]: need.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the other the other advantage that
once you start looking at the once you
[SPEAKER_02]: start considering the idea of a removable
battery, being able to take it out,
[SPEAKER_02]: probably one of my favorite accessories is
the fast charger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Being able to have particularly having two
batteries, being able to just pop one out,
[SPEAKER_02]: leave one always on the fast charger on
the desktop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then whenever I even basically
whenever I leave my house, I just grab
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever the charger is on the whatever
battery is on the charger and pop it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know every time I've got a full
charge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it makes it super, super easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are plenty of devices that have
batteries that have good batteries,
[SPEAKER_02]: also have 18650s, but they all plug in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're if you're about to head out
and you realize that your vape is dead,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to bring a portable battery.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really cool about this battery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, give it to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that you can charge it through USB.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't need a custom charger.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you don't even need to put on the fast
charger.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just take the battery out and
charge it via the USB.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you can.
[SPEAKER_06]: I hope you haven't been wasting your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here I am using a fast charger.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can charge it this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: But but the benefit to that is I don't
have, you know, wherever I have a USB
[SPEAKER_06]: cable, I can charge it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't need to.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, now it's dead and go home to my custom
charger.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I mean, not to keep using this word,
but the firefly does that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I actually have a firefly that I've
been playing with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, whenever you go somewhere,
you have to either make sure that the
[SPEAKER_06]: battery is like fully charged or bring the
charger along with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd rather just bring my USB cable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do like I mean, I have so many different
types of devices.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a camera equipment, audio
equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have smoking equipment and anything that
uses standard standardization is beautiful
[SPEAKER_04]: versus proprietary.
[SPEAKER_04]: Proprietary drives me crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where that's kind of the the
idea of balance as well is that we have
[SPEAKER_02]: the removable battery with a proprietary
connector and a proprietary fast charger
[SPEAKER_02]: that you can sit at home and you can
charge nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like you were saying, if you're on the
go, if you've got a bunch of other devices
[SPEAKER_02]: that also use micro USB, you're never
without a charger.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have that kind of flexibility in
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just tried some dryer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to mix it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go straight to the you want to go
straight to the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have our concentrate expert in the
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really quick before I move from the
concentrates, though, I'd like to point
[SPEAKER_02]: out with flower vaporizers, with dryer
vaporizers like this, the the biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: judge and one of the best judges of them
is what your flower looks like afterwards.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so here's here's the example here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had what I had like I took like four
hits before I passed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So four or five, six, seven, eight,
nine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I took another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll just call it 10 hits at 311
degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is not even brown.
[SPEAKER_02]: This this specific crucible, I could bump
this up to probably three forty nine,
[SPEAKER_02]: get another four or five good hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I could probably get another five or
six good hits at four twenty eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always tell people, depending on how
you use it, depending on the temperatures,
[SPEAKER_02]: depending on your process, you can get a
whole heck of a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how many more hits are you going to
could you get from that across all the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature ranges?
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably another six to ten.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Realistically, that's after another
already taking nine hits out of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So conceptually, that's actually pretty
interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea of almost like trotting your
terpene intake of like, yeah, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_04]: do this slice and I'm going to get these
terpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this specific terpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to like move on over to the
limonene or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I great example of that, what I like
to do is there are there are two
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids that I love.
[SPEAKER_02]: Delta nine THC and THCV.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I love them is they're both
euphorians.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they give you that kind of euphoria
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Delta nine THC vaporizes at three
hundred fifteen degrees, which is very,
[SPEAKER_02]: very low.
[SPEAKER_02]: And THCV vaporizes at four hundred twenty
eight degrees, which is typically what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're getting when you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're smoking at all, whether a joint,
a bong, any thing, you're getting a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: heck of a lot more of that THCV because
it's at that high temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of the reasons why you
associate this kind of euphoria high with
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a very common, it's a very common
feeling when you smoke in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why a lot of people find
vaporizing is a very different experience
[SPEAKER_02]: because you typically aren't hitting it at
that four hundred twenty eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're getting these kind of in
between cannabinoids that give you a
[SPEAKER_02]: little more, sometimes a little more
mellow high and a little difference to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like three fifteen and four twenty
eight allows you to really like dial in
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for concentrates, what I like is that
we use this, we use the same crucible
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's the same medical grade ceramic
crucible, same stainless steel lid.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we drop in the stainless steel mesh
pad and the pad is what actually captures
[SPEAKER_02]: the melting and concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you stick a little rice grain size
amount on the pad and then on the first
[SPEAKER_02]: heat up, it melts it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then every other draw after that,
you're really kind of vaping this
[SPEAKER_02]: stainless steel sponge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, that's holding all that
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: What that also allows that I like is that
you can then once you're done,
[SPEAKER_02]: pop the whole thing out and drop
everything in isopropyl and it just kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of cleans itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So easily the easiest cleanup for
concentrates.
So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have anything else you wanted to
add about concentrates and going on to
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate some when you're when you're
vaping it on the pad, the pad actually
[SPEAKER_01]: lets you get all your concentrates out of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not really wasting anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not too sure if you guys ever dab and
you guys ever dab, you guys have to clean
[SPEAKER_01]: it with a Q-tip after and you're cleaning
up, you're cleaning up all that
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: As with the MB1, you're actually vaping
all of it out of the pad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're getting the full use out of your
concentrate, which is crazy because you
[SPEAKER_01]: can get like 15 to 20 hits off of a
concentrate pad.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes back just as just to the
efficiency of the device with flour with a
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate super efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, a tenth of a gram compared to
other vapes on the market where they use
[SPEAKER_01]: point three grams and we're using point
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're saving them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're saving a lot of a lot of flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And going back to what they were saying
about the heating system, if you're just
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing the button there and you're not
drawing your materials, not burning,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, because your lungs part of the
system, it becomes part of the vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm sitting here just pushing the
button, my material is not going to burn.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to waste, which means it's
not going to combust either since there's
[SPEAKER_01]: no contact with that heating element in
your material.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for concentrates, you're really only
hitting it when you're taking a draw.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're pulling heat across it is when
you're... Because we're still,
[SPEAKER_02]: even for the concentrates, we're still
using the same convection heating.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still heating in the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get all the same benefits of the
on-demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of the only devices that you can
take out of your pocket to take a hit of
[SPEAKER_02]: your concentrates and then put it back in
your pocket.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're making me anxious here by just
holding that ready to be put in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wanted to show that this is all
you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is about a little less than a rice
grain size amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all you need.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you drop it right here in the middle of
the screen here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a pro at the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my first jar of it, but I'm pretty
happy about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So drop it right there in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you usually want to... For
concentrates, you want solids,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's too liquid, it's just going to
melt all the way down through and you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't want that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to go with the more solid,
the better, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I said, the same one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have anything else on the
concentrates?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I think we covered most of it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So put in the same crucible, stick in the
same device.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all the same stuff, which makes it
a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then for concentrates, we have one
setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll change the setting on the device
up from my custom all the way up to three
[SPEAKER_02]: reds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Three reds means concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important that you don't try to do
herbs in the concentrate mode,
[SPEAKER_02]: because concentrate is at a much higher
temperature, understandably, and you will
[SPEAKER_02]: just burn your flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's not a good experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the efficiency purposes,
we preheat the device for concentrate
[SPEAKER_02]: mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So normally when you press the button,
you're going to start heating and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to start drawing after about seven
or 10 seconds to start drawing the heat
[SPEAKER_02]: across it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for concentrates, we're going to press
and hold and you'll see it'll start
[SPEAKER_02]: blinking as if we should be drawing right
now, but instead it's preheating.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're preheating the air down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of getting everything set up
and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll take about... Like auto set up in a
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, in a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so once the yellow lights on,
then you know that you're at concentrate
[SPEAKER_02]: level and you're ready to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will actually turn down.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you let it sit here for too long,
it'll turn back to green because it's
[SPEAKER_02]: cooled down too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at concentrate level, we'll press it
and you can just start drawing
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to draw relatively slowly
because you're drawing that heat across
[SPEAKER_02]: and letting that concentrate melt into the
pad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then going back to efficiency,
like they were saying on the device,
[SPEAKER_01]: with your material, with your flour,
especially once you're done using it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell people not to throw it away and
save it because you can make edibles out
[SPEAKER_01]: of it later.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could really get that full life
cycle out of your material that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using in your vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I know their prices are getting
expensive now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an eighth, instead of rolling you three
joints, you could have 35 crucibles,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's a super... It's really
efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's efficient with all the material that
you're using.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to the... I've always... I've
started, since I started using the Ghost,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've transitioned from buying really cheap
eighths to buying really nice grams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have wheat that I only smoke in vapes
because they have certain cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: certain terpenes that I want to hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's certain wheat that I just
smoke out of a bong or a joint because I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't care about them, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So what terpenes are you exploring?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really like Wonder Brick because they
have a bunch of different cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_01]: their flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because of that, you're able to hit
different flavors, you'll get different
[SPEAKER_01]: highs with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because a lot of people just want THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with those terpenes, that's where you
get the different flavors and things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I don't always look for the
highest THC flour, but the ones with the
[SPEAKER_01]: most different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Wonder Brick has a bunch of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so what is your current Wonder Brick
favorite?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like the blueberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: The blueberry is really good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And speaking of that, I think that one of
the things that people forget is
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody's been so trained at this point
to go to a dispensary, to smell a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: different flour, to find that flour they
really like and find a delicious flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they buy it based on that smell
because it's like, oh, it smells so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to try this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as soon as you put it into anything
that's going to combust, put it into a
[SPEAKER_02]: bowl, a bong, a pipe, anything,
you lose most of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you roll it into a joint,
you smoke it, you'll usually get a hint.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you get like a strawberry banana
strain, you'll get a hint of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you don't even realize how much of
those terpenes you're missing out on until
[SPEAKER_02]: you try it in the ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had people who really enjoy their
specific strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually had a fantastic example.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a grower at one of these events
that we went to that's been doing it for
[SPEAKER_02]: 15, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been the industry forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he tried the ghost for the first time
and grabbed his private stash,
[SPEAKER_02]: his private strain, the strain that he's
had a million times that is his go-to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he tried it in the MV1.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was driven to tears, like verge of
tears, eyes watering up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said it's like he was tasting it
for the first time, which I think is a
[SPEAKER_02]: fantastic example of how when you've
tried, when you've been smoking weed and
[SPEAKER_02]: you're familiar with it so much,
you kind of get used to the low quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's only once you finally taste it in
something that really highlights that
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor that you understand everything that
you're missing out on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you go back to a joint and you're
just, it's kind of ruined for you,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you're, you're completely right on
that because I'm, I'm the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I ever used a ghost,
I was like, am I smoking oregano?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I smoking a herb?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, what did you guys put in this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause I've never tasted it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never tasted weed that tasted like what it
smelled like out of the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, I think that's a good
experience too, that if you never tasted
[SPEAKER_01]: weed, what it smells like, you need to
taste it out of a ghost vape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like what Collier says, you could hit
specific temperatures for specific
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could even get more, more of a
better experience that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let me ask you a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause when we're in dryer mode,
we were tranching, we were going like
[SPEAKER_04]: right up temperature wise to hit and
isolate specific terpenes and
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in, in concentrate mode, there's just
one temperature, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you talk about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So concentrate is a concentrate is
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's a, it's a concentrated form.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it's a much less complicated
material that has far fewer compounds
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we still got terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You still got cannabinoids, but it's going
to vaporize about the same temperature at
[SPEAKER_02]: that high temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause you're not vaporizing the,
the terpenes, the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're vaporizing the actual like material
itself, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You're vaporizing the concentrate itself
and that's going to vaporize.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to vaporize at different
temperatures, but the temperature we
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't set to is the one that will
vaporize pretty much every concentrate
[SPEAKER_02]: around there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason you want to be able to set
different temperatures for flour is that
[SPEAKER_02]: on flour, you don't want to vaporize the
material itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to vaporize the things that's
that are in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to do that, you want to hit those very
specific temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the, that's the simple version.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can get into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the specifics for flour are
the quality of the flour in general,
[SPEAKER_02]: as far as where it was grown, how it was
grown, the age of the flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes if it's far too old,
when you grind it, it'll get way too
[SPEAKER_02]: powdery and you'll just, you'll get a bad
flavor out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cure, a lot of flour isn't cured well
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the moisture content is what
we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for good flour, if you're keeping it
properly preserved, which you want to do,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying you shouldn't use the
Boveda packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying that you want to use them to
keep your flour preserved.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you go to vaporize, you're going
to, particularly if it's well preserved,
[SPEAKER_02]: those first couple of hits are going to be
pure flavor, very little visible vapor,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you will get some fantastic flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you get out of that flavor range,
you've kind of dried it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've gotten rid of a lot of the terpenes
at that level and everything after that is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be a lot more visible vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get a lot more, less of the
flavor, a lot more vapor, a lot more of
[SPEAKER_02]: the effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as flour goes, it's all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you'll see, a lot of people say
that CBD flour doesn't taste good and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's typically because they're burning
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And CBD flour doesn't have a lot of
terpenes at those high temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you burn it, you just get kind of
grass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't taste very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a great example is that this stuff we
had, because even though it's CBD flour,
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's got those terpenes at the low
temperatures, the piney and the mercy and
[SPEAKER_02]: the limonene, you get the low temperatures
where you don't get the kind of burny
[SPEAKER_02]: flowery, the burny plant taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get those actual terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, and so many people these days
are heading to oil cartridges and so
[SPEAKER_06]: forth, which are really just, they're
extracted.
[SPEAKER_06]: All the terpenes are taken out and then
they're put back in later.
[SPEAKER_06]: With flour, it's really more of a natural
extraction in a way.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're extracting and consuming all in one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what makes it so much better.
[SPEAKER_06]: The terpenes that you taste are natural as
part of the flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: And whereas with oil, it's just,
there's always this kind of like,
[SPEAKER_06]: well, it's either too much or not enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's very few that are balanced
correctly.
[SPEAKER_06]: With ours, we're really just getting the
taste of the flour.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's really a wonderful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I like to, to your point about the oil
cartridges, I like to associate it with
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of this move towards vitamins,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a period where we are eating a lot
of just regular old food back in the good
[SPEAKER_02]: old days of the, you know, the early
thousands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when we started doing
manufactured food and we started having
[SPEAKER_02]: canned food and pre-prepared food and
pre-prepared meals, that was a huge,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was a big deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody loved those.
[SPEAKER_02]: We flocked to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've, we've gotten to this point
where we're doing vitamins, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: People are taking, I wake up in the
morning and take vitamin C, vitamin D,
[SPEAKER_02]: vitamin E.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I take all these different vitamins.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now even more recently, we're getting
back to this idea of whole foods,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting back to the idea of just
taking vitamin C isn't good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to take vitamin C as part of a
food that you're eating because there are
[SPEAKER_02]: these other things that come with the food
that we kind of don't understand fully
[SPEAKER_02]: their benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the same way, vaping an oil cartridge
is just like taking vitamins.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting the THC, which is true,
which gives you THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that's your goal, that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's, what's being missed that we
don't have enough research to really back
[SPEAKER_02]: up is this idea of the entourage effect,
which is that when you vape flour,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're getting those cannabinoids,
but also the terpenes and also the other
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, and they're all kind of
acting together to increase the effect and
[SPEAKER_02]: give you a much more rounded experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: That isn't just like a, like a blasted
head high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a full kind of experience.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's more of a, it's more of a journey,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, when you, when you, when you
taste the flour at lower temperatures and
[SPEAKER_06]: then halfway through, like after six or
seven hits, change the temperature higher.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's, it's really much more versatile of a
way of consuming it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now to that point, I do have a different
flour here that was pre-packed from one of
[SPEAKER_02]: our other events called XJ-13.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I mentioned it is that this
flour, if I'm not mistaken, I think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: this one, is high in terpenyl,
which is a terpene that tastes a lot like
[SPEAKER_02]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that, it's that turpentine kind of,
kind of alcoholic gasoline kind of flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that vaporizes at 426 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that strain, to your question about the
different flours, that strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you vape it at lower temperatures,
doesn't really taste very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it doesn't have many terpenes at
those low temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you hit it at 426 or 428 at those
high temperatures, you get a very strong
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of sour diesel flavor that goes along
with the cannabinoid THCV that's vaporized
[SPEAKER_02]: at that same temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that XJ-13 with that high terpeneol is
very much like a, I would consider as
[SPEAKER_02]: close to you're going to get to like a
smoker's high.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, what's interesting there is I kind
of feel like cultivators and brands should
[SPEAKER_04]: understand when people are vaping their
products, what's the ideal temperature for
[SPEAKER_04]: my flour?
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which you're hitting on conceptually.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is, that is one thing that we've
worked with a lot of flour companies and
[SPEAKER_02]: we've made a lot of friends with flour
companies and they, they all have that
[SPEAKER_02]: same idea, which is that they're working
so hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're every day is trying to make their
flour unique, make it different,
[SPEAKER_02]: make it special, make it great.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no matter who's selling it,
no matter how much time you spent on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you sell it and then roll it up into a
joint, they might as well be the same as
[SPEAKER_07]: every other flour.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: as not a grower, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I know is that it needs to be well
cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have been told by a lot of, by a lot of
growers when I've showed them flour that
[SPEAKER_02]: I've bought, when they, when they have
told me like, but this is not,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is not well cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not good because it's not well
cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know exactly what that means,
but I know it needs to be well cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe this is the, so the,
what I was just doing there is one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things I love, which is that it's one of
the only vaporizers that what you smell is
[SPEAKER_02]: what you end up tasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always love when I do a demo at
events is I like to have people smell it
[SPEAKER_02]: and then put it in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that's the Puffco peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're different.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're, they're totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, the peak is essentially
around concentrates and only concentrates
[SPEAKER_01]: only.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's five different settings for
concentrates, whether you like hot dabs or
[SPEAKER_01]: cold dab, that's kind of, kind of what
it's for people that just wants that
[SPEAKER_01]: instant high.
[SPEAKER_01]: As were the ghosts, it's people that are
looking for flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're just not looking to get
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to hit those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to get those flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to get the most out of their
weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, someone smoking three joints
a day, that's an eighth a day,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they switched, if they switched to
vape, there's going to be an eighth a week
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're buying, you know,
they're going to have that good quality
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Using a vape is even, is even healthy for
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: For those people that smoke like backwoods
and things like that, that tobacco is
[SPEAKER_01]: horrible for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if they're smoking joints or
bongs, they're getting that butane.
[SPEAKER_01]: As are all this, it's, it's pure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Collier said, you get a different
high from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a cleaner high from it because
you're not getting any of those things
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're not supposed to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that makes sense, you're not supposed
to smoke the butane.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not supposed to smoke the tobacco,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when people will say that their
weed doesn't taste good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like with tobacco, with tobacco leaves,
you know, cause you, cause you're,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're covering up that taste with the
tobacco leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: As were this, you're just getting the
full, the full taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even with the Puffco peak,
I don't think we were able to get a hit
[SPEAKER_01]: with that grain of rice we use in this out
of the Puffco peak.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be lucky to get one draw,
one person to get one draw out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you still have to clean it up
after this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could just keep hitting it,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're two totally, they're two totally
different devices, but I do like how this,
[SPEAKER_01]: it gives you the option to use both.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get the best out of both when
you're using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't know if you noticed the
concentrate hit was very, very tasteful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're able to taste it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we get by having the one
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not have to worry about overburning
it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what are we about to smoke and what's
the terpene?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this one, what temperature is the,
it's like the cheat code in a video game.
[SPEAKER_04]: What temperature?
[SPEAKER_02]: The temperature I believe is up,
up, down, down, left, right, left,
[SPEAKER_02]: right, B, A, start.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm not mistaken, that's how you unlock
this temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that one would be contra.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the contra code.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody does.
[SPEAKER_04]: Metroid and contra.
[SPEAKER_04]: Remember Metroid?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not going to lie to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not entirely sure if this is extra 13
or not, because my nose is not good enough
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to smell it, but just judging
by the look, pretty sure it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll go to that temperature and see if we
find what we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here's the test.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will be the test.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have it set to 428 degrees, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's right around that 426,
the terpeneol.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to get high flavor of the
terpeneol and a lot of THC, which is that
[SPEAKER_02]: euphorian high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it doesn't taste like that,
then it's not the string.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where we need like the,
like the bachelor, where like someone's,
[SPEAKER_04]: someone's about to get kicked off and they
cut to each person, like looking at you to
[SPEAKER_04]: see if you're going to, you're going to
taste it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's looking at you.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this temperature though, you should get
a lot more clouds as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you guys used the peak before or any
other vapes before?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your guys' opinion on those
compared to the guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: You found something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, this is a great example of when
you started it, when you go straight to
[SPEAKER_02]: 428, I think that's the, I think that's
the, I think that's the XJ-13.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you started at the high temperature,
you usually can only get, instead of the
[SPEAKER_02]: full 15 second draw on the, particularly
the first couple of draws, I can only make
[SPEAKER_02]: it five or six seconds because it produces
so much vapor so quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it taste like you get that diesel?
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if that's the, I'm not sure
if that's the XJ-13.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm getting, I'm getting a little
diesel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe you just put diesel into my head and
now that's what I... Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I primed you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing, what you're saying about
the, the flower as well is the pack is
[SPEAKER_02]: very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've noticed a lot of times on the
first draw, if it's not good, I'll just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of, I'll pull it out and I'll just
even use the lid here and just kind of not
[SPEAKER_02]: even stir it, just kind of rough it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just give it a little, loosen it up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slap it around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Show it who's boss.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you notice when you do that,
you get, you get much more, much feathery,
[SPEAKER_02]: much more feathery pack, which is ideal,
but I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can get, even if you get to a
point, even if you get to a point where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're not getting any vapor or any
effects, sometimes you get to a point
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's, it has vaporized just about
everything you can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all you got to do is stir it up a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can get two more good hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you just did there that I want
to, I, if I could, if I could say
[SPEAKER_02]: anything, I would say that's like the,
that's like the, the call sign of the
[SPEAKER_02]: ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever tried a ghost, the most common
thing is people, even if you don't get a
[SPEAKER_02]: visible vapor, they blow out and they go,
Oh, yeah, I get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people don't even realize they're
doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my favorite part.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see if I've got, I wonder if I do
have, cause I don't even think I have a
[SPEAKER_02]: jar of XJ 13 on me, but we, we like to
partner with different flower brands.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: So talk about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's your interactions and relationships
with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so it works really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flowers flower brands work really well
with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our good friends is THC design,
which is what we're, which is what we've
[SPEAKER_02]: been smoking this whole day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason that they love us and we love
them is that they, like I said,
[SPEAKER_02]: they put their terpenes on the packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not many other brands actually put what
terpenes to expect on a packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that helps us because people are
looking for those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that the first time that the
folks from THC design tried their flower
[SPEAKER_02]: in the MV one, they wanted to work with
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason is, like I said earlier,
you put so much time into making this
[SPEAKER_02]: flower that tastes a certain way,
that smells a certain way, that has a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you really only get to maximize that
and get the most out of it in something
[SPEAKER_02]: like the ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like it because you can seek out
those specific terpenes and look for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of my favorites that is not as
common is nursing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I learned recently that nursing is the
same terpene that's found in mangoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you vape something like the gift at
349 to get that nursing and you eat a
[SPEAKER_02]: mango or you eat something high in
mangoes, it's like, it's kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: drinking red wine with steak.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has this kind of multiplier effect that
just really enhances everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I may do that tonight.
[SPEAKER_04]: Red wine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So THC design's power move would be next
to the terpenes to list what temperature
[SPEAKER_04]: exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can isolate that terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So give me an example.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is partnering just like mutual love and
admiration or is partnering like we have a
[SPEAKER_04]: business deal together?
[SPEAKER_04]: So talk about partnerships with THC design
as our case study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you probably guessed, we're a
relatively young company still.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you can also probably guess,
we are still working very hard to get our
[SPEAKER_02]: name out there and get the product out
there, get people trying it, make people
[SPEAKER_02]: aware of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right now we're still at the stage
where we're just good friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're dating.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had a couple of dates.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've exchanged phone numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're Facebook friends.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hooking up with other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the kinds of partnerships that we're
building are very mutually beneficial in
[SPEAKER_02]: that there's one brand that probably
doesn't want to be mentioned, but they're
[SPEAKER_02]: taking the Ghost MV1 around with their
sales team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're bringing the Ghost and
Crucibles and their flower to dispensaries
[SPEAKER_02]: and distributors and all these places to
demo their flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because right now the current process is
if you're a grower, when buyers come to
[SPEAKER_02]: your grow to test out your flower to see
if they want to buy, you're rolling seven
[SPEAKER_02]: to 10 joints of an eighth or more a piece.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a huge waste.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds like a good time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speak for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you think about it from two
different perspectives, if you're the
[SPEAKER_02]: grower, that's a huge waste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're the person who's trying to
judge, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a professional, you can judge
the difference between a bunch of
[SPEAKER_02]: different strains by slight variations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those different strains in the MV1 at
the temperatures that highlight their
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes, like night and day.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a suggestion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, yeah, you'll go into dispensary now
and you'll go buy something, get a
[SPEAKER_07]: pre-roll for a dollar.
[SPEAKER_07]: What if it's like buy a Ghost,
get a gram of a particular flower,
[SPEAKER_07]: a branded flower for either nothing or a
dollar away?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's definitely an option.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone might win.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's definitely something that we're
considering going down the line there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can also do... But can
dispensaries sell vaporizers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're actually in a lot of
dispensaries right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So dispensaries can sell vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, realistically, almost anybody
can sell vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also sold in smoke shops all over
the place because you can vape lavender
[SPEAKER_02]: out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of depends on what you put in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those people put cannabis in it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I'm going to try that later
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, if you want to try that...
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, give me some other herbs from my
garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hear that sage is a really good
combo.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you grind sage and cannabis together,
they have a very good multiplicative
[SPEAKER_02]: effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll keep the evil spirit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a dual purpose, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can also... What I've started
experimenting with more recently is I
[SPEAKER_02]: grind...
[SPEAKER_02]: I usually do like two nugs of THC flower
and one nug of CBD flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just grind that all together and load my
crucible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one of the downsides of the modern
cannabis is that modern cannabis is bred
[SPEAKER_02]: and grown to maximize THC, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole purpose is to get the highest
percentage THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's like the goal of every single grow
right now is the THC percentage is how
[SPEAKER_02]: we're judging the quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: As alcohol came out of prohibition,
you only had moonshine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually, you had the cavernet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so eventually you have craft beer,
too, which is like, we're not even trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to get drunk here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just enjoying the beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: You went from fire water to reliance and
flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: To that point, what I'm trying to
replicate here by grinding some CBD flower
[SPEAKER_02]: back in with it is to add that CBD back
into the flower that's been bred out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for the longest time, there was no
value in CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't the thing that was getting
people high.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your purpose is to get high,
CBD has no value to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no purpose in... Actually,
it does have a... While people don't know
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you know, when you actually
understand fully, CBD has the combination.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to the general consumer, THC is the
thing that gets you high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so having a high THC percentage is
what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's brainstorm some business
partnerships for you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because obviously there's just the mutual
marketing and publicity partnership,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'm thinking more like there's a legal
business deal in place.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you guys...
[SPEAKER_04]: What could you do with brands?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the two types of brands that we have
the most synergy with, for lack of a
[SPEAKER_02]: non-business term, is consumption lounges
and retailers and flower brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flower brands, we are providing the best
experience in many different ways for
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're providing the best experience for
buyers trying their flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're providing the best experience for
their customers to actually be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: appreciate the quality of their flower,
which means that if I've spent $100 for an
[SPEAKER_02]: eighth instead of my usual $40 or $60 for
an eighth, I want to know that that was
[SPEAKER_02]: worth it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And using it in something like the MV1
makes you actually feel like it was worth
[SPEAKER_02]: it because you taste those terpenes,
you get that effect, you get that smooth
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor, and you actually feel like it was
worth $100.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it sounds like you should be the
recipient of multiple testimonials from
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivators wanting people to use your
device.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: The consumer then will appreciate it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: To show off my flower and its best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the consumption lounges are our
best friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as they start getting up and
running, they're our best friends because
[SPEAKER_02]: they've got costs on the mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time somebody's... How many are up
and running?
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, actually there's one up in
Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot that aren't licensed.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of underground ones that
aren't licensed.
[SPEAKER_07]: West Hollywood is probably your soonest
bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're friends with the consumption
lounge opening there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's Budberry is opening in West
Hollywood, but we're friends with them,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they won't be hosting the MV1 because
they're entirely edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all consumables, not flower,
which is fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's okay if that's what you want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But consumption lounges, particularly if
you're providing flower, if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: providing flower for people to demo,
to try to sell, or whatever your goal is,
[SPEAKER_02]: being able to just use a tenth of a gram
is a huge cost savings.
[SPEAKER_02]: A tenth of a gram instead of an eighth in
a joint, or even in a little mini J.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even a mini J is going to be probably two
or three grams at the very least.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably two grams.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this first one on the market,
when could I first buy?
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it in the past eight months or so?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it first went on the market,
I want to say like June.
[SPEAKER_02]: June of last year, but we really hit our
stride in October.
[SPEAKER_02]: October is when you would have first
really heard of us, and the reason is we
[SPEAKER_02]: launched the Stealth Black Edition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did I put it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you've got it over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Stealth Black was the first version
that we had that was all black.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was this matte black.
[SPEAKER_02]: The torn down one's actually a better
example of it because I've swapped out my
[SPEAKER_02]: heat sink here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just swap it back.
[SPEAKER_07]: How are you doing in vape shops or smoke
shops, non-dispensary shops, head shops?
[SPEAKER_02]: In a weird way, we're actually doing
better, and the reason is that those
[SPEAKER_02]: shops, you can pay with credit card.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the biggest barrier right now is
that people love it, people understand it,
[SPEAKER_02]: they see the value of it, but if you've
got to pay $300 in cash, usually if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to dispensary, the most I think I've
ever brought into a dispensary was $200 in
[SPEAKER_02]: cash, and that was to buy weed,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to then turn around and pull
out another $300 to buy a vaporizer no
[SPEAKER_02]: matter how good it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're working on solutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can obviously buy it directly on our
website, GhostVapes.com.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ship internationally, pretty much
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everywhere that's a lot more allowed to
ship, which at this point is most places.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we ship to all states, GhostVapes
.com.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the single biggest complaint that
buyers of your product have?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the single biggest thing that they
might return it for?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say there's two.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is user error, which is they
just didn't read the instructions,
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't understand how vaporizers work,
they didn't bother to look up anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they broke it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually didn't break it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very difficult to break, obviously
being made of such high quality materials.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I was with the fiddlers guys,
we actually had to bust out the
[SPEAKER_04]: instructions.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were super high by this point,
and you had shown me how to use that,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I totally was blanking on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, I know there's something about
hitting it three times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember what that does,
but I know that does something.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we're trying to change the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fortunately, Jody, I don't know,
sorry, Cameron was like, I'm going to
[SPEAKER_04]: focus and read through this instruction
manual until I figure it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's green flashing that's giving the
battery indication, it says press and hold
[SPEAKER_00]: the mode button to display battery level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Release, then press and hold again to
display the current heat setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be fair, when I first got it,
I first got mine about two or three months
[SPEAKER_02]: before I started working for Ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I first got it and I found out
there as a smartphone app, I just
[SPEAKER_02]: downloaded the app and never used the
buttons on the device.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I used the vape button on the back to
use it, but otherwise I just turned it on
[SPEAKER_02]: and did all the temperature management on
the app.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was only once I started at Ghost and I
realized that you could change the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature on the device itself that I
realized that I needed to look up the
[SPEAKER_02]: instructions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, as an employee of Ghost,
pulled out my box, I pulled out the
[SPEAKER_02]: instructions and I read up and literally
read it one time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like once you figure out the button
sequence, it's not difficult to remember,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I read the instructions and figured it
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most people that we find, they after
about one day of use have figured out how
[SPEAKER_02]: to turn it on.
[SPEAKER_02]: They figured out how to change the
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: They figured out the draw speed,
their kind of technique on using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after about a day they're golden.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the second complaint though is,
what was the second complaint?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was user error and no visible vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a common one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason I say no visible vapor is
as we were discussing before, I would
[SPEAKER_02]: argue that if you are tasting,
if you're tasting something and if you're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting high, then it doesn't matter if
you're seeing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think anybody once they get it,
gets it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the process of going from your
initial expectation to get, and when I was
[SPEAKER_04]: with, like you can watch the video,
you literally watch us in real time
[SPEAKER_04]: figuring stuff out with the Ghost,
which is like A, how to use that one
[SPEAKER_04]: button to do 18 different things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then number two was we're all sitting
there, like everyone's sucking really hard
[SPEAKER_04]: on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're like, is it working?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we're like, we are all super high
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it might be working.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's just, and that was when we were
like, oh, and I was like, maybe it's like
[SPEAKER_04]: better if you're not blowing vapor out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to that point, the, the only recently I
discovered the best, the best instructions
[SPEAKER_02]: for breathing technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've ever done a guided meditation or
any kind of, any, any kind of yoga
[SPEAKER_02]: meditation or anything that has a
breathing exercise where you're like 10
[SPEAKER_02]: seconds, like it's not that you want to
take a 10 second breath.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that you want to spread your breath
across 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you do that, then it forces you to
draw at the correct speed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause if you guys are sitting there
sucking on it, there's a very good chance
[SPEAKER_02]: that either A, it was packed too tightly
or B, you're pulling too fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because the only downside of having
your lungs be part of the mechanism is
[SPEAKER_02]: that if you're pulling too fast,
you're pulling that hot air across the
[SPEAKER_02]: material before it can actually transfer
its heat to the material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're essentially not giving it any
time to heat up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's like when I try to teach my
four year old daughter how to swim and I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: like, the more you flail around,
the worse off you are if you just relax
[SPEAKER_04]: and float on your back, you could like
float across the entire pool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in my research, you know, I,
I don't, I forget how it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I made my way to ghost, but, um,
but it just, it just, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: and there's just so many products on the
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the one, and the one problem for that
article is I'm hands on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I wanted to be able to try,
you know, so I was talking about,
[SPEAKER_05]: was that a problem though?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, I wasn't able to.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I couldn't get my hands on a ghost.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, I kind of had to,
you know, do that part of it blind,
[SPEAKER_07]: but pretty much it was a learning
experience for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, with respect to ghost
specifically, I don't, I don't have any
[SPEAKER_07]: follow up questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: I knew it was a quality product and all I
knew from that one after the article was I
[SPEAKER_07]: wanted to get my hands on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's, that's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And did you, you tried it with the
concentrate?
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you think about the concentrate?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was a flavor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And listen, the flavors, you know,
bringing out the flavors is, is really
[SPEAKER_07]: what it's all about.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, there's, there's a lot of things
I appreciate about this one right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: The fact that it doesn't get really hot,
that it's easy to use, um, that,
[SPEAKER_07]: uh, the electronically is well made,
but the bottom line is the experience.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, um, if you can, cause that's my
experience, long time smoker longer than
[SPEAKER_07]: you guys have been on time, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: But the last few years, learning to
appreciate that nuanced experience has,
[SPEAKER_07]: has really been very exciting.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, so, and I love all the,
because I'm not a blow my brains.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't go to shows and dab and go like
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to be able to have conversations.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now experiencing the new, you know,
live rosins, new resins and those things,
[SPEAKER_07]: and to be able to, um, consume them
properly and experience them properly is
[SPEAKER_07]: my mind expanding literally.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not my numbing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm glad you enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thanks Tom.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like we're in Mr. We're in Mr.
Roger's neighborhood and we have guest
[SPEAKER_04]: visitors popping in.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hey, there's Trolley.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can we talk sales numbers and volume?
[SPEAKER_04]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it sells well.
[SPEAKER_02]: People love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we're, yeah, we're just working on
expanding visibility and getting more
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're, one of the main things that
we're trying to do is get to as many
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer events as possible, as many
opportunities to get it in front of
[SPEAKER_02]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause as you know, I can sit here and tell
you all day, every day, how great it is,
[SPEAKER_02]: how great the flavor is, how easy it is to
use, how you can dial in those terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But because there really is no other
device that gives you that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no frame of reference.
Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, you don't actually, you don't
actually understand or even believe what
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm saying until you try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we were just this Saturday,
we had an event in downtown that was a
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and we had plenty of people coming up
like, and these, this was a consumption
[SPEAKER_02]: lounge where people were smoking joints,
rolling huge joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and they would come up and they were
like, Oh, what is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you gave them a shot,
once you give them a chance to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: hit it, every, every single one
guaranteed, they blow out the smoke,
[SPEAKER_02]: blow out the vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Oh, Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because of the heat sink, the vapor
comes out so cool that these people that
[SPEAKER_02]: are used to taking huge hits from thongs
or joints, whatever it is, they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: realize how big of a hit they're taking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're sitting there kind of like,
Oh, it's getting, I'm getting good flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, this is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they finished their draw and they
blow out and that's the vapor just keeps
[SPEAKER_02]: coming and keeps coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they start coughing and they're like,
Oh, I didn't realize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we have a lot of people that walk
away from our booth or walk away from our
[SPEAKER_02]: table, wherever we're demoing and
coughing, just like, Oh, I did not expect
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Was not expecting that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, because the vapor just comes out so
cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: What, what, uh, so sales are good.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the answer to your question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, this is like the first product,
the hero product, I would say.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is there a, another product in the
pipeline and what, what do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it just like, the model S of this,
or is it something totally different for a
[SPEAKER_04]: different purpose?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's, um, this, there's
always a lot of different answers to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, what's this one called?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is called the ghost MV one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, so you're talking about the MV two,
for instance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's say not two things.
[SPEAKER_04]: One, what's the improvements that you want
to make or not improvements.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the, a different word, uh,
additional features you want to put in the
[SPEAKER_04]: MV two.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then secondly, what's a totally
different product you guys are
[SPEAKER_04]: conceptualizing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think the, um, the idea of
improvement is, is pretty clear.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, we listen to our customers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, you know, we hear what they have to
say and, you know, I think, uh,
[SPEAKER_06]: most of them focus around the interface.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's a clear opportunity for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and there's a lot of ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many parallels.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like here's a pan Panasonic EVA one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a Panasonic GH five.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have Sony's, I have, uh, can it like
they each, and then your phones and things
[SPEAKER_04]: like all these things have different
interfaces that you need to learn.
[SPEAKER_04]: And some are just, you're just like,
that's so frustrating why they make that
[SPEAKER_04]: interface decision.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you said, you know, everyone now is
aware of user interface.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and so now the playing field is
different.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your minimum product has to be it has to
meet expectations or exceed them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that means it has to take all of this
into consideration, uh, where users are
[SPEAKER_06]: going to expect the feedback to be what
kind of feedback it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And is it intuitive?
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's really what we want to make is
as intuitive as possible so that you need
[SPEAKER_06]: no instruction whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just have it in your hand and the
product tells you how to use it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, it just, it just knows and it knows
you right away.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are the things, you know,
aspirationally and, you know, for next
[SPEAKER_06]: gen, uh, that's what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see a second button or like a joint,
like a button with a joystick with a
[SPEAKER_04]: little LCD monitor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I stopped there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I stopped there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally random, funny example.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I was looking at like a GoPro
and I was like, Oh, this one's cheaper and
[SPEAKER_04]: it has great reviews.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first time I filmed with it,
I pulled the footage and it had the
[SPEAKER_04]: timestamp in the footage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I emailed the company being like,
I can't figure out where and how to turn
[SPEAKER_04]: off the timestamp.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I don't want it to say like January
1st, 1999 or like what, cause you never
[SPEAKER_04]: set that thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were like, yeah, no, you can't do
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, am I the first person
who's brought this up?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, that's like a firmware update.
[SPEAKER_04]: That should be a simple and they're like,
yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, to that point, one of the things
that we, that I really love about the
[SPEAKER_02]: ghost and that I love about the fact that
this is, this is more a technology company
[SPEAKER_02]: than anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have, we obviously have an app.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got firmware.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can tell you late breaking news.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a new update to the app coming
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the beta version of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You heard it here first.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and what's, what's interesting is that
obviously we can't change the hardware.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're limited by what we already have,
but with software, we're able to make some
[SPEAKER_02]: very kind of minor, but very valuable
improvements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the changes that I love that
was a thing for me is that the current way
[SPEAKER_02]: to change the temperature, I don't have a
different one, but the way to change the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature is you press and hold on this
multifunction button for about three
[SPEAKER_02]: seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see the battery level blink and you
press and hold it again to get to the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you do that once or twice,
you're like, okay, this is normally press
[SPEAKER_02]: and hold to get to the battery,
press and hold to get to the temperature.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you've been doing that for a few
months and you do it every day,
[SPEAKER_02]: all day, and you're changing the
temperature a lot, having to go through
[SPEAKER_02]: the battery level every single time gets a
little bit tedious.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a deal breaker.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a reason to return it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a reason to hate it, but it's
just a, it's not great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to have like the function one button,
which gets you right into temperature
change mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we, so what we did on the newest
version of the app and the newest version
[SPEAKER_02]: of the firmware is we just gave you the
option to change the order that those come
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I changed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it goes straight to the temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I press and hold temperature,
not battery level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's those kinds of little changes that
we can very easily make via software.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are obviously making that we don't
have to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a new hardware.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to release a new product.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't have to buy a new version of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can just roll out software updates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And suddenly your vape has a whole new
mode or a whole new setting or some kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of different color.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we can do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can't do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just change the color of the LEDs.
We can do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, so there's a, there's a lot of
opportunity with the fact that it is a
[SPEAKER_02]: connected device.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the, to the peanut gallery in the back,
uh, give, give some love to some of your
[SPEAKER_04]: favorite, uh, flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: And concentrate brands.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, in the ghost, I think Shabrinsky's
works really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, wonder Brett works really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've actually just hopped on the trend of
Fidels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, he sells that her branium in LA,
um, really good concentrate, really good
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Resin raw garden works perfectly,
perfectly well, um, in the vape as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, honestly, anything that's just grown
really well, um, that's grown with respect
[SPEAKER_01]: because we like to respect the flower that
people really put the time in to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: their flower, to get the best flower,
to the, to the people who've been growing
[SPEAKER_01]: like terpene, you know, for THC design,
putting them on the, on the, on the
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's perfect for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, to specifically hit those
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, if you know what you're getting
out of your, you know, what terpenes are
[SPEAKER_01]: in your flowers and the ghosts for any of
those flowers, you know, anyone who puts
[SPEAKER_01]: that time into cultivate and get those
terpenes out of their plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to go right down the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: When not using the ghost vape,
what are you smoking out of?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you rolling joints, a bong,
another?
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually doing joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, usually doing joints, joints or bongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I currently have a grab, a grab Helix
bong.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm not using the MV1, um,
I mean, that's what I'm using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, yeah, same question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I'm not gonna lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm like 99% MV1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I've, I've now just out in the
interest of, of, uh, product research,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've now tried the Firefly, the Solo 2,
the Mighty, the Crafty, a bunch of cheap
[SPEAKER_02]: Chinese vaporizers, a bunch of knockoff
brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time I come back to the MV1,
uh, pretty much immediately because the
[SPEAKER_02]: other ones are not great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I have on occasion smoked a two or
three puffs from a joint because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: about all I can ever handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I immediately wash my hands,
uh, sometimes take a shower, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: at the very least change my clothes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'm not, I'm not wild about the
lingering smell of cannabis in general,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is why I like vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do you smoke out of?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like the old timer here,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You remember the days when you had to roll
joints.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was never good at joints.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was really good at bowls though.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, um, at any time it's like,
okay, you know, I have the ghost and I
[SPEAKER_06]: love it, but sometimes the closest thing
is the preloaded bowl that I always keep,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, in my shed and, and it's always ready
to go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the perfect pack.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and, um, so I'll, I'll hit on that
every once in a while just because it's
[SPEAKER_06]: right there and the lighter sits right
next to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I realized though, why now I've
discovered vaporizers cause it's like,
[SPEAKER_06]: okay, I know this will get me high in a
second.
[SPEAKER_06]: But still it tastes like shit.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, I feel like my,
my throat is literally on fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, it's good to have that so
that I can appreciate vaporizers as much
[SPEAKER_06]: as I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're completely right on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love how we get no coughs on the MV1.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a surprise.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget, I forget how smooth it is until
I hit a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I remember, look, that's why I
only get like two or three puffs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I take, I like, I get like a
pre-roll or I use my, my fancy auto to
[SPEAKER_02]: roll a joint for me, which is nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I'll pack it and I'll light it
and I'll get maybe two or three hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hurts my chest, hurts my throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll just, I'll just untwist it and
pour the remaining stuff in crucibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for watching.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll see you next time.
