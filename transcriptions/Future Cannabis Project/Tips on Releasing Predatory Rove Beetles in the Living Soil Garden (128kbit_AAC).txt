[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: Morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm Saul Alba from Beneficial
Insectary, Michael Arsino, Navy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here to talk about some natural
enemy releases and some tips on how to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're starting with, you know,
the generalist soil predators that can be
[SPEAKER_02]: used together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm talking about Delocia coriaria,
the road beetle, the predatory road
[SPEAKER_02]: beetle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It targets drips, prepupa, and fungus
gnat.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's formerly known as a theta coriaria,
but the entomologists that the taxonomists
[SPEAKER_02]: and insect taxonomists changed that
recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Along with that, we're going to release
Stradiolalypse scimitus, which is the
[SPEAKER_02]: predatory soil mite, also targets strips
and fungus gnat.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one was known as a hypoaspis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most people still know it as hypoaspis,
but we just call them strats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, first thing you want to do
basically when you show up in our prepping
[SPEAKER_02]: for release is to acclimate the bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, they come in in ice,
packed in ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want to warm it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's a, I guess it'd be the
equivalent of you waking up, somebody
[SPEAKER_02]: waking you up with a bucket full of ice
water, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of want them acclimated to the grow
condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as you can see right here, we have both
containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a, this is the soil predator mite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the predatory road beetle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have these acclimating here to get
to the grow condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically we're going to show you how we
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after this acclimation, what you want
to do is you want to inspect them for
[SPEAKER_02]: viability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just tap them out and you'll see them
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're called road beetles because they
just move everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just constantly in search.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I kind of like that, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They flip their tails up like all road
beetles do.
Oops.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, those all look pretty viable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Road beetles do fly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not great flyers, but they do fly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a huge advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strats are a little bit more difficult to
see, but often you can see them crawling
[SPEAKER_02]: on the, there's none there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, you want to carefully inspect
for the viability.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may require a loop, so you may not be
able to see them really.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they also could still be
sluggish.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't quite wait another 30 to 45
minutes that we should have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for purposes of moving this video
along, we'll, we'll take a closer video to
[SPEAKER_02]: show you what they look like when they're
crawling around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although, you know, that pretty much shows
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're just mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think I did say the white carrying
the little foam top for the refrigerated
[SPEAKER_00]: box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is probably, these are probably
enough mites for several, I think I
[SPEAKER_02]: remember calculated some of like 600
square feet, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to overload them here,
but it's a living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Mike really wanted to try to establish
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the beauties of the,
of this, these predators here in
[SPEAKER_02]: particular is both of these are some of
the easiest to get to establish in your
[SPEAKER_02]: growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, that, that was the case at the
farm I work with where we need very few
[SPEAKER_02]: releases to actually get them to
establish.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like the, they like your environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will, they'll establish readily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have like heavy fungus
snap pressure or heavy pressure,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and there's not an abundant food
source in the soil with those two pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: what other things can these guys feed on?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, some mites will eat, uh, fungus.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure if hypoaspis eat or strats
eat fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, about like springtails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Springtails is yeah, springtails are
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I'm working on a rearing system
for Delosha, um, which requires rearing
[SPEAKER_02]: springtails first and then feeding that to
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just for fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some springtails.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they'll help you with those.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an extra food source for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't know which is their
preference, but these are frequently used
[SPEAKER_02]: as, um, an adjunct to nematodes for fungus
snap control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the nematodes are obviously your
best choice, but two more weapons,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, speaking about, speaking of rearing
springtails, um, lot of growers don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been done for, for a while now,
uh, other, uh, greenhouse operations of
[SPEAKER_02]: other crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can build what are called,
uh, Delosha breeder boxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically that is, um, you know,
a box where you have a food source and the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil and you release some of your Delosha
in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and it's covered, um, and you allow
them to reproduce and colonies form,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, because you've given them food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you have all sorts of life stages.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have eggs, you have nymphs or larva
and you have the adults and then you can
[SPEAKER_02]: open the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and the adults will leave the box,
but you have this generation in the box.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's essentially constantly producing,
um, row beetles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, you just very simple to maintain,
you know, every once in a while you add
[SPEAKER_02]: some food, keep them moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, and, you know, this has been done
for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a little mini insectary,
or you could call it like a giant Delosha
[SPEAKER_02]: sachets.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you know what a sachet is,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, anyway, um, so yeah, um, it's really
pretty simple to release these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and like you said, everyone warmed up
so they're moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, it's just that really you can
either tap them, you know, tap them in,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, but, uh, they're, uh,
they're probably like, uh, these are also,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, pretty, pretty tough beetles.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the carrier like cocoa and
vermiculite?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a, it's a cocoa and vermiculite
carrier pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, a peat and vermiculite carrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see them right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to go ahead and empty this
container.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys will, yeah, if you want,
although it's a little bit moist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you can actually do slats like this,
but they're, they're wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the carrier will stick obviously to the
leaf, but if you've got them where
[SPEAKER_02]: they're, if you have them where they're,
um, you know, with, without the dome and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're fairly dry, then you can just
shake the, uh, you can just shake the
[SPEAKER_02]: extra carrier off the leaves once,
once the beetles have moved down into,
[SPEAKER_02]: into the soil or fake soil, whatever,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to hand this over to Mike here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can hop out in the back there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa,
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit left.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now for the strats, you know,
same idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can sprinkle them or in this case,
a lot better to just stand up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there a feeder mites in the Delosha as
well?
[SPEAKER_02]: In the strats you mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or in Delosha?
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm not sure that we, it was a real
beetle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I'm not sure what's in the carrier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, if anything, they might've put some,
some eggs, um, feeder feeding eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the moth, um, that lays eggs that
we can use for, for feeding certain
[SPEAKER_02]: predators.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know Delosha eats those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen them do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but the mites, I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, that's why we do overnight shipping
just to get them to you, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: get them out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important to, I don't know,
Mike, if Mike remembered to do it over
[SPEAKER_02]: there, but kind of want to leave these
caps and the open bottles out in the grill
[SPEAKER_02]: for a while in case, you know,
it's just a good practice.
It's a,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably the easiest release there is out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a no brainer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and like we said, it's, both of these
have the ability, the ability to establish
[SPEAKER_02]: readily in your growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I've even seen them actually at Mike's
operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, he's actually having, has them
established in a rock wall media.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, another grower I know in LA,
downtown LA, had a natural, a native,
[SPEAKER_02]: native, uh, population of Delosha that
established.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Along with straddle.
[SPEAKER_02]: They never released, but they were there.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delosha was the gateway, uh, Benny for our
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't like to invest into Benny's
cause they didn't think they would
[SPEAKER_00]: persist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then one day, uh, during a cut down,
I'm seeing some Delosha rolling through
[SPEAKER_00]: the rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cubes, this is probably,
uh, I'm guessing six months post,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, last introduction into the
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I showed that to my cultivation
manager, he was like, okay, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you can get back to order and go
since those two seem to persist and that
[SPEAKER_00]: with the nematodes really seem to be the
game changer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a, it's a thing of being not so much
for us because, you know, our business is
[SPEAKER_02]: selling, selling beneficials and you're
essentially getting one that tends to
[SPEAKER_02]: establish.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, uh, that's fine.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just want biocontrol to work for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, easy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my insurance policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
