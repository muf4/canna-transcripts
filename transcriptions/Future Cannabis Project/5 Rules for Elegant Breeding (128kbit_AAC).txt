[SPEAKER_01]: This is Mother Teresa, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: She won the Nobel Prize in 1979 for her
work with afflicted patients all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about this guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone recognize this guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Norman Borlaug, and he won the
Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for ending and
[SPEAKER_01]: averting global famine.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was really the most pressing issue
confronting humanity at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was sort of akin to the climate change
of his era.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobel Borlaug was a plant pathologist by
training, and he accomplished this work
[SPEAKER_01]: through breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why he's relevant to our talk
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see, after World War II, analysts
thought that by the 70s or 80s,
[SPEAKER_01]: the rate of the growth of human population
would exceed the rate of agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would lead to catastrophic starvation
and human die-off.
[SPEAKER_01]: But Borlaug solved this problem by
breeding improved grain, which increased
[SPEAKER_01]: yield by over 500%, and he thereby saved
over 100 million lives, making him
[SPEAKER_01]: arguably the most important figure in
human history.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why am I talking about Borlaug?
[SPEAKER_01]: Borlaug's fascinating to me because of a
conversation I had recently with an
[SPEAKER_01]: investor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I told this investor that we intended to
double the average per-acre yield in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in the next couple of years,
and they couldn't believe that was
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were incredulous, frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand the skepticism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like every day now, we hear new
biotech startups coming into the space,
[SPEAKER_01]: pitching disruptive technologies which
will change the market and disrupt the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole agricultural production.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hearing about molecular genomics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hearing about CRISPR.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hearing about biosynthetic
production of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all want better, faster,
stronger plants, but what's the right path
[SPEAKER_01]: to get there?
[SPEAKER_01]: The key to successful investing in
cannabis biotechnology is knowing which of
[SPEAKER_01]: these approaches are likely to be
successful and which are meaningful.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not mere fads.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here to say that the successful
breeders of the future will create elegant
[SPEAKER_01]: programs which combine both judicious
science and artful breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: My vision, based on 12 years of experience
in the labs, the fields, the greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the growhouses of California,
is a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've boiled down this vision to five
points, five rules for elegant breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all combine artistic, intuitive
concepts with organized, scientific
[SPEAKER_01]: concepts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're gonna go over each individually.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rule number one, grow plants from seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Plant production systems are something I
know a little bit about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hearing a lot lately, especially
about tissue culture, which, again,
[SPEAKER_01]: is something we have experience with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dark Heart opened the industry's first
tissue culture lab back in 2014.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tissue culture is a great technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's space-saving.
[SPEAKER_01]: It creates clean, high-quality plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the production system requires very
long lead times, and the costs are
[SPEAKER_01]: astronomical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many will tell you tissue culture is used
successfully in other agricultural crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used for things like bananas and
other tropical plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It typically has a means of last resort.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bananas that we grow are sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only grow them from tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most production in cannabis is produced
through clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how we make most of our plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really the core business of Dark
Heart Nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these plants can be very high-quality
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're moderately fast to market and
relatively low-priced.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's very high disease pressure for
these plants, and that makes it really
[SPEAKER_01]: hard to operate a clonal system at scale
over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we're going, and where most of the
industry will go, is to production based
[SPEAKER_01]: on seedlings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seedlings are the highest-quality,
lowest-cost production system.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the cleanest plants, and they have
very low disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're super low-cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're talking pennies here,
not dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with seeds is that there's not
very much availability of stabilized
[SPEAKER_01]: varietals, so you get a lot of variation
in the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a problem that can be readily
addressed by breeding, and it's one that
[SPEAKER_01]: we intend to solve.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do think that there's a role for tissue
culture in research and development.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some advanced technologies,
especially around phytosanitation,
[SPEAKER_01]: that are great for tissue culture,
but we don't see it as a production
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, rule number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Include heritage breeders in your program.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the guys that have been here for
decades.
[SPEAKER_01]: At Dark Heart, we work with them day in
and day out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're farmers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They understand this plant better than
anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been doing it longer than anyone,
and through grit and intuition,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've created an amazing abundance of
unique and interesting varietals that we
[SPEAKER_01]: consume in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can seem sort of low-tech and amateur
from afar, but I have to tell you,
[SPEAKER_01]: in three years, I saw these guys take the
average CBD content of varietals from one
[SPEAKER_01]: or 2% to 20%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing the work that they've done,
given limited resources.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're truly the industry's artists,
and any great program in breeding will
[SPEAKER_01]: build upon rather than replace their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at an analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the wild mustard plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humans have been breeding the wild mustard
plant for perhaps tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_01]: years, and that's looked like sort of
creative, amateurish breeding programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very intuitive by farmers, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Across many, many generations,
and as a result, they've created these
[SPEAKER_01]: unique species.
[SPEAKER_01]: The broccoli, the cauliflower,
the Brussels sprout, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: None of us would consider abandoning the
broccoli, and neither should we consider
[SPEAKER_01]: abandoning the breeders that have taken
this plant to where it is today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Successful breeding programs, again,
will combine this intuitive artistic
[SPEAKER_01]: approach and supplement it with modern
scientific approaches.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a well-known concept amongst
breeders, but history is replete with
[SPEAKER_01]: examples of breeding programs that failed
to acknowledge and incorporate this basic
[SPEAKER_01]: concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see some of those examples here in a
second.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, rule number three, avoid tech fads.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is hard to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much hype around these new
technologies, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm as excited as anyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got these molecular breeding tools
that offer precision and so much power to
[SPEAKER_01]: the breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to use them, but I caution you,
don't give the nerds the keys to the
[SPEAKER_01]: kingdom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because you have a hammer doesn't
mean the problem is a nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: The solutions we may be looking for might
not be technological, and any technology
[SPEAKER_01]: out of context will fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the 20s, there was a great new
technology on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where breeders would apply x-ray
technologies to seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would induce mutations in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the purveyors of this technology
promised that it would create marvelous
[SPEAKER_01]: new varietals that were quote unquote made
to order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sound familiar?
[SPEAKER_01]: At one point, you could actually take your
seeds to like a local drug store or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that, and they would have,
you could have them irradiated on site and
[SPEAKER_01]: take them back to your garden and grow
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: As interesting as that is, you might not
be surprised to find out that this
[SPEAKER_01]: technology had virtually zero commercial
applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was all hype, all science.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could see some of the hype,
but no art.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no understanding of the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the technology can distract a
program with fads, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Other times, the program can implement
good, strong, techniques, but the goals
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves are misplaced.
[SPEAKER_01]: That brings us to rule number four.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consider consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems obvious, but it hasn't always
been.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about the tomato?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you guys like your grocery store
tomatoes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_01]: I hear some people liking them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the grocery store tomatoes,
they look great, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're bright, they're firm.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're colorful, but they taste like
garbage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they taste like water,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason is that since the 60s,
tomato breeders have bred for everything
[SPEAKER_01]: but flavor, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They've bred for mechanical harvesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've bred for firmness.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've bred for pest and disease,
but like literally the consumer was not on
[SPEAKER_01]: the list of breeding targets for tomato
programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That breeding was scientific, but it
didn't consider the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It didn't consider the end result of the
program.
[SPEAKER_01]: It focused on agronomic traits alone,
and that led the program astray.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, nowhere is this more of a
problem than in cannabis, where flavor is
[SPEAKER_01]: king, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what our consumers are really looking
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this problem in tomatoes and other
vegetable and fruit crops is an ongoing
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: In response to it, breeders in recent
decades have sought to apply molecular
[SPEAKER_01]: biotechnology tools to correct it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually led to the introduction of the
world's first GMO crop, which was created
[SPEAKER_01]: by a company called Calgene here in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: They called this crop the flavor saver
tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was introduced in 1994, and it had a
gene that extended shelf life of the
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, this allowed the tomato to ripen on
the vine, which is the big problem with
[SPEAKER_01]: tomato flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's a tomato that ripens on the vine
can be much sweeter and have a much better
[SPEAKER_01]: flavor at market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it should have been a hit,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only market on, it's the only
tomato on the market that tastes great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the company was led by scientists,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They were eager to use this GMO
technology, and they didn't include input
[SPEAKER_01]: from farmers and other people in the
supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a result, they didn't really understand
the supply chain or the economics of the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial farming industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't start with really great
tasting varietals, and they didn't start
[SPEAKER_01]: with great yielding varietals.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a result, the flavor saver tasted
better, but it didn't taste that much
[SPEAKER_01]: better, and it was really hard to produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was low yielding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It required special packaging to get it to
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: The production costs were sky high,
and consumers rebelled at high prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: The product was ultimately abandoned in
1997, and Calgene was sold at a discount
[SPEAKER_01]: to Monsanto that same year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It brings us to rule number five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Use an integrative approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most understand, you have to understand
the context in which you're breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the targets, and what impact will
they have on the supply chain?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is breeding even the right way to address
the problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only do you need multidisciplinary
scientists, but you also need stakeholders
[SPEAKER_01]: from across the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine if Calgene had included farmers
and processors and distributors in their
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding program.
[SPEAKER_01]: They may have identified some of these
problems earlier on, and that would have
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed them to pivot the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Molecular breeding technologies,
like the flavor saver, are super exciting,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they have their limits.
[SPEAKER_01]: They allow really precise targeting of
genetic changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They allow precise control, sort of like a
scalpel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scalpels are really good, really important
tools if you're doing surgery.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're building a house, a scalpel
isn't of much use to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Breeding is much more like construction
than it is like surgery.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go back to Borlaug.
[SPEAKER_01]: What did he target that won him a Nobel
Peace Prize?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Average production of this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, that's what almost all breeding is
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about it in different terms,
pest resistance, drought resistance,
[SPEAKER_01]: other targets, but most of these are about
yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing with yield is there's no gene
for yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no marker that can be identified
for yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yield is a complex interaction of hundreds
of genes and non-genetic factors,
[SPEAKER_01]: like environment, production system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the proof.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a graph of the improvement of corn
yields over the last 150 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might consider the slope, especially
in the modern era since the 60s,
[SPEAKER_01]: to represent the impact of breeding on the
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep in mind, corn is the most important
grain worldwide.
[SPEAKER_01]: The US crop alone is worth $51 billion a
year, which makes it the biggest target
[SPEAKER_01]: for research and development.
[SPEAKER_01]: No cost is spared on breeding corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every tool available is used on corn.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing that I like to point out here is
you'll see my callout on the graph.
[SPEAKER_01]: The corn genome was sequenced back in
2009.
[SPEAKER_01]: We might expect that if modern molecular
genomics were breakthrough technologies,
[SPEAKER_01]: that the slope of that graph would have
went aggressively up.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you can see, since 2009, corn breeding
has stayed alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Along the steady path that it was already
on, suggesting that although this tool may
[SPEAKER_01]: have some uses, it's certainly not a
breakthrough technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go back to Borlaug one more time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not technological breakthroughs,
what is it that makes a breeding program
[SPEAKER_01]: successful?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it that made Borlaug successful?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about elegant systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did Borlaug increase the average yield
of wheat by 500%?
[SPEAKER_01]: He bred two crops a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He bred two crops a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was his innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Borlaug was breeding here in the central
highlands of Mexico, in this town called
[SPEAKER_01]: Chapingo.
[SPEAKER_01]: He realized that because of the difference
in latitude, at the end of the breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: season, he could take his seed and move it
north to the Yaqui Valley, where he could
[SPEAKER_01]: get a second grain season in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was called shuttle breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a clever innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the breeding system, rather than a
breakthrough technology, that clever
[SPEAKER_01]: innovation accelerated the improvement of
grain yields, and it saved 100 million
[SPEAKER_01]: lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: Borlaug's solution wasn't genius,
but it was elegant and unexpected.
[SPEAKER_01]: That kind of elegance will drive
successful breeding programs in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Successful programs in the future will
combine judicious sides of science,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they will include and accelerate the
experienced, creative, intuitive,
[SPEAKER_01]: artistic breeding that's already here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They certainly won't replace it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, Dan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to ask, because you've pointed
out the heritage farmers and people who
[SPEAKER_00]: have been developing brands for strains
for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is, why aren't we seeing some
of these heritage strains on the market in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis products?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maui, Waui, these type of brands that have
been around for many, many years that were
[SPEAKER_00]: very flavorful, very lovely strains that I
don't see on the market anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are these?
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's interesting because there's actually
a lot of demand in the market for some of
[SPEAKER_01]: those varietals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say the biggest thing that I see
is they're really hard to come by these
[SPEAKER_01]: days.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing about cannabis coming out
of this underground space is that many of
[SPEAKER_01]: these programs just were lost over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think in many ways, there's a demand
out there for them, but it's just an issue
[SPEAKER_01]: of finding them and bringing them back to
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, thank you, Dan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Round of applause.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
