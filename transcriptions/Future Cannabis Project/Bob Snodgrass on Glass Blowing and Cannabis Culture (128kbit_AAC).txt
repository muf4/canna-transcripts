[SPEAKER_01]: Hey everybody, I'm Josh from Dragonfly
Earth Medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm Kelly from Dragonfly Earth
Medicine and today we have here with us
[SPEAKER_00]: Bob Snodgrass, legendary glass maker,
educator, amazing human being and
[SPEAKER_00]: community leader.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are talking about where cannabis
has come from and you won a lifetime
[SPEAKER_01]: achievement award this year and we would
love to know how you're feeling about
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: How am I feeling about it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm amazed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm having flashbacks to days before any
kind of regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember a guy once telling me that he
used to make jello water and spray his
[SPEAKER_02]: plants with it to get extra weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I instantly didn't want to smoke any
more of his weed, but today we were tested
[SPEAKER_02]: for how many terpenes, what your THC is,
but also you get tests that say no mold
[SPEAKER_02]: and no pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of reassurance really brings
in a healthy approach to what we can do
[SPEAKER_02]: with our thousands of strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many have been developed that there are
weird characteristics to so many pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if one of them doesn't work for
somebody, find one that does because they
[SPEAKER_02]: all have a kind of a different trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then anyhow, here I'm going to give
you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what have you really seen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you've been in a really black market,
really hidden.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done a lot of Grateful Dead tours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So traveled with the Grateful Dead family
and now being here at the Emerald Cup and
[SPEAKER_00]: an event where obviously there's a lot of
Grateful Dead family all around all day
[SPEAKER_00]: today and yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it like now in being with this
whole family in a state of legalization?
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes me giggle first off.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, yeah, for the approach that we
have now, we can walk out there and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a sign that says you can smoke on
this side and not on that side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody can and everybody can carry,
I see people carrying around clones and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just tickled.
[SPEAKER_02]: The open sharing in the glass world opened
it up that we've made advances in glass
[SPEAKER_02]: tenfold at exponential rates Well,
this kind of event for cannabis is
[SPEAKER_02]: allowing that exponentiality to boil over
into us growing better pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my goal as a glassblower was to make a
pipe that allowed it to operate that would
[SPEAKER_02]: let pot work at its maximum potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have so many growers that are
getting the pot to grow at its maximum
[SPEAKER_02]: potentials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to thank you for opening us
up originally to clean cannabis smoking
[SPEAKER_01]: and being able to smoke out of a glass
pipe originally when it was metal pipes
[SPEAKER_01]: and dirty apparatuses and plastic bongs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you really kind of helped us get
into something clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even tin cans.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in the day, when I first hit dead
tour, my sales pitch was have you ever
[SPEAKER_02]: smoked out of glass because 99.9% of them
hadn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a whole career came after that of
people imitating mine and working at that
[SPEAKER_02]: to go on and say, really like the way you
live.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you teach me?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had people come out of the woodwork
from all over the country, all over the
[SPEAKER_02]: world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I gave away all the secrets but one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And today that's what should be done with
everybody's pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We appreciate you leading us like that
with the spirit of the Grateful Dead and
[SPEAKER_01]: the giving and then the spirit of what
you've taught us.
[SPEAKER_01]: By teaching everyone, you taught us about
the bell curve and how we all learn
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we all learn together, we rise as our
consciousness and our awareness.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've open source educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have been an unbelievable,
shiny example of come on over.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the time and the dedication,
I'll teach you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know from way back in the day and going
out to the bus out in Veneta, there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: ton of people around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were really always teaching everybody
whatever that they wanted to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now there's all these amazing glass
blowers all over the place that really
[SPEAKER_00]: have carried your legacy and have really
taken it even to their own style.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's that like for you to see that?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not all a bunch of outlaws
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody has to be really ducking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's yeah, you can be part of a
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I'm encouraging people,
I think that I know that are growers to
[SPEAKER_02]: check out their local granges and find out
about establishing co-ops because bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses are going to want to come after
you pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you got a method to stand up,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what we're working on with
Dragonfly Earth Medicine, bringing people
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're upholding the spirit of what Bob
Snodgrass has done in the Snodgrass
[SPEAKER_01]: family.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for joining us and
giving us the opportunity to share a
[SPEAKER_01]: little story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Kel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
