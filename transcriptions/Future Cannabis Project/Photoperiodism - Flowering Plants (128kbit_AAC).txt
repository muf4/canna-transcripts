[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, this is Travis from The Hemp Mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you are watching today is part one of
two parts on the topic of photoperiodism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure some of you who are watching are
thinking, what the heck is photoperiodism?
[SPEAKER_00]: But for those of you who are watching who
are currently in the hemp industry or the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry, this is a topic that is
not discussed as often as it should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that is is just because of the
nascent and new market of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_00]: general if we compare it to other mature
markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I'd like to do through this video is
for one address the concept of
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiodism, help you have an
appreciation for it as well as a basic
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of what it is, discuss
photoperiodic classes, maybe connect some
[SPEAKER_00]: dots between plants that you grew up
enjoying and how they're manipulated to
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, similar to how we manipulate
cannabis to flower, and then go through
[SPEAKER_00]: some practical scenarios in the greenhouse
and in the field on how you can use this
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding to manipulate the crop to
your benefit, ultimately increasing your
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom line at the end of the season or at
the end of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, before we jump into the
presentation itself, I want to give you
[SPEAKER_00]: just a quick understanding of my
background and why it's pertinent to what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself as well as my business partner,
Dr. Allison Justice, both of us have been
[SPEAKER_00]: trained in commercial horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to school at Clemson and Virginia
Tech for environmental horticulture and
[SPEAKER_00]: then went and worked with one of the
largest ornamental crop growers in the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we think about agriculture,
we have a branch off of agriculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is horticulture, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is shrub production, tree
production, flower production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then from horticulture, we have a
branch of floriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the background that both
myself and my business partner have.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an extensive background in
floricultural crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I bring this up is because,
you know, I think back to my career in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ornamental industry and I hold that
experience of extreme value.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, this is a mature market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a supply chain which has been
completely developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in many cases, those who are in it
understand the potential of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way to secure more business
or the only way to grow is to maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: internal production regarding consistency
and efficiency to a level that can benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: from shoestring margins at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: In these mature horticultural and
floricultural markets, those that are
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with such a small margin at the
end of the year, they are incentivized to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand crop physiology to a depth at
which the cannabis industry has yet to
[SPEAKER_00]: even touch the surface of.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now let's bring some of what we've
learned from these mature markets into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis market, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's, you know, stop in some cases
banging our head on the wall saying what's
[SPEAKER_00]: next and start to truly be able to be
innovative and utilize some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: concepts that are already known within
mature horticultural markets and start
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing them in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So through this video, what I'd like to do
is I'd like to touch on what the heck is
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiodism?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why does it matter to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are photoperiodic classes?
[SPEAKER_00]: What class is cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then let's talk through some scenarios and
examples being indoors, being in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, being in multiple different
latitudes in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding field production of hemp and
ultimately equip you to maximize the
[SPEAKER_00]: potential of the genetics and of the
cannabis plants that you have to increase
[SPEAKER_00]: your bottom line.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and so with that said, let's jump
into the meat of this video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving forward into the future,
the HempMind will release what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: calling our technical support series.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first topic that we'll be
discussing is photoperiodism.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, like I said, I will be
presenting on part one and later on,
[SPEAKER_00]: Allison will launch another video which
we'll be presenting on part two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is photoperiodism?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just so that whomever is watching,
I want us all to be on the same page.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna read exactly what this bullet,
this first bullet, says.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photoperiodism is a physiological response
in multiple different plant species that
[SPEAKER_00]: dictates whether or not the plant is
focused on vegetative growth or
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This response in photoperiodic plants is
dictated based on the amount of darkness a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant receives during a single 24 hour
period and then consistently thereafter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know many of you have heard the term
photoperiod.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this refers to the amount of light
hours in a given 24 hour period.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, humans work during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see when the lights are on or the sun
is out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we discuss photoperiodic
plants, we discuss the photo period,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of time light is on or the sun
is out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not discuss the duration of the
night period even though we know that the
[SPEAKER_00]: length of the night period obviously
correlates with the length of the day when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're only focused on discussing a 24 hour
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we know that plants ultimately
perceive the length of the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: So moving forward, when discussing
photoperiodic plants and I say
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiod, I'm talking about the length
of the day and not the length of the
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are different types of photoperiodic
classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these classes include long day plants,
short day plants, day length neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis falls into the short day plant
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this means is in order to
maximize the potential of this crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: based specifically in certain facets of
the market that you're participating in,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need to maximize the production of this
plant by giving it a long day followed
[SPEAKER_00]: then by a short day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this transition from a long day to a
short day initiates flowering,
[SPEAKER_00]: causes the plant to go from vegetative
growth to reproductive growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a short day plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long day and then a short day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for long day plants, it's
flipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, in order to maximize the
potential of other species, you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: give them a short day followed by a long
day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the cannabis industry, there's also
much discussion around auto flower
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And auto flower, I believe, is a little
bit different than day neutral,
[SPEAKER_00]: but very similar concepts that you're not
subject to the length of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of either an accumulation of
growth that triggers flower development.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're gonna focus on today is
short day plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I do wanna make one more thought
apparent here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are additional characteristics that
can be attached to these photoperiodic
[SPEAKER_00]: classes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it can go even a level deeper in the
complexity of these different flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for example, you could even have
obligate short day plants or facultative
[SPEAKER_00]: long day plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give one example of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a good example of a facultative long
day plant is greenhouse vine crop
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, it's been proven that they
are facultative long day, which means the
[SPEAKER_00]: longer the day, the better regarding
flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keep in mind that we're having to
navigate through these different flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: responses for multiple crops, and it is
certainly nothing new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growing up, I'm sure maybe your mom had
garden mums on the porch in the fall,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if not had Christmas poinsettias on
the fireplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these plants have the exact same,
if not very similar short day
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiodic nature to them that cannabis
has.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these plants have been grown for
decades, and we've learned an extreme
[SPEAKER_00]: amount from maximizing the production of
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one thing I like to just point out
is this is nothing new.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is the cannabis industry not talking
about photoperiodism when it's how we
[SPEAKER_00]: dictate and forecast production of these
other crops?
[SPEAKER_00]: We should.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with a basic understanding of what
photoperiodism is, and understanding that
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is a short day crop, meaning that
you need a short day preceded by a long
[SPEAKER_00]: day in order to trigger flowering,
let's now look at an example of an indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: This schedule here is just an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will admit that this schedule is widely
used within completely climate controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana facilities to smokeable
flower greenhouse hemp facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's just break it down and just walk
through it so that we understand how to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at this from a crop development
standpoint as well as a production stage
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we look at the at the top of the the
graphic here, I have production stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I have the vegetative stage and
another mature markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: In some cases, you call this bulking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have flower development.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are three specific different
production stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Under that, we have week number.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not year week.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is week number within this single
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let's start with discussing
propagation and propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm focusing on schedules that
originate from using vegetative material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in propagation, let's say that you you
have mother stock growing and you take a
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for this example, let's use a 72 cell
tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a cutting or an unrooted clone
and you stick this in a 72 cell tray in a
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ideally can root this between 14 to 21
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the sake of the example, I used 14 in
a perfect world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could root everything in 14 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are in we have the understanding of
OK, we need to go through propagation
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to root these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what crop development stage do we want
to keep them in?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep them in a vegetative
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we apply a long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, we apply an extremely
long day of 18 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if it's been interesting for me
to understand why the cannabis industry by
[SPEAKER_00]: default is using 18 hours is a long day
and 12 hours is a short day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what what we've come up with is that,
you know, if you were to open a crop
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology book and you you were to read
through, I guess, the photoperiodism
[SPEAKER_00]: section by the book for most plants,
a long day is anything above 12 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the day length of anything longer than
12 hours and a short day is 12 hours or
[SPEAKER_00]: less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so within the cannabis industry,
it's widely used that 12 hours is the
[SPEAKER_00]: photoperiod at which you should initiate
flowering with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do believe that that's just because
by the book, that's what it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also are using 18 hours as a long day
because that's an extremely long day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're pretty much guaranteed that that
plant is going to stay vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why in this example,
I show 1812 because in most cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities throughout the world,
they're using this lighting schedule,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I hope after we watch this video,
for those of you that are growing indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's challenge this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so let's move from propagation and now
discuss the vegetative stage of crop
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from propagation, like I said,
we have a 72 cell tray that's been rooted
[SPEAKER_00]: between 14 to 21 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still under a long day because we
want to keep the plants vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, let's transplant these rooted clones,
these liners into larger pots and perhaps
[SPEAKER_00]: move them into a different room or move
them and space them out in the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: and keep them again under long days for
three more weeks so that we can build some
[SPEAKER_00]: size on these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vegetative part of the cycle is
focused on these plants building a root
[SPEAKER_00]: system, focusing on leaf development,
shoot development, cell elongation,
[SPEAKER_00]: cell division, making these plants grow in
bulk and get bigger in size, ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: influencing where you have flowers being
developed and ultimately dictating the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of yield you get at the end of the
cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the vegetative cycle and maximizing it
is very important for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've gone from propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've now transplanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've gone through vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've kept both production stages under
the same crop developmental stage by
[SPEAKER_00]: applying long days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we do what's called flipping of the
photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we do is we reduce the amount of light
hours from 18 to 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does that do?
[SPEAKER_00]: It extends the length of the night,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This in short day plants triggers them
into flower initiation or into a
[SPEAKER_00]: reproductive state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you see here on week six,
we start to initiate flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And depending on whether you're a
marijuana grower trying to produce as much
[SPEAKER_00]: THC as possible or you're a hemp grower
that is trying to push the limits with CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: while still making sure that you stay
compliant with point three total THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would then take your cannabinoid tests
throughout this flower development part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would influence when you
ultimately harvest this crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that basic schedule understood for
indoor production of cannabis or hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's look at some pictures that have been
grown under a very similar schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the picture that I just brought up
here, this is an example of what's called
[SPEAKER_00]: a sea of green.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I wonder if my mouse will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most likely they had two weeks,
if not three, whatever it took to root the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had that same duration as part of
what we see here on this example.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what they did is they didn't allow the
plants to get very big before they
[SPEAKER_00]: flowered them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could be due to the regulations
per state if their required to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain amount of plant count versus
taking up amount of space, whatever it may
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've chosen to have more plants per
their area with less amount of a
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative cycle throughout that
production cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they've done is they've
transplanted these plants that have rooted
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have a very high density planting
that they give a very short window of
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plants don't get too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they initiate flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you have a sea of green.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this example, which I hope you can see,
I could have cropped it a little better,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you can see that each individual plant
is much larger than the plants over here
[SPEAKER_00]: in the sea of green example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this shows us is that they did
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely they propagated these plants
in two to three weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They then transplanted them into much
larger pots, spaced them at much wider
[SPEAKER_00]: spacing, and they gave these plants a
longer vegetative cycle to build mass on
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most likely this scenario has used
the three to four week vegetative period
[SPEAKER_00]: versus here that most likely used one,
if not one and a half to maybe two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it shows you the difference in plant
size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately it will influence the yield
per plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of what you see is dictated based on
understanding the photoperiodic nature of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and how you manipulate its light
cycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so let's move on to discussing
production of cannabis outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the hemp mine gets quite
passionate because obviously we are a hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: company and our main target customer is a
field farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are working very closely with
greenhouse customers, but we ourselves are
[SPEAKER_00]: vertically integrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grow 60 acres of hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on our third year now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we want to offer as much technical
support to field farmers as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: For one, knowing the risk that we're all
taking going into this from the start,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as understanding how volatile the
market value of the final product is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's look at the map itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once this video is published,
you will have a tab on our website that is
[SPEAKER_00]: labeled as HPMS.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Hemp Planting Map.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have here a good description,
high level on how to use it, what to look
[SPEAKER_00]: for and the purpose of the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately this video is meant to show
you how to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to shout out to Joanne Logan at
the University of Tennessee.
[SPEAKER_00]: She was the climatologist that helped us
compile all of the data for this map and
[SPEAKER_00]: also helped us put it into a functional
and interactive format.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much, Joanne,
for helping us do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make this data available to farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's step back for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about an indoor crop
schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about the importance of applying
long days, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To help the plant bulk in size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the field, you don't have the
ability to manipulate lighting like you do
[SPEAKER_00]: in a greenhouse or an indoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to strategically plan your
production outdoors so that you maximize
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment at the location where you
are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with this said, there are key
environmental factors that you should
[SPEAKER_00]: think about when determining when to plant
at your location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are your frost date,
or excuse me, your frost potential,
[SPEAKER_00]: the date at these different frost
potentials and the day length.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so let's dive into the map itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, if you press and drag,
it is interactive, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of these different dots that you
see on the map are specific locations that
[SPEAKER_00]: have environmental data tied to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the sake of this example,
let's look at Lansing, Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd zoom in and you can press and drag,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's click on, I believe this is
Lansing, so East Lansing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you some basic information in
this data table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it shows the latitude, longitude,
elevation, the state, the city name,
[SPEAKER_00]: but let's expand it so we can wrap our
heads around what is the valuable data at
[SPEAKER_00]: this location.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what you see here on the left,
it says date, and then it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: The date right here is May 15th,
but what's important to understand is the
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the potential of frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've given it to you pretty much
from 100% to 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at 90% chance of frost in Michigan,
the date would be April 12th, but then you
[SPEAKER_00]: would have a 10% chance of frost on May
15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it shows you kind of the potential
of frost because as we all know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the last thing you want to do is plant too
early, especially clones, and the frost
[SPEAKER_00]: come through and kill all of your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then if we scroll down,
we understand the date that correlates
[SPEAKER_00]: with the frost potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's figure out the day length.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you come down to 10%, chance of frost,
which we had up here, and we see DL.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is day length.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on May 15th, we have 10% chance of
frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also on May 15th, we have a day length
of 14 hours and then 65% out of 100
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so let me dive in a little bit deeper
to explain to you how you should look at
[SPEAKER_00]: this specific data point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that we totally grasp what it's saying
about photo period and the day length.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me highlight this so that we're all
on the same page.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on May 15th, we have a 10% chance of
frost, but our day length, as notated here
[SPEAKER_00]: on the hemp line, hemp planting map,
is 14 hours 0.65.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does this mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It means that we have 14 hours plus 65% of
an additional hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: For how we had to format this,
we couldn't make the 0.65 be minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had to make it be a percentage of an
additional hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just break this down really
simply so it's not confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since it is a percentage, let's turn this
into a pie chart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, we could think of a
clock as a pie chart, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because in a clock, 60 minutes equals
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what is 65% of a full hour?
[SPEAKER_00]: 39 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tells us that this photo period is 14
hours and 39 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because 39 minutes is 65% of one hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so now that we understand this,
let's look at two practical examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one being in Lansing,
Michigan, like I showed before,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the second one being in Alexandria,
Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so same location.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see here in the clip at the bottom
right that I chose the exact same data box
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were just looking at when looking
at the interactive hemp planting map.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've put it into a format so that we could
run through this example pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I have here up on the left is it
shows frost potential, the day length,
[SPEAKER_00]: the year week, as some growers use that,
and then also just the day, the day of the
[SPEAKER_00]: year, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: In this scenario, if we were working with
a farmer in Lansing, Michigan,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that farmer wanted to plant Southern
Cat Daddy for outdoor field smokeable
[SPEAKER_00]: flower production, we would go about
recommending when he plant based on this
[SPEAKER_00]: exact example right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern Cat Daddy has a flowering
response time of 14 hours, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that any day length longer
than 14 hours will ensure that it stays
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative, and any day length shorter
than 14 hours will trigger it into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: initiation, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we wanna plant, we wanna make sure that
we plant when the day length is longer
[SPEAKER_00]: than 14 hours so that it can focus on
vegetative growth and continue that growth
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the majority of the season and
get bigger and bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: So over here, I show frost potential,
and I started on April 29th.
[SPEAKER_00]: April 29th, we have a photo period of 14
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is right at the line, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would not recommend planting at 14
hours as that is this cultivar's flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: response time exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would go into flower if planted April
29th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, you have a 60% chance of frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the risk and investment that you're
taking upfront anyway with this crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: do you also wanna risk frost?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would not recommend planting in
Michigan, in Lansing, Southern Cat Daddy,
[SPEAKER_00]: on April 29th.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then would say, okay, what's our next
best option?
[SPEAKER_00]: We go a week later.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have May 6th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Photo period has increased 19 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could actually plant Southern Cat
Daddy because now the day length is longer
[SPEAKER_00]: than 14 hours and it would stay
vegetative.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, we have a 40% chance of frost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I again would say, hey, no, we're not
risking it yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's our next option?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then you see here we have 20%
chance, May 13th, 14 hours and 47 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely long enough to plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the sake of this example,
I would recommend, okay, at 10% chance of
[SPEAKER_00]: frost, let's get these plants in the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your day length is definitely long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is at the end of May.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not waste any more time to get the
plants in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then once plants are planted, they're
growing, they're establishing,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're focusing on vegetative growth,
you have a natural distribution of day
[SPEAKER_00]: length throughout the year, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the spring, it slowly gets longer
and then as you hit the solstice,
[SPEAKER_00]: it peaks and then the day lengths get
shorter as you go into fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we follow that throughout the
season, the plant stays vegetative and
[SPEAKER_00]: initiates flowering when day lengths come
back down to 14 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so on August 12th, Southern Cat Daddy
would initiate flowering in Lansing,
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan because we've hit 14 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Lansing, Michigan, this is when I
would recommend to this farmer with this
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar when to plant because this would
allow them to have 11 weeks of vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: grow time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would allow the plants to really fill
out in size and it truly should dictate
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of plants they plant per acre
based on the amount of vegetative growth
[SPEAKER_00]: time that they do have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now let's look at the exact same
cultivar in Louisiana, a much more
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern latitude in the city of
Alexandria, Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would look at the data from the map
right here, just shows another screenshot
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully, we don't have to worry too
much about frost, but the day lengths are
[SPEAKER_00]: much shorter than they are in Michigan at
the same dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I referenced the same week,
week 17, the same date, April 29th,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have 10% chance of frost, not a big
concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, our day length is really short at
13 hours and 21 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely do not want to plant Southern
Cat Daddy would prematurely go into
[SPEAKER_00]: flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would recommend that they actually
plant June 3rd because your day length is
[SPEAKER_00]: right over 14 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would hope that this would ensure
that it stays vegetative if not planting a
[SPEAKER_00]: little later.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, their natural distribution of
long days peaks and falls much sooner than
[SPEAKER_00]: what we saw in Michigan and their plant
Southern Cat Daddy would go into flower
[SPEAKER_00]: initiation on July 1st.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in Louisiana with the exact same
cultivar, you would have only three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: of vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant would be much smaller than the
plants in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, keep in mind they're the same
cost and most likely other breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: companies are recommending that you plant
them at the same crop density as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how we should do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the hemp mine would do is knowing
all of this data going into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: also knowing the objective of your
production and what final product you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to offer to the market and when.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would allow you to understand this like
we do through this kind of example,
[SPEAKER_00]: but offer a solution that would match a
similar grow time in Louisiana to the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that through offering a different
cultivar that has a shorter flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: response time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Michigan, this is the example of
Southern Cat Daddy, 11 weeks pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: of vegetative grow time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Louisiana, only three.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we would do is we would recommend
a cultivar named Southern Sunset to lower
[SPEAKER_00]: latitude states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Alexandria, Louisiana, it would
allow this farmer to have this vegetative
[SPEAKER_00]: crop schedule instead of the three weeks
Southern Cat Daddy vegetative crop
[SPEAKER_00]: schedule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because Southern Sunset has a
response time of 13 hours and 20 minutes,
[SPEAKER_00]: not 14 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the grower in Louisiana can be
competitive in plant size and yield per
[SPEAKER_00]: acre when planting the same crop density
as the farmer in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: This data dictates when to plant,
crop density per acre, ultimately what
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics you should choose and when
ultimately to start testing, because this
[SPEAKER_00]: is when the plants will go into flower
initiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so from here is when you should count
down pretty much to harvest and when you
[SPEAKER_00]: should start taking your first cannabinoid
tests on week one, two, or three after
[SPEAKER_00]: flower initiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this chart just shows you the response
time of each of our cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will expand on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coming out with a new catalog for
2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will elaborate on this more with
actually having more cultivars as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work very closely with a lab partner,
Kacha Labs, and with them, we are able to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer our customers discounts on
cannabinoid tests because we do recommend
[SPEAKER_00]: that you take quite a few throughout the
flower development production stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: your crop cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately what we would do for each
of our customers is create a schedule like
[SPEAKER_00]: this for you after we're on the same page
with what genetics you want to use,
[SPEAKER_00]: for what purpose, and at which location,
we create a crop schedule for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: helping you understand, okay, when you
need to plant, when these plants will go
[SPEAKER_00]: into flower initiation, and when you
should start testing and give you all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the proper information for how to test,
how to sample, where to send your samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this concludes part one,
photoperiodism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part two will be coming soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will release this before the end of
2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned for Dr. Justice as we will
dive a little deeper into the flowering
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: During our 2020 field trials, we have
noticed some very interesting responses,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are leading us to expand our short
day plant understanding even further.
So stay tuned for part two,
photoperiodism.
