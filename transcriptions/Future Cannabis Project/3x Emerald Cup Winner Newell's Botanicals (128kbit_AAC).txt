[SPEAKER_00]: One of the surprises coming back again
this third year in a row is noticing how
[SPEAKER_00]: many people are not here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of our friends that have been here
in the past and are not here or not this
[SPEAKER_00]: well not here participating.
[SPEAKER_00]: They might be here at the show and it
really we feel privileged to actually make
[SPEAKER_00]: it past the first two extinction event
level events that have moved a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people out of the manufactured products
end of the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very thankful for our distributor to
help us get past that point and our
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing partner to help us be in
compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's the landscape's really changing
and we're trying to stay in it and trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to help our fellow sun-grown cannabis
folks stay in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing I noticed about the
Emerald Cup this year is there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: less weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this is the Hall of Flowers right so
there's no weed sales in this room where
[SPEAKER_01]: we are but this time last year there were
so many people walking around with blunts
[SPEAKER_01]: in their mouths that this room was
hotboxed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'm noticing is despite
greater access to cannabis there's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole lot of it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where's the guy with the blunt
bandoliers?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: No I'm definitely seeing the cannabis
industry evolve cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no longer just your Cheech and Chong
kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's your your your mom pop video are
starting to use cannabis more.
[SPEAKER_00]: The boomers are actually using cannabis
more and you can tell that it's changed
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole industry that we work in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been interesting to watch that
development.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting to see how it's playing
out here at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how everyone's bringing their
packaging game up.
[SPEAKER_01]: The boxes are really fly this year I have
to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what was your hardest moment over the
last 12 months?
[SPEAKER_00]: Shared manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to find a location actually build
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to make sure that we we could stay
in business and then the BCC regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: you know making that type of manufacturing
questionable and yeah and then trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: find investment to actually keep us
floating and moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot well you live it with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's stressful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think for me the worst was when they
dropped the reg revision after the 45 day
[SPEAKER_01]: comment period and immediately banned our
business model with two weeks of comments
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they sent that off to the OAL to
get written into law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know that was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been multiple existential crises
throughout the last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like are we going to survive this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: That one was the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had like a breakdown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm not going to be okay for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know what you come to figure out
is like no one's position in this industry
[SPEAKER_01]: is guaranteed or secure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you want to keep if you want to be
here month after month year after year
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it basically comes down to not
quitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you come to be in the cannabis
industry from your position your
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay at that point in time we're talking
like seven eight years ago I was I was
[SPEAKER_01]: married to somebody who was having really
bad health problems due to prescription
[SPEAKER_01]: medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I told him he should start smoking
weed instead.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it kind of led us down a path for a
while where we got really involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: advocacy public speaking at shows like
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I just I kind of knew that I just
wanted to be around cannabis and where it
[SPEAKER_01]: was going that I could actually fulfill my
my kind of inner drive to help people
[SPEAKER_01]: through this new commercial pathway that
was at that point in time just expanding
[SPEAKER_01]: right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know fast forward a bunch of years
and I had a lot of contacts in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and a lot of jobs under my belt
and experience and a lot of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when I saw that the the market in
the topical space was saturated with
[SPEAKER_01]: stinky sticky ineffective smells like weed
you know gunk essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't about to to recommend something
like that to my grandma who you know was
[SPEAKER_01]: having hip surgery and is super Christian
and conservative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to be like here Nan rub this
weed cream on your body and go to church
[SPEAKER_01]: just reeking to high heaven.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we developed something just from the
ground up to be to solve all those
[SPEAKER_01]: problems to be easy to use to be friendly
to an older more conservative customer to
[SPEAKER_01]: not smell like weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be highly efficacious and and I didn't
launch that as a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just handed that to my grandma.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Emerald Cup came around in 2016
and I decided to bottle some of it slap a
[SPEAKER_01]: sticker on it and then we won.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was very unexpected.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did you feel in that in that moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well for myself like when you came into my
life and you discovered me I was working
[SPEAKER_00]: on building regenerative natural farming
techniques for cannabis because you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: came out of my background is
bioremediation cleaning up the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized a lot of the same
techniques could be used in agriculture to
[SPEAKER_00]: advance natural crop production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was I had always been in Canada into
cannabis as a user and it was only in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last seven to 10 years that I got into it
as like breeder producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a good way to to to prove and
validate agricultural principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a high uptake plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could prove that I could grow
cannabis well with these techniques I can
[SPEAKER_00]: grow anything really well with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other half it's it's a clean
growing technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want a plant that's going to be clean
for somebody using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For potentially for their health.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was seeing a lot of nasty products
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate hearing the statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do to flush bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you talking about flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this flush you speak of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to flush shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean my plants they're does does nature
flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess fall rains would be a flush.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean no no that's stupid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's that was my passion in getting
into it when I met Chelsea.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a marriage made in heaven.
[SPEAKER_00]: She she does really great plant work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of really good soil work and
together we were coming to the Emerald Cup
[SPEAKER_00]: as a cannabis consultant team for growing
and chose to enter it to kind of validate
[SPEAKER_00]: what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know put in a flower entry put in a
topical product and ended up winning and
[SPEAKER_00]: pivot to actually creating a business
around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really want to get back to farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We we we do this to support our camp to
support our farming habit essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we haven't been able to be on farm
as much as we want to right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't want this to blow up so I can
go back to like tending goats and sheep
[SPEAKER_00]: and chickens and plants and and that's
that's where I'd want to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know this is all fun and good and it's
helping people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really just want to get back on the
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working in association with farms
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few of them here being represented in
boobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't have our own farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the whole purpose for us getting
into this was to actually get to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I might as well plug our homies right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so two of our source farms are some of
his full full sun farms who won.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've won multiple top 10 awards for
their flowers and their products like
[SPEAKER_01]: their manufacturer products.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other one is a green shock farms which
is again one multiple top 10 emerald cup
[SPEAKER_01]: awards for their flowers and also terpene
last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah they end up so they do all their own
breeding in-house every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come with a fresh line of strains
that are completely unique and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: rocking terpene profiles and no one's ever
seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: What did you do to differentiate our
product from the other things you saw on
[SPEAKER_00]: the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had spoken to the fact that didn't
want to smell like a hippies van didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be overly greasy and tacky.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were some of the other factors that
you were kind of shooting for when you
[SPEAKER_00]: designed the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well it's funny that the product ended up
having such wide appeal and doing well
[SPEAKER_01]: because when I designed it I had two
people in mind very specifically my
[SPEAKER_01]: grandma and my dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they had very specific issues that I
was trying to address like my grandma is
[SPEAKER_01]: still caught up in that belief that that
fat is bad and she's like terrified of
[SPEAKER_01]: cholesterol and she takes statins which
are just horrible for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nothing I do can I can convince her to
stop those destructive behaviors but I
[SPEAKER_01]: knew that that emu oil which is one of the
ingredients in our topical I knew that it
[SPEAKER_01]: had the ability to mimic cholesterol and
so when it hits the skin and is absorbed
[SPEAKER_01]: it essentially takes the place of missing
cholesterol in handling inflammatory
[SPEAKER_01]: issues in the localized area where you're
applying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is why emu oil by itself is
anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was that was half the reason like
I knew that that she was fat phobic and I
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to get some good cholesterol fats
into her any way that I could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially working around her own
particular ways of accessing health which
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't really serving her and since you
can't get her to change behavior you gave
[SPEAKER_00]: her a product that worked around her
behavior and that was kind of your part of
[SPEAKER_00]: your design constraints.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the herbal ingredients that I
ended up infusing into that original batch
[SPEAKER_01]: of oil was just what I happened to have
growing in my herb garden because I we
[SPEAKER_01]: were doing permaculture cannabis
cultivation at the time at the time so I
[SPEAKER_01]: had calendula and chamomile and a bunch of
other stuff co-planted and I harvested
[SPEAKER_01]: those flowers you know pinching off little
chamomile flowers every day one at a time
[SPEAKER_01]: until I had a jar full of that a jar full
of calendula I took some lemons off the
[SPEAKER_01]: lemon tree and I peeled them and I put
those skins into the oil too which so I
[SPEAKER_01]: did all this on instinct initially and
then come to find out well calendula is
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly good for healing and restoring
skin and fighting infections and chamomile
[SPEAKER_01]: is one of the best medicinal plants next
to cannabis I would put that like cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: number one chamomile number two like
ginger third and that's what I finished
[SPEAKER_01]: with I the one ingredient I went out and
actually bought you know specifically to
[SPEAKER_01]: put into this that I didn't have on hand
was ginger co2 extract which is hundreds
[SPEAKER_01]: and hundreds of mono terpenes and
sesquiterpenes and phenols polyphenols
[SPEAKER_00]: sterols all of all the things that make
the synergistic effect in cannabis with
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpenes most of those are found in
ginger lower amounts differing varying
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts different combinations but that's
that's kind of one of the things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: really like experimenting with also is
finding out the other plants that work
[SPEAKER_00]: within the endocannabinoid system to help
modulate human human health and human
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism and we're researching every day
we're trying new things every day we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to make sure that we you know get
it on people and get actual people using
[SPEAKER_00]: it you you
