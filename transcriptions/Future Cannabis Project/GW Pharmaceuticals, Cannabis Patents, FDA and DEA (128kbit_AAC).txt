[SPEAKER_02]: So I had a question I kind of like to ask
these guys what they think about this What
[SPEAKER_02]: do you what do you guys think about the
significance of the DEA given?
[SPEAKER_02]: GW schedule five for CBD, but it's still
schedule one for everybody else in the
[SPEAKER_02]: world what that's weird to me and I just
wanted to get your thoughts on that It's
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing what money can do in this country
So, you know, I think Without getting too
[SPEAKER_00]: down to it if we want to have a viable
industry and continue to grow we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: support industry traded associations like
NCIA and CCIA because the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_00]: lobby is massive and I don't think they
would be heartbroken if they could figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out a way when federal rescheduling comes
to pull as much of this away from us as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible and they're only one of many
industries that is lobbying actively and
[SPEAKER_00]: could benefit from you know being able to
have this but the timing also,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know It the timing of everything was
interesting right the these guys the
[SPEAKER_00]: declassification came You know within
weeks of the farm bill and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's there's a lot of public comment
that's yet to be had But we'll see where
[SPEAKER_01]: the chips fall So GW's done a lot through
the industry and trying to Where they made
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the isolates and such but they
also started off with full spectrum and
[SPEAKER_01]: the enormous amount of information as far
as going back through the ratio of I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it was 144 different initial components
they were looking at for the ratio of
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of each one but the ratio to each
other even some of the minor terpenoids
[SPEAKER_01]: and the phytols and the alkaloids that are
in there I think the second part that
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes from that is is my biggest
struggle is not having the American
[SPEAKER_01]: universities in the United States being
able to do the research and so that's part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the problem where they had the 49
different applications for other
[SPEAKER_01]: universities being able to supply the the
different cannabinoids for for medical
[SPEAKER_01]: research so university so Mississippi
State had that but they but it's not their
[SPEAKER_01]: fault on the fact that they only had two
varieties they were able to use that was
[SPEAKER_01]: determined by the DEA and NIDA and so Dr.
Assoli was always I need more we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: be looking at more varieties and they
would he would always be rebuffed on You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, you can't have more so finally he
got 14 more I think three years ago and
[SPEAKER_01]: then they started adding more material for
him to use but it's also the other
[SPEAKER_01]: universities you got Cornell you got UC
Davis I don't want to leave someone out
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado State now that I'm on a roll but
all these other ones that are they're the
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Vermont I'm on a roll now
and so you go back through these these
[SPEAKER_01]: places that are that are agricultural
centers that we've used throughout our
[SPEAKER_01]: history of being able to have the
boundaries so whether it's good boundaries
[SPEAKER_01]: or boundaries we still need to know what
the boundaries are for each one of these
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid mixtures what else is in the
terpenes what else is in the alkaloids
[SPEAKER_01]: here's the question for you what's in the
roots because we're not using the roots
[SPEAKER_01]: right now if we grind up the roots there's
some minor trace alkaloids that have shown
[SPEAKER_01]: some capability as the antifungals that's
typically where everything starts we
[SPEAKER_01]: typically eat a lot of roots we eat
potatoes we eat carrots we eat a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things from the ground and that's why we
eat them so the other one is is what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens when you start to have different
varieties that that are able to be used
[SPEAKER_01]: with other species there's some
preliminary work that if you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids you have the the cannabis
plant and you plant it between different
[SPEAKER_01]: types of species they grow a monster and
you put us through some of the other ones
[SPEAKER_01]: in there and they they're stunted so
there's some communal work that has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: done that the ag schools the universities
and so I'm an American okay so at the same
[SPEAKER_01]: time I'm not prejudiced by the fact that
we have great universities but right now
[SPEAKER_01]: we're getting we're not getting the
research done that's being done in Spain
[SPEAKER_01]: that's being done in Colombia that's being
done in Uruguay that's being done in
[SPEAKER_01]: Israel Canada you got McGill now you got
Guelph you got beast you have all these
[SPEAKER_01]: places that the universities in the in the
United States could really benefit from
[SPEAKER_01]: and the in the next generation so Fritz
and I are we're okay but at the same time
[SPEAKER_01]: we have these young people that want to
getting their PhDs that are sitting there
[SPEAKER_01]: 30s that they're aching to get into it but
they can't there's no universities are
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna that are going to be able to
compromise their grants to be able to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this and so that's that's what it is it's
a it's a private research that's happening
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a little tangential but I think it's
also really important to note that a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of anecdotal evidence and experience for
cannabis is from the full spectrum of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that that plant has to offer
and you know with rescheduling it gets a
[SPEAKER_00]: little murky because the FDA doesn't have
the best track record for wanting to
[SPEAKER_00]: authorize multi compound multi chemical
compounds right they like it simple they
[SPEAKER_00]: want one chemical compound maybe two but
you know getting into different ratios
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene blends you know it's it's highly
unlikely that those products will ever see
[SPEAKER_00]: the light of day given the current
structuring of the FDA if it moves into a
[SPEAKER_00]: federal medical classification and that's
why it's you know it's it's a much more
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoyable from the consumer's perspective
to smoke all those things but also from a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical perspective you know there's a lot
going on that medical cannabis offers that
[SPEAKER_00]: the pharmaceutical industry just won't
just inherently and how it's structured
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah I want to also throw in I guess I'm a
little fixated on this but apart from the
[SPEAKER_02]: DEA giving GW a schedule five the FDA gave
them an NDI number a new dietary
[SPEAKER_02]: ingredient number for CBD so that really
I'm knowing a lot about the natural
[SPEAKER_02]: products industry that means that it's
kind of like a patent the GW doesn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: to enforce themselves the FDA will enforce
that for them so it's all does that mean
[SPEAKER_00]: that with with that it authorizes them to
use CBD as an ingredient in food I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know exactly where where you know where
the boundaries are but an NDI number is is
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what that means it's a new dietary
ingredient it's like it's like GW
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered a new herb so if you look at
the so I always I always study every
[SPEAKER_01]: morning so I did look at some of the newer
patents by GW and other companies and now
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing it as a single component but
also can be used in a botanical dietary
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritionary supplement so that's a new
little clause that they're adding at the
[SPEAKER_01]: end of some of the patent work that
they're doing so if you look at the FDA
[SPEAKER_01]: guidelines from December 2016 it's the
it's a natural it's a dietary supplements
[SPEAKER_01]: so natural products and dietary
supplements guidelines so if you see the
[SPEAKER_01]: guidelines that goes through anything that
you would have to do with any natural
[SPEAKER_01]: products it doesn't matter if it's cohosh
you know St. John's ward it doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_01]: vitamin E it doesn't matter what they are
you still have to be able to show that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're you're growing a crop that in three
crops gave the same relative amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: that variety that you were expecting then
so you have good agricultural practices
[SPEAKER_01]: you have good manufacturing practices you
have good laboratory practices so those
[SPEAKER_01]: are all in the guidelines and all you have
to really do is take that that one
[SPEAKER_01]: guideline and just add cannabis into it
and then all the guidelines are done you
