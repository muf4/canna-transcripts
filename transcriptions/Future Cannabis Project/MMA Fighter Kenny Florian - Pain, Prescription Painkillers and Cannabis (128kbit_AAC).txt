[SPEAKER_00]: Being around other people who got addicted
to opioids, that scared me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anytime there was something that was
going to be prescribed to me for an injury
[SPEAKER_00]: or for pain, I just was always afraid of
taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really never did anything at all,
even Advil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're doing something like mixed
martial arts, in a lot of ways,
[SPEAKER_00]: the training is more difficult than the
fight itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the UFC, you can kick, you can
knee, you can elbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can punch, and you're doing this with
four ounce gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the training for it is brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're training two, three times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're sore all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're hurting all the time, not to
mention you're taking some blows to the
[SPEAKER_00]: head, even before you even get into the
cage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very difficult on the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being around the various mixed martial
arts gyms, kickboxing gyms, boxing gyms,
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a lot of nightmare stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of kids and men who were addicted to
opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of promising careers were thrown
away because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that definitely had an impact on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a reoccurring theme through all
the different gyms that I was around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the fighters used them
recreationally as a party drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vicodin and Percocets were mixed with
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of craziness ensued because of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I just saw a lot of lives
shattered because of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even had a very negative perception of
marijuana as well coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, our perspectives guide us in
everything that we do and see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of had that negative view of
cannabis and really didn't try it until I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I was like 28 years old,
when I was kind of, I guess in the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning, earlier part of my UFC career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it definitely helped me in a variety
of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dealing with pain and I guess seeing
things in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't have those addictive
qualities.
