[SPEAKER_05]: When Peter suggested the idea of doing a
panel and letting me moderate I was like I
[SPEAKER_05]: like jumped at him like oh gosh for once I
can ask the questions and sort of sit back
[SPEAKER_05]: and relax so I'm really excited about it a
little bit nervous too but anyway just to
[SPEAKER_05]: let you know as Peter said the three
licensing authorities have just finished
[SPEAKER_05]: their 45-day comment period I know for the
Bureau we're looking at thousands of
[SPEAKER_05]: comments that have come through so that's
pretty incredible that we're getting that
[SPEAKER_05]: many comments and we're going through them
but I think tonight is the perfect now
[SPEAKER_05]: that we are done with that comment period
and looking through those regs it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: perfect idea perfect time to get the
industry's perspective on what we should
[SPEAKER_05]: be looking at what we should be changing
and just get their perspective so even
[SPEAKER_05]: tonight I'm gonna be doing a lot of
listening because I want to hear from them
[SPEAKER_05]: and how things are going for them but
before we get started I'm gonna let them
[SPEAKER_05]: each introduce themselves and then we'll
get started with the questions hi
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody I'm Samantha Miller I'm the
president and chief scientist of pure
[SPEAKER_06]: analytics laboratory so we're operating as
a licensed laboratory certifying products
[SPEAKER_06]: for the retail cannabis market and as
anybody in here who is a manufacturer
[SPEAKER_06]: distributor can imagine it's very
interesting to be a lab right now I'm
[SPEAKER_11]: Gavin Kogan I'm chief branding officer and
founder of Grupo floor in the Salinas
[SPEAKER_11]: Valley our operations span the entire
supply chain in different companies
[SPEAKER_11]: operating kind of in the horizontal
company as opposed to one big company hi
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Sabrina Fendrick I'm director of
government affairs for Berkeley patients
[SPEAKER_04]: group which is the oldest dispensary in
the country good evening my name is
[SPEAKER_08]: Michael Wheeler and I'm the vice president
of policy initiatives for Flo Khanna Flo
[SPEAKER_08]: Khanna is a branded distributor of
sun-grown craft cannabis from Northern
[SPEAKER_07]: California hello my name is Kristen of it
all I'm the chairperson for the
[SPEAKER_07]: International Cannabis Farmers Association
our group is we form to help empower the
[SPEAKER_07]: traditional cannabis farmer through
research education and advocacy and I also
[SPEAKER_07]: work with my husband and our business
partners we have the Humboldt's finest
[SPEAKER_05]: brand okay well thank you so I you know I
have the first ones maybe a softball but
[SPEAKER_05]: now that we're looking at eight months
into the legalized regulated market and I
[SPEAKER_05]: know from the Bureau's perspective for
each part of the supply chain we've had
[SPEAKER_05]: our own challenges in regulating so I
wanted to get your perspective on how it
[SPEAKER_05]: has been for you the last eight months and
being in this regulated market and
[SPEAKER_05]: especially how have you continued to deal
with the changes that come down because we
[SPEAKER_05]: always talk about the regulators you know
we keep changing things on you and so I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: curious how you've dealt with that you
know you have to stay nimble and you have
[SPEAKER_06]: to be on top of it I think the worst thing
you can do is refer to lawyers to
[SPEAKER_06]: interpret the regulations for you instead
of as a business operator being engaged in
[SPEAKER_06]: them in a line-by-line fashion and I think
that's where some people have been caught
[SPEAKER_06]: unawares at times where they're relying on
others to interpret for them rather than
[SPEAKER_06]: as I say as operators actually being fully
engaged in the text of the regulations but
[SPEAKER_06]: I think some of the biggest challenges
have been to on the lab side is the the
[SPEAKER_06]: marketing right of the regulations is is
to help guide people through things they
[SPEAKER_06]: feel are unreasonable or things they don't
feel like they should have to do and help
[SPEAKER_06]: explain and understand to them that this
path forward represents one where we're
[SPEAKER_06]: taking some extraordinary measures around
the protection of consumer safety because
[SPEAKER_06]: we lack a certain body of data so I think
one of the biggest challenges has been
[SPEAKER_06]: really been to communicate to the people
who are the users of lab testing in this
[SPEAKER_06]: current market maybe why some of the
things that are in place are there in
[SPEAKER_06]: terms of being able to react to the
changing regulations mostly you have to
[SPEAKER_06]: anticipate when you get an initial draft
of regulations you need to take them
[SPEAKER_06]: almost as if that's what's going to be
because if you wait until the end of a
[SPEAKER_06]: comment period implementation then you'll
find yourself probably too far behind so I
[SPEAKER_06]: think one of the struggles that people
have had is well I don't want to spend
[SPEAKER_06]: money I don't have to right in case this
thing changes let's say there's no heavy
[SPEAKER_06]: metals requirement for example right I
don't want to buy an ICPMS if I don't have
[SPEAKER_06]: to so I think making those decisions in
anticipation of what could be while trying
[SPEAKER_06]: to manage cash flow and and and capital is
has been challenging as a business owner
[SPEAKER_11]: yeah absolutely all those points that the
I think probably the top-level thing I
[SPEAKER_11]: would say is the ultimate goal was to
transition people from the black market to
[SPEAKER_11]: the regulated market and for as a whole
supply chain enterprise such as group of
[SPEAKER_11]: floor it's frustrating talking for example
to dispensary owners explaining to them
[SPEAKER_11]: that the packaging we have actually does
comply with the law and then getting into
[SPEAKER_11]: fights with them about why it does or does
not and that gets very tiresome so there's
[SPEAKER_11]: a lot of unknown I was actually mentioning
to you Lori before the event there's a lot
[SPEAKER_11]: of distrust politically there's also a lot
of distrust in our industry towards
[SPEAKER_11]: politicians and I think that the more we
can you know connect and demystify a lot
[SPEAKER_11]: of both ends of that be really useful for
us I think the to see a larger rollout I
[SPEAKER_11]: think this has been left you know
explosive rollout than we had anticipated
[SPEAKER_11]: so a lot of people spent a lot of money a
lot of energy to gear up for not a lot and
[SPEAKER_11]: so that's been very frustrating I hope to
see that evolve well interesting you
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioned the packaging relationship with
retailers but before I get to that I would
[SPEAKER_04]: say sort of on an overall 30,000 foot view
of this has been the educating and talking
[SPEAKER_04]: to both the vendors and the public because
we have both basically to deal with and
[SPEAKER_04]: the public has been very frustrated with
the rising prices and the taxes and a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of that sort of the education around that
component and then also talking to the
[SPEAKER_04]: vendors and and like some of us were
talking about before everybody sort of has
[SPEAKER_04]: their own interpretation on on what's
compliant and what's not and it kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: comes down to you know sort of making a
determination of within the business of
[SPEAKER_04]: where you know where you're going to draw
the line and what you believe is is going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be the right thing because ultimately I
think if if the intent is there and you're
[SPEAKER_04]: trying your best to be as compliant as you
can in your own capacity then you're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as you can but yeah so it's sort
of just been a balancing act and making
[SPEAKER_04]: sure I think the July 1st transition was
fascinating
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah you know I it was it was inevitable
and I think that it were really we're a
[SPEAKER_04]: really interesting place in California
being the largest cannabis market in the
[SPEAKER_04]: world and you know having just one chief
overseeing the the largest cannabis market
[SPEAKER_04]: and trying to fit all the supply chains in
together and and having everybody talk to
[SPEAKER_04]: each other and making sure that that it's
working and that we all are on the
[SPEAKER_04]: basically the same page so it is a heavy
lift but I'm really glad that it's
[SPEAKER_04]: happening and I think it if it's done
right if people stay diligent then it can
[SPEAKER_04]: be done it's not entirely impossible but
there's always going to be challenges and
[SPEAKER_04]: always going to be issues and then there's
also the working with the local
[SPEAKER_04]: jurisdiction I think has also been a
challenge and that seemed to bring out a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of players that had never
traditionally come out to challenge
[SPEAKER_04]: anything regarding cannabis BPG has been
around for almost 20 years and most of the
[SPEAKER_04]: community members seemed fine with it and
then all of a sudden January 1st there was
[SPEAKER_04]: this outpour of interest groups that were
completely opposed and it was shocking
[SPEAKER_04]: because I nothing really changed other
than who we let in the door and tweaking
[SPEAKER_04]: security measures so that was kind of a
challenge I agree with much as much that
[SPEAKER_08]: has been said already and you know to not
repeat any of that I would say that it
[SPEAKER_08]: really does feel like we are all you know
we've all got our map on how to try to
[SPEAKER_08]: succeed and we're each interpreting those
words slightly differently as we make our
[SPEAKER_08]: way through this dark forest because it's
not there's no path it's follow the map
[SPEAKER_08]: and that's been the challenge is my
impression or my understanding of what
[SPEAKER_08]: these words say is a little bit different
than maybe somebody else's and we've got
[SPEAKER_08]: to do business together and that creates
complexities and at the same time to make
[SPEAKER_08]: a separate different point I think that
we're all able to understand and measure
[SPEAKER_08]: the success of this growing regulated
market but we're not able to measure the
[SPEAKER_08]: health and wellness of the illicit market
that we're trying to deconstruct and that
[SPEAKER_08]: presents a challenge to me because I can
only understand whether we're making
[SPEAKER_08]: progress as a regulated market but not
whether or not we are gaining ground on
[SPEAKER_07]: the illicit market and so I think that's a
lot of really good lead-in to what
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivators are facing especially existing
cultivators right we have a cultivation
[SPEAKER_07]: system that breaks cultivators into sizes
and scales them right so you're 2500
[SPEAKER_07]: square feet or you're below 5,000 or
you're below 10 or 22 or if you're
[SPEAKER_07]: outdoors or you can have up to an acre and
so California has a 20 year old cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: industry that's trying to wrap regulations
around a very robust existing industry
[SPEAKER_07]: this has not been done before right in
most states statute is passed regulations
[SPEAKER_07]: happen and an industry is birthed right so
here in California we have a whole new
[SPEAKER_07]: paradigm where these regulators are trying
to figure out how to fit multi-billion
[SPEAKER_07]: dollar industry into a linear regulated
box so to say so for existing cultivators
[SPEAKER_07]: were were having a lot of struggles we
didn't we didn't build our cultivation
[SPEAKER_07]: based on you know 500 square foot
increments or 5,000 square foot increments
[SPEAKER_07]: we built them a lot of times where they
fit in the landscape and so what we're
[SPEAKER_07]: really struggling with are these
challenges around how to have 12,000
[SPEAKER_07]: square feet when the licenses are 10,000
or 22 right economically you don't fit
[SPEAKER_07]: into 22,000 square foot license and you
don't really fit into 10,000 because you
[SPEAKER_07]: have 12,000 so a lot of our members and
the existing cultivators especially the
[SPEAKER_07]: seasonal cultivators I find are really
struggling with how to fit their existing
[SPEAKER_07]: operations into a regulated model that
doesn't have flexibility right it's really
[SPEAKER_07]: linear and the issues around shared
facilities if I have to have two licenses
[SPEAKER_07]: because I'm 12,000 square feet I now can't
share a processing or a propagation area
[SPEAKER_07]: so we have lots of providers that have
been working diligently to provide
[SPEAKER_07]: medicine for patients over the last 20
years that like don't necessarily have the
[SPEAKER_07]: funding to build new facilities nor do
they have the space or necessarily the
[SPEAKER_07]: land use opportunities because of being
located rurally and they're on egg lands
[SPEAKER_07]: and not on commercial lands or industrial
land so you know work we're kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: constantly trying to figure out how to fit
into a system after years and years of
[SPEAKER_07]: engaging and being involved in proposition
215 and SB 420 and feeling kind of really
[SPEAKER_07]: pulled in a multitude of ways so it's a
little bit of a kind of quicksand scenario
[SPEAKER_07]: for a lot of our stakeholders and members
so Sabrina brought up an excellent point
[SPEAKER_05]: the July 1st transition so the bureau took
a lot of heat when we did not extend the
[SPEAKER_05]: transition period there was a tremendous
amount of pressure on us to extend it we
[SPEAKER_05]: did not we did not change our regulations
and we did not extend it I'm one question
[SPEAKER_05]: two questions for the panel how did you
feel about that decision and how did it
[SPEAKER_06]: affect your business operations you know
my personal feelings about the decision
[SPEAKER_06]: were that I had been approached by some
retail operators and other operators in
[SPEAKER_06]: the industry to to put my name with those
who were asking for an extension and for
[SPEAKER_06]: ourselves as a laboratory an extension
wasn't really going to be material one way
[SPEAKER_06]: or another in terms of readiness or
execution because we were already doing
[SPEAKER_06]: what we needed to do for July 1st but what
I was seeing was that having to do with
[SPEAKER_06]: the inventory that was being held and
valuation of inventory that was either
[SPEAKER_06]: owned by yourself or by another party that
you were in contract with that the
[SPEAKER_06]: particulars around the ownerships of those
inventories and the date of its production
[SPEAKER_06]: in some cases because the deadlines either
weren't understood or anticipated with
[SPEAKER_06]: respect to when things were manufactured
or harvested and when they could continue
[SPEAKER_06]: to be sold that I became aware of certain
people who I personally cared about a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: that we're going to take enormous losses
that could potentially put them out of
[SPEAKER_06]: business as small business owners and so
as a small business owner entrepreneur I
[SPEAKER_06]: have a lot of compassion for those people
and I was I was dismayed that they were
[SPEAKER_06]: having such a negative impact because I've
known them since my company was founded
[SPEAKER_06]: eight and a half years ago and to be in
business for eight and a half years or ten
[SPEAKER_06]: years and suffer that kind of blow and one
that you really can't affect and maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: it's their own responsibility and their
own fault because they weren't prepared or
[SPEAKER_06]: they weren't engaged and that may have
been why it happened but it was
[SPEAKER_06]: unfortunate just as a from a humanistic
perspective it was unfortunate to watch
[SPEAKER_11]: that happen for people I personally I
would have liked to see an extension for
[SPEAKER_11]: all the reasons that you said the I do
wonder though if we had extended I'm sure
[SPEAKER_11]: this is part of what informed the decision
not to us would have been any different
[SPEAKER_11]: another six months hence right so
personally I would have liked to see an
[SPEAKER_11]: extension because I think that needs to be
a smoother transition from the unregulated
[SPEAKER_11]: to the regulated market from a business
perspective though anticipated that it
[SPEAKER_11]: would be held hard and so to that July
date so we amped up for it and there was a
[SPEAKER_11]: lot of market share to be got during that
period as a result and then lastly just
[SPEAKER_11]: you know kind of embarrassed by the
Instagram and social media posts of just
[SPEAKER_11]: all these empty shelves throughout our
state one of the biggest you know concerns
[SPEAKER_11]: I have is the lack of dispensaries in our
in our market being a whole supply chain
[SPEAKER_11]: company so I hope to see those shelves
filled again and that's robust market so
[SPEAKER_11]: it's a little scary how much of a set it
was yeah I agree I think it would have
[SPEAKER_04]: been delaying the inevitable if you had
just moved it and there the reactions
[SPEAKER_04]: would have been the same I made sure that
you know that the buyers at BPG were in
[SPEAKER_04]: communication with their vendors to make
sure that they were as prepared as they
[SPEAKER_04]: can be and and you know how that
communication gets through and whether
[SPEAKER_04]: it's received on that end I I don't know
but I I think that it definitely helped to
[SPEAKER_04]: provide a sort of a process for them
because a lot of them didn't really know
[SPEAKER_04]: what to do or what was even going on or
that there was even a July 1st deadline
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know just to ensure that we did
have enough products and and you know
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't lose out on any of that and all of
the testing and Berkeley's testing
[SPEAKER_04]: standards have always been extremely high
and the highest in the state so most of
[SPEAKER_04]: the vendors that we worked with were
pretty used to you know meeting those
[SPEAKER_04]: rules anyway so the testing wasn't as much
of an issue as the packaging and labeling
[SPEAKER_04]: which also kicked off a lot of discussions
and arguments but I think that yeah I mean
[SPEAKER_04]: it better to happen now and to have
everybody adjust right now if this is all
[SPEAKER_04]: it's inevitable and you know we've been
fighting for this for a really long time
[SPEAKER_04]: and here we are so this is what it looks
like and I just look at it as growing
[SPEAKER_04]: pains and you know it's it's really hard
to see you know like you said some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: these smaller business owners that just
don't have the resources or the bandwidth
[SPEAKER_04]: to really keep up with all of these things
and and find themselves in a situation
[SPEAKER_04]: where they're not completely able to
comply to the extent that they can get
[SPEAKER_04]: their stuff online right away I think a
lot of this is a very flexible creative
[SPEAKER_04]: industry that has managed to survive
through many challenges in the past and I
[SPEAKER_04]: think that that spirit will continue on
and people can be innovative and and find
[SPEAKER_08]: a way so I think it was good yeah I would
say that despite preparation beginning in
[SPEAKER_08]: June for the July 1st changes the end of
that grace period you know Flo Khanna
[SPEAKER_08]: suffered significantly in early July as we
didn't agree with our retail clients on
[SPEAKER_08]: what were the packaging requirements and
that was that was really challenging to
[SPEAKER_08]: not see eye-to-eye have us all trying to
comply but disagree about what the rules
[SPEAKER_08]: said that was very challenging and at the
same time despite the pain that we felt
[SPEAKER_08]: and what I assume many many companies felt
I would say that I still salute the BCC
[SPEAKER_08]: for not flexing on that because this is
the beginning of the relationship of
[SPEAKER_08]: there's an open period where we all get to
talk about what the rules should be and
[SPEAKER_08]: then we will enforce the rules and so I
salute you for enforcing the rules when it
[SPEAKER_08]: was time to enforce the rules and we
learned that this is this is a sort of a
[SPEAKER_08]: weak link situation weakest link situation
in the industry where those who and we're
[SPEAKER_08]: gonna confront it again in the near future
probably when these regs go final we will
[SPEAKER_08]: have those who didn't prepare enough and
businesses will choose oh you're not
[SPEAKER_08]: prepared I'm not gonna do business with
you right now and that may be a
[SPEAKER_08]: make-or-break moment for those who didn't
prepare and yet that is the way this
[SPEAKER_08]: industry and any industry works you know
it's competition and we can seek to
[SPEAKER_08]: out-compete each other on compliance to
the state's benefit and I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: farmers were kind of caught off guard I
mean granted the transition period was
[SPEAKER_07]: published but we're transitioning away
from kind of a bulk flower market so
[SPEAKER_07]: traditionally cultivators have provided
bulk flower into the retail sector and
[SPEAKER_07]: that's how it's gone into vending
departments so a lot of cultivators
[SPEAKER_07]: weren't prepared for packaging they didn't
have a brand they didn't have containers
[SPEAKER_07]: they're used to bringing whole pound units
and then having the dispensary package and
[SPEAKER_07]: so when you're in a position to try to or
have to start figuring out packaging first
[SPEAKER_07]: of all the time frame on that is you know
six to six months to a year to just try to
[SPEAKER_07]: figure out how to source and how to put
together compliant packaging so as
[SPEAKER_07]: Humboldt's finest we started our rebrand
for compliant packaging in January and
[SPEAKER_07]: what we what came what we came up against
was that as early as April the
[SPEAKER_07]: distributors we were working with were
like oh no no we're not taking any more
[SPEAKER_07]: product unless it's prepped for July and
we're like oh my gosh this is kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: crushing because here we have packaged
product that you know should have been
[SPEAKER_07]: able to be on the shelves until July and
then our distributors were kicking it back
[SPEAKER_07]: because they didn't want to have anything
in their stock right come July 1st that
[SPEAKER_07]: wasn't compliant so we'd already been
doing the testing and for us it was
[SPEAKER_07]: dealing with the child resistant packaging
component especially when we looked at
[SPEAKER_07]: pre-rolls we do a lot of pre-roll
cigarette or cannabis cigarettes so trying
[SPEAKER_07]: to figure out how to especially in single
serving sizes manage that CRP component
[SPEAKER_07]: was really challenging and it was
expensive but we're there and I think if
[SPEAKER_07]: people didn't plan you know six nine
months in advance they really got caught
[SPEAKER_07]: off guard with it and so it's it's a you
had basically have a point person that you
[SPEAKER_07]: could put on that and the resources to do
it to be prepared is what we found you
[SPEAKER_06]: know one point to add on I think that was
actually really important about the July
[SPEAKER_06]: transition that's very focused on the lab
sector was the increase in testing
[SPEAKER_06]: requirements and the increase in the
compound lists because the phase one
[SPEAKER_06]: pesticide list really didn't encompass
what's normally used on cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_06]: things that were usually the most
concerned about finding and so I think
[SPEAKER_06]: that delaying the implementation of the
phase two pesticide list especially would
[SPEAKER_05]: have definitely been an error yeah that's
really it's really helpful to from your
[SPEAKER_05]: perspective one of the things as
regulators we're constantly looking at is
[SPEAKER_05]: how we can how we can make the supply
chain more efficient because it is a
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis product is a very difficult
commodity to get to market in an efficient
[SPEAKER_05]: time frame so we're always looking and
we're also balancing between retail and
[SPEAKER_05]: supplier and manufacturer because we feel
like you can't what's good for one isn't
[SPEAKER_05]: always good for all so I would love to
hear from your perspective on the things
[SPEAKER_05]: that we can control and regulations can
you point to one single change that would
[SPEAKER_05]: make the supply more efficient from your
point of view I know that's a tough one
[SPEAKER_08]: huh I can go out of order yes so I would
say we're we're on the path to this right
[SPEAKER_08]: now but it's it has everything to do with
allowing koa testing as high up in the
[SPEAKER_08]: supply chain as possible and then letting
that bulk material that's been tested and
[SPEAKER_08]: have that koa test move through to other
distributors to co-packers to others who
[SPEAKER_08]: will handle it and put it into packages or
pre-rolls or you know go through that
[SPEAKER_08]: supply chain and and that itself would
make things much more efficient and that
[SPEAKER_08]: is much better than the alternative of the
illicit market where nothing is tested so
[SPEAKER_08]: I totally appreciate that we want to make
sure that nothing there's no jars of flour
[SPEAKER_08]: or pre-rolls or manufactured products that
are tainted with chemicals and filth and
[SPEAKER_08]: that kind of thing but no matter what if
it passes a koa test at the at the bulk
[SPEAKER_08]: level it is definitely better than what is
being sourced on the illicit market and so
[SPEAKER_08]: I would love to see that koa test for bulk
product be able to travel with with that
[SPEAKER_08]: with those I'm going to use a metric term
with the package tag that is assigned to
[SPEAKER_08]: it and be and be good to go but you know
what I think would actually do something
[SPEAKER_06]: amazing in the supply chain right now is
something that gets used in supply chains
[SPEAKER_06]: in manufacturing and many many other
industries whether regulated or not and
[SPEAKER_06]: it's often referred to a skip lot testing
and it's the concept of when a producer or
[SPEAKER_06]: an actor in the industry who's responsible
for the quality of a product has
[SPEAKER_06]: demonstrated that over a period of time
that specified by a regulatory body that
[SPEAKER_06]: they're doing things correctly there's
been an on-site inspection there's been an
[SPEAKER_06]: audit of their SOPs and from a regulatory
testing perspective they're passing and
[SPEAKER_06]: not having issues that are systemic and
that are related to their their processes
[SPEAKER_06]: and so in many situations like that in
other industries those good actors will be
[SPEAKER_06]: allowed to not test every lot if that was
a place based on data that we could get to
[SPEAKER_06]: from a comfort level to say that we can
verify a producer to the extent that we
[SPEAKER_06]: can feel comfortable taking that approach
to testing and and approval of products
[SPEAKER_06]: would be amazing but I think we're
probably a bit far out from that in terms
[SPEAKER_06]: of having the data to be able to base
those decisions on I would kind of going
[SPEAKER_11]: back to the dispensary's piece I can't get
into a specific regulation but just
[SPEAKER_11]: generally I would like to see some efforts
to encourage a lot more transition from
[SPEAKER_11]: the black market or what I'll even say is
the prop 215 crowd that are sort of
[SPEAKER_11]: waiting in the wings I'd really like I
think that our success is going to depend
[SPEAKER_11]: on how many outlets and dispensaries there
are and so I would encourage as
[SPEAKER_11]: unfavorable as this might be to some
people a much lower bar of entry for
[SPEAKER_11]: dispensaries understanding that there's
going to be problems there but we need to
[SPEAKER_11]: have access for the public to start
trusting and wanting to participate it's
[SPEAKER_11]: as a term I use with Andrew before we need
more carrots and less cannons to encourage
[SPEAKER_11]: transition I know I'll say further this is
an industry that we're not concerned about
[SPEAKER_11]: getting arrested so cannons aren't that
effective they haven't been for
[SPEAKER_11]: generations so why we think that would be
effective now I think that really some
[SPEAKER_11]: creativity and how we could encourage
people to participate in the regulated
[SPEAKER_11]: market at that retail end is going to do
an awful lot to stimulate growth in the
[SPEAKER_04]: supply chain throughout yeah I would I
would agree with that I think on the the
[SPEAKER_04]: retail end is really about we're the
public facing side of the supply chain so
[SPEAKER_04]: anything that goes wrong anywhere it's
always the retailers faults and for the
[SPEAKER_04]: lab but nobody knows who the lab is we're
the public ones we're the storefront so
[SPEAKER_04]: we're some of us are and so I think that
public health component and child safety
[SPEAKER_04]: component is really important to the
retailers and making sure there's the
[SPEAKER_04]: story I have told a couple times about I'm
sure some people know what happened with
[SPEAKER_04]: marine doubt in Colorado and she ate too
much of an edible and then wrote an op-ed
[SPEAKER_04]: in the New York Times about it and it
almost completely destroyed the
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturing canvas manufacturing
industry in Colorado and they're still
[SPEAKER_04]: recovering today this happened in 2014 and
so things like that happen and so we need
[SPEAKER_04]: to make sure that we're we're doing the
best of both like protect you know
[SPEAKER_04]: touching on the the child resistant
packaging needing to be closest to the
[SPEAKER_04]: actual product for certain products I
think is something that's app very
[SPEAKER_04]: important which you've heard me say a
couple times now different hearings and
[SPEAKER_04]: also I think some sort of a just consumer
education outreach to to take down take
[SPEAKER_04]: down the illicit market encourage more
people to come into the legal regulated
[SPEAKER_04]: market and have some sort of easily
accessible map I have a just a quick story
[SPEAKER_04]: my mother decided she wanted to go buy
some cannabis she lives in San Diego
[SPEAKER_04]: County in North County and didn't tell me
but whatever and looked it up did a Google
[SPEAKER_04]: search and found a a website that lists
lots of dispensaries some license some not
[SPEAKER_04]: licensed and she she told me that she went
to a licensed dispensary in Vista
[SPEAKER_04]: California and I was like mom no I don't
this does not licensing I don't think you
[SPEAKER_04]: did and she's went to someplace called the
sugar shack where they sold her a 300
[SPEAKER_04]: milligram chocolate bar that was I mean
the whole thing luckily she knows enough
[SPEAKER_04]: to not eat the whole thing and break it up
and she said it actually didn't do
[SPEAKER_04]: anything which goes to the testing but
that whole story I was just like if my
[SPEAKER_04]: mother who actually you know has a
daughter in the industry and it kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: knows a little bit about this and she's a
71 year old grandmother now there must be
[SPEAKER_04]: lots of people out there that are doing
this and and I couldn't even I was trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to I sent her the spreadsheet that was on
the BCC site because there there isn't
[SPEAKER_04]: really a place that I could point to
that's directly like here this is a map of
[SPEAKER_04]: all of the licensed dispensaries that you
can go to and you know it's tested and you
[SPEAKER_04]: know this and and all of that and it's
safe so I think yeah just some sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer information so that the the
people that do want to go to the legal
[SPEAKER_04]: market know where to go and and can trust
it and then I think I'm just all of these
[SPEAKER_07]: are really great points but coming back to
Michael's point about how the batches are
[SPEAKER_07]: configured with testing from a cultivator
perspective you know we might harvest one
[SPEAKER_07]: batch from one farm of say OG Kush and
then that OG Kush turns into one gram
[SPEAKER_07]: pre-rolls and then a pack of seven
pre-rolls and then eights and then
[SPEAKER_07]: quarters and so those all new have they
all have new skews to them when they go in
[SPEAKER_07]: new track and trace batch numbers when
they go to the distributor but it's
[SPEAKER_07]: literally one batch of cannabis flowers so
for us to now have to test the single
[SPEAKER_07]: pre-rolls as one batch the five to a pack
as one batch the eights as one batch is a
[SPEAKER_07]: cost that we can't necessarily afford to
sustain as cultivators putting
[SPEAKER_07]: non-manufactured products into the
marketplace so if that could be looked at
[SPEAKER_07]: as one batch because it came from one farm
was harvested at the same time was one
[SPEAKER_07]: crop that would actually create such a
tremendous amount of ease in moving these
[SPEAKER_07]: products safely from the farm through the
testing and distribution model and to the
[SPEAKER_07]: retail so that's one of the places where
we're really struggling with timing
[SPEAKER_07]: hang-ups and costs of trying to get a
broad spectrum say of non-manufactured
[SPEAKER_07]: products into the marketplace that's a
sticky spot for cultivators right I
[SPEAKER_06]: actually think that that highlights one of
the biggest issues that we've all talked
[SPEAKER_06]: about along the way which is the different
interpretations of the regulation text by
[SPEAKER_06]: different parties and so Kristen I had an
aha moment a few months back where one of
[SPEAKER_06]: the members of the BCC team helped us
understand that as a lab that we can
[SPEAKER_06]: actually sample as one batch pre unpacked
flower eights and quarters all together as
[SPEAKER_06]: one batch and apply the COA to all those
different skews and so in in certain
[SPEAKER_06]: readings of the regulations it was
interpreted by some people as if every
[SPEAKER_06]: skew had to have a specific COA but in the
case of flower which is kind of a special
[SPEAKER_06]: case with the exception of pre-rolls which
is handled differently in the new draft at
[SPEAKER_06]: least as it as it stands at the moment we
actually have the ability now to to
[SPEAKER_06]: tighten that up a little bit and to to
apply one COA to unpacked flower eights
[SPEAKER_06]: and quarters say that we're from the same
harvest batch can we get a memo over to
[SPEAKER_05]: our testing facility that would be great
100% I got the nod well I think what's
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting and concerning to me at the
same time is on each question I'm finding
[SPEAKER_05]: that throughout the supply chain you are
interpreting the regs differently and so
[SPEAKER_05]: if you're going to reflect back what are
what could we do to make sure and I know
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to tell me I know we got to
get information out but with all of our
[SPEAKER_05]: other responsibilities do you have any
good ideas for us where we could do a
[SPEAKER_05]: better job of explaining the regs I mean
maybe it starts with the regs the cells
[SPEAKER_05]: but you know I think there's better ways
to get the information out and and one
[SPEAKER_05]: thing that I worry about as we come to the
final leg of our rulemaking how do we make
[SPEAKER_05]: sure we're continuing to communicate and
collaborate we've done it a lot getting
[SPEAKER_05]: these regs out but how do we going forward
make sure we keep that momentum so I'd
[SPEAKER_07]: love your thoughts on that you know I
think there's that agency to agency
[SPEAKER_07]: component right so a lot of the operators
are are kind of wrangling multiple sets of
[SPEAKER_07]: regulations that they have to comply with
cultivators have California Department of
[SPEAKER_07]: Food and Agriculture open-air cultivators
have the water board the water resource
[SPEAKER_07]: control board they have Department of Fish
and Wildlife and then depending on how
[SPEAKER_07]: they choose to transport their product if
they have say a self-distribution
[SPEAKER_07]: transportation license now they have BCC
right and and so how how like as a
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivator we digest that body of material
is really challenging and then I find that
[SPEAKER_07]: there's not always the same I don't know
if definition is the right word but maybe
[SPEAKER_07]: interpretation of specific definitions
from statute so like we're really
[SPEAKER_07]: suffering with the contiguous premise
component especially as existing
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivators that already built out right
how do we fit into that box but BCC seems
[SPEAKER_07]: to have a little different way of dealing
with contiguous premise than say CDFA or
[SPEAKER_07]: CDPH so those pieces make it really kind
of a quicksand feeling because you're not
[SPEAKER_07]: sure who to look to for answers in some of
those cases so I think kind of more
[SPEAKER_07]: inter-agency communication and sort of
joint educational opportunities would be
[SPEAKER_06]: really fabulous you know what I was
yearning for in this in this last round of
[SPEAKER_06]: these of the draft regulations and also
actually with July 1 in lab there's not a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of us who are currently operating I
think there's maybe 30 or maybe more
[SPEAKER_06]: licensees now as they keep adding on but
in terms of operators it's I think it's
[SPEAKER_06]: less than 15 probably right now and what
we're doing is fairly complicated there's
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of details and if we get it wrong we
can have a serious economic impact on a
[SPEAKER_06]: party completely unintentionally by making
by misinterpreting something and
[SPEAKER_06]: misapplying it on a COA that then can't be
amended and so when those transitions
[SPEAKER_06]: happen I said you know what it would have
been really great from a collaboration
[SPEAKER_06]: perspective if we just could have gotten
the lab operators on the phone with the
[SPEAKER_06]: regulators to really walk through what
what the ask from us was in terms of
[SPEAKER_06]: changes to help us understand the label
claim thing has been a little over the top
[SPEAKER_06]: it to understand what it means what has to
be what doesn't have to be where's the
[SPEAKER_06]: where's the area of permissions where's
the area of no permissions and so I think
[SPEAKER_06]: like it's literally a simple conference
call with the lab operators because we're
[SPEAKER_06]: a small number would have been amazing and
it would have cleared up a lot of kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: disparate things between us which affected
the manufacturers and it affected
[SPEAKER_06]: distributors because our interpretations
affect everybody in a big way now I don't
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's totally doable for
everybody because there's a lot more
[SPEAKER_06]: manufacturers and a lot more distributors
than there are labs so that may not be
[SPEAKER_06]: applicable for each group but that
approach which may mean maybe there needs
[SPEAKER_06]: to be more funding for outreach personnel
that are specifically just about outreach
[SPEAKER_06]: and about giving voice to that
interpretation because there's there's a
[SPEAKER_06]: difference in having a discussion like
with Elena who's been who's an amazing
[SPEAKER_06]: resource on your team to help understand
the regulations but I think there's people
[SPEAKER_06]: who don't feel like they have that
personal connection to the BCC team or a
[SPEAKER_06]: go-to person and somehow we need to create
that sense of everybody knows who to go to
[SPEAKER_06]: and that person has the bandwidth to
answer them because they're they're a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of us yeah yeah you know California is the
only state that has multiple agencies
[SPEAKER_04]: regulating one supply chain and cannabis
so that's very unique and you know
[SPEAKER_04]: obviously causes lots of problems with
them interpretation and who is authority
[SPEAKER_04]: over what and I would say you know
something the CDT FA does that they
[SPEAKER_04]: started a couple of months ago and they've
only had a couple but they've invited a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple of operators from distributors and
retailers to discuss the just the excise
[SPEAKER_04]: tax and and how the the tax structure is
paid and what's going on and and we ask
[SPEAKER_04]: them questions and they ask us questions
and we kind of just have the sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: informal back-and-forth conversation so
that's been pretty helpful because that's
[SPEAKER_04]: been unbelievably confusing on its own and
so that might be an idea I know there's
[SPEAKER_04]: the advisory committee which is very
formal and sort of there by law but some
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of more informal stakeholder licensee
conversation and right now since there
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't and a ton of licensees it probably
would be easier to do at this point than
[SPEAKER_04]: you know six months or a year later when
it there's more coming out as more places
[SPEAKER_04]: and people get online and I think the
other thing is you know going back to this
[SPEAKER_04]: packaging and labeling which has just been
a you know interesting transition and our
[SPEAKER_04]: different interpretations of you know what
is required I think having a general
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding of because we were in the
position I you know the retailer BPG was
[SPEAKER_04]: saying that we are we're licensed and
inspected by the bureau so we're gonna go
[SPEAKER_04]: with what the bureau says and what statute
says and then there's CDPH that has what
[SPEAKER_04]: they have and then that's what them I
think this also comes down to why there
[SPEAKER_04]: may have been some difference in
interpretation we're friends now though
[SPEAKER_04]: and yeah so I you know one of the sort of
more specific nuance things would come
[SPEAKER_04]: down to sort of the you know statute says
everything has to be in a resealable
[SPEAKER_04]: child-resistant tamper evident it's in one
sentence and it says cannabis and cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: products and so that means everything from
seeds to clones and and the seeds and
[SPEAKER_04]: clones I would say was a very interesting
question because that's what statute says
[SPEAKER_04]: CDPH doesn't address it CDFA doesn't
address it and so you know we are erring
[SPEAKER_04]: on the side of caution because we're like
well I the bureau is the one inspecting us
[SPEAKER_04]: not DPH so we're just gonna go as as far
conservative as we possibly can and then
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's what I mean the staff kind of
they're frustrated with me too because
[SPEAKER_04]: that's sort of how I go I'm like we're
gonna ease up as we realize that we can
[SPEAKER_04]: but we're just gonna start with the
strictest interpretation but yeah so sort
[SPEAKER_04]: of the the crossover areas and and
addressing those and and who has you know
[SPEAKER_04]: what are you guys looking for when you're
coming in to inspect the dispensary when
[SPEAKER_11]: it comes to packaging and labeling stuff
like that I would as a lawyer kind of
[SPEAKER_11]: shift towards you know when statutes are
interpreted greatly for the business
[SPEAKER_11]: community by case law and case law informs
and different fact in our scenario is how
[SPEAKER_11]: one would behave the IRS uses decisional
memos I think that it might not be a bad
[SPEAKER_11]: idea to do something like decisional memos
that have an expiry date on them so that
[SPEAKER_11]: the statue says they change those
decisions kind of become but it really
[SPEAKER_11]: helped us out a lot while we're really the
front line I mean if we fail state fails
[SPEAKER_11]: right so it helps us out in divining how
we should go and and I would absolutely
[SPEAKER_11]: agree one body making those decisions and
itself working with CDPH or working with
[SPEAKER_11]: the other departments to come up with a
decisional memo that is consonant across
[SPEAKER_11]: the board so that we can make a decision
for example if I have a cultivation
[SPEAKER_11]: license can I can I package for somebody
kind of package somebody else's flower
[SPEAKER_11]: just off of my farm like it's really not
clear right so and it doesn't have to be
[SPEAKER_11]: clear and we don't have to wait for
regulators to make that decision but I
[SPEAKER_11]: think in the interim if the bureau could
just make a decision for right now for the
[SPEAKER_11]: rest of this year our interpretation is
that would be acceptable that allows us to
[SPEAKER_11]: mount this effort without the constant
fear that we're going to get you know
[SPEAKER_11]: Thor's hammer on our back and so there's a
lot of that fear of how to move and if we
[SPEAKER_11]: can have some clearance on that it's kind
of like an FAQ but it's a little bit more
[SPEAKER_08]: formal right so so just an idea to throw
out there I think it's been great the way
[SPEAKER_08]: that the agencies are willing to travel
around the state to listen to all of us
[SPEAKER_08]: during public comment and I think it would
be you know there's a there's a huge
[SPEAKER_08]: cross-section of companies some which have
staffed up to have policy professionals
[SPEAKER_08]: focusing on the regs on a daily basis and
then there's companies that don't have
[SPEAKER_08]: that resource and they utilize their
industry associations or word of mouth or
[SPEAKER_08]: you know call the bureau up but it would I
think it'd be great if there could be
[SPEAKER_08]: ongoing opportunities for the agencies to
in different parts of the state have
[SPEAKER_08]: workshops that are designed to focus on
their regs and clarify and educate and I
[SPEAKER_08]: think that probably you would get a lot of
participation there's a lot of hungry
[SPEAKER_08]: minds I know it's it might open a new can
of worms if one answer at one venue is
[SPEAKER_08]: different than another answer at another
venue so obviously not a perfect solution
[SPEAKER_08]: but I think there's a lot of people that'd
be interested to come in here and learn
[SPEAKER_08]: this is what we mean when we say this so I
completely agree with you it can be
[SPEAKER_05]: frustrating for us just staffed our
communication guys on when people don't
[SPEAKER_05]: when I call and say what agency do we go
to or for us it does get frustrating
[SPEAKER_05]: because it does even even internally it's
difficult to work with two other agencies
[SPEAKER_05]: and come to decisions and and being
consistent also it's you know like you
[SPEAKER_05]: noted we do want to do more outreach but
we're also dealing with new staff coming
[SPEAKER_05]: on every day and it's hard to keep them
apprised of okay these are the these are
[SPEAKER_05]: the regulations that are in place right
now and and so we struggle with making
[SPEAKER_05]: sure that we're giving consistent answers
and you're not getting different answers
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think you'll see once we get our
final regulations it's gonna make a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: easier we don't have the emergency
regulations the proposed and all that so
[SPEAKER_05]: this is all really very helpful you know I
I could I could keep interrogating these
[SPEAKER_05]: guys more but I think you guys want to
answer some question ask some questions of
[SPEAKER_05]: them but I do want to point out that we
did get approval our budget got approved
[SPEAKER_05]: to have a public awareness campaign we are
going out to bid so we are going to get
[SPEAKER_05]: out there and start having a campaign to
inform consumers of whose license the
[SPEAKER_05]: importance of going to a licensed retailer
and also trying to bring more people from
[SPEAKER_05]: the unlicensed market into the regulated
market so that'll be something exciting
[SPEAKER_05]: you're gonna see from our communications
team so we're looking forward to that but
[SPEAKER_05]: this has been extremely helpful to me and
I really appreciate you guys being so
[SPEAKER_05]: candid with your answers so I'm gonna
leave it to Peter to all right so we have
[SPEAKER_02]: a question from the back row yeah Doug
Ryerson small business owner this might be
[SPEAKER_02]: a three-part question and anybody can
answer it up there but Laurie you might
[SPEAKER_02]: have the best answer we'll see so PPM
levels acceptable at this time on
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrations the labs at this point they
figure they're safe but are they really up
[SPEAKER_02]: to FDA standards to federal standards and
pharmacological balance and safety that's
[SPEAKER_02]: the first one second one is labeling and
packaging why isn't Walgreens and CVS and
[SPEAKER_02]: Safeway going to take this over once the
feds get a hold of it and it's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: in the right packaging it's going to be
you know they're going to tell you how to
[SPEAKER_02]: take it you have any questions when you
come up to the store so constellation and
[SPEAKER_02]: canter grow in Canada just known like 30%
of the market in Canada they're on the
[SPEAKER_02]: stock market now so a lot of these small
businesses are gonna be struggling I'll
[SPEAKER_07]: take a crack at the FDA component so the
FDA has two pathways to approval right
[SPEAKER_07]: there is the new drug application and then
there's a botanical drug application
[SPEAKER_07]: pathways they're both hugely expensive and
the variances that those products can hold
[SPEAKER_07]: through those approvals are are very low
right so when dealing with a botanical
[SPEAKER_07]: material which cannabis is the variance
from crop to crop which makes the variance
[SPEAKER_07]: from product to product tends to be
generally well outside of the range of
[SPEAKER_07]: what the FDA is going to approve so as the
FDA has drugs or botanical products that
[SPEAKER_07]: come through their pathway those products
will be FDA approved but what we have
[SPEAKER_07]: right now is a botanical cannabis program
which is similar more similar to say our
[SPEAKER_07]: traditional botanical program for
nutraceuticals and single herbal products
[SPEAKER_07]: on the marketplace and so I would expect
in the long run to see kind of a similar
[SPEAKER_07]: unfolding right as as the FDA changes and
federal regulations change and we move
[SPEAKER_07]: into prescribed cannabis marketplace right
CBD will probably still also have a
[SPEAKER_07]: botanical whole plant product available
even after FDA products are approved I
[SPEAKER_07]: mean this is there are very few botanical
products that have come through the
[SPEAKER_07]: pathway there's I think three today one of
them is a green tea product and I think
[SPEAKER_07]: there's there's two more that have come
through that botanical product pathway
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a very rigorous and expensive pathway
a lot of botanical products choose not to
[SPEAKER_07]: utilize that pathway so I think what will
still remain to see is cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_07]: botanical product and then cannabis
probably move into also an FDA regulated
[SPEAKER_06]: product so when it comes to safety of the
products and we talk about things like
[SPEAKER_06]: contaminants like residual solvent and
pesticides when you see the action limits
[SPEAKER_06]: that are in the regulations that that
we're currently adhering to they're based
[SPEAKER_06]: on other other standards that exist so
there's the international harmonized
[SPEAKER_06]: standards around pharmaceuticals that have
action levels for residual solvents what
[SPEAKER_06]: California has specified is is in line
with those things in some cases it may be
[SPEAKER_06]: more stringent in some cases a little bit
less but they're in the same neighborhood
[SPEAKER_06]: so to speak and when you look at things
like action limits on residual solvents
[SPEAKER_06]: you know they were based on the data
that's available in terms of the exposure
[SPEAKER_06]: that workers who work in environments
where those solvents exist in their
[SPEAKER_06]: working environment what they can be
exposed to on a sustained basis say in a
[SPEAKER_06]: part per million level so they went to
actually fact-based standards to say what
[SPEAKER_06]: should we pull from to make action limits
and I'd say if you if you read the initial
[SPEAKER_06]: text around the regulations the
explanation of the regulations and the
[SPEAKER_06]: justification for how the action limits
were set there was quite a bit of work and
[SPEAKER_06]: thought and care put into what those
action limits should be on based on other
[SPEAKER_11]: regulated industries and standards thank
you yeah I'll respond to your good your
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis growth comment so I kind of look
at that in two ways one one thing I know
[SPEAKER_11]: for sure about this country is while
there's social justice issues compassion
[SPEAKER_11]: care issues nothing moves the needle more
than missing out on a global market
[SPEAKER_11]: opportunity so I expect that investment to
be a big needle mover in the federal
[SPEAKER_11]: government's position and that may be a
bad thing considering your packaging
[SPEAKER_11]: question right now are we going to be
suddenly is it going to be Walgreens so
[SPEAKER_11]: I'll say this and this is not my idea is
an idea that I just subscribe to and that
[SPEAKER_11]: is it cannabis its core is a connoisseur
product aspirin is not you know beer
[SPEAKER_11]: wasn't until craft beer came around and
now there's this very healthy craft beer
[SPEAKER_11]: market same with wines and there's a lot
of young upstarts you know ballast point
[SPEAKER_11]: at one time was just you know a couple of
folks that just had the mocks would go get
[SPEAKER_11]: it yeah and they had they had the lion
heart that that we all love so much about
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis people is that we're
entrepreneurs and we're at aggressive lone
[SPEAKER_11]: wolf go-getters you know and so as that
lone wolf piece starts to fall off that
[SPEAKER_11]: that go-getters and this is going to stay
there and I expect that if we can do a
[SPEAKER_11]: good job of educating consumers at the
retail level and doing things like
[SPEAKER_11]: allowing consumers to try topicals at the
retail stand right something like that
[SPEAKER_11]: that's kind of an ambassadorship into some
normalcy I think we can really encourage
[SPEAKER_11]: people to start participate and buy into
that connoisseurship I think it's always
[SPEAKER_11]: going to be something as long as we
celebrate it and don't fall into marketing
[SPEAKER_11]: just Walgreens style products I think we
can have a very healthy market and at the
[SPEAKER_11]: same time to Kristen's point there's
always going to be the other side of it
[SPEAKER_00]: there's nothing we can do about that since
the industry is mirroring different
[SPEAKER_00]: industries that we're all aware of ie
tobacco alcohol I would love to see one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing as a new person in the production
manufacturing business now give us a
[SPEAKER_00]: license and if we're bad characters
penalizes but like every other licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: within those structures let us get it and
have it I don't like the one-year mark I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to see a five-year mark I'd
like to see an infant item licensing that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're receiving until we prove otherwise
and I don't know it's it's not been done
[SPEAKER_00]: in any other states but we should be
taking the presence on that because it is
[SPEAKER_00]: a medicine and it certainly has a very
important place so the one-year mark is
[SPEAKER_00]: just not satisfactory for some of us that
are looking at this long term and we
[SPEAKER_00]: should really have that opportunity as
well the second position that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: wanting to take is the plastic industry I
mean it is a medicine first and foremost
[SPEAKER_00]: so here we are all drinking our water out
of our plastic but now we're putting our
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine to plastic which has been done a
lot of contributors to cancer and other
[SPEAKER_00]: illnesses and conditions but we are not
only creating an unknown factor by putting
[SPEAKER_00]: our medicine in that packaging but now
we're adding to an environmental concern
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the waste factors all the level
of the plastic so it just keeps
[SPEAKER_00]: compounding and we'd like to see this
industry taking a position and being
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally sound and reducing all the
amount of environmental waste that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: contributing to and again we just don't
know what the long-term effects are of
[SPEAKER_00]: that those packaging principles and I'd
like to see some consideration of waste
[SPEAKER_00]: long-term and not provoke anything that
could be conditional down the road okay
[SPEAKER_09]: anyone else all right actually you can
yeah just use that mic yeah I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: question and a comment I very much
appreciate everyone that's been here
[SPEAKER_01]: Laurie I've been following you from day
one and appreciate everything you've done
[SPEAKER_01]: I traveled from Long Beach today to be
here to actually have some concrete
[SPEAKER_01]: answers to some of the questions about I'm
a manufacturer about packaging about child
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant about this and I feel like I
attended another political city council
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation about no concrete answers
when are we gonna get concrete answers
[SPEAKER_01]: about this is what packaging needs to be
this is what compliance needs to be this
[SPEAKER_01]: is what lab testing needs to be this is
what happens inside a box this is what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens at the retail level this is our
lab testing at micro dosing we need
[SPEAKER_01]: concrete answers we're business owners
that are suffering significantly because
[SPEAKER_05]: these decisions are not being made so our
are the Bureau's public comment period
[SPEAKER_05]: ended on Monday and we're still going I
think we're up over 3,000 comments so
[SPEAKER_05]: there is no concrete answers other than
the current regulations that are in place
[SPEAKER_05]: those are your that is what you have to
abide by right now so over the next
[SPEAKER_05]: probably few weeks we have to respond to
each and every public comment that came in
[SPEAKER_05]: that has to be part of our final
rulemaking package we are then gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: probably I'm I'm I'm I'm positive the
Bureau is going to be making changes their
[SPEAKER_05]: regs I can't I can't speak for CDPH and
CDFA but I believe all three of us are
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna be making changes based on those
comments and then we have to go out we
[SPEAKER_05]: have to draft new regulations for those
changes and we go out for another comment
[SPEAKER_05]: period that is the California rulemaking
process that comment period could be 15
[SPEAKER_05]: days or 45 days and guess what it starts
all over again we get that comment and
[SPEAKER_05]: then at that point we have to meet our
deadline of I believe it's December 6th to
[SPEAKER_05]: get the final regulations in place so the
rulemaking process is a very arduous
[SPEAKER_05]: process I think it can be frustrating
because people want answers right now and
[SPEAKER_05]: the only thing we can tell them is what's
currently in the emergency regulation
[SPEAKER_05]: package but it's also a very transparent
process and it has a lot of public
[SPEAKER_05]: feedback which is good because we're not
doing anything you know behind closed
[SPEAKER_05]: doors if we make changes we have to go out
for another comment and and we can't make
[SPEAKER_05]: those final decisions until we do that
additional comment period and then change
[SPEAKER_05]: again so I think it is frustrating but
believe me as a regulator we want this
[SPEAKER_05]: process to be over as much as you do I
mean we're just constantly doing this
[SPEAKER_05]: we're tired of it we want to just have the
answers to every time we do FAQs it
[SPEAKER_05]: changes every time we put out some fact
sheet it changes a couple months later
[SPEAKER_05]: because we've changed it again but I'll
tell you this as regulators the reason we
[SPEAKER_05]: keep changing is because we keep getting
more data more information and we're
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to do things better not trying to
make it worse for you we're trying to make
[SPEAKER_05]: it better so that's the process we have
right now and so again it's it's I want to
[SPEAKER_04]: add something too this is we are all
learning right now literally the industry
[SPEAKER_04]: the regulators I mean the cart is way
ahead of the horse in terms of California
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry and moving it into the
regulations and you the I think the the
[SPEAKER_04]: businesses and the operators that are that
have been around for a while and that will
[SPEAKER_04]: you know the new ones that will continue
to stay around have to realize that
[SPEAKER_04]: adaptability and flexibility is critical
to survival in this industry in this day
[SPEAKER_04]: and age and just making sure that you're
always on your toes and and that there
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't I mean they're literally as you
said we're we're following a map but we
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of have blinders on because we don't
really know what the end is gonna look
[SPEAKER_04]: like but we we know what our overall
ultimate goal is and we know that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna get there but there I I think there
there should be a little bit of room for
[SPEAKER_04]: for understanding for everybody for for
all of the the supply chain and for the
[SPEAKER_04]: regulators and just we're all kind of
moving this horse together it is a
[SPEAKER_04]: multi-billion dollar industry and and
we're trying to plug this in backwards so
[SPEAKER_08]: it's not gonna be and I'd love to jump in
here too just because I absolutely feel
[SPEAKER_08]: your pain you know I trying to educate my
company to the same points that yes you
[SPEAKER_08]: remember emergency regs 1.0 we rolled
those up and threw those away then we had
[SPEAKER_08]: emergency regs 2.0 and that's what we're
living by right now even though all the
[SPEAKER_08]: attention is on the proposed regs which
were going through and just wrapped up our
[SPEAKER_08]: public comment period but that aside it's
also an important lesson I think for us to
[SPEAKER_08]: realize and we learned this on July 1st
which is that depending on your position
[SPEAKER_08]: in the supply chain there's state regs and
those matter a lot but how your business
[SPEAKER_08]: partner next in the supply chain
interprets those regs those are the real
[SPEAKER_08]: regs because whatever Sabrina says is what
they require for packaging doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_08]: what I think you know the BCC says about
packaging it's what she says about
[SPEAKER_08]: packaging because otherwise she's not
taking my product and I think that's that
[SPEAKER_08]: is the most challenging part of all
because that shifts all over the place
[SPEAKER_01]: well I respect our issue is all of those
things you've said but also BCC says
[SPEAKER_01]: something different than CDPH and this one
wants it inside the box this one wants it
[SPEAKER_01]: inside the box and outside the box and
they're conflicting and they're all state
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory agencies it's not fair to us as
small businesses or even big businesses to
[SPEAKER_01]: we've seen it in Colorado where they have
to retool and they have to redo this
[SPEAKER_01]: because the agencies can't play together
this is what I expected from this meeting
[SPEAKER_01]: tonight I expected the public comment to
all come together and this is what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna do we need this percent variance on
testing we need this on the inside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging we now can have CBD but we have
to put it on the front of our packaging
[SPEAKER_09]: what's the resolution to that we'll take
one more question for this panel and then
[SPEAKER_09]: we have an entire new panel after this so
good evening Sean Kelly rice Silicon
[SPEAKER_10]: Valley Cannabis Alliance thank you all for
your your attendance here a question for
[SPEAKER_10]: Laurie we've had a lot of success in just
calling your office and interacting with
[SPEAKER_10]: you directly and getting an answer so
anyone that who who has who has questions
[SPEAKER_10]: call the BCC it you you will get an answer
someone there will give you an answer and
[SPEAKER_10]: you can actually move forward so we've not
had that problem I'm on the front line the
[SPEAKER_10]: Silicon Valley Cannabis Alliance is on the
front line without what we do none of
[SPEAKER_10]: these suppliers matter we're trying to get
more and more retail in these cities right
[SPEAKER_10]: now Silicon Valley only has San Jose it's
a hundred and five million dollar market
[SPEAKER_10]: but Milpitas is coming Mountain View is
coming the city of Santa Clara is coming
[SPEAKER_10]: gosh Morgan Hill is coming there's a
number of other cities that are looking at
[SPEAKER_10]: it I'm the only person going out there
advocating talking to lobbying these folks
[SPEAKER_10]: and and and they're great politicians and
elected officials to talk to can you
[SPEAKER_10]: provide someone that can go and give a
counterpoint to what I say because when I
[SPEAKER_10]: go in there they're like oh great this is
wonderful Sean you get paid by the
[SPEAKER_10]: industry who else can we talk to that from
the BCC sometimes I'm lucky I do actually
[SPEAKER_05]: get standing right behind you right there
Andre Jones our governmental affairs he's
[SPEAKER_05]: a one-man show going to all the cities and
counties across the state that that's what
[SPEAKER_10]: we need you do honestly I mean that that
would be so so helpful I'm going to San
[SPEAKER_10]: Carlos and gonna talk to the rotary and
they hear my side of it and they know what
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna say but they would love to have
someone like this I would love to have a
[SPEAKER_10]: resource to grab to go to all these cities
and say here talk to the other side talk
[SPEAKER_10]: to the state talk to someone that's other
than someone who's getting paid and get
[SPEAKER_10]: the counterpoint see how well retailers
are actually really doing out there it's
[SPEAKER_10]: not chaos it's not mayhem you know it's
not alcohol it's it's going pretty well
[SPEAKER_05]: well and another thing too we also are
developing we know there needs to be a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: more education at the local level it's
just not consumer it's just not our
[SPEAKER_05]: licensee it's also at the local level
we're at establishing a unit a local
[SPEAKER_05]: liaison unit so we're gonna hire 10
analysts that that's their jobs to talk to
[SPEAKER_05]: the cities and be that resource because
they also want a single point of contact
[SPEAKER_05]: now of course we got to hire the people
first and train them so it's not coming
[SPEAKER_05]: next week but that's also going to assist
you so you can direct them to a certain
[SPEAKER_05]: person in that region from the BCC that
can help them out and even forums like
[SPEAKER_10]: this that are designed specifically for
politicians we had one July 11th at the
[SPEAKER_10]: San Jose Rotunda we ended up getting
council members from Santa Clara council
[SPEAKER_10]: members from Milpitas other council
members that actually showed up and were
[SPEAKER_10]: there interested because they want to hear
from all their politicians we had
[SPEAKER_10]: politicians come down from Antioch and it
was fantastic so even forums like this
[SPEAKER_10]: that are maybe not designed for the
industry but designed for the politicians
[SPEAKER_10]: so they feel in that safe environment that
they can get some of that feedback because
[SPEAKER_10]: it really helps us get more retail because
that's really you know it's storefront and
[SPEAKER_10]: delivery because we're woefully you know
lacking in delivery also can I just I
[SPEAKER_08]: would love to respond to your question as
well real quick because I feel like this
[SPEAKER_08]: is you know take a an average 50 year old
adult that thinks that they're healthy and
[SPEAKER_08]: until they go to the doctor and get a
diagnosis that says we measured your you
[SPEAKER_08]: know your LDLs in your blood and you have
really high chance of a heart attack you
[SPEAKER_08]: need to change your behavior until you can
do that they're thinking they're healthy
[SPEAKER_08]: and I feel like the same thing is going on
in these communities that think you know
[SPEAKER_08]: we're not going to deal with the regulated
market we don't want to touch that right
[SPEAKER_08]: now but we're also not going to admit to
ourselves that we have an illicit market
[SPEAKER_08]: that's going on as well there needs to be
a way to measure what's going on in
[SPEAKER_08]: communities so that we can point at that
and say here's your illicit market it's
[SPEAKER_08]: this big it's this valuable and you're
missing out on this much job creation tax
[SPEAKER_08]: revenue this is this is the amount of
product that is moving through your
[SPEAKER_08]: illicit market that is untested and who
knows where it goes to if we can measure
[SPEAKER_08]: that and begin to have that information to
present to communities and say this is
[SPEAKER_08]: your this is your status we would
encourage you to move to the regulated
[SPEAKER_08]: market and improve the health of your
community I think it would be hugely
[SPEAKER_08]: helpful to the work that you do and and
let me just say that I salute the work
[SPEAKER_08]: that you do because you're absolutely
right without more retail throughout the
[SPEAKER_08]: state and the two-thirds of the state that
has no retail what we have is we have an
[SPEAKER_08]: illicit market that we don't know how big
it is but it's pretty healthy I can tell
[SPEAKER_08]: you that it's a it's a big healthy illicit
market thank you all right and I would
[SPEAKER_09]: like to thank our panel we have one more
panel after this so let's take a
[SPEAKER_04]: five-minute break I would also like to
thank Laurie Ajax Laurie you're a sport
[SPEAKER_04]: tonight thank you I can't even imagine I
don't envy your position but thank you for
[SPEAKER_04]: working with all of us yeah you
