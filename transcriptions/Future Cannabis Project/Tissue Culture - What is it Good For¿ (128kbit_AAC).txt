[SPEAKER_02]: So we're talking tissue culture,
and you said you've recently been dabbling
[SPEAKER_02]: in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, so we hired a stem cell
researcher three years ago to go down the
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture route.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started with, by the way,
it was a stem cell researcher in human
[SPEAKER_00]: stem cells, so he had to quickly learn
tissue culture for plants, but he was the
[SPEAKER_00]: right person to do it, and they spent
about six months developing tech,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we went from kind of no generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he say anything that he learned that
was different doing plant stem cell versus
[SPEAKER_02]: human?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah, there's a lot of differences
to it, but a lot of the protocols for
[SPEAKER_00]: clean room were very important,
so having someone real familiar with clean
[SPEAKER_00]: room protocols.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of, yeah, the technology
itself is a lot different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it started as just reading papers on
the subject, and then trying to replicate
[SPEAKER_00]: the studies, and then after that it was,
okay, let's do some real research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Start from scratch.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it, there's hardly anything on the
subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple of famously bad papers
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's what we started with,
I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys probably did the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people want to strangle this,
a lot of scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was like, do it from scratch,
learn it, and then, you know, the
[SPEAKER_00]: conclusion that we came to in our year and
a half was that it's great for certain
[SPEAKER_00]: things, but for general propagation,
you know, mom's in cutting still seem to
[SPEAKER_00]: be the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, curious to see kind of what
you're... Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we started a lot of... But wait,
before he goes, talk about what was it
[SPEAKER_02]: good for in your scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, we were just starting to get
into the research on cleaning up plant
[SPEAKER_00]: material, and this is right about the time
where we started to hear kind of noise
[SPEAKER_00]: about these mutations and OGs being
actually a virus or a viroid, but we
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't have any information, and then it
came out, you know, about a year and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half later.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys did some research, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that Leighton... And we
think there's probably others as well that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're exploring right now.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely the Hop, Leighton,
Viroid is a big target for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It still is, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're seeing it all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a cultivator, you know,
I've been growing for 20 years now,
[SPEAKER_00]: started to see those like real weird
mutants in OGs and like any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: OG-related varieties, it seemed like at
first, and anything that we bred with them
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's an interesting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's been a lot of like crazy
research in the tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's good to hear that, you know,
some of the top guys in the game found the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing we did, that putting tons of
money into tissue culture for propagation
[SPEAKER_00]: might be kind of a bad move.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, it was, I mean, like we were in
the space like probably like 2014 or so we
[SPEAKER_01]: started it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was funny because I was thinking
back on this, and for us it was,
[SPEAKER_01]: the big thing was like we were at the
maximum of this indoor facility we have in
[SPEAKER_01]: Oakland, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're like, how could we possibly make
more plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's check out tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, in tissue culture,
we're like, wow, you do the math,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could do like a million plants in 10
square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started exploring it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we built out a lab and same
thing, you know, looked at the papers and
[SPEAKER_01]: never accomplished what the papers
promised.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we actually did launch a commercial
line of plants through tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_01]: scaled up the lab pretty aggressively.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had this lab line of products that we
did.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, at the end of the day,
you do the math and you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesus, our tissue culture plants cost X,
our regular plants cost X.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, we would do trials as
well, because there's this question like
[SPEAKER_01]: our tissue culture plants is higher
quality, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they more productive?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they branch more.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time we did a trial,
we're like, I don't know, he's pretty dang
[SPEAKER_01]: close either way.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's pretty dang close.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no clear, there was no clear
advantage to tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you said, I think what did become
really important to us was, especially
[SPEAKER_01]: around what we call final sanitation,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we saw, and frankly,
like going back all the way, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: for my whole 12 years in the industry,
people have always talked about genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: drift, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, oh, genetic drift, don't you
notice that plants do worse over time?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, you know, like, as like,
you know, my like inner geneticist tells
[SPEAKER_01]: me that that's not a thing, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But what could be happening is we've got
these disease pressures, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't know what they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And frankly, we hadn't even seen them in
symptoms at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we said, like, let's start figuring
out like final sanitation, like
[SPEAKER_01]: mariculture techniques and like other
treatments to pair with that to eliminate
[SPEAKER_01]: viruses, viroids, and other pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it took like four more years before we
were like, we're really able to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we really had to, we had the
final sanitation stuff, but then we had to
[SPEAKER_01]: do the sequencing, diagnostic work to
actually figure out what was in the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What were the culprits, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: that was the biggest one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's that we're confident where
we showed like causality, we really went,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, Jeremy Warren, who's now our
director of plant health, was really able
[SPEAKER_01]: to go all the way to identifying that
causes the dudding symptoms that we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we, you know, since we published that,
we've had people come to us with other
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, what's this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's this?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're now seeing other symptoms that
are not, you know, probably not HPLVD,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we think are probably something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going through a second,
a second set of sequencing right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some of the symptoms you're
seeing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's like all across the
board and Jeremy's really the best to
[SPEAKER_01]: explore this, but you know, frequently
we'll see like varying leaf deformities
[SPEAKER_01]: are like really common, especially when
they're like, you know, this is like kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of my like farmer hat, you know,
my farmer descriptions, like you'll see
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves where they have like asymmetric
deformities.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll like curve, they'll have like
various forms of modeling, mosaic-y type
[SPEAKER_01]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of looks like variegation,
but it's not, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a weird, yeah, we have,
I've seen that a lot, structural issues on
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf, where it's like half the leaf
looks kind of deformed, and it's not an
[SPEAKER_00]: oblate environment, it's different than
the dud.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, various forms of like,
even like various forms of leaf curving,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like leaf tacoing and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes that's just nutrient,
but other times it seems to be something
[SPEAKER_01]: else is going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, whole plethora, even like,
you know, weird like fox tailing on
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's funny because HPLVD we have found is
very widespread.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, now that we've got that,
and this is really the key for us,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what we've done with tissue culture is
turn the lab into what we call our clean
[SPEAKER_01]: plant program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we marry this tissue culture with the
mariculture and various pre-treatments to
[SPEAKER_01]: get clean plants, but also really
importantly, we have the diagnostic lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to, after we go through that
process, we have to like run it through
[SPEAKER_01]: the lab to confirm that it is in fact a
clean plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then frankly, like in what we call our
elite mom repository, routinely test to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that those plants have not
become reinfected, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I mean, you really have to get rid
of the viroid all the way throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can hide in who knows where.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lower branch that has the
hoplite viroid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's one of the really surprising
things is that this is like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's been described to me as like,
you know, it's like you would be looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for one person on the planet Mars,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like potentially the scale you're
dealing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even like with really precise PCR
diagnostics, like for us, we don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: consider anything clean until it tests
clean three times consecutively on
[SPEAKER_01]: screens, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you get a lot of false negatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that's interesting, we were able
to reduce the dieting just by mom
[SPEAKER_00]: selection, not even doing tissue culture,
just really aggressively mom selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you take your thousand cuttings
from your moms and then you take,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the top 30 and those become moms
and then you do that generations and
[SPEAKER_00]: generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually, you're just kind of
selecting towards bigger and you could
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen that help a lot,
just statistically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like even the first thing we ever saw
published on dudding, I think it was Rick
[SPEAKER_01]: Krumm presented like at the Emerald
Conference years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was like really best practice,
you know, even before anyone knew what it
[SPEAKER_01]: was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like just select, select,
select, select, call, call bad stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: select, select.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny, we still don't know enough
about the viroid to like know exactly how
[SPEAKER_01]: that works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, they do call it latent for a
reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can exist asymptomatically and
frequently does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, presumably you just get the
pressure below a certain point or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like that you can, you can
manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, we've noticed also,
it seems, I mean, this is just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: observation that the environment and,
you know, the way that you grow the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: can also influence how the symptoms affect
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So maybe, you know, your environment is on
point, everything's perfect, lighting's
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect, the plant's super happy and the
viroid doesn't affect it as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, like, so my version of that is
like we see many more symptomatic plants
[SPEAKER_01]: with indoor growers, but like greenhouse
and especially outdoor growers seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: have far fewer symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like, we don't know exactly what
that is, but probably something
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot and cold or maybe it's the light or
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Epigenetic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that epigenetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the, I don't even know what I'm
talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the epigenetic, so I mean,
I guess it's the plant's ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: trigger certain genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've heard that with like outdoor growers
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put something that's indoor,
it seems to be real weak out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within, you know, a season,
you can bring it back in, it's strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe it's UV light or, you know,
something else, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's really Jeremy's field of study
on our team, but I do know like the plants
[SPEAKER_01]: do have a immune response system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, in an environment where that
system can work better, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: better at eliminating the pathogen itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, I think just in general,
indoor environment is much more stable
[SPEAKER_00]: than the outdoor environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although you can control it, but the
stability itself is a lot different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be hard, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and it's just unnatural for the
plant, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's stuff that doesn't always work the
way the plant expects it to work.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: What, I just want to get back to the
point, because when we were over there
[SPEAKER_02]: before we came over here, it was for us
here, just specifically like the three
[SPEAKER_02]: things, tissue, culture is good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like remember, we talked about like
keeping your library, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you just get into like,
what do we use tissue culture for as a
[SPEAKER_02]: functioning row operation and where is it
not really relevant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because then you got into like,
it's easy to just take a thousand
[SPEAKER_02]: clippings a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for like propagation, kind of just
general production in a facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: it seems like mom clone is still the way
to go for cannabis, at least right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we did research on tissue culture,
the one, yeah, the one benefit we thought,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we didn't really get to test it as
much as we wanted to, but it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you are doing breeding and phenotype
selection, storing those varieties,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's a lot less space,
you know, and you can store for quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of time if you have the right
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's, you know, I still think
there's a lot of research that needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can probably speak on that more in
terms of storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's basically, you know,
so that's for us, we have the clean plant
[SPEAKER_01]: program and we have the genetic library.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's, you know, it helps us and,
you know, it's the two combined for us is
[SPEAKER_01]: what's really important, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can take a new genetics, clean them up,
add them to the library.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got something like a hundred
varietals now at the lab, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: which allows us to offer more interesting
genetics more frequently and also to know
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're clean when we're watching the
market.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys done any long-term stores
with cryo-freezing or is it just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like freezing level?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, zero degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you guys doing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't done any cryopreservation stuff
yet, but we have done a variety of like
[SPEAKER_01]: long-term storage protocols, which have
been mostly successful for us,
[SPEAKER_01]: but never like the liquid nitrogen bath
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you guys very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
