[SPEAKER_09]: Good evening all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_09]: To what have the regulations done to us?
[SPEAKER_09]: Love your regulations?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: So where are we and why are we talking
today?
[SPEAKER_09]: And why is today the 11th important?
[SPEAKER_09]: You have 11 important days left.
[SPEAKER_09]: Last Friday, the three regulatory
agencies, which I'm sure everybody in this
[SPEAKER_09]: room is familiar with, the Bureau of,
that was ominous and true, the Bureau of
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis Control, the Department of Public
Health, and the Department of Food and Ag
[SPEAKER_09]: all released their revised draft permanent
regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: They did so so nicely early in the morning
on Friday versus at 445, when I thought
[SPEAKER_09]: they were going to drop.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, BCC, for hijacking my day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what that means is it started a 15-day
countdown where we can provide public
[SPEAKER_09]: comments.
[SPEAKER_09]: That terminates on November 5th at 5 p.m.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can provide comments to the regulatory
agencies via email, snail mail.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you can even call them and harass
them if you would like.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in some form or fashion, you have to
comment by 5 p.m.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, what can you comment on?
[SPEAKER_09]: During this period, you can comment on
revisions and the rulemaking process.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can't just blanketly comment on
anything you want.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was during the 45-day comment period
that ended earlier in August.
[SPEAKER_09]: And why should you comment?
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is that effective?
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we can start there, and that's
pretty important.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were able to, and I think before we get
into ostracized the agencies about what
[SPEAKER_09]: we'd like to see change, there were
positive steps in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw movement.
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw developments.
[SPEAKER_09]: And therefore, I think the big takeaway
is, and why you all are sitting in this
[SPEAKER_09]: room tonight, you can make a change.
[SPEAKER_09]: And together as an industry, we can unite
to those things that are most concerning
[SPEAKER_09]: and the most problematic.
[SPEAKER_09]: And before we get there, I'd like to
invite my fellow panelists to provide some
[SPEAKER_09]: of what they think were wins in these last
set of updates to the regulations.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm gonna go ahead and jump in,
but I hope I'm not taking this,
[SPEAKER_13]: but I know that we are totally,
probably in line with this is,
[SPEAKER_13]: not that it makes a huge difference in the
long run, but that metric is now,
[SPEAKER_13]: instead of inventory every 14 days,
it's once a month.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not like that should make any difference
to your SOPs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Not that that should make any difference
with that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Also on that one tied in with that is that
it went from 2.5% of your inventory,
[SPEAKER_13]: or was it $5,000, whichever one is less,
to now 3% of your inventory and no cap on
[SPEAKER_13]: the dollar amount.
[SPEAKER_13]: However, I don't like that, in my personal
opinion.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I like it that we only have to do it
once a month.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Jackie, what are some of your big,
exciting takeaways?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the Bureau did an excellent job at
finding some middle ground based on our
[SPEAKER_05]: feedback and our public comments during
the 45-day public comment period that we
[SPEAKER_05]: just witnessed.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Bureau only expected all three
agencies to get 1,000 comments altogether,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they got 4,000.
[SPEAKER_05]: Half of those comments were a direct
result of some grassroots movement,
[SPEAKER_05]: in particular, related to 5416D,
which allowed statewide delivery,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether a jurisdiction had a ban or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a big one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still a big one.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a letter of support to go that
we're gathering signatures for right now
[SPEAKER_05]: so that we can make sure that that stays
intact.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we also saw really, really big wins in
delivery across the board, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're regulating technology platforms
now and requiring... The big wins depends
[SPEAKER_13]: on what side of the spectrum you're on on
that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: My firm represents most of the delivery
associations in the state, and so for us,
[SPEAKER_05]: those were really big wins that we pushed
on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I agree.
[SPEAKER_05]: The restriction on when you can leave a
dispensary with a retail order or with a
[SPEAKER_05]: delivery order now has to have... You have
to have $2,500 of orders before you can
[SPEAKER_05]: disperse, and then you can have up to
$5,000 worth of inventory in your car.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Bureau really did a good job at
listening to the industry and their
[SPEAKER_05]: concerns over the fact that there was a
few unregulated tech platforms that were
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of gobbling up market share and not
necessarily playing by the same set of
[SPEAKER_05]: rules that small delivery services have to
play by.
[SPEAKER_05]: The fact that they took the limit down
from $10,000 that you could carry in your
[SPEAKER_05]: car down to five, and then with that other
restriction requiring $2,500 worth of
[SPEAKER_05]: orders before you drive around.
[SPEAKER_05]: What they're trying to do is prevent what
our opposition likes to call wandering
[SPEAKER_05]: weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they didn't want delivery services to
turn into ice cream trucks, and our
[SPEAKER_05]: opposition was actually the UFCW who
sponsored a campaign called Stop the
[SPEAKER_05]: Wandering Weed, and they used cartoon
figures to show us driving up to schools
[SPEAKER_05]: and delivering to children.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just nothing that makes me more
angry than when anyone uses the children
[SPEAKER_05]: against us, especially given how much we
have to combat that argument over and over
[SPEAKER_05]: again in every single jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I see a union that's supposed to be
our union representing our interests use
[SPEAKER_05]: the children against us, there just isn't
anything more offensive to me than that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Won't it be a wonderful day when we can
look back and remember when we couldn't do
[SPEAKER_13]: some of these things?
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just like, people are gonna start
waking up and understanding, oh,
[SPEAKER_13]: this actually doesn't kill anybody.
[SPEAKER_13]: And wait, this actually saves lives.
[SPEAKER_13]: It makes people's lives better.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can't wait till that time because some
of the stuff that we're gonna go over
[SPEAKER_13]: tonight is ridiculous that we still are
being hindered by a plant that's never
[SPEAKER_13]: hurt anybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: You mean the child-resistancy whiplash?
[SPEAKER_09]: When an alcohol bottle does not have
child-resistancy or your child can walk in
[SPEAKER_09]: into a convenience store and pick up an
alcohol bottle and nobody is there to tell
[SPEAKER_09]: them, no, there is no security.
[SPEAKER_09]: There is no, please stop, present your ID.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let me put it in an opaque exit bag before
you leave.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or that we are all up, not we are all,
but many people are up in arms about
[SPEAKER_13]: straws.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, we got other bigger shit going on
right now, and then we're gonna put,
[SPEAKER_13]: we're bitch about straws, and then we have
bags and child proof, but not child proof.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you're gonna put the mints in
their individual little packages and most
[SPEAKER_09]: things, and we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're supposed to be on wins right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk about our wins because there's
a few of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, we're gonna return to the wins.
[SPEAKER_09]: California and cannabis companies are in
fact disruptive.
[SPEAKER_09]: They are in fact incredibly innovative and
creative.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's with that spirit that I want us
to look at the regulations and how we go
[SPEAKER_09]: about dealing with some of these more
complex, nuanced issues.
[SPEAKER_09]: So before we dive into that, some of the
things that I think were successful,
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'd like to pat the BCC on the back
for, because you gotta celebrate the wins
[SPEAKER_09]: before you discuss the issues,
is that look, now as a retailer,
[SPEAKER_09]: you're gonna be able to reject shipments.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is huge.
[SPEAKER_09]: Before you were gonna have to fully reject
an entire distribution shipment that came
[SPEAKER_09]: to you if one skew had a labeling issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now you don't have to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: If there is parts of your order that are
damaged in transit, you can specifically
[SPEAKER_09]: identify those on the manifest and send
them back.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was not compliant operations
previously.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think the BCC listened, and they looked
at the certificate of analysis that were
[SPEAKER_09]: coming in where nearly, what is it,
almost 70% of the reasons that COAs were
[SPEAKER_09]: failing was because the THC and the CBD,
the cannabinoid content was wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: The label figures.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it was one of the four primary
panel requirements.
[SPEAKER_09]: Before manufactured goods were allowed to
leave, they had to have that cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_09]: content on them, and it was a guessing
game.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they were failing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the BCC listened, and now it
distributed and the distributor can put
[SPEAKER_09]: that on after the fact, after the COA
comes in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can I interject real quick?
[SPEAKER_13]: So I went to college for a few things
multiple times.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I went for psychology and English
rhetoric and writing, and technical
[SPEAKER_13]: writing was a huge aspect of what I had to
do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And from a technical writing standpoint,
I think there's an issue of, you
[SPEAKER_13]: oftentimes will write out an instruction,
like a how-to, and you do it from your
[SPEAKER_13]: perspective with your preconceived
notions.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I feel like this is what the state
blatantly showed us, is that they do not
[SPEAKER_13]: understand what cannabis is, what the
cannabis industry is, and how to write
[SPEAKER_13]: regulations to buy it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they wrote the most intense regulations
over something that they didn't even
[SPEAKER_13]: understand.
[SPEAKER_13]: It drives me nuts.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's like they did not take the
stakeholders in this industry,
[SPEAKER_13]: patients, distributors, retailers,
cultivators, into consideration when they
[SPEAKER_13]: wrote these regulations.
[SPEAKER_13]: Now they keep coming back with these
whiplash regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: We didn't talk about the whiplash.
[SPEAKER_13]: We didn't talk about whiplash.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's also important that we don't
forget about the forms, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: These are forms that you are going to have
to utilize.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so when we comment on the regulatory
package in what you are allowed to comment
[SPEAKER_09]: on, please let us not forget that the
forms, because most of them are new,
[SPEAKER_09]: are things that you can comment on.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so if they don't make sense,
and in some of the forms, they were asking
[SPEAKER_09]: for things that did not make sense,
and these were blanketed forms to be used
[SPEAKER_09]: by every license type that the BCC
controls.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've now seen the BCC come out with
specific testing regarding forms and
[SPEAKER_09]: pulled that from the regular inventory
control forms that they had previously.
[SPEAKER_09]: The CEQA forms.
[SPEAKER_09]: For those of you who don't know what CEQA
is, it is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was an environmental attorney before I
came to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's three or four letters that amount
to the California Environmental Quality
[SPEAKER_09]: Act.
[SPEAKER_09]: CEQA is the preeminent environmental law
in the country.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is what its federal analog,
the National Environmental Policy Act,
[SPEAKER_09]: or NEPA, it was really based upon.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so when you are thinking, oh,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: My city or county exempted the ordinance
in CEQA.
[SPEAKER_09]: This doesn't affect me.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_09]: The answer is just simply a no.
[SPEAKER_09]: CEQA is triggered by a discretionary
action.
[SPEAKER_09]: The bureau issuing you a permit is a
discretionary action.
[SPEAKER_09]: That limited statutory exemption expires
in July 1 of 2019 that most of these
[SPEAKER_09]: cities, or some of these cities,
specifically the city of Los Angeles,
[SPEAKER_09]: used to exempt their ordinance only did
that, exempted the ordinance.
[SPEAKER_09]: It did not exempt your individual
projects.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are an individual project and you
are in an existing building, you may think
[SPEAKER_09]: notice of exemption.
[SPEAKER_09]: You may not.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's a categorical exemption class
that says notice of exemption for an
[SPEAKER_09]: existing facility.
[SPEAKER_09]: You are only an existing facility if you
do not change the use and if you do not
[SPEAKER_09]: exceed the existing footprint.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so what the BCC did was it made two
CEQA forms, not just one.
[SPEAKER_09]: It said if you think that you are exempt
for any particular reason, and there are
[SPEAKER_09]: several classes, if anybody's interested,
we can talk about it later.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there are an exemption package and
then there's a package if you have to
[SPEAKER_09]: adjust your project and you're not CEQA
exempt.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you have to go through.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's four pages.
[SPEAKER_09]: And there are specific ways in which you
have to address CEQA with magic language
[SPEAKER_09]: that gets you to not have to conduct a
further environmental review through an
[SPEAKER_09]: environmental impact report or a mitigated
negative declaration.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are pathways that can result in
hundreds of thousands of dollars and up to
[SPEAKER_09]: 6, 9, 12, or 36 months to get through.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you don't have a provisional
license, which we'll talk about,
[SPEAKER_09]: for the year, that means you can't operate
until you go through CEQA.
[SPEAKER_09]: So please take a look at the forms and see
if you have any questions, clarifications,
[SPEAKER_09]: or wouldn't be able to respond to them
according to your project.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can comment on forms.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it's all brand new.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's all brand new.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: So do we want to jump into regulatory
whiplash or owner, financial interest
[SPEAKER_09]: holder?
[SPEAKER_05]: How many people in the audience have a
licensed commercial business?
[SPEAKER_05]: And how many people are trying to get
licensed?
[SPEAKER_13]: And how many people work for a licensed or
unlicensed company right now?
[SPEAKER_13]: So we've got licensed and unlicensed.
[SPEAKER_13]: Trying to get licensed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: So then I think we should talk about the
temporary to provisional to annual
[SPEAKER_09]: licensing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Shout out what you guys are interested in.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you'll get the most value in it.
[SPEAKER_13]: White Labeling has been a hot topic.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's because we are asking for a ton
of clarity on this.
[SPEAKER_13]: But there is clarity if you talk to the
right people that know the right things in
[SPEAKER_13]: the right place.
[SPEAKER_05]: So where we're at right now is most people
are still rushing to get their temporary
[SPEAKER_05]: permits in with whatever agency they're
applying with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the beginning of the year,
the Bureau wanted major cities,
[SPEAKER_05]: they wanted everybody to start issuing
these temporary permits.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cities were kind of scratching their
head going, yeah, but we haven't really
[SPEAKER_05]: done any inspections on them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we made it through code compliance and
the fire department.
[SPEAKER_05]: But OK, we're going to trust you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to give out these temporary
permits.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you had big cities like Sacramento and
Oakland and San Francisco that were just
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of given up.
[SPEAKER_05]: They were just trying to find out these
temps in good faith.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thinking that they were going to get
through the process of all those checks
[SPEAKER_05]: and balances.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what happened was they all ran out of
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we are approaching the end of the year
where statutorily the temporary licenses
[SPEAKER_05]: are not going to exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to be issued anymore
after December 31st.
[SPEAKER_05]: But even trying to get your temp by
December 31st is going to be more
[SPEAKER_05]: challenging.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the CDFA just released today that they
will no longer be accepting any more
[SPEAKER_05]: temporary applications by December 1st.
[SPEAKER_09]: November 31st?
[SPEAKER_09]: Back it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does everybody understand the difference
between what Jackie was talking about,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is fundamental, your local permit,
and if your local jurisdiction gave you a
[SPEAKER_09]: temporary permit, which then entitled you
to go get a state temporary permit.
[SPEAKER_09]: So there's two things happening.
[SPEAKER_09]: One, in order to get your state temporary
permit, you need to have a local permit or
[SPEAKER_09]: you need to have a local authorization of
some kind.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so at the beginning or late last year,
probably around this time actually,
[SPEAKER_09]: the BCC was, we were all in Vegas and they
were coming out with the emergency
[SPEAKER_09]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they were going around talking to the
cities saying you have to get ready,
[SPEAKER_09]: you have to give local authorization so
that we can start issuing temporary
[SPEAKER_09]: permits before the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_09]: So starting on January 1, when we turn on
that lever, there's businesses that can
[SPEAKER_09]: conduct legal commercial cannabis activity
under the implemented regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: And what that transpired was cities like
Sacramento issuing these temporary
[SPEAKER_09]: conditioned letters of approval so that
they could go to the BCC and obtain a
[SPEAKER_09]: temporary permit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've been working under this state
temporary structure for the better part of
[SPEAKER_09]: 10 months working on a year.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what was supposed to occur or what did
occur is you applied for your initial
[SPEAKER_09]: temporary permit that entitled you to
operate for 120 days, at which time you
[SPEAKER_09]: had to then apply for your annual permit.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you applied for your annual permit,
you were granted 90 day extension.
[SPEAKER_09]: So everybody in this room, everybody in
this state that is operating in a state
[SPEAKER_09]: compliant fashion is doing so under a
temporary permit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why do I say this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because as of today, what is it?
[SPEAKER_09]: The 25th of October, all three regulatory
agencies have issued zero annual permits
[SPEAKER_09]: for any supply chain actor, continuous
supply chain actor.
[SPEAKER_09]: I say that as an asterisk because to be
technical, when you are an event
[SPEAKER_09]: organizer, you were issued your full event
organizer license because there was no
[SPEAKER_09]: reason to issue you a temporary.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it's not tied to any particular
location or building or continuous
[SPEAKER_09]: commercial activity.
[SPEAKER_09]: In fact, it is limited in the number of
events you can throw a year.
[SPEAKER_09]: So as we're working on these temporary
permits, we were confronted when the new
[SPEAKER_09]: draft permanent regulations came out that
we were reminded under 64, which when it
[SPEAKER_09]: was brought in together with the MCRSA,
before we were the MACRSA under SB 94,
[SPEAKER_09]: that part of 64 came in.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that said regulatory agencies,
you were only vested with the right to
[SPEAKER_09]: issue temporary permits until December
31st of 2018.
[SPEAKER_09]: That means that in order to issue a permit
by December 31st of 2018 for any new
[SPEAKER_09]: temporary licensee that's seeking a
permit, the agencies have to have enough
[SPEAKER_09]: time to process these permits.
[SPEAKER_09]: For CDFA, as Jackie said, they put the
date as December 1.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because when they did the readapted
regulations, they escalated and expanded
[SPEAKER_09]: what it is that you need to provide in
order to get a temporary permit.
[SPEAKER_09]: You now have to provide a cultivation
plan.
[SPEAKER_09]: You never had to do that before.
[SPEAKER_09]: The readapted regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: So instead of taking a week to two weeks
to process, CDFA has been running a four
[SPEAKER_09]: to six week delay from when you submit to
when you are issued a temporary permit.
[SPEAKER_09]: So them saying December 1 means that
they're going to work nights and weekends
[SPEAKER_09]: to process these applications.
[SPEAKER_09]: Heed the warning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Know that they mean that if you submit
after December 1st, they cannot,
[SPEAKER_09]: will not guarantee that even if you put
that license in, that you will be issued
[SPEAKER_09]: it by the 31st.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is that so critical?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because in order to get a provisional
annual license, which is what happened at
[SPEAKER_09]: the end of the legislative session in
August, at the 11th hour, they gutted and
[SPEAKER_09]: amended a bill, SB 1459.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wow, my thoughts are a little out of my
head.
[SPEAKER_09]: 1459.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that said you have to have or have
held, interesting legal verbiage there,
[SPEAKER_09]: have or held a temporary permit in order
to get a provisional annual.
[SPEAKER_09]: What does a provisional get you?
[SPEAKER_09]: It means you can operate for an entire
year.
[SPEAKER_09]: An entire year.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you get your application processed
from the state and deal with the local
[SPEAKER_09]: level.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you do not have a provisional,
what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: It means that before you turn on your
business, before you do one iota of
[SPEAKER_09]: commercial cannabis activity, you have to
be issued a full annual permit from one of
[SPEAKER_09]: the three agencies who have issued no
annual permits in 10 months.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what I think is quite interesting here
is that nobody's received their annual.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Nobody's received their annual.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the window's closing as to when you
can submit for a temporary, which would
[SPEAKER_05]: roll into a provisional.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't know what the new window is
going to entail.
[SPEAKER_05]: When it comes to you submitting a full
annual application, we have no way to
[SPEAKER_05]: quantify exactly how long it's going to
take any of the agencies to process that
[SPEAKER_05]: or if it's going to be a priority at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have no way of knowing if it's going to
be three months, six months, a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't be less than three.
[SPEAKER_13]: I find it interesting that I feel like the
government, again, to that technical
[SPEAKER_13]: writing thing where they've put the cart
before the horse.
[SPEAKER_13]: So one reason why I feel like they haven't
given out annual licenses yet is because
[SPEAKER_13]: they're still understanding what the hell
metric is and that they have not figured
[SPEAKER_13]: out that metric itself is a system that
has flaws and issues and goes down when
[SPEAKER_13]: the state of Maryland had to do their anti
looping protocol and it took down.
[SPEAKER_13]: If Maryland can take down metric,
what the hell do you think?
[SPEAKER_08]: With data to be get instead of data to be
uploaded.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's like when the city of Culver
City, not even Los Angeles, when we come
[SPEAKER_13]: on board over here, what is that going to
do to this system that is riddled with
[SPEAKER_13]: issues?
[SPEAKER_13]: I find that is quite interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that's why the state is now giving
extensions left and right because like,
[SPEAKER_13]: oh shit, we wiped our ass before we
should.
[SPEAKER_09]: As soon as they issue a provisional,
metric has to go online because you have
[SPEAKER_09]: to do everything you're entitled to do for
an annual.
[SPEAKER_09]: Asterix without a vested right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you are issued a provisional,
that means take a look at that new
[SPEAKER_09]: licensing and take a look at the new fee
structure.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to talk about a comment that I
would wish everybody in this room to make
[SPEAKER_09]: if you were going to be an operator.
[SPEAKER_09]: They gave us better tiered systems.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you so much, BCC.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they, we know where you are in a
classification.
[SPEAKER_09]: What they didn't do was allow you based
off of a business that doesn't have a
[SPEAKER_09]: knowledgeable track record of what your
sales will be.
[SPEAKER_09]: They didn't give you the flexibility to
say, you know what, BCC, I'm six months in
[SPEAKER_09]: and it looks like I'm going to make more
money than I thought.
[SPEAKER_07]: Great.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was in a special event and I served as
the retailer.
[SPEAKER_09]: So all of a sudden I had an influx of
income that I didn't expect.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to up my percentage.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to pay you more of a fee so that at
the end I don't get a penalty and have to
[SPEAKER_09]: pay half the fee plus the other fee as
it's currently drafted.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or I get a credit.
[SPEAKER_09]: I overshot.
[SPEAKER_09]: For some reason I had a recall.
[SPEAKER_09]: I had an issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: My business didn't do as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Should I then be able to roll that money
into next time?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there any flexibility in the licensing
both as a benefit or a penalty to run a
[SPEAKER_09]: business that you have to forecast out an
entire year of your operation in a space
[SPEAKER_09]: that is unknown and evolving without any
flexibility?
[SPEAKER_13]: That's a hardship for a business.
[SPEAKER_13]: The companies that the delivery and things
like this are trying to phase out is does
[SPEAKER_13]: it sometimes feel as it does to me and I'm
sure other people is that this is a pay to
[SPEAKER_13]: play industry right now is that we went
from unregulated for 20 years and now we
[SPEAKER_13]: are hyper regulated and they are pushing
out the people that have fought for not
[SPEAKER_13]: just cannabis as medicine but CBD
genetics, all of these things that we are
[SPEAKER_13]: pushing these people out so that we can
replace them with people with big money.
[SPEAKER_09]: So comment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Comment because that's a legitimate real
world affecting your bottom line as a
[SPEAKER_09]: business comment and it makes good
business sense.
[SPEAKER_09]: Nobody's saying I don't want to pay and
nobody's saying I won't let you keep my
[SPEAKER_09]: money but if you tell them within six
months or within three months of your
[SPEAKER_09]: renewal, look I got a pivot one way or the
other based on market considerations and
[SPEAKER_09]: what has happened to my business,
you're asking for something reasonable and
[SPEAKER_09]: as my mother likes to say, if the answer
is no, what's the harm in asking the
[SPEAKER_09]: question?
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's switch to white hot white
labeling disaster.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's what everybody wants to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's what.
[SPEAKER_09]: 50 32 B.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead Pamela.
[SPEAKER_13]: And we've all by the way just had a few
days to digest hundreds of pages of
[SPEAKER_13]: documents to refer back to and to go to.
[SPEAKER_13]: So please understand this is just my
perspective and you're a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to make the good old legal
disclaimer that we should have done at the
[SPEAKER_09]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_09]: I none of this advice should be used for
your own individual businesses without
[SPEAKER_09]: seeking the guidance of a knowledgeable
attorney or consultant for your particular
[SPEAKER_09]: needs.
[SPEAKER_09]: We are expressing personal opinions and
those are not to be used for your own
personal needs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to use that as an excuse.
I'm going to use that as an excuse.
[SPEAKER_09]: So thank you very much for that public
service announcement.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the change is verbatim because that may
be helpful.
[SPEAKER_09]: The licensees shall not conduct commercial
cannabis activities on behalf of at the
[SPEAKER_09]: request at or pursuant to a contract with
any person.
[SPEAKER_09]: And person also includes entity because
person under the law is both an individual
[SPEAKER_09]: and a entity as acting as a person that is
not licensed under the act the act being
[SPEAKER_09]: the M.A.
[SPEAKER_09]: U.
[SPEAKER_09]: C.
[SPEAKER_09]: R.
[SPEAKER_09]: S.
[SPEAKER_09]: A.
[SPEAKER_09]: Such prohibited commercial activities
include but are not limited to those
[SPEAKER_09]: commas are very important to the following
procuring or purchasing cannabis goods
[SPEAKER_09]: from a licensed cultivator or a licensed
manufacturer manufacturing cannabis goods
[SPEAKER_09]: according to specifications of a non
licensee.
[SPEAKER_09]: This one is particularly troubling
packaging and labeling cannabis goods
[SPEAKER_09]: under a non licensees brand or according
to the specifications of a non licensee.
[SPEAKER_09]: Again extremely troubling distributing
cannabis goods for a non cannabis licensee
[SPEAKER_09]: which is sort of tethered to or anchored
to the technology platform language in 54
[SPEAKER_09]: 14 point one.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that that is.
[SPEAKER_09]: So why is this concerning.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are we concerned about this particular
provision.
[SPEAKER_09]: For those of you who are at N.C.I.A.
[SPEAKER_09]: C.C.I.A.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thought it was very interesting that
from the regulators point of view and from
[SPEAKER_09]: Lori herself she was quite surprised at
the reaction and the negative reaction of
[SPEAKER_09]: the industry to this.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is it was the BCC's official opinion
that this was merely a clarification of
[SPEAKER_09]: existing policy.
[SPEAKER_13]: I feel that it was a clarification.
[SPEAKER_13]: In a lot of ways and as somebody who has
been a purchaser a S.O.P.
[SPEAKER_13]: writer and run dispensaries I feel like
this was a and I'm on both sides of this.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm very neutral because the fact is is
that if we did not have brands who could
[SPEAKER_13]: not get their license due to the rigidity
of the regulations they had no choice
[SPEAKER_13]: either watch their brand die or get with a
company that has a license that has
[SPEAKER_13]: ability to manufacture.
[SPEAKER_13]: But what I'm understanding from is that
you just need to have some contracts in
[SPEAKER_13]: place.
[SPEAKER_13]: What I've been seeing and I can totally
see why the state did this is we have just
[SPEAKER_13]: like in July 1st when all sudden cannabis
you can find on the market.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh it was there.
[SPEAKER_13]: It just went from legal dispensaries to
illegal outlets.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's what I feel like what's
happening here is that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_13]: with manufacturing license like oh yeah I
cultivated this because there's no metric
[SPEAKER_13]: track and trace in place.
[SPEAKER_13]: So all of a sudden this you know 5,000
square foot 10,000 square foot grow is
[SPEAKER_13]: pumping shit tons of cannabis into the
market.
[SPEAKER_13]: However it is meeting the needs and then
providing tax dollars to that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not judging anybody that's not my job.
[SPEAKER_13]: I do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this may have been a clarification but
the fact that it was coupled with new
[SPEAKER_05]: language requiring disclosure of ownership
and that's what happens whenever you do
[SPEAKER_13]: this illegal stuff.
[SPEAKER_13]: It makes a bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't get nice things when one person
does something wrong.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of you have heard me speak before.
[SPEAKER_09]: I say that a lot because it is very true.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why we can have nice things.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you made a very good point right.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's for those operators that could not
find a home that tried.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you know what this regulation is based
off of is the egregious behavior of those
[SPEAKER_09]: who had the war chest and the money and
the time and the knowledge to go out and
[SPEAKER_09]: get a license and instead didn't and kept
walking and acting and being like a duck
[SPEAKER_09]: and saying that they were overtly having a
brand and having a license and go buy my
[SPEAKER_09]: products.
[SPEAKER_09]: They weren't your products anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were products where you licensed your
brand name to another licensee and they
[SPEAKER_09]: became a house of brands.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then aren't you technically at that point
in time just a marketing company.
[SPEAKER_09]: You should be but they did not hold
themselves out to be.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think we all in this room can think of a
few brands that if you looked up whether
[SPEAKER_09]: they had a license and when you read the
ice or you read the statement of reasons
[SPEAKER_09]: as to why the BCC did this.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are hallmarks in there.
[SPEAKER_09]: We see people acting out of school.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you from your point of view it's very
true.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got to look at it from both sides of
the issue.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are they trying to prevent and what
are people doing coupled with what
[SPEAKER_09]: happened with the Department of Public
Health regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have zero localities that have issued a
type S license a type S license.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anybody know what that is.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is anybody concerned about that to talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay a type S license is a shared facility
a shared manufacturing facility.
[SPEAKER_09]: Interestingly enough though it was written
that you have to have a share a user
[SPEAKER_09]: agreement.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you have to have an agreement.
[SPEAKER_09]: The locality has to expressly allow the
type S facility and then the landlord
[SPEAKER_09]: needs to be involved in that too because
you're now using your business for
[SPEAKER_09]: multiple operators.
[SPEAKER_09]: But each operator in that scenario goes
and gets a permit.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's interesting about that and shows
the clear indication that the agencies
[SPEAKER_09]: don't understand the true cost of doing
business in this space and it's pay to
[SPEAKER_09]: play is that they and by their sheer
amount of grace did DPH do this.
[SPEAKER_09]: They originally said that you could only
make half a million dollars in profits and
[SPEAKER_09]: that's all you could make is a type S
licensee.
[SPEAKER_09]: They upped it to a million dollars isn't
that nice of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And by their statement of reasons as to
why they did that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because if you made a million dollars
you should be able to go out and get your
[SPEAKER_09]: own license.
[SPEAKER_13]: And let's just for clarity on this one
since they're a cannabis business they may
[SPEAKER_13]: have done a million dollars but had nine
hundred and ninety nine thousand dollars
[SPEAKER_13]: worth of overhead and they could not write
that off.
[SPEAKER_13]: So they can't show that they have a
thousand dollars worth of profit they have
[SPEAKER_13]: a million dollars.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think it's important to know that
every single thing that you're wearing
[SPEAKER_13]: every single thing that you have at your
home was done by a manufacturer that was
[SPEAKER_13]: probably a licensing agreement and that
the cannabis industry is just learning how
[SPEAKER_13]: to survive while also paying 100 percent
of tax with zero write off.
[SPEAKER_09]: And wants to be a business and Laurie
herself said I want to help you operate
[SPEAKER_09]: your businesses.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know how you help operate our
businesses as a collective industry
[SPEAKER_09]: allowing us to take advantage of the
business practices that are available to
[SPEAKER_09]: us and white labeling private labeling.
[SPEAKER_09]: Licensing agreements these are traditional
cornerstones of any commodity marketplace.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about some of the solutions
that you and I know that people are
[SPEAKER_05]: debating right now and some that are being
advised by attorneys.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because I think that's what everyone
is most concerned about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I do want you guys to know that like
the smartest people I know are working on
[SPEAKER_05]: this and have you know proposed solutions
that they're vetting amongst each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're doing our everything that we can
do to try to find a path to make you know
[SPEAKER_05]: white labeling still a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you are white labeling and you're
touching the product and you're not
[SPEAKER_05]: licensed it's an issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're just leasing your genetics and
your plan and your recipe to someone who
[SPEAKER_05]: is producing that product for you that we
can get we can fix.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can make sure that that can still
happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm pretty sure anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I mean we're hearing that there might
be another draft after this public comment
[SPEAKER_05]: period expires.
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know if that's true.
[SPEAKER_05]: If there's not then there might not be a
pathway to fix this other than through
[SPEAKER_05]: state lobbying.
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now we're really focused on
trying to fix this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Pamela do you want to give them some
of the solutions that you've heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can read Max's.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a plethora of solutions all the
way from redrafting and reorganizing your
[SPEAKER_09]: agreements such that specifications write
that language.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't want to specify.
[SPEAKER_09]: We want to give options at the election of
the manufacturer to take that really on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you own a piece of the licensee.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you like do we tie these agreements to
if you are an owner or a financial
[SPEAKER_09]: interest holder.
[SPEAKER_09]: And those have been I think imploded to
expose to include almost anybody in
[SPEAKER_09]: anything fits into one of those two
categories.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if we simply tack on unless you are
considered an owner or a financial
[SPEAKER_09]: interest holder then you would be able to
do these things as long as the agreements
[SPEAKER_09]: were in place.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that to me makes sense because if
you enjoy the rights and responsibilities
[SPEAKER_09]: but you are also then incurring the
liabilities and the consequences of those
[SPEAKER_09]: actions if somebody's actions can cost you
your license then they are in effect part
[SPEAKER_09]: of that license.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that would be licensees conducting
business together or internally through
[SPEAKER_09]: one license act that would get you out of
that contract.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you go about having your IP in a
separate multiple entity structure which
[SPEAKER_09]: we've always done for 280 protection and
also so that you can license that back to
[SPEAKER_09]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to have to define those
differently with different classes and
[SPEAKER_09]: options.
[SPEAKER_09]: And is that really a function that works
for your business.
[SPEAKER_09]: That all you also have to think about if
you are purely a licensing company or a
[SPEAKER_09]: company that says we are not plant
touching.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you expose yourself to being an owner
if you were to do something where you were
[SPEAKER_09]: a branding entity and we've heard going
out and getting other licenses think about
[SPEAKER_09]: what that means.
[SPEAKER_09]: Once you are in fact a licensee that you
say I am an owner or a financial interest
[SPEAKER_09]: holder.
[SPEAKER_09]: What does that do to your business.
[SPEAKER_09]: What does that do to financing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And money that you've taken in under the
color of not being having to go through
[SPEAKER_09]: these disclosure requirements.
[SPEAKER_09]: So a lot of it's going to come down to and
unfortunately I'm going to do the cagey
[SPEAKER_09]: lawyer thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those individual nuanced contracts of how
you maneuver through this language and
[SPEAKER_09]: creatively carve yourselves out of what is
a very expansive definition of white
[SPEAKER_09]: labeling or entering into quasi commercial
cannabis activity I would call it into the
[SPEAKER_09]: gray area.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know that a lot of people are talking
about potentially proposing a new license
[SPEAKER_05]: type for a non plant touching you know
just administrative easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: It would be the it would be a simple
solution but we would have you know a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of departments debating that and then the
cost of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I mean because that's what they do in
the liquor industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that another attorney I know is
advising some of her clients to become
[SPEAKER_05]: have the licensee become an employee of
the white label or and and figuring out a
[SPEAKER_05]: contract with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you if you're in this industry and you
think that you're going to be able to do
[SPEAKER_05]: this by yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not you're going to have
consultants and attorneys on your team for
[SPEAKER_05]: the longevity of your brand because your
brand is going to depend on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Max who I is who I work with came up
with this solution.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_09]: You read it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what we're just talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well I just kind of give like a few
different answers because I don't think
[SPEAKER_05]: that there's a one size fits all solution
to this problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got IP people that Colorado brands
out of state brands and definitely being
[SPEAKER_05]: affected by this.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you have legacy operators being
affected by this.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have people that are touching the
plant that are trying to hide out and not
[SPEAKER_05]: get licensed that are being affected by
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe that's you know a good thing a
bad thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we need solutions for all of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there isn't going to be one thing that
the bureau can come up with.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah they're just talking about Max's
solution.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Be real cognizant of what is a
specification and how much direction you
[SPEAKER_09]: are giving.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think if you contract and say at the end
of the day the manufacturer has any and
[SPEAKER_09]: all rights to ensure compliance.
[SPEAKER_09]: There may be some flexibility there
because they're really looking at who is
[SPEAKER_09]: controlling.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you acting on their behalf or you're
putting that out into the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then also you know it always comes
down to where is the money.
[SPEAKER_09]: Follow the money.
[SPEAKER_09]: How is the money being taken in.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why is the money being taken in.
[SPEAKER_09]: For what reason.
[SPEAKER_09]: How you're drafting those terms.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a very difficult thing for
those that are the non cannabis touching
[SPEAKER_09]: part of this equation.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're really flipping the script.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which is what I find to be most
interesting if I'm looking at it from a 50
[SPEAKER_09]: thousand foot level.
[SPEAKER_09]: Most of the time the non cannabis plant
touching businesses are in the driver's
[SPEAKER_09]: seat.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have more flexibility.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have more maneuverability.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have more impact on creating what
that cost is between the discussion
[SPEAKER_09]: points.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're taking my brand.
[SPEAKER_09]: My brand has a name.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm taking a risk.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're producing for me.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you flip that around and say you the
licensee can't act on your behalf that
[SPEAKER_09]: they can't be given your specifications.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to see a different discourse
in negotiations because now the licensees
[SPEAKER_09]: are in the driver's seat to say well how
are we going to put this together because
[SPEAKER_09]: now I'm taking more of the risk.
[SPEAKER_09]: My license is on the line.
[SPEAKER_09]: You were worried about entering into
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm worried about you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your entrance into cannabis affecting my
license.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you're going to see different
conversations starting to emerge.
[SPEAKER_13]: And something I would like to remind
people of is that many of us that are
[SPEAKER_13]: newer into the industry are but this is an
industry that was founded on innovation
[SPEAKER_13]: and surviving.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that we are here to to continue this
and that if you don't know what to do then
[SPEAKER_13]: ask for help.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you know what to do give help.
[SPEAKER_05]: Join my Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_05]: California City and County Regulation
Watch.
[SPEAKER_09]: Don't hold the answers to yourself either.
[SPEAKER_09]: High tides raise all ships.
[SPEAKER_09]: We all want to survive.
[SPEAKER_09]: This industry is big enough for everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was a collective good to be here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We stand on the shoulders of those that
went to jail so that we can sit up here
[SPEAKER_13]: and talk about this for the people that
have died because they couldn't have
[SPEAKER_13]: access to it and are continuing to die
because they do not have access to it.
[SPEAKER_13]: So when you feel like you can't do it
anymore remember how blessed you are.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the last one we wanted to talk about
front which was a request from the
[SPEAKER_05]: audience is testing and phase three it's
still on.
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes into effect December 31st which is
going to require detection of heavy
[SPEAKER_05]: metals.
[SPEAKER_05]: They did push back on the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would have preferred to have terpenes
instead of heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I this is my most concerning issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been my most concerning issue since I
saw how severe the product shortage issue
[SPEAKER_05]: caused like dispensary shells to be dry
after July 1st.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am terrified of the phase three heavy
metals going into effect for multiple
[SPEAKER_05]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the first reason being that there are
only I know of two licensed labs in the
[SPEAKER_05]: state that are conducting R&D for phase
three right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we need way more than that to just get
the process going.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's concerning that we don't know
what's going to fail.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now if you're growing indoors and
that wood that is on the floor is treated
[SPEAKER_05]: with a chemical that chemical could be
causing your product to test positive for
[SPEAKER_05]: heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or your vapor pens.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or the glass jars.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're seeing glass jars fail that are
coming in from China.
[SPEAKER_05]: The product is not failing but the glass
jars are seeping into the product and
[SPEAKER_05]: that's causing failures now.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not causing failures down the road.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's failing.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you are sourcing products that have
heavy metals in them even though your
[SPEAKER_13]: product does not you are failing as
somebody who's fighting for consumer
[SPEAKER_13]: rights.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you should know your shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the hard part about this one is that
this isn't a part of the public comment
process.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this isn't something that we can submit
to the state and ask them to fix.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is something that is a date that they
chose to implement these new guidelines.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it may take a legislative fix but
we have to wait for a new governor to come
[SPEAKER_05]: in and we have to wait for a new session
to start.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that will be after the fact.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this one is definitely the one that's
going to continue to keep me up at night.
[SPEAKER_09]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to take some questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice work up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Adam from Kiva.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another question about testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: My request from the audience to talk about
testing was part of the comment period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something that came through that we
noticed that affects us quite a bit is
[SPEAKER_03]: plus or minus 10 percent THC and CBD
variants.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in this round they put something else
in there that said that no way no how can
[SPEAKER_03]: anything be over a hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was curious if you guys know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you guys read that in the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you guys have any idea why they
would have put that in because that'll
[SPEAKER_03]: cause most brands particularly edibles to
so reformulate down plus or minus 10
[SPEAKER_13]: percent unless it's plus 10 percent
ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_09]: To me that was them trying to do another
point of clarification.
[SPEAKER_09]: You were never supposed to have anything
over a hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if it's plus plus or minus 10 plus or
minus 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well I've seen this on COAs.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's not confusing though because
botanical medicine is regularly plus or
[SPEAKER_13]: minus 15 percent.
[SPEAKER_13]: Right.
[SPEAKER_13]: And let me remind you that we are
botanical medicine and that the only way
[SPEAKER_13]: to dial in plus or minus 10 percent when
you're dealing with 2.5 percent milligrams
[SPEAKER_13]: is when you're dealing with isolates.
[SPEAKER_13]: And isolates are truly just that.
[SPEAKER_13]: They are isolating one chemical out of the
hundreds if not thousands because we do
[SPEAKER_13]: not have the research yet of that the
cannabis plant produces that helps
[SPEAKER_13]: regulate your endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I think that's a wonderful thing that
we know what section that is to deal with.
[SPEAKER_09]: And goes back to your point of technically
writing something that they do not
[SPEAKER_09]: understand because I don't think it's
confusing for us.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it was very confusing for the
agency to interpret their mandate of where
[SPEAKER_09]: those criteria in limits existed.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we're seeing the reverberation
of them attempting to understand an area
[SPEAKER_09]: where they are not scientists but are yet
putting a scientific impact there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in order to comment on it talking to
somebody like Brad clearly understands
[SPEAKER_09]: what that is.
[SPEAKER_09]: But like putting that data in so that they
can make a better decision based on the
[SPEAKER_09]: information because what they don't know
they're going to regulate they're going to
[SPEAKER_09]: regulate in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that's what really happened
with that section.
[SPEAKER_13]: And another way is I feel like what we're
dealing here is a symptom of a bigger
[SPEAKER_13]: problem here is that we are not having
community subject matter experts
[SPEAKER_13]: recommending legislation and people that
are not being paid for by cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: committees themselves.
[SPEAKER_13]: So we have our own lobbyists but the other
lobbyists there we need to have legit
[SPEAKER_13]: concerned citizens who have no stake in
the plus or minus of whoever's industry
[SPEAKER_13]: just giving the honest feedback of what
they need.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I feel like this is a situation here
where they're making regulations that they
[SPEAKER_13]: don't understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the next question from a brand IP
owner.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hi there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thanks Peter for hosting.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you all for spending your time with
us tonight.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is a question regarding white label
and you obviously gave a nice overview but
[SPEAKER_11]: it's a little bit more specific.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm the owner of a cannabis brand that is
working to be in market.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have two partners one a manufacturer
with a license one a distributor with a
[SPEAKER_11]: license.
[SPEAKER_11]: We do not have a license.
[SPEAKER_11]: So based on kind of what you read on five
oh three two and that new language there's
[SPEAKER_11]: kind of concern on and we're not planning
on touching plant or anything but what
[SPEAKER_11]: would be your advice on kind of moving
through these new regulations.
[SPEAKER_11]: We've heard I have had received already
some feedback on it but again I think as
[SPEAKER_11]: you said it's people are still discussing
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I don't know if you had any specific
feedback for people in that arena.
[SPEAKER_13]: So just so I can clarify on your sentence
here you said you have two partners one
[SPEAKER_13]: has a manufacturing license one has a
distribution license.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_13]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: You are not licensed holders.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what do you as far as we it sounds like
when you say talking about partnerships
[SPEAKER_13]: here is that we have a manufacturing
license and we have a distribution
[SPEAKER_13]: license.
[SPEAKER_13]: Or is it I don't have that and they do.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't and they do.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's where the clarity needs to
happen.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's what the state is asking from my
understanding is that they're asking that
[SPEAKER_13]: if you're going to state we have a
manufacturing then we have a distribution
[SPEAKER_13]: license then we are on a contract together
and all they're asking for is a contract
[SPEAKER_13]: here to understand where funds are going.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if you're doing this to get out of
paying the tax situation we all understand
[SPEAKER_13]: it.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that's the pay to play portion here is
what they're asking for.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so in my opinion from my understanding
of not sleeping for the past week I would
[SPEAKER_13]: say that's what I'm implying.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now I would have to understand more the
dynamics of what you're doing and how
[SPEAKER_09]: exactly you are interfacing with that
manufacturer and that distributor.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: What you know what are you actually
telling them what money is coming to you.
[SPEAKER_09]: What how are those interplay.
[SPEAKER_09]: How are you interplaying in all of those
sectors.
[SPEAKER_09]: What are the Venn diagram.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where do you overlap in control and
management and dictation.
[SPEAKER_09]: And again that word specification.
[SPEAKER_09]: How how entrenched are you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so those are those are the devil in
the details.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I will tell you that none of us up
here can give you a blanketed answer.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have partner.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm working with other people.
[SPEAKER_11]: One of them has a manufacturing license.
[SPEAKER_11]: Another one has a distribution.
[SPEAKER_11]: We my brand does not and not because of
not wanting to.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy to know anything.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm happy to.
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to be regulated.
[SPEAKER_11]: We want to pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_11]: We want it set up correctly.
[SPEAKER_11]: But there's just a lot of unclarity on.
[SPEAKER_11]: We thought we were.
[SPEAKER_11]: I thought I was clear.
[SPEAKER_11]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Up until you're exchanging money between
these three entities yourself and your
[SPEAKER_05]: manufacturer and your distributor.
[SPEAKER_09]: And how much control do you have over your
brand.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: At the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's going to be your that's going to be
your concern point.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are the vehicle where you are
saying manufacturer acts use this hardware
[SPEAKER_09]: correct this specification use these
formulas do it this way.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is my brand.
[SPEAKER_09]: All the way down to the font on the box of
how you're going to do this.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is where the BCC is exerting concern.
[SPEAKER_09]: At what point are you then functioning in
the shoes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of that licensee.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so how you articulate those terms in a
contract.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's where you're going to start to see
this ingenuity creativity innovation.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what the situation may ultimately
demand.
[SPEAKER_09]: I am very hopeful that we see guidance on
this because of the reaction at NCIA where
[SPEAKER_09]: they were so surprised.
[SPEAKER_09]: It seemed like the industry was having an
outcry and maybe not totally understanding
[SPEAKER_09]: where the regulators were.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I am hopeful.
[SPEAKER_09]: That we will see something come out that
we can comment on.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that they realize this is an area
where we do have legal representation.
[SPEAKER_11]: And obviously this has never come up
prior.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well I think the government.
[SPEAKER_09]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: The government really an issue.
[SPEAKER_13]: They realize that this is an area where
we're hemorrhaging money.
[SPEAKER_13]: There's no tax documents that are showing
where money that is being paid to you or
[SPEAKER_13]: vice versa is going.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's ending into this abyss of taxes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Money is missing here and they need to
know where the money is going.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again consult with your attorney.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't necessarily take this advice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because it wasn't directed for your
business.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you've already worked out the
monetary agreements between your
[SPEAKER_05]: manufacturer and your distributor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you've been doing this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then what would prevent you from being an
employee of those two companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that you could.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not always the employee.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's the brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's how you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be the simplest way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now without any waiting on a
regulatory solution.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not if his company is still being paid.
[SPEAKER_09]: He may be an employee so that he can go in
there and do the business.
[SPEAKER_10]: To that extent.
[SPEAKER_10]: To that extent.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nope.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's say his brand brings in 15 percent
of the sales of that distributor of that
[SPEAKER_10]: of that manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's to stop.
[SPEAKER_10]: His company his brand.
[SPEAKER_10]: Being a 15 percent stakeholder in that
company variable only to the sales
[SPEAKER_10]: associated with that brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've said that and then and
distributors don't like that response.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most companies don't like that response.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't want to be forced to take on an
equity owner even though you know they're
[SPEAKER_10]: not they're not forced.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have an option not to.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how they feel right this second.
[SPEAKER_13]: And watch their brand die.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh you don't you totally don't have to
sign over any equity.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah you don't have to do anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is where I worry that big companies
that are big manufacturers and
[SPEAKER_13]: distributors may have lobbied behind some
of this legislation right now because
[SPEAKER_13]: we're still all very much are digesting
this and we could totally be wrong about
[SPEAKER_13]: so many of these things because it's been
a minute.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean this is this is a structure that
exists in lots of places.
[SPEAKER_10]: Film production companies that have
directors that are DG.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I come from a background of that.
[SPEAKER_10]: They have a portion of that company that
is variable to the money that they bring
[SPEAKER_10]: into that company.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they don't get 15 percent from total
gross sales.
[SPEAKER_10]: They get 15 percent of the of what that
brand brings in as a proportion of
[SPEAKER_10]: ownership to that company because it's
less than 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't even think you have to file
financials with the BCC or the city of Los
[SPEAKER_10]: Angeles.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well if it's less than 20 percent that's
your trigger.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was your old trigger for ownership.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we want to look at ownership in 50
0 3 and financial interest in 50 0 4 as it
[SPEAKER_09]: stands currently in the in the presented
re drafted permanent regulations if he if
[SPEAKER_09]: that brand even if they're only taking 15
percent of the variable if they are then
[SPEAKER_09]: giving the specifications for how that
product is being made or branding and
[SPEAKER_09]: they're giving branding direction even non
cannabis branding direction we can look at
[SPEAKER_09]: the definition of the owner.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can read it verbatim.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're you're an owner.
[SPEAKER_09]: Doesn't matter if you have 20 percent or
more.
[SPEAKER_09]: No I get that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But as but as a less than 20 percent owner
you don't even have to file.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just changed.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just changed.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm telling you right now you're an owner
the same as you would be as a 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you are it's easier.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's read it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there is there a minimum percentage
because it used to be 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: No it's now it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're now an owner if you are controlling
a brand if you are making executive
[SPEAKER_05]: decisions if you are negotiating the
wholesale price of of you know cannabis in
[SPEAKER_05]: some way.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Pamela's going to read the exact
language.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically what they're doing is in and we
witnessed the same thing in Colorado is
[SPEAKER_05]: they're going to continue digging until
they find where is the money where is the
[SPEAKER_05]: money going who are the owners.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we think the state's actually
a little bit smarter than we gave them
[SPEAKER_05]: credit for and saw all these shell
companies and oh we'll just form a
[SPEAKER_05]: management company.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well they want to know who the owners are
in that management company now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they want to know everyone that's
making an executive decision.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So anybody even has a one percent interest
in the company has to file.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going to tell you right now it has
nothing to do with percentages.
[SPEAKER_09]: I need you to lose the idea that ownership
is tied to the percentage of an owned
[SPEAKER_09]: company.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now it's not that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you Peter.
[SPEAKER_09]: Even sick.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not that they got.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean they did get smarter.
[SPEAKER_09]: Part of your annual application submission
package is providing your operating
[SPEAKER_09]: agreement.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you are wholly owned by another
company and the bureau uses multi layered
[SPEAKER_09]: company that's the language they use.
[SPEAKER_09]: They saw that you may have said that the
lower entity was a manager.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if you're 100 percent owned then all
those people have ownership in your
[SPEAKER_09]: business.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you look at five zero zero three
owner means any of the following a person
[SPEAKER_09]: with the aggregate ownership of 20 percent
or more in the person applying for the
[SPEAKER_09]: license.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have 100 percent you own 100
percent of the underlying holding entity
[SPEAKER_09]: that is 20 percent in the aggregate that
higher up entity owner the chief executive
[SPEAKER_09]: officer or of a nonprofit or other entity
a board member of the direct directors of
[SPEAKER_09]: a nonprofit the trustee and all persons
who have control of the trust and the
[SPEAKER_09]: commercial cannabis business that the
trust is held an individual entitled to a
[SPEAKER_09]: share of at least 20 percent of the
profits of a commercial cannabis business
[SPEAKER_09]: an individual who will be participating.
[SPEAKER_09]: And here's where it gets real fun in the
direction control or management of the
[SPEAKER_09]: person the business applying for a
license.
[SPEAKER_09]: Such individuals include any of the
following a general partner of a
[SPEAKER_09]: commercial cannabis business that is
organized as a partnership a non member
[SPEAKER_09]: manager or member managing member of a
commercial cannabis business as an LLC an
[SPEAKER_09]: officer a director of a commercial
cannabis business that is organized as a
[SPEAKER_09]: corporation any individual who who assumes
responsibility for a license.
[SPEAKER_09]: Such an individual includes but is not
limited to any individual who is managing
[SPEAKER_09]: or directing the commercial cannabis
business in exchange for a portion of the
[SPEAKER_09]: profits.
[SPEAKER_09]: That means any an individual who assumes
responsibility for the debts of a
[SPEAKER_09]: commercial cannabis business an individual
who is determining how a portion of the
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis business is run including a non
plant touching portions of the commercial
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis business such as a branding or
marketing any individual who is
[SPEAKER_09]: determining what cannabis goods the
commercial cannabis will cultivate
[SPEAKER_09]: manufacture distribute purchase or sale.
[SPEAKER_09]: So now you're purchasing manager your
cultivation consultant when an entity is
[SPEAKER_09]: an owner in a commercial cannabis business
all entities and individuals with a
[SPEAKER_09]: financial interest in the entity shall be
disclosed to the bureau and may be
[SPEAKER_09]: considered owners in the cannabis
business.
[SPEAKER_09]: For example this includes all entities in
a multi layered business structure as well
[SPEAKER_09]: as the CEO the members of the board
partners trustees and all persons that
[SPEAKER_09]: have control and a managing member or non
managing members of the entity each entity
[SPEAKER_09]: disclosed as having a financial interest
must disclose the entities of all persons
[SPEAKER_09]: holding financial interest until only
individuals remain.
[SPEAKER_05]: They want to know everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep and that was the definition of owner
and then we also had language change in
[SPEAKER_05]: the definition of financial interest.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got a WTF on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: This part actually kind of makes me smile.
[SPEAKER_05]: No no the financial this part makes me
smile because I've witnessed a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: landlords really taking advantage of the
cannabis industry so the bureau would like
[SPEAKER_05]: to know now if a landlord has entered into
a lease agreement with the commercial
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis business for a share of the
profits.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now mind you it says to receive a portion
of the profits but also but includes but
[SPEAKER_09]: not is limited to the following meeting if
you thought you could get out of profits
[SPEAKER_09]: and only have gross revenue because most
cannabis businesses don't have profits
[SPEAKER_09]: with 280 when you get to the including but
not limited to language they'll get there.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's not going to be a hide the bomb.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then financial interests language in
5004 also they would like to know who if
[SPEAKER_05]: an employee is receiving profit sharing
they want to know if the consultant is
[SPEAKER_05]: receiving profit sharing they want to know
if your attorney your CPA anyone in the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis business but also really there's
been such you know noise about the white
[SPEAKER_05]: labeling thing that I think that I don't
even think that brokers realize that they
[SPEAKER_05]: got swept up in this and that is also
under the new disclosure for financial
[SPEAKER_05]: interests is a salesperson who earns a
commission.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically they want to know where the
money is guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: I see a question.
[SPEAKER_09]: I killed some dreams I'm sorry.
I know.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hi panel you make me very joyful so don't
worry about it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you for all your help.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have kind of an odd question but in the
spirit of being disruptive you know some
[SPEAKER_12]: some people have suggested to me that it
may be possible for non licensed cannabis
[SPEAKER_12]: entities to gift or give away free
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry what now.
[SPEAKER_05]: No more free.
[SPEAKER_05]: No more free.
[SPEAKER_05]: No more violent free.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop saying the word free.
[SPEAKER_13]: You as a private individual whatever you
so deem to as long as you do it in the
[SPEAKER_13]: state of California don't step outside of
this and I'm not your lawyer.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm not a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_13]: That seems possible.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well as an individual yeah but I'm asking
as a non licensed entity like a company
[SPEAKER_12]: say a marketing company that was trying to
get around regulations to get consumer
[SPEAKER_12]: cannabis products to consumers and try to
give them what is it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So are you talking about like the Emmy bag
situation.
[SPEAKER_12]: Yes kind of.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to say give boxes give bags that
things like one bad actor can cause a
[SPEAKER_09]: firestorm.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are things like to be clear it's not
me.
[SPEAKER_09]: No I know.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are asking for honestly crawl before
you can walk walk before you can run.
[SPEAKER_09]: Learn how to run before you run a
marathon.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is really where we're at.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately in disruption works good and
bad both ways.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've had this events pop up culture that
has occurred where if it's on non if it's
[SPEAKER_09]: on private land all of a sudden because
metrics not their vendors are showing up
[SPEAKER_09]: manufacturers are showing up with product
that's never gone through a distributor or
[SPEAKER_09]: a retailer and is getting to consumers
because you know it's not at a licensed
[SPEAKER_09]: event.
[SPEAKER_09]: No if you are a individual and you go into
a dispensary and buy your allotted amount
[SPEAKER_09]: and then you want to go and give it away
to any you know over 21 year old not on
[SPEAKER_09]: Yosemite federal land but square in the
rights of California.
[SPEAKER_09]: You go right ahead and do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you start then advancing that you are
marketing this material and you're giving
[SPEAKER_09]: it away and a consumer because remember I
think it's important that we discuss where
[SPEAKER_09]: who is the BCC housed under the Bureau of
Cannabis Control does not exist as an
[SPEAKER_09]: entity onto itself as a state agency.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is housed under another state agency
and that is the Department of Consumer
[SPEAKER_09]: Affairs.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Department of Consumer Affairs mission
is to protect the citizens of California
[SPEAKER_09]: from fraud from misleading marketing and
advertising material.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you are trying to advance something
that could be construed by consumer that
[SPEAKER_09]: it's coming from you and you're advancing
that and not from the licensee that's what
[SPEAKER_09]: they're there to prevent and to protect
and it's important to understand that
[SPEAKER_09]: that's the lens that's coloring a lot of
this regulation and if you start to
[SPEAKER_09]: confuse the consumer we saw it with the
alcohol in cannabis we're seeing it with
[SPEAKER_09]: the tech platforms that are out there
saying I'm gonna deliver you the product I
[SPEAKER_09]: don't have to say the name but if you were
to ask away in the general ordinary course
[SPEAKER_09]: outside of people that know cannabis if ex
delivery service brings you their cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's their cannabis that they're
bringing you I would argue that four times
[SPEAKER_09]: out of five they're gonna say that that
company that brought it to me that's their
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis and that is the exact scenario
that is concerning to the BCC.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome thank you yeah I think we have one
more question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a follow-up question to the gifting
and free and we shouldn't use those words
[SPEAKER_03]: and I have another and when I'm done with
this question I'd love to hear you guys
[SPEAKER_03]: take on CRP but the question is around
free and it is a bit of a limitation when
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturers brands distribute
distributors can't somehow give product to
[SPEAKER_03]: a business partner and I'm curious what
you guys think the solve there could be
[SPEAKER_03]: and when I say business partner I mean if
you launch a new item and a buyer at a
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary wants to try it before they
decide to shelve it or the press wants to
[SPEAKER_03]: write an article about the new product but
you can't give it to them or an influencer
[SPEAKER_03]: wants to write a review but they want to
try the product before those are all
[SPEAKER_03]: limitations and I would call those
business partners and I'm curious what you
[SPEAKER_09]: guys think we could do to use some of that
it breaks my little heart that we all
[SPEAKER_09]: submitted so many comments about the
sampling issue and it just fell a little
[SPEAKER_09]: bit on deaf ears at the BCC I will admit
that I when I first saw the sampling forms
[SPEAKER_09]: was super pumped and thought that they
were sampling forms for how you do a
[SPEAKER_09]: sample they are not I will I killed my own
dream when I looked they were actually for
[SPEAKER_09]: how to take a patch sample I know and I
was like oh BCC that hurts but that's the
[SPEAKER_09]: issue and there are some interesting
workarounds to that are any of them a
[SPEAKER_09]: hundred and ten percent fully compliant I
think that that's the question CDT FA says
[SPEAKER_09]: if you reduce to them below the fifty
percent there's a whole different tax
[SPEAKER_09]: regime that takes place do you do a
heavily discounted box to a dispensary
[SPEAKER_09]: that's trial that then you send the
influencers to that dispensary they get it
[SPEAKER_09]: for a significantly discounted rate they
excise taxes paid there is a way mechanism
[SPEAKER_09]: potentially to do something not for resale
and it has a different price but it still
[SPEAKER_09]: is going to have to go through all of
those channels to be able to the point of
[SPEAKER_09]: retail and then be able to do that if that
is truly if you're going to if you're
[SPEAKER_09]: going to try to chart the most compliant
way to get there it's going to be one of
[SPEAKER_09]: those really intricate ways and it's never
going to be that the manufacturer straight
[SPEAKER_09]: direct gives it to any individual other
than a distributor so let's say
[SPEAKER_02]: hypothetically Lori Ajax actually watches
this video hi Lori so since Pam is a
[SPEAKER_02]: lawyer and maybe cannot comment on this
I'm gonna Brett is very free with his
[SPEAKER_02]: verbiage totally why not so from somebody
who who has been on the retail side and on
[SPEAKER_02]: the brand side what language do you think
we could like what would you propose to
[SPEAKER_02]: the BCC as language that would allow sort
like okay we get you don't want us to give
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers free samples but in the course
of business of letting a prospective
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary try our product and decide that
they like it complicated and my personal
[SPEAKER_13]: opinion in that if distributors are able
to provide product to us and that we still
[SPEAKER_13]: remain in under three percent variance of
our inventory loss that we are able to
[SPEAKER_13]: provide out for that they're able to give
to us and it's part of like our three
[SPEAKER_13]: percent so obviously we're not using this
as sampling because three percent's not
[SPEAKER_13]: gonna sample a lot of people there and I
think as long as we stay with this three
[SPEAKER_13]: percent variance here out of just a writer
as long as is like the just the you know
[SPEAKER_13]: the distributors are able to provide us
with samples here but also at the end of
[SPEAKER_13]: the day like if I'm wanting to build
something new for my store I'm wanting to
[SPEAKER_13]: invest in my store the key word there is
invest so if I need to really take my time
[SPEAKER_13]: and realize that you know what this is a
product that I want to have in my store
[SPEAKER_13]: and then I have to buy it and I'm sorry it
just as a sample wise there if that's what
[SPEAKER_13]: we have to currently do right now I would
recommend in my personal opinion staying
[SPEAKER_13]: on the conservative side of things because
they can go back for seven years and so
[SPEAKER_13]: you may hear in six years and 350 days
mess up on something and they can go back
[SPEAKER_13]: and do a full audit of you and stuff that
we were all under this ambiguous cannabis
[SPEAKER_13]: regulation time that they can be like had
the shit out of it and if you're missing
[SPEAKER_13]: one document that they're looking for
that's thirty thousand dollars I give you
[SPEAKER_09]: a big benefit it's two it's seven years
record retention it's five years that they
[SPEAKER_09]: can enforce you so you get to but what I
like to tell people is the BCC DPH and DFA
[SPEAKER_09]: are not gonna lose their allotted
employment budget right because they're
[SPEAKER_09]: like hiring like it's going out of style
they're not gonna want to lose that budget
[SPEAKER_09]: they're not gonna want to lose those
employees know what's gonna happen in
[SPEAKER_09]: about three and a half four years when
this is with the dust has settled audits
[SPEAKER_09]: and they're gonna say I don't have to
license anybody today you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_09]: gonna do I'm gonna pick out of the pool of
people that I have just gonna pluck it out
[SPEAKER_09]: and I'm gonna say show me everything and
if I see something I don't like oh guess
[SPEAKER_09]: what I'm gonna get a gold star I've done
something today I've audited and made this
[SPEAKER_09]: department money and I think that's when
we do not think that what you do today
[SPEAKER_09]: does not have impacts on your business and
your businesses livelihood in the future I
[SPEAKER_09]: don't mean to come across sounding like my
mother but it is very true and I cannot
[SPEAKER_09]: say it enough in an error of ambiguity and
an error of well if my neighbors doing it
[SPEAKER_09]: I should be able to do it I'm not as being
as egregious as they are life is not fair
[SPEAKER_09]: and those that deserve to be punished
rarely often are and those that tried
[SPEAKER_09]: their best but faltered and thought that
nobody was gonna pay attention to them are
[SPEAKER_09]: the ones that are gonna be made the
example of so I implore you to treat your
[SPEAKER_09]: business today as if they are scrutinizing
you and you have to meet the letter of the
[SPEAKER_09]: law it is just going to be it's gonna be
an extinction event in five years at the
[SPEAKER_09]: same level as it is today and the new
players are gonna benefit because they
[SPEAKER_09]: don't know any other way to operate and
that is an unfortunate legacy operator
[SPEAKER_09]: issue and I get it I get it it's hard to
pivot it's hard to see your bottom line
[SPEAKER_09]: numbers bottom out and you're hemorrhaging
money on compliance it's not easy but with
[SPEAKER_09]: that if you look at the rigs and you use
your creativity and if we all can
[SPEAKER_09]: collaborate together really I do believe
that the industry will survive and we can
[SPEAKER_05]: help each other and really I mean you can
give samples away you just you owe the tax
[SPEAKER_05]: liabilities on that product so huh you can
give away the product because you're
[SPEAKER_09]: paying the taxes on it you're paying the
excise taxes you still can't it's that act
[SPEAKER_09]: of giving away free product right a
giveaway a one-for-one if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: discounting it or they're doing it for a
penny they're doing it for a peppercorn
[SPEAKER_09]: look it's the law right if you see it if
it goes into metric you gotta put all this
[SPEAKER_09]: stuff in right like again the things you
do today have an impact so even if it's if
[SPEAKER_09]: it's infinitesimal it's a five cents right
plus the full excise tax then you have
[SPEAKER_09]: charged something that isn't free free
means something free means there was
[SPEAKER_09]: nothing of value exchanged free means that
you didn't charge anything and a penny is
[SPEAKER_05]: not free free is free and free can be
diversion so that's probably why they're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing away with that language but free
giveaways are still happening the
[SPEAKER_05]: companies are just responsible for the
taxes on it
[SPEAKER_09]: right but every other supply chain actor
shouldn't be giving away a product they
[SPEAKER_09]: don't they don't go B to anything they go
B to B and by B to B they mean licensee to
[SPEAKER_09]: licensee they don't mean business to
Google they mean business to cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: business the only way you get B to C C
includes customers influencers other
[SPEAKER_13]: entities retail and once we get track and
trace up and running it will answer I
[SPEAKER_13]: think a lot of these questions because if
somebody has a product that was never
[SPEAKER_13]: tracked how the hell did it get there I
don't know it'll be sometime in January
[SPEAKER_09]: when the first provisionals are or no they
could be even out six months or 90 I would
[SPEAKER_09]: say within 90 days three months of the new
year you're gonna really start to see
[SPEAKER_09]: provisionals and they're gonna come the
same way that the original temporaries
[SPEAKER_09]: came in batches right because they got to
get people going so the first people they
[SPEAKER_09]: get these extensions that expire sometime
in the new year that's gonna be your your
[SPEAKER_09]: pivot point once you start seeing your
temporaries expire in 2019 let's talk
[SPEAKER_09]: about child-resistant packaging which one
July 1 July 2020 or January 2020 where did
[SPEAKER_05]: we settle where did we settle because we
have it shifting Stan yeah I mean we we
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted to go well some people wanted to go
and get away with the do away with the
[SPEAKER_05]: exit bags and revert back to child
resistant packaging at the product level
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think that the state came up with a
pretty good combination of the two and
[SPEAKER_05]: they also gave us a grace period they're
giving us until 2020 to come into
[SPEAKER_05]: compliance with that so we shouldn't have
child-resistant packaging on flour because
[SPEAKER_09]: the child can't ingest flour and get high
right you go and pick out apples they're
[SPEAKER_09]: not prepackaged and child-resistant you
can see them if there's track and trace
[SPEAKER_09]: what is the difference of bringing in a
pound of cannabis measuring it out so
[SPEAKER_13]: people can see it because there's usually
quite a bit of loss on that one too I mean
[SPEAKER_13]: as I've done both sides of it I've done
where you're gonna have more than 3% loss
[SPEAKER_13]: on a pound of flour that's gonna come in
from a distributor if you take the pound
[SPEAKER_13]: you're gonna have more than 3% with stems
and everything on there touching all the
[SPEAKER_09]: Keith it's difficult I find
child-resistant packaging to be very
[SPEAKER_09]: difficult to bring in so I think it's
interesting to see how they've delineated
[SPEAKER_09]: all of the different uses like you have to
be CR for the life of the product or you
[SPEAKER_09]: have to individually wrap what a hundred
like 50 minutes I feel like I would like
[SPEAKER_13]: to follow the money here like they're
doing with us and follow the packaging and
[SPEAKER_13]: the plastic companies that are required
that are definitely wanting to fund this
[SPEAKER_13]: right now the people that are lobbying for
this on the other side of the spectrum
[SPEAKER_13]: just as much as we're lobbying as well
other people are lobbying for their
[SPEAKER_13]: livelihood we just happen to be doing it
for you know something that helps people
[SPEAKER_13]: yeah you know but I think the CRP
packaging is ridiculous and I think that
[SPEAKER_13]: they changing it right now is also
ridiculous that throwing it back on the
[SPEAKER_13]: retailer side who cannot be tapped any
more they may have not been responsible
[SPEAKER_13]: and put money aside for a rainy day and
we're sitting in a hurricane right now but
[SPEAKER_13]: retailers really can't take much more of a
hit at this point in time with excise tax
[SPEAKER_13]: taking a huge chunk of what's going on and
trying to catch up with compliance I think
[SPEAKER_13]: the whole CRP thing is ridiculous and a
waste of packaging if we're gonna bitch
[SPEAKER_13]: about straws and our sodas and stuff that
we're getting here environmentally
[SPEAKER_09]: egregious as an environmental attorney I
am offended we live in a state that has a
[SPEAKER_09]: banned the goddamn plastic bag right like
give me a break when you look at how these
[SPEAKER_09]: things are packaged it is it's terrible we
you an alcohol bottle that will kill you
[SPEAKER_09]: dead before any marijuana ever will does
not have a child-resistant top it is
[SPEAKER_09]: tamper-evident and that is about it it may
be child-resistant while it is at the
[SPEAKER_09]: store and that is not to protect from
children it is to protect from sneaky
[SPEAKER_09]: adults who want to drink it while they're
in the store okay so we have eight minutes
[SPEAKER_02]: left and what I would love to hear is
either from panelists for the yeah I want
[SPEAKER_02]: more ranting panelists or the audience in
specific license categories what's one
[SPEAKER_02]: recommendation that you want to make to
the BCC that directly relates to your you
[SPEAKER_02]: know I'm a delivery company I'm a
manufacturer I'm a dispensary slash retail
[SPEAKER_02]: so anyone want to you're a brand you're a
slash manufacturer so what do you want to
[SPEAKER_03]: say to the BCC let's say they should this
year that's most important to us as a
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturer Kiva today and what we saw in
the regulations is these testing
[SPEAKER_03]: requirements and to not be to be capped at
a hundred milligrams and nothing over like
[SPEAKER_03]: you mentioned just scientifically isn't
possible that needs to be reworked and the
[SPEAKER_03]: biggest issue for us is if this goes into
place in 15 days we have three months
[SPEAKER_03]: worth of inventory that would immediately
be obsolete and we couldn't relabel we
[SPEAKER_05]: couldn't use so are you saying that you
were allowed to go over it with the 10%
[SPEAKER_05]: plus or minus variance that was allowed
prior that that is has been stricken the
[SPEAKER_03]: way it reads now is it used to be a
hundred milligrams if your product was a
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred milligrams it was plus or minus
ten percent right past testing now the way
[SPEAKER_03]: that it reads is if you're gonna claim a
hundred milligrams it's only minus ten
[SPEAKER_05]: percent and so that so any of the bars
that might go over a couple percents then
[SPEAKER_03]: those are gonna have to be destroyed yeah
and that's for us a large sum of money
[SPEAKER_05]: that we have okay well we'll talk after
this because I'd like to push back on that
[SPEAKER_05]: with you we'll come up with something
[SPEAKER_00]: I did hi Karen testing labs I'd really
like to end the ambiguity between you know
[SPEAKER_00]: test getting your license in between the
temps and annuals and provisionals it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be so much better to have a clear
path on what that all means and the timing
[SPEAKER_00]: involved and everything like that we're
almost there I think okay so we just had
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturer we had testing lab how about
event organizer consumption event
[SPEAKER_02]: organizer do you have a word or two you
can spare hi I guess what I would say to
[SPEAKER_01]: the VCC about events is that you know be
flexible with the municipalities as they
[SPEAKER_01]: are working to develop their events
policies because I think that that's you
[SPEAKER_01]: know we don't know what that's really
gonna look like yet so as far as how local
[SPEAKER_01]: areas are gonna decide to create that we
want to see support in that arena I guess
[SPEAKER_02]: on the event side how about the panelists
so you guys so we've covered manufacturers
[SPEAKER_02]: we've covered events we've covered a
testing lab something you would like to
[SPEAKER_09]: say to the VCC that I appreciate the hard
work I appreciate that you listened and
[SPEAKER_09]: looked at the industry and crafted some
good improvements I would ask you to read
[SPEAKER_09]: the next set of comments you get very
critically as they are not critiques on
[SPEAKER_09]: unnecessarily your ability but they are
critiques on making sure that these
[SPEAKER_09]: businesses survive and I would ask if Lori
watched that to ring true to what she said
[SPEAKER_09]: at NCIA CCIA which I truly appreciate it
was she said I want these regulations to
[SPEAKER_09]: help you and your businesses be successful
businesses so I would ask the VCC I would
[SPEAKER_09]: empower them to truly live up to that
statement and whereas there are some bad
[SPEAKER_09]: actors there are more good actors and
don't get the good actors caught in the
[SPEAKER_09]: crosshairs give them the mechanisms
specifically with regard to the white
[SPEAKER_09]: labeling to be able to operate in a
compliant manner and the type s license
[SPEAKER_02]: just doesn't get us there so first of all
Pam was on her deathbed so can we give a
[SPEAKER_02]: round of applause for Pam the resurrection
of Pamela Epstein wasn't my best but you
[SPEAKER_02]: got it so yeah I'm gonna get this in front
of the VCC in front of the California
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Public Health in front of
the CDFA so first of all can we just thank
[SPEAKER_02]: our panelists and thank all of you this is
sort of like a we put this together in six
[SPEAKER_02]: days when I was like let's do this the
next event in this location is a total
[SPEAKER_02]: curveball from this topic it's the pathway
to legalization for psychedelics yes thank
[SPEAKER_02]: you all for coming thank you all what it's
it's the Monday so thanksgivings on a
[SPEAKER_02]: Thursday Friday Saturday Sunday Monday and
Omar Figueroa is gonna basically MC and
[SPEAKER_02]: then we're getting someone from Maps we're
gonna get a scientist slash doctor who's
[SPEAKER_02]: researching either MDMA or like like the
one I want is someone who's at UCLA who's
[SPEAKER_02]: doing MDMA research I'd love to get a
patient who has used this stuff as
[SPEAKER_02]: microdosing to talk about their experience
so for me my goal is basically to
[SPEAKER_02]: normalize this and show the efficacy with
scientific rigor and legal sort of you
[SPEAKER_02]: know lawyers helping us craft a pathway
towards legalization with cannabis sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: being like what other drugs draft off of
so anyway it should be a very fun event
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway panelists thank you
[SPEAKER_02]: Brett had no idea he was right thank you
very much thank you
[SPEAKER_06]: you you
[SPEAKER_06]: you you you you
[SPEAKER_06]: you don't know
