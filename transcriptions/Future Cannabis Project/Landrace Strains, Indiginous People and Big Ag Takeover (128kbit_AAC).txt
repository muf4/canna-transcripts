[SPEAKER_00]: My question goes back to the theme of
today's talk, which is the preservation of
[SPEAKER_00]: landrances.
[SPEAKER_00]: There seems to be a prohibition into this
becoming more of a medically accepted
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic agent to almost like a green
rush towards crossing landrances with
[SPEAKER_00]: other strains to then achieve a certain
outcome with certain pathology.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that said, just to use your example,
sir, a little bit earlier with Greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical, you see these companies,
these genetic banks, going to places like
[SPEAKER_00]: Congo and Brazil and Colombia and taking
these landraces and then patenting that
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge later so that the indigenous
people that have been growing this for
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of years are now having to buy
this back from the rich world So with all
[SPEAKER_00]: the amazing benefits that preserving these
landrances bring to us, how can we also
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that when you think of the war on
drugs and the people disproportionately
[SPEAKER_00]: affected by this prohibition don't suffer
because we are so busy preserving them
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're actually extinguishing them by
crossing them?
[SPEAKER_03]: I do tissue cultures of all of my
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have two refrigerators that are
completely filled.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will keep them preserved for as long as
possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have 132 of the listed 498 strains that
are available.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do do breeding and we do that
intentionally to zero in on effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_03]: A prime example for you is I brought back
a pure Afghani when I came home from the
[SPEAKER_03]: Marine Corps.
[SPEAKER_03]: We won't have too much of a conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was the best pain reliever,
down-to-earth pain reliever that I ever
[SPEAKER_03]: ever grew and the one problem that I was
having was, okay, let's simplify it.
[SPEAKER_03]: A person who's in pain 24 hours a day is
predisposed to be an asshole.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're always in pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what if you could take away their pain
and change their attitude?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you can change the attitude
then you bring the socialization back
[SPEAKER_03]: which communication and community help to
rebuild and regenerate and rehabilitate
[SPEAKER_03]: the individual.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that you have to hold that person up
or hold their hand, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just through common communication.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we took a pre-79 euphoria which was
known for taking a woman who can go from
[SPEAKER_03]: zero to bitch in three seconds and turning
that switch off so that she becomes mom
[SPEAKER_03]: again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or that person who is suffering from PTSD
type issues that snap to judgment or snap
[SPEAKER_03]: to reaction to what you see happening
around you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the idea of it was take away the pain
and change the attitude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we achieved that goal in creating
the Ugani and that was crossing those two
[SPEAKER_03]: strains, both of which are land-raised
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then leaving it alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: We left it alone after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we found was that it actually
worked for sight, sound, odor,
[SPEAKER_03]: over alertness, over awareness and
paranoia in a veteran giving the
[SPEAKER_03]: individual back but getting rid of the
symptoms of all of the PTSD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a certain point where you
should cross and try and find an effective
[SPEAKER_03]: change but there's also a certain point
that you should allow it to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: After something's been crossed,
you cross it back to ensure that you have
[SPEAKER_03]: a stabilized phenol out of it and then at
that point there, do testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you find something that works,
test it on other people that have the same
[SPEAKER_03]: type of issues and see what the reactions
are.
[SPEAKER_03]: As growers, what you should be doing when
you take a strain into a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_03]: make little cards, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that when a patient goes in and gets
your product and takes it home,
[SPEAKER_03]: that there's 10 questions on there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you tell them, listen, if you answer
all these honestly and you bring this back
[SPEAKER_03]: in or mail this out to us, okay,
the next time you go in, you're gonna get
[SPEAKER_03]: 10% off or 20% off of your product.
[SPEAKER_03]: But over a 30-day period of them testing
your medicine, you can actually pinpoint
[SPEAKER_03]: what works and what doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what you're gonna find is that by
going back to the original land-raised
[SPEAKER_03]: strains, you can actually target better.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other part of that, to answer your
question, the land-races have a whole lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of history and have been used by wise men
and medicine men from my part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: country, of the world, to China.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to go back to that gives you a
reference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sort of like the sun on demand takes
you back to the sun, which is your
[SPEAKER_02]: reference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can get the terroir,
there's your reference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you come with the genetics,
there's your reference.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're somewhere there.
[SPEAKER_02]: The hybrids that have come about is
because it's called resistance farming,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're resisting nature as you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you go indoors, you're resisting
nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to do something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now you've got to take an Afghan and
you've got a 28-day cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know what, how do you think OG Kush
came along, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because somebody wanted to make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: They wanted a short cycle and they wanted
to get a high.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not all about THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about full plant extract.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about the ensemble effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you know what, that plant has
figured it out already.
[SPEAKER_02]: You trying to screw up in there,
you trying to go in there and try to do
[SPEAKER_02]: extractive and all that, trying to be a
pharmaceutical company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Company, again, is totally bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse my French.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it totally bullshit because you're
poisoning the people, you're cutting your
[SPEAKER_02]: own business, and you're short-changing,
and you're sure damn we can't look in the
[SPEAKER_02]: mirror.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, so let's go back to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what hopefully we're trying to do here
is to talk about how do you create your
[SPEAKER_02]: own medicine for your patients?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you differentiate yourself in the
marketplace as a small farmer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Empower yourself instead of trying to be
like everybody else in the grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: find medicine that you want to grow,
that you have in your heart, that you
[SPEAKER_02]: would like to solve.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the growers that we talked to had
personal experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Harry Rose would treat well, although
things went awry for him in his business
[SPEAKER_02]: model.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's back again as Rosette down in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was saved by his own balance tincture,
and that's why he's back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why he's here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm sure most of you have stories of
people you've helped, or you helped
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that medicine, the one that you feel
the most passionate about, and make it as
[SPEAKER_02]: best as you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna blow away everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: People can find their way to you if you do
that in a very natural way, even if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just wanted to answer your
question, and it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Intellectual property from indigenous
people around the world is, yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's being taken and being used
commercially.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been happening across the Amazon
basin, where pharmaceuticals coming in and
[SPEAKER_01]: finding these plant medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just about preserving small farms
here in Oregon or in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's across the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Women have been cultivating this medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been allowing their children to go to
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: That still, we need to keep those small
farmers around the world alive and
[SPEAKER_01]: preserve that.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, I don't really know exactly
what the answer is around genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to see a surf system where
it's like, okay, we come and take your
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, then we sell it back to you,
and then you grow for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you can make a living because you grow
for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That model, it may not be the right one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Part of these genetics, they're entering
commercialism for the first time,
[SPEAKER_01]: these land races.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were grown and not intended for
money, not whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was used for spiritual healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was used for healing people.
[SPEAKER_01]: This clash with commercialism,
it's very real, and it's something that we
[SPEAKER_01]: should all be thinking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's pretty obvious that we all
agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to have great genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to have great light.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to have natural soils.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just makes sense to do it that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm always so impressed when I come to a
talk like this and I listen to people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have my stupid ideas, and then I hear
somebody say, we find it and make it even
[SPEAKER_04]: better.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what's so cool about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what's cool about this industry
that I don't think we'll ever see the big
[SPEAKER_04]: guys doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get together.
[SPEAKER_04]: We share information.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always like to say we're just one big
cell, and we're all enzymes in here,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we're all helping build the cell
better, and that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't matter whether you make money
or not.
[SPEAKER_04]: What matters is that you grow the best
plant possible, because that's what it's
[SPEAKER_04]: all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're supposed to be growing the best
plants possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's go forth and do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Period.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to add to this conflict
between commercialism and being farmers,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is that this culture of gifting
and sharing is with the home grower,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we should be encouraging and be
helping everyone home grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so I'm going to add to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a new book coming out.
[SPEAKER_04]: On auto flowering cannabis, because I
think that now that we've got the stigma
[SPEAKER_04]: going away, and it's becoming legal in all
the states, and in Canada, and Bolivia,
[SPEAKER_04]: and every place else, it's the next
tomato.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the plant that my mother will
grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: When snap peas came out, what I say is
once or twice in a lifetime, a new plant
[SPEAKER_04]: is developed for the home gardener.
[SPEAKER_04]: Snap peas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh my god, now there's 15 different kinds
of snap.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I might add, I think it started right
here in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Auto flowering cannabis gives you the
ability to grow from seed to flower
[SPEAKER_04]: harvested seven to nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you fertilize it too much,
you screw up the soil food web too much,
[SPEAKER_04]: they don't grow well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Holy crow, it's a plant that needs to be
ignored, in a sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: You give it natural conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_04]: They've improved the genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that we've got lights and things that
we can even make them even better,
[SPEAKER_04]: this is the plant that my mother,
my sisters, I don't have a sister,
[SPEAKER_04]: will grow at home because it's just like a
tomato plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's coming, folks, and the home
gardener, we need the support.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.
Thank you.
Thank you.
See you next time.
