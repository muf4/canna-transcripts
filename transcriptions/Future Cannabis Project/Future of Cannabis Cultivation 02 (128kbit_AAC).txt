[SPEAKER_05]: I'd like everyone to meet the mayor of
Avalon.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's got a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first of all, you know, you can all
come to Catalina free on your birthday on
[SPEAKER_00]: Catalina Express right here out of Long
Beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you might have heard me yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on Avalon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have all the we all have the Coast
Guard regulations, the federal regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: that keep transportation of cannabis to
Catalina against the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going forward, we're really going to
have to look at cultivation local locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, my first question is because 89%
of our island is in a conservancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're concerned about keeping
everything indigenous and natural,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though there is some loco weed that
does grow somewhere on the island.
[SPEAKER_00]: But question is, when you grow outdoors,
does it move with the wind?
[SPEAKER_00]: And could it go elsewhere and grow
elsewhere?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it because there's no seeds or
however you do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my first question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kyle?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, cannabis pollen of any variety has
been known to cross oceans.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, but luckily, there's something
called the species barrier.
[SPEAKER_04]: So cannabis pollen can't enter species
with any of their conserved plants or
[SPEAKER_04]: natural plants that they're worried about.
[SPEAKER_04]: So unless they're unless they're
cultivating cannabis out there,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they have anything to worry
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so then my question would be,
so now it appears and maybe this is
[SPEAKER_00]: something to talk individually about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now truly, we're going to need to
cultivate, test and process and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: right there on the island, because you
can't take it back and forth even to
[SPEAKER_00]: testing agencies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the question would be to
someone, what would be a model and how
[SPEAKER_00]: much because the city of Avalon owns no
land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only owned by a couple of different
people there, one being the conservancy 89
[SPEAKER_00]: and one being the Wrigley family.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess the question is, how could we
what kind of space and what are we looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at to set up something that we have 4200
people and a million visitors a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm wondering how we do the calculation
to figure out what our needs would be and
[SPEAKER_00]: how we get through this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of metrics to go through.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but you know, what I would suggest
is, is that you get your city council to
[SPEAKER_04]: open to be extremely open to the
commercial ization of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: because there's going to be a lot of tax
revenue coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And B, then there's also the personal
benefits that you can reap in your own
[SPEAKER_04]: community by allowing these businesses to
set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's probably worth forming a
committee.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that complicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you're not going to it's like,
like the solar grid, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're going to grow too much weed,
you can probably find someplace else to
[SPEAKER_04]: pump it into.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would I would just seriously suggest
that the council seriously embrace the
[SPEAKER_04]: commercialization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my question will be then,
though, if some of you are out there and
[SPEAKER_00]: can help figure out what this little
design would be, that would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we don't have the expertise
locally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I would say, you know,
if you have the data on population,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, you have the demographics of the
tourists, you could make some pretty good
[SPEAKER_02]: assumptions and guess what the production
level would probably be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you could design around that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, one of the problems that they have
is there's no space.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they need a solution that they can grow
as much as possible in a tiny little
[SPEAKER_05]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I definitely don't see like a 10
story building being built now along to
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivate.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, that would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: A nice 10, 20 story building built out
just for cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm down with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Call me.
[SPEAKER_07]: So guys, my name is Nick with Booms Farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I do living soil and genetic
consultation.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've talked before.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of the topics is IPM integrated pest
management.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your view on crop rotation versus
the monoculture model, which is like corn
[SPEAKER_07]: and other food production crop?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because I see cannabis go in that
direction.
[SPEAKER_07]: We do 350 acres in Colorado and it's kind
of we do OK organically, but it's becoming
[SPEAKER_07]: increasingly hard for clients that are
having they can't use chemicals,
[SPEAKER_07]: no pesticides.
[SPEAKER_07]: So now it's all biological controls.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I want to see what your thoughts are on
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think tissue culture is a good answer to
maybe spring nasty fungicides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know you biological controls only go
so far, but I think, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: as we advance the tissue culture and if
they're if it becomes cost effective
[SPEAKER_02]: enough and we can put out a really sterile
crop, every harvest or a sterile set of
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics from a lab that then has,
you know, a limited exposure, I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: would be a good start.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a tough, tough question to
answer in general, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing is, we are working with genetics
that was born in a desertic place and on
[SPEAKER_01]: top of it, most of the cultivar that are
used here come from the from the Kush
[SPEAKER_01]: country, like it's arid mountain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a plant that here receive a lot
more water that is necessary and too much
[SPEAKER_01]: food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that plant, not only she has problem to
acclimate, but you're pushing her limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she become weak.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have never seen PM or all the problem
you have here in any producing country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those plants go through really
harsher, much, much harsher condition than
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the solution would be to try to
step back a little bit and try to work
[SPEAKER_01]: around the cultivar, around the genetic
more than trying to adapt that genetic too
[SPEAKER_01]: fast to what we want her to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to realize that what we're we're
trying to make this plant jump through
[SPEAKER_04]: hoops and basically because of
prohibition, you know, so, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you weren't risking going to jail for
10 years, you wouldn't be worrying about
[SPEAKER_04]: getting as many grams per square inch as
you possibly could.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like French, if we step back and we
forget that we're not looking for those
[SPEAKER_04]: helicopters overhead anymore, you know,
then we can focus a little more on the
[SPEAKER_04]: language of the plant and just accommodate
her a little bit.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi guys, you all know me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a couple of comments on on some of
the things that was said.
[SPEAKER_03]: One was about the LEDs and the LEDs,
they have their place in growing
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana, but growing flowers is a little
bit difficult with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the same problem that
fluorescents have, and that is that
[SPEAKER_03]: they're linear.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they don't have the penetration that a
point source of light has.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just don't have the depth of canopy
that you do with your HBSs or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say that David earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't think that they can.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think they can create a high
intensity LED.
[SPEAKER_04]: Simply because of the way it's made,
it would be too damn hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'd burn up.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the other hand, I've grown with LEDs,
but I've used them to produce small,
[SPEAKER_03]: quite small seed crops in a closet.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the benefits, of course,
they don't produce the heat because
[SPEAKER_03]: they're more efficient, you know,
making light rather than heat.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing is that, and this is
something that particularly grates me,
[SPEAKER_03]: there is no such thing as calyx to leaf
ratio, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, there is none.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's bracto leaf ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, because nobody in this room has ever
seen a female calyx because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Official smack down by Mel Frank,
accepted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to explain this very quickly,
if you take a seed, you'll notice that it
[SPEAKER_03]: has spots usually or some sort of
camouflage on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look really closely, you'll notice
that that's contained in a translucent
[SPEAKER_03]: veil that covers about 60 to 90% of the
seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can rub those spots right off the
seed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, within that veil, there are
presumptive cells that would become a
[SPEAKER_03]: calyx if it ever evolved in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are also cells that would produce
the corolla if it evolved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the corolla, for you that don't know,
are like the fancy petals you see on
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers you would buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The calyx would be the little ground cop
that's holding those petals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, those evolved to attract
pollinators, animals, insects,
[SPEAKER_03]: that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is wind-pollinated.
[SPEAKER_03]: It never had an incentive for those cells
to develop into anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they remain just a few cells within
this thin veil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this calyx to leaf to calyx ratio has
bugged me for so long, I can't tell you,
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's so much apart.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am so glad I gave you an opportunity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't you speak out?
[SPEAKER_03]: The other one is that they call the two
hairs that stick up, that are the pollen
[SPEAKER_03]: catches, they call them pistols.
[SPEAKER_03]: And those are stigmas.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only one pistol per flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the pistol is the entire sexual organ
of the plant, which is just those two
[SPEAKER_03]: stigmas and the little ovule inside that
will become the seed of its pollinate.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I have to say.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was an amazing educational moment
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if we're looking at the future of
cultivation, can we just talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: more about energy use?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it is not a very green situation.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oregon right now has a new standard coming
up called Clean Green.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's their alternative to organic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because frankly, if you have a bunch of
pesticide regulations, well, if you use
[SPEAKER_06]: organic soil, you'll be triggering those
pretty regularly.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in California specifically,
and indoors specifically even more,
[SPEAKER_06]: the energy grid, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say I once heard that 2% of
all the electricity generated in
[SPEAKER_04]: California goes to cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't know if that's low or high,
or if it's even correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm qualifying that I just.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got Betty Yee in the audience.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you know the number?
No?
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so now I can't have hamburgers because
of cow farts, and I can't smoke my
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana because it's cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I'm just using humor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very valid point.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have to become cleaner,
if not through LEDs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I can't solve the energy crisis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have any great ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mel Frank, do you have any great ideas
about the energy crisis?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, come on up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've listened to some of the PBS on Prop
64.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you get people there who have one
aspect of growing, like one of the issues
[SPEAKER_03]: is the amount of electricity that's being
used.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've seen two studies.
[SPEAKER_03]: One was 1% and one was 3%.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in any event, they're looking at this
the wrong way because they're looking at
[SPEAKER_03]: it as it exists now with all these
underground, hidden, indoor grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are not going to be that many of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to start to disappear
because people can come out and use
[SPEAKER_03]: natural light.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're using the wrong data to try to
project what it's going to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be much less than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Than they think.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, how are you doing?
[SPEAKER_06]: Question relating to LEDs.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you guys think of LECs?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have much experience with LECs
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't really comment on LECs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even know what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can somebody please educate me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ceramics?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know they were called LECs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just knew they were called ceramics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, Mel has done some testing with
LECs recently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he could probably comment on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But me personally, no, I don't have any
data on the LECs versus MHAs or LEDs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't either, other than just some
anecdotal from people who have told me
[SPEAKER_04]: that it veggies really well, but it
doesn't flower very well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last time, really.
[SPEAKER_03]: For people who don't know, they're called
ceramic bulbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're generally right now using 315
watts.
[SPEAKER_03]: The power value out of there, in other
words, the usable light by the plant is
[SPEAKER_03]: very high.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, I've seen one of these 315,
not one, actually I've seen many of them,
[SPEAKER_03]: but one single 315 watt light over a four
by eight standard tray be able to veg out
[SPEAKER_03]: the entire tray, which was amazing because
when you look at both ends of that tray,
[SPEAKER_03]: they seem to appear to be almost in the
dark.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yet, we got great growth across the
entire thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think the people who are selling them
are talking about having six of these per
[SPEAKER_03]: four by eight tray.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, you would have amazing
growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: But just from what I've seen so far,
and I haven't done it with full flowering
[SPEAKER_03]: yet, is I think three or four,
which would cut your electrical use from
[SPEAKER_03]: standard HBSs where you would use two 1000
watt for a four by eight tray,
[SPEAKER_03]: by almost a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are also some of the things that
are going to change the amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: electricity that's used as more efficient
ways of using the energy that you need to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow these plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ceramic bulbs, I think,
are one of those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: No?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much, you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Susan, for a great event.
Thank you.
Thank you.
