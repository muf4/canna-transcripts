[SPEAKER_01]: what's happening a little bit with the
farm bill and what the expectation is
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just brought up the whole CBD side
of having dual use there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we're watching a lot of people
think that the farm bill has solved all
[SPEAKER_01]: their problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're going to see just such a
massive new wave of CBD products coming to
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're going to see such a massive
wave of new cultivators coming to market,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in Kentucky, Tennessee,
North Carolina, Colorado, just massive
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp farms come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all these people that think that hemp
derived distillate and isolator are going
[SPEAKER_01]: to stay at $8,000 a kilogram I think are
sadly mistaken when they see how much
[SPEAKER_01]: comes to market and how much is going to
be available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really worried about all these
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've created CBD brands recently that are
going to go through really, really tough
[SPEAKER_01]: time with price compression unless you
have great brand equity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at this point in time, I can't think
of a single CBD company that really has
[SPEAKER_01]: that much brand equity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the question of whether
or not the FDA jumps in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the FDA is certainly looking a
lot more closely at CBD than they were
[SPEAKER_01]: previously because they're thinking that
everyone's jumping into it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you make claims that don't pass
muster with what they think is acceptable,
[SPEAKER_01]: expect that you're going to get a letter
from the FDA at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm really curious to see what happens
because everyone thinks, oh, CBD is legal
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we'll say it's legal to an extent,
but we'll see whether or not it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's legal to sell with no additional
oversight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that oversight's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five years from now, market size of hemp
and hemp derived product versus what led
[SPEAKER_00]: the charge, which was higher THC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think kind of industrial hemp's
just going to be like an 800 pound gorilla
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to what cannabis is?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think for CBD and potentially,
surprisingly for other lesser known trace
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, yeah, very likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm just thinking overall,
for example, as paper, as all of its uses
[SPEAKER_00]: because cannabis has uses, but it's kind
of one is to ingest it or to rub it on
[SPEAKER_00]: your skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But hemp, it's like concrete, paper,
clothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great point.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: For all the hype we're getting right now,
about hemp for CBD, I think ultimately
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp becomes a huge industry of its own
for everything else, for plastics,
[SPEAKER_01]: for building materials, as you said,
for clothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think about all the things that
hemp is good for and also how quickly it
[SPEAKER_01]: grows, how fast it can be, it doesn't
damage the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it's a remediation product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So planting hemp makes your soil better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's oftentimes planted after you've
depleted the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think of like super fun sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you plant hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're cleaning it up and still be able
to use the hemp for other things outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of human consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many great reasons for hemp to
become a massive industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that the cannabinoid side of
hemp is a small sliver of what hemp's
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the one thing that I
think we've been waiting for for a long
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you think about how hemp became
illegal and what a farce it was that no
[SPEAKER_01]: one was told in Congress that they're
actually talking about hemp because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: called marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time, even people that passed the
bill were like, wait a second,
[SPEAKER_01]: what did we just do?
[SPEAKER_01]: We just made hemp illegal?
[SPEAKER_01]: It would have been a huge industry for the
last 100 years, but for the fact that it
[SPEAKER_01]: was cloaked under some other name that no
one knew about at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's one of the things that
we've been waiting for for a long time.
