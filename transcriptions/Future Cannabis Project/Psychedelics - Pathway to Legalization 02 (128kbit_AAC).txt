I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to first talk to Natalie Ginsberg.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has a master of social work from
Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also went to Yale.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's brilliant, and she's the policy and
advocacy director for the
[SPEAKER_00]: Multidisciplinary Association for
Psychedelic Studies, MAPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's passionate about psychedelic
therapy because it works by addressing the
[SPEAKER_00]: root causes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, something that really interests
me about her work is her focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: intergenerational trauma as well as using
psychedelics for something I never thought
[SPEAKER_00]: possible, community conflict resolution
and restorative justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something that we had started to kind of
discuss a bit earlier is when kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: progression of cannabis to psychedelics,
and that is something that comes,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we're already seeing state-level
initiatives right now coming around
[SPEAKER_01]: psilocybin, but kind of wondering where
that conversation sits among the broader
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation for drug decriminalization
for all substances and what it looks like
[SPEAKER_01]: when we're picking out individual
substances versus holding it kind of in
[SPEAKER_01]: this broader context.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something I'm really thinking a
lot about because we actually saw some
[SPEAKER_01]: polling that there's much more support for
full drug decriminalization than taking
[SPEAKER_01]: out individual substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And though cannabis has been laid such an
amazing groundwork and created a pathway
[SPEAKER_01]: for other things to move forward,
some people fear that we are, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: picking out that this is a good drug and
that there are bad drugs and what that
[SPEAKER_01]: really means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's something I think it's
really important for us to hold when,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course, psychedelics have so much
promise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess we can speak a bit more about
that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I guess I'm curious how you
think that kind of fits in to this broader
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I've experienced exactly what you're
talking about, like doing criminal
[SPEAKER_00]: defense, which I did for I now,
you know, turned 20 years as a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember like prosecutors just like
demonizing meth, you know, and like meth
[SPEAKER_00]: users are evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meth is evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're OK with some substances,
but meth, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I saw that demonization,
I thought like, you know, we don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be like taking sides and saying like some
drugs are the soft drugs and they're OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And meth and cocaine and whatever other
substances LSD are bad and they're hard
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a nuanced approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Tony Sarah, my mentor,
says there are no bad drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's sometimes bad times to
use certain drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, every drug can help you explore
your own human potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess I'll add something that I kind
of forgot to mention is that, in fact,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more dangerous that a drug has the
potential to be, I believe the more
[SPEAKER_01]: important it is that that drug is legal
and we have access to information that
[SPEAKER_01]: they can make sure they're using it in the
most safe way possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it might seem like kind of
counterintuitive at first that something
[SPEAKER_01]: more dangerous would actually need to be
regulated more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's something that I hold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something I think sometimes we
can lose track of, because as you so
[SPEAKER_01]: beautifully laid out, our whole system of
scheduling is just complete bullshit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse my French, you know, not based on
any kind of research, not based on
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think, yeah, it's we we get caught up
in that and something like cannabis that
[SPEAKER_01]: is so incredibly safe in so many ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's not fatal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, seems like extra ridiculous to
be in that space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess the other piece you bring up
around cognitive liberty I find really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting and also is something that
comes up a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess, you know, to back up on
the director of policy at MAPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm lucky to travel the world,
to go to different conferences,
[SPEAKER_01]: be meeting with people that work on drug
policy and psychedelic policy reform and
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of thinking about it from all
different angles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cognitive liberty is definitely a
strain that is very present and makes a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of sense in the context of psychedelic
advocacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess kind of centering that in what
we are just speaking about, it's also
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting to think that some people,
you know, who are, as you also pointed
[SPEAKER_01]: out, are currently, you know, in prison in
cages around around their substance use
[SPEAKER_01]: feel, you know, that also cognitive
liberty, though it's something they 100
[SPEAKER_01]: percent, you know, believe so deeply in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like they, you know,
someone sitting in a cage is like,
[SPEAKER_01]: sure, cognitive liberty is great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, my physical liberty,
like getting in this in this space and
[SPEAKER_01]: when there's so many fewer people arrested
for psychedelics and for other substances,
[SPEAKER_01]: like how that kind of comes into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, although we'll share one.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's kind of a tangent that is really
exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just learned recently that apparently
LSD is finding some more ground and use in
[SPEAKER_01]: the prison system because it's,
I guess, easier to access.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really providing a lot of people
a lot of healing, which I thought was just
[SPEAKER_01]: really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's easier to introduce into the
prisons because of how compact it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in a legal context.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now there is no, you know,
legal use of LSD that I'm aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's in the research setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you tell us about LSD research?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now there's actually not a ton of
LSD research going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a ton of psilocybin research and
MDMA research going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there has been LSD research in the
past.
[SPEAKER_01]: MAPS conducted a study using LSD therapy
to work with people who have anxiety
[SPEAKER_01]: associated with the end of, like a
terminal illness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw really great results with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also some kind of companies
starting to develop LSD for creativity
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're kind of not really super public
about and trying to think.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess the majority of psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like LSD itself or LSD analogs?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've heard of both actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like with psilocybin,
where it is psilocybin itself and not the
[SPEAKER_01]: analog that's being developed both by a
nonprofit called USONA and also for a
[SPEAKER_01]: company called Compass.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also developing psilocybin now to
treat depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then MAPS is developing MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy to treat PTSD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all three groups that I just named
have had FDA approval to continue doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this research.
[SPEAKER_01]: MAPS expects by 2021 we'll have MDMA
therapy approved to treat PTSD,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really, really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have some people working on our
studies here who can speak a bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can you tell us about the FDA approval
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: How onerous is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they make it easy for research?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the FDA process, there's a process of
drug development that you have to take
[SPEAKER_01]: anything through in order to make a
substance into a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is onerous, but it is also quite
just like here are the steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those were the frameworks that MAPS
was founded over 30 years ago when MDMA
[SPEAKER_01]: was first made illegal based on ridiculous
research that was actually not MDMA
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have kind of taken this path.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the FDA is actually quite insulated
from politics because they're really
[SPEAKER_01]: protecting this ability to innovate on
substance research.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, it's really expensive to conduct
their, there's phase one, phase two,
[SPEAKER_01]: and phase three trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to complete phase three to
have full approval.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it costs a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our whole system right now is
created so that you have big
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical companies that are the only
ones able to sponsor research in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: make something into a medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: MAPS is a nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've started a benefit corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we were a nonprofit, we were able
to afford to do this MDMA research because
[SPEAKER_01]: there was so much MDMA research sponsored
by the government to try to demonstrate
[SPEAKER_01]: the harms of MDMA.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in fact, they failed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's like the safety and efficacy
data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also used that for our cannabis
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we basically like I Keto that into like
saving us millions of dollars worth of
[SPEAKER_01]: research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're able to fundraise to do phase
two and also phase three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in phase three, we've started a
benefit corporation because post approval
[SPEAKER_01]: when MDMA is for sale, we can't function
as a nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as a benefit corporation, it's really
essential to us that the social benefit is
[SPEAKER_01]: our priority.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not profit maximization because we've
seen how that impacts other pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: companies and our healthcare industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something I'm really proud of
with MAPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're one of the very first benefit
corporations that are pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, which is like mind boggling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if anything to me should be a B Corp,
it would be a pharma company.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so we're right now just working on
developing like a standards of ethics to
[SPEAKER_01]: be evaluating a B Corp pharma company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone's interested in that,
let me know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about like the funding for
psychedelic research?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it shifted now that cannabis
legalization has happened in many funders'
[SPEAKER_00]: minds?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do see people getting more and more
open, like kind of coming from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis world or, you know, picking up a
Michael Pollan book and being inspired.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say that also the fact that now
Compass, for example, is one company that
[SPEAKER_01]: is taking investors to be developing
psilocybin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That also pulls away some donors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're trying to do it in a
different context.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some people might rather prefer to
invest than donate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people do both.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say if anything, we're just,
it's continuing to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the cryptocurrency community has
been really supportive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had like multiple anonymous million
dollar Bitcoin donations, which was really
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I think just the more and more
people are learning about these things,
[SPEAKER_01]: the more supporters we are finding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any legislative efforts,
you know, to start reforming the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelic prohibition?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are ones that I'm really encouraged
by or actually, I mean, I'm all for
[SPEAKER_01]: referendums and state initiatives,
but actually legislators in a number of
[SPEAKER_01]: states have introduced bills around
ibogaine research.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iboga is a West African root bark that's
used in the Bwiti tradition as a really
[SPEAKER_01]: powerful spiritual guide and medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the extract ibogaine and iboga are
very effective in stopping opiate
[SPEAKER_01]: withdrawals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the psychedelic piece is very healing
for people struggling with substance use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the physiological component of really
blocking your opiate withdrawals makes it
[SPEAKER_01]: like extra powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also research being done in iboga
for Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really powerful medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because of the opiate crisis right
now, there's a lot of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are a few states where we've had
state legislators, including Republican
[SPEAKER_01]: state legislators, introduce ibogaine
research bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking to people in California who
are really interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I actually have a Republican from
Iowa state legislator reaching out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a call tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like there definitely is interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think right now what's gonna be most
feasible around that will be
[SPEAKER_01]: research-focused initiatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I also, as I said, I'm all for
legalization, regulation, and
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of psychedelics, I think
that's gonna make most sense in that
[SPEAKER_01]: broader context.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you think just choosing to repeal
psychedelic prohibition for psychedelics
[SPEAKER_00]: alone is not gonna be as effective as a
broader strategy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that both it won't be as
effective because there won't be as much
[SPEAKER_01]: support, but also because it won't be
targeting, to me, the greatest harms of
[SPEAKER_01]: all drug prohibition are those being
incarcerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that, and I also wanna
take a step back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am pausing because even when you say
psychedelic prohibition, as you saw in the
[SPEAKER_01]: schedules, it's not like they're like,
here are the psychedelics.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's a psychedelic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Even MDMA, many people around in the
psychedelic conferences will tell me,
[SPEAKER_01]: MDMA is not a psychedelic, and to maps it
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means mind-manifesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is that these things,
there aren't perfectly defined categories.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are already psychedelics like
ketamine that are not scheduled on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this process is already starting to
happen, and I certainly support anything
[SPEAKER_01]: moving through the scheduling system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally support getting completely
rid of the scheduling system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't even make sense, so that's
another frustrating part to keep working
[SPEAKER_01]: within this system that's not really
serving.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I guess to me, when there are
groups like psychedelic societies that are
[SPEAKER_01]: really excited around psilocybin state
initiatives, I think that it would be
[SPEAKER_01]: really awesome to focus on ways to make
psychedelic access safer right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: MDMA use, for example, is the most common
psychedelic, not including cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But MDMA is often adulterated with many
other substances, and people don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: access.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside of the US and Europe, there are
many countries that actually have
[SPEAKER_01]: government-sponsored drug checking.
[SPEAKER_01]: The US does not quite have that yet,
but we are working towards that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you tell us more about that
government-sponsored drug?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that like testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's drug testing to tell you what's in
your powders, and what's in your liquid,
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Barcelona, I literally went to a
center that the government sponsors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can drop off some substances,
and they'll give it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll mail it back to people in the US,
they were showing me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then in other countries, they actually
have them set up at festivals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go drop off a pill,
and then they'll put a report.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there'll be all these pills that are at
the festival.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can even go by and check.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you happen to have that same thing,
you can check it, and it's been really
[SPEAKER_01]: successful in reducing.
[SPEAKER_01]: People find out there's other stuff in
their substances, they're less likely to
[SPEAKER_01]: use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that actually helps me connect to what
I keep saying about psychedelics being
[SPEAKER_01]: connected to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the US, now for the first time,
drug checking is being decriminalized
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's used, in the opiate crisis,
it's used to check opiates if they're
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminated with fentanyl, which is a
much stronger opiate that's killing so
[SPEAKER_01]: many people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's been this big move around
decriminalizing drug testing for opiates,
[SPEAKER_01]: and because of that, then that makes them
decriminalized for MDMA, and for
[SPEAKER_01]: everything, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's just one example of ways that
we're actually much more connected to all
[SPEAKER_01]: of this than we like to think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any chance of progress on the
federal front?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, federally is what we're
taking through this medical route.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yes, 2021, we'll have MDMA as medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, that's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think that we can be pretty
optimistic about cannabis on a federal
[SPEAKER_01]: level, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then again, that has its own set of
complications.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say that eventually,
we can have hope in the longer term.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't be expecting full, although as
I say that, again, I could see a context
[SPEAKER_01]: where maybe drugs are decriminalized in
the not so distant future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I certainly hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it really does look like MDMA,
will it be rescheduled or descheduled?
[SPEAKER_00]: What will happen after that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when a substance is as a medical value,
then it's moved to the schedule two or
[SPEAKER_01]: three.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what they've done with other
substances like this is very well could
[SPEAKER_01]: just say, well, for this medical use,
it's schedule two, but MDMA, any other
[SPEAKER_01]: context, is schedule one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something that's complicated,
because usually drugs going through the
[SPEAKER_01]: system are patent new molecules that a
pharmaceutical company can patent and then
[SPEAKER_01]: make a lot, you know, they have more
financial incentive in that space so that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're always new substances.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with something like MDMA or cannabis
that's this widely used substance,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the other substances, they've actually
taken, they can be in two schedules,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've got to get rid of the whole
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that happens with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis itself is schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drenabinol is schedule three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That other thing, I forgot what it's
called, syndrome is schedule two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess it remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the history of the scheduling of
MDMA, I think, was the medical community
[SPEAKER_00]: thought initially that if it was going to
be scheduled at all, it should be schedule
[SPEAKER_00]: four.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there was kind of like a
consensus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, my boss and founder and director
of MAPS, Rick Doblin, when MDMA was first
[SPEAKER_01]: made illegal, which was actually in the
early 80s, after some of these other
[SPEAKER_01]: substances, he gathered a group of like
faith leaders, therapists, doctors to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of protest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the DEA was moving to schedule it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They forced them to have a hearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the DEA administrative law judge
had this two-year hearing on MDMA and
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it deserved to be in schedule one.
[SPEAKER_01]: The judge decided it did not and moved to
schedule it to another schedule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the head of the DEA rejected
their own judge's ruling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, nope, it's schedule one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was in the 80s, you know,
in the height of drug war hysteria with
[SPEAKER_01]: Reagan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was really like, I mean,
the MDMA especially was just really not
[SPEAKER_01]: based in anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It had been used in therapy in the 70s,
a lot of couples therapy and phobias.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in the early 80s, a group,
and it was legal at this point,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it was called Adam, and then a group
decided to rename it Ecstasy and sell it
[SPEAKER_01]: to a Dallas like nightclub scene.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that quickly helped it skyrocket.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then amidst the war on drugs,
you know, like what is this new drug
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's using?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then immediately moved to schedule it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the crazy thing is this actions in the
US, like for MDMA and all other substances
[SPEAKER_01]: really reverberate throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've exported this war on drugs
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the UN, the same thing happened a
little year later with MDMA, and they
[SPEAKER_01]: moved to schedule it just based on faulty,
on research with MDA and rats.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it literally wasn't even MDMA
research they were citing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
Thank you very much.
