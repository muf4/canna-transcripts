[SPEAKER_00]: What you have is you have information
that's used as basically marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like reading old high times,
because I haven't read this shit in years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like reading high times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every article was basically to sell
the material on the next page.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not giving you any information.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're giving you a marketing pitch
wrapped around some photos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem is you're not really
getting true info.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what people need is true info,
because that's what's going to resonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in this kind of community,
that's what you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people come to hang out and
experience that type of situation,
[SPEAKER_00]: their education level skyrockets and their
appreciation of cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_00]: skyrockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it means that they'll take the time to
ask the person at the counter,
[SPEAKER_00]: could you direct me into something like
this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the person at the counter,
who's the lowest paid person in the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary, is the gatekeeper to every one
of your farm successes.
