[SPEAKER_00]: From an investment standpoint,
I think the most surprising thing was the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of capital that was being poured
into Canada, and the amount of capital
[SPEAKER_00]: that Canada was pouring back into the
United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think for the last couple of years,
the expectation was that most of the deal
[SPEAKER_00]: flow was going to be dominated by the
private equity firms here in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: The guys that had large pools of capital,
they put together specifically to back
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis-based businesses, and they
thought that their competition for deal
[SPEAKER_00]: flow was largely going to exist between
private equity funds.
[SPEAKER_00]: What ended up happening is that after some
of these Canadian companies ended up with
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes billions of dollars of capital
sitting there, they're creating special
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities funds, and those special
opportunities funds were now competing for
[SPEAKER_00]: deal flow, and they also had the advantage
of being able to use their paper as,
[SPEAKER_00]: when I say their paper, their stock,
as a way to purchase some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: From an M&A perspective, so much of the
deal flow went to the Canadian businesses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then there's also Canadian businesses
that were formed specifically for the
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose of acquiring U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: assets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Companies such as Canada Royalty,
which is now called Origin House,
[SPEAKER_00]: or C21, or Ianthus, those companies
started coming to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and using a combination of cash and stock
to put together large portfolios of U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses, and I don't think that anyone
in 2017 expected how much capital would
[SPEAKER_00]: come out of the Canadian market that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
