[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the infancy stages of
understanding the science of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis has been around for 5,000 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have written records going back to the
pharaohs of Egypt and the emperors of
[SPEAKER_01]: China.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been used as an effective healer and
treater of dis-ease and symptoms from ill
[SPEAKER_01]: health for all those thousands of years,
but without anybody understanding why.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our shamans, our witch doctors,
our midwives, all of our traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: healers, hands-on healers, first of all
they knew that holistic healing had to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a question of what you ate,
what you did with your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used music and drums, they used
sound, they used food, they used
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they understood that the body,
because we are a complex organism,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wants lots of different kinds of
healing modalities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they understood all that, but they
didn't understand the science of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't begin to understand the science
of it until the second half of the 20th
[SPEAKER_01]: century.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We only started to learn about the lymph
system in the mid-20th century.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to this date, I've had 14 surgeries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every surgeon I ever talked to,
I said, well, do you check to see where my
[SPEAKER_01]: lymph nodes are before you go in there and
slash them open?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go like, no, we don't think of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Europe, they ask the lymph doctor to
come in and show where the lymph nodes are
[SPEAKER_01]: before they start cutting through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are so far behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't teach you nutrition in medical
school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Allopathy in this country has been deeply,
deeply shaped and formed by the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical industry, which came out of
making the gases for World War I.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately for those guys,
they ended World War I.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they had all these toys and nothing to
do with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they went into fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They moved from fertilizers into creating
these so-called medicines, chemical
[SPEAKER_01]: compounds that they would treat symptoms
with to some effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they embarked on a
four-decade-long mass marketing scheme to
[SPEAKER_01]: convince people that certain diagnoses,
boxes that they came up with, such as
[SPEAKER_01]: schizophrenia, depression, and then later
bipolar, autism, ADHD, all of that stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: requires Prozac or Valium or Ritalin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they created this market.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to learn how this all worked
out, I highly recommend a book called
[SPEAKER_01]: Anatomy of an Epidemic by Robert Whitaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, it traces the whole history of the
pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's important about that to us is that
we in the cannabis industry come out of
[SPEAKER_01]: something quite different, which is
unbeknownst to us almost, this thousands
[SPEAKER_01]: of years tradition of herbal healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so contrary to allopathy,
which Western medicine, allopathic
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, pharmaceutical-shaped medicine,
is about altering the body's chemistry in
[SPEAKER_01]: order to supposedly heal, but really to
suppress symptoms and make you feel a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit better.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're the smartest guys in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: They, in the meantime, create side effects
that require more pharmaceuticals to treat
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's this vicious cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was in the sequel to the original
Rick Simpson Phoenix Tears movie,
[SPEAKER_01]: the producers went to a big pharmaceutical
convention in Paris, and they said they
[SPEAKER_01]: went around all the booths, and there's
just lackeys at the booths.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no big wigs from big pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were talking about, oh,
and this year, Pfizer did this,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Merck did this, and Johnson & Johnson
did this, and they were coming up with all
[SPEAKER_01]: these great bragging points.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finally, the producer said,
well, what have they done to cure cancer?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the guy threw his hands up and said,
why would they want to cure cancer?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're up against a perception.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like I was over at my booth the
other, over there, and it's sort of,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, how do you get proper dosing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if you look at our video that we
created, and we have a 35-year public
[SPEAKER_01]: health nurse who had severe tendon rupture
and had to have wrist surgery,
[SPEAKER_01]: the doctor said, well, I would... She was
using cannabis for pain, and the doctor
[SPEAKER_01]: said, well, the problem I have with
cannabis is we can't figure out the
[SPEAKER_01]: dosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you watch our video on any of our
websites, she's so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Barbara Rowe Pride is her name,
this nurse, and she says, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: doctor, let's look at what you just gave
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You gave me 40 Norco, pretty strong
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's in charge of the dose?
[SPEAKER_01]: He just looked at her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She says, it says take two to three every
three to four hours as needed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's in charge of the dose?
[SPEAKER_01]: The patient's in charge of the dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do you do when you're sitting on
the toilet at two, three in the morning?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're so dehydrated that you're dizzy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're falling off the toilet because you
kept taking them because it wasn't doing
[SPEAKER_01]: anything for your pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you might have overdosed on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, with cannabis medicine, the bad news
is we have to do the same kind of art and
[SPEAKER_01]: science of figuring out what's the ratio
and what's the dose for our particular
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly, our particular metabolism,
even trickier, but beyond that,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the good side, we can't do any harm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not causing liver and kidney damage
or stomach damage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it doesn't work, but it doesn't
hurt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just switch to a different,
either a different delivery system,
[SPEAKER_01]: a different ratio, a different dosage,
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are at the beginning stages of
understanding this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You go to cannabis, medical cannabis
conferences, and we're learning all these
[SPEAKER_01]: great new scientific facts about how
cannabis works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know how far away we are from
actually operationalizing these facts?
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact of how the CBD receptors,
the CB1 receptors, the CB2 receptors,
[SPEAKER_01]: the TRPV1 receptors in our body,
the receptors in our skin, how do they
[SPEAKER_01]: actually engage the phytocannabinoids from
the plant and kickstart the body's natural
[SPEAKER_01]: healing processes, which is what our body
has the capability of doing on a cellular
[SPEAKER_01]: level, healing anything, any dis-ease that
hits us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Animals know when they're sick.
[SPEAKER_01]: They switch plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know what to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the TRPV receptor?
[SPEAKER_01]: The TRPV1 receptors in the ARCADA
conference, which I really want to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about in a second because it tries to
bring together Western medicine with
[SPEAKER_01]: herbal medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethan Rousseau, you may know him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a leading researcher.
[SPEAKER_01]: He announced that they discovered a new
set of receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: CB1, CB2, they're not the only ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: TRPV1 is another one, and it does a whole
bunch of other different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cannabinoid receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a whole other receptor site.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are more.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll find out more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now we know there's at least 113
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just what we know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are beginning to understand that
terpenes have more to do with healing than
[SPEAKER_01]: making the blood smell good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just beginning to understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same with flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We haven't even touched it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're at the beginning stages,
and yet we're increasing our knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: base by leaps and bounds in very short
time period because we've got these great
[SPEAKER_01]: studies going on at Pltense in Madrid,
at Oxford, at Hebrew University,
[SPEAKER_01]: with Dr. Bashulam, in Brazil, and with our
own people who are doing it sort of below
[SPEAKER_01]: the radar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're finding things out every day,
but do you know how far away from that
[SPEAKER_01]: abstract theoretical knowledge,
whether it's animal models or just
[SPEAKER_01]: laboratory work, how far away from that
understanding we are to operationalizing
[SPEAKER_01]: it in a cultivator setting or a cannabis
medicine manufacturing setting?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you look at the big picture,
we are so far away from that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then throw in 40 years of
misinformation and disinformation that the
[SPEAKER_01]: public has been subject to because of
prohibition and fear, the fear factor,
[SPEAKER_01]: and throw in the fact that who sits on the
board of the, who's the majority of people
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting in seats of the FDA or the DEA,
members of the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are these poor folks going to ever
bridge that gap?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing in place to have that
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the industry, the good elements of
the industry have to lead the regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm not a huge fan of regulation,
but regulation actually will help the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry because it will separate
the real medical operators from the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the biggest, that's the
hardest, for me, that's what I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the hardest element to break
through in getting people to really
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that the stigma continues,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're destigmatizing it in one way,
but then the very simultaneous we're
[SPEAKER_00]: restigmatizing it by selling medicine from
basically a recreational shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is the thing, I'm glad you
brought up, because I wear a three-pointed
[SPEAKER_01]: hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is, you know, I run a dispensary and a
wellness center and I work with patients
[SPEAKER_01]: every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do patient education and public
education.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other is that I'm trying to bridge the
gap between those people who are into the
[SPEAKER_01]: sales and the marketing aspect of the
cannabis industry and those people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: hands-on creating the medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And get them to talk to each other and,
hey, by the way, let's talk to the
[SPEAKER_01]: patients as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my other corner of my hat,
all my life I've been an activist around
[SPEAKER_01]: policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've spent countless hours in
Sacramento lobbying with the legislators
[SPEAKER_01]: before we ever got Makursa, you know,
putting those bills together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ukiah with the Board of Supervisors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a political activist and I have
been all my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's sort of like you walk in and the
wink, wink, nod, nod is alive and well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are they doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a patient come in to me just this
last Sunday at Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's about 60 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got an autoimmune disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: He drove from Nevada to try to get some
medicine here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, well, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got medicine in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he goes, I'll tell you what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been going to a certain dispensary
and I get my tincture and it helps with my
[SPEAKER_01]: autoimmune disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then Nevada passed this recreational law.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went back to my dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were two entrances, two lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: The recreational was out the door and
around the block.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were two people in line at the
medical counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went up to my, the medical line,
two people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought, well, that's good, I guess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he gets up to the front and they said,
no, we don't have room on our shelves
[SPEAKER_01]: anymore because the money is all behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay, all behind the rec and the adult
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon had rough parity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Christian Lay, who is a cannabis
physician and has a cannabis clinics
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout Oregon, you may know him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had interviewed him at the Arcata
conference, which I want to talk about in
[SPEAKER_01]: a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he said they had rough parity,
the equal numbers of medical dispensaries
[SPEAKER_01]: and recreational dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the state made the dispensaries
choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if the state, if you have to choose
and you're a dispensary owner,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can choose to go down the toilet with
medical, even if you passionately believe
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's, but how do you stay alive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Race to failure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Race to failure, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now when Oregon decided to do that,
the ratios changed to 14 to one and guess
[SPEAKER_01]: what the tilt is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me, I paid $40.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been legal since 2011 when I opened
my dispensary and wellness center.
[SPEAKER_01]: I paid $40 a year to the county for a
direct business license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm paying 5% of gross sales every
three months, starting January 1st,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2017 to the county, just off medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had to lay staff off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had to shrink my compassion program,
but that's not all on the state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I want to stay alive, I've got to get
both a medical and an adult use license
[SPEAKER_01]: because of what we just said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to cost, based on gross
sales, it'll cost me $7,500 a piece
[SPEAKER_01]: annually.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's $15,000 a year annually just for
my state licenses to run a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that not going to put me down the
toilet?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
I don't know.
