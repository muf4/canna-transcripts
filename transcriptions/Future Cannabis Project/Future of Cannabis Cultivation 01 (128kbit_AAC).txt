[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about the future of cannabis
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Alex Campbell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to be the moderator today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to start by introducing our
panel, Cal Cushman, who is a multiple cup
[SPEAKER_03]: winner and specializes in beganics,
beganic cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frenchy Canole, who is a legend in the
hash game.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's going to talk about something
very near and dear to my heart,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we'll get to that in a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: And David Holmes, Clade 9, who's overseen
several cultivation facilities in Nevada,
[SPEAKER_03]: in Arizona, and also here in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to start with my thoughts on
the future of cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll turn it over to Kyle first
to talk about his background.
[SPEAKER_03]: When he thinks, I say the future of
cannabis cultivation, the price is going
[SPEAKER_03]: down, per pound, on the whole scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only organizing principle I
would operate from.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Kyle, take it away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, that's all you want to say?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to go down?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a fair bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's a good thing, because cannabis
is medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even beyond that, it's the safest
recreational intoxicant known to man.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it should be cheap and available for
anybody who wants to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The future of cannabis cultivation,
it's really awesome to be able to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about that topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not thinking about the past or how
we're going to get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of like this boat.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've already arrived.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really feels really good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying that any fight is over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you guys were lucky enough to
listen to Ethan Nadelman yesterday,
[SPEAKER_02]: he gave an amazing, really, really
inspiring speech.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the legalization of cannabis isn't
just about any one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just about being able to get high
or being able to cure your illness.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just about the economy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we do legalize cannabis,
hopefully we'll continue to fight for the
[SPEAKER_02]: people who are in jail for having a tiny
little bit of cocaine or a tiny little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of any intoxicating substance that they
decide to use and not lose their freedoms
[SPEAKER_02]: and tie them up in jail forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: The future of cannabis is freaking bright,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hybrid of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hybrid of indoor and outdoor and
light deprivation using all seasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a big, wide open space for
entrepreneurial, enterprising people,
[SPEAKER_02]: young and old, who have a passion for this
plant or for the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But do you think the price is going down?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can answer the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I keep losing these consulting
gigs because I start with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, the price is going down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't hire me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the price is going to go down for a
lot of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to go down because of the
supply.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to go down because better
practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to go down because it should go
down because people shouldn't have to pay
[SPEAKER_02]: $25 for a gram of marijuana that's smoked
up in a joint.
Hear, hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, let's move on to French
economic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't have to answer my question.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to talk to you about terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it all goes together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's not a question of price.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for the moment, you are facing a
choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every producing country in the world
produce quantity and not quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could be the first ever producing
country producing only quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not talking only about us small
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about the whole industry in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge choice that you have in front
of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge edge on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before thinking that price are going to
go down, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Price are going to go down if you don't
produce quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But price are not going to go down if you
produce quality because the world is open
[SPEAKER_00]: very soon to a world market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If legalization happen here in California
and in a few other states, there is
[SPEAKER_00]: country like Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is many country around the world
that produce vast quantity of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: derivatives that want absolutely to be
legal too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not only a choice that you make in
this small market of California and the
[SPEAKER_00]: US.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a world choice that you're making.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the wine industry did in the 18th
century after 13,000 years of mass
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Black market and any things you could add
to the wine to make it is lifetime longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They decided to go to quality because they
had no choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were facing competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a history book, you have literally
a blueprint how to not only protect your
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer but that their land is so valuable
because it's not the price of the land
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what the land produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something so unique that it's a brand
worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's called an Appellation
Controler.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have everything, every part here in
many different places of California where
[SPEAKER_00]: there is everything to create what the
wine industry created 160 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's your choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like do you want to make a lot of
money short time and to be just one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: other mass producing cannabis country in
the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you want to be the reference to the
world of cannabis in the future like the
[SPEAKER_00]: wine industry looking at Bordeaux and
France?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I figured out the answer to your
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is that the price is going to both go
up and go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Frenchie is extremely smart in this
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to expand on his thought, what's going
to happen is that cheap grade marijuana is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to get cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And high grade marijuana is going to
become more valued.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what came to me by listening to
Frenchie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll respond to that after we let David
talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys can hear me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you guys hear me pretty good?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I was thinking about the
future of cannabis cultivation and I
[SPEAKER_01]: realized it was a difficult question to
answer how it's going to turn out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I decided to think about all the
different cultivation types that currently
[SPEAKER_01]: exist and the products that they currently
create and how maybe those products would
[SPEAKER_01]: evolve and those types of cultivation
would evolve with the types of cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: they produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just going to do it a little more
analytically and kind of my style.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we started, you know, the top indoor
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently indoor cultivation produces,
in terms of retail value, the highest
[SPEAKER_01]: value flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the trim that comes from indoor
currently produces the highest retail
[SPEAKER_01]: value extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not saying it's necessarily better
than greenhouse or sun-grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in our retail market, it produces a
higher retail value.
[SPEAKER_01]: The indoor cultivation does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much in all of its options.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you move down to the greenhouse
product, the greenhouse is definitely
[SPEAKER_01]: getting better and it's becoming a
competitor of indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And currently a lot of the greenhouse
flower goes to, you know, the dispensary
[SPEAKER_01]: retail market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it still has less of a retail
value in dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just talking about my experience
in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is what I've realized.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the extract that comes from the
greenhouse is also a competitor of indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think indoor and greenhouse are
competitors and they're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: competing for specific products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the sun-grown is a different
entity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different beast altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the product it creates is unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the future of sun-grown is
probably going to be the largest segment
[SPEAKER_01]: of the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think as the greenhouse and indoor
compete with each other, that connoisseur
[SPEAKER_01]: market that you guys are talking about is
going to fight its way out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'm not saying there isn't a
connoisseur sun-grown market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a separate connoisseur
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that like indoor or greenhouse
flower probably aren't going to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: people that are going to transition to
sun-grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're separate customers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of the evolution,
as greenhouse and indoor fight it out and
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouse becomes high-tech and could do
a lot of the things that the indoor flower
[SPEAKER_01]: could do, I think that at some point
indoor may lose the battle because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cost associated with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there are a couple of things I think
indoor could do to stay in the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one is data collection, data analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look at an indoor grow,
it has so much control.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's tons of variables that you could
analyze, you could control.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking temperature, humidity,
BPD, daily light integral, dissolved
[SPEAKER_01]: oxygen content of your nutrient reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look at the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean these are all things you could do
in any of the types of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in an indoor, the type of control you
have gives you an advantage to go the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceutical route, which I think in any
of the classes, the indoor gives you the
[SPEAKER_01]: most control to produce a pharmaceutical,
clean-room type flower that the others
[SPEAKER_01]: can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the only saving grace of
the indoor in the long, long run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still think it has legs for many years,
but anyway, yes, the price will go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's going to cross the board on
average it will.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a specific question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start with Kyle.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never grown indoor with LED lights.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever grown with LED?
[SPEAKER_02]: Neither have I.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have any of you grown with LED?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it work?
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems to be the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is the future because it saves
electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because the LED industry has not been
improved for over 80 years, it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: economic, nobody wanted to give something
that they could not sell and resell on the
[SPEAKER_00]: very regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not been touched until we came into
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I play around with one of the first
really good LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, because you can pretty much copy
and get close to the spectrum you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all about mimicking as close as
possible the sun spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, to a point in the future it's
going to make a lot of difference for them
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor because it's so cost effective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me just ask you a follow up question
about mimicking the sun indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you, as part of your cultivation
technique, do you also reduce the amount
[SPEAKER_03]: of sunlight hours as the cycle goes on?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, yes I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you move from say 18.6 to 17.7 and so
forth down until 10.14 at the end?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I don't follow it as strict as that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe 20 to 18 to 16 to 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then at the end, maybe the last two
weeks dropping it to 10, 11 to 10.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also the amount of light
intensity I think is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're trying to mimic outdoor,
as the season goes on, October,
[SPEAKER_01]: November, you're not getting as much total
light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to try to replicate that as much
as possible by lowering the amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: light intensity also.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what about yield with LED?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I have some experiments.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did build like a 400 square foot LED
experimental room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the quality is always really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the only issue with LED,
in my opinion, was the inconsistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to get a really uniform light
across the canopy with LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have to put them really close
together?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you've got to put them close
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if there's a way that they can
create a higher intensity enough LED that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can get that distance to make a really
even light spread, I think there's a big
[SPEAKER_01]: future for LED.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there still is a big future in
the veg stage, and also in cloning,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also in supplemental lighting and
greenhouse potentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think LEDs have a big future in a lot
of the different cultivation types.
[SPEAKER_03]: You mentioned something about medical sort
of being preferred for indoor,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I can see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just on a personal level, if you,
given the choice, would you rather smoke a
[SPEAKER_03]: joint that's all sun-grown or outdoor,
or would you rather smoke a joint that's
[SPEAKER_03]: indoor?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll ask each of you that question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll start with you first.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a very tough question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had great, great sun-grown flower
rolled into a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say I'm a little biased
because I'm an indoor grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, just a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: So currently, yeah, my favorite,
if I were going to put any flower I could
[SPEAKER_01]: choose, it would be my indoor flower into
a joint to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just because of the cleanliness and
the, I mean, the cultivation rooms that I
[SPEAKER_01]: run are pretty much like clean rooms,
and I like that sterility about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let me just ask, are you growing in
rockwool, or are you growing in potting
[SPEAKER_03]: soil and half cocoa?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, rockwool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're growing in rockwool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, rockwool.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I've never been able to get good
purple out of rockwool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just crank the temps down the last time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know, the temps.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that doesn't always do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find the light cycle actually has more
to do it than the temperatures.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Frenchy, outdoor or indoor?
[SPEAKER_03]: Take a stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outdoor all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like when you're dealing with a
living organism that is aware of its
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat and everything that is there,
that literally control every mobile being
[SPEAKER_00]: in the air and underground.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant call every microbe underground
to break her food, for the food to be
[SPEAKER_00]: available at the right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: She call every insect, every predator,
she can do everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: She rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that power, you cannot duplicate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: By becoming the master in a group,
grow room, it's not the same plant that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it's very difficult to grow
outdoor, a strain that has been breeded
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor, and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the thousand year, if we had more,
100 years or so, or 200 years of
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition, that plant would become very,
so away from what we know that it could
[SPEAKER_00]: become a subspecies like we've been
thinking that Sativa and Indica,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like she's so adaptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's another creation altogether.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no way you can give me what Gene
is growing in his garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: That plant that has been breeded in that
garden is so powerful, is so unique that
[SPEAKER_00]: the neighbor cannot do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no way you can get that because
the plant is exuding all terpene,
[SPEAKER_00]: all her life, it's according to her
habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting something that is super
unique in itself, but we can't literally
[SPEAKER_00]: compare.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really a question of choice,
literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: The breeding that has been done the last
10 years for indoor plants makes them
[SPEAKER_01]: unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: You take an indoor OG outside,
it's a lot more difficult to grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I agree with you, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, David, you're lucky you went first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't know why or how anyone
would want to contradict anything that
[SPEAKER_02]: Frenchie just said.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm gonna use comedy to deflect my
nervousness on my answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do have a few opinions on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I also prefer to smoke indoor flower
for the following reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has to do with calyx to leaf ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, everything Frenchie said,
I have to say, is absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're dealing with a living,
I'm not gonna say sentient, but you're
[SPEAKER_02]: dealing with a living organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no matter how great a grower you are,
it's not plugged into the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not feeling any of the magnetic
energy vibration from the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, to go beyond that, it's a
completely different animal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to say indoor and outdoor weed is a
completely different animal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because no matter how much I like to mimic
nature, or how much my mantra or my ethos
[SPEAKER_02]: is to mimic nature, how many times I
change that timer, how many times I change
[SPEAKER_02]: the bulbs and try to blend the lighting,
it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the same as how the plant evolved
to have the sun rise and set every day at
[SPEAKER_02]: a different time and have the sun travel
through the sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, ode to Frenchie, because he speaks
the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I like smoking indoor flower because
of the calyx to leaf ratio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So outdoor plants are naturally going to
grow more leaf because the light intensity
[SPEAKER_02]: is lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant wants to capture more rays.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it grows more leaf, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: So outdoor bud is, almost always going to
have a higher leaf to calyx ratio as
[SPEAKER_02]: opposed to indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not always, absolutely not always,
almost always, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: But, so if you take that outdoor weed and
you clean it properly and you remove all
[SPEAKER_02]: of the leaf material that I personally
don't want to smoke, now you're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about something truly special that you
have there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're talking about the resin glands
that Frenchie works with, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not talking about smoking a flower
from a stick that came from a stalk
[SPEAKER_02]: outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a difference between that flower
and the indoor flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is also a profound difference
between the resin glands of the two.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I know you guys make your living
on indoor, so we'll just leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And personally, when I smoke a joint and
I, it's from Mother Earth, it has a,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know, I can get more cannabinoids
out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's just my personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to say also that we're all a
product of our environment, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And where I come from, upstate New York,
and there was literally a proverb in
[SPEAKER_02]: upstate New York for the growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it went like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You needed to have five plants for every
one you wanted to keep when you grew
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: You needed one from Mother Nature,
you needed one for the animals,
[SPEAKER_02]: you needed one for the cops, you needed
one for the thieves, and then you got to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep the fifth one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I personally didn't like those odds,
so I went indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Product of our environment, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got good at what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I would love to grow outdoors under
the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally grow in dirt, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I don't feel like unless I get
dirt under my nails, I'm not farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cultivating, but it's not farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no disrespect at all, I'm just
deleterating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a big part of the outdoor versus
indoor is also the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the largest marketplace is Los
Angeles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the dispensaries in Los Angeles,
they want well-manicured, frosty,
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the stuff that comes from outdoor
doesn't always look like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think as consumers get more
educated, we might see more outdoor
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but if you think that they are the
ones who educated the public to the
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor, it's like most people have never
smoked outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, you judge a flower on appearance.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the whole experience is all
justatory, I just don't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, it's all a question of
education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put some flower on the table, and you
don't say anybody what it is, and you have
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to see the result.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the palette.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the palette.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the average across the board,
the average outdoor bud, when you just
[SPEAKER_02]: roll it and smoke it, is going to contain
more leaf matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that leaf makes it harsh on the back
of the throat.
[SPEAKER_02]: So more people choose the indoor bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the people who do harvest before the
calyxes are totally formed, because I know
[SPEAKER_00]: personally a bunch of grower, their
outdoor are sold as indoor in very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very high-end dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all the dispensaries that have
been keeping the indoor as the uniqueness
[SPEAKER_00]: of it, because that's where the best
market and the best profit are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we are just starting to talk about the
sun grown, but we are far from it,
[SPEAKER_00]: because most people have not ever smoked
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you give them the choice,
they would go for an indoor, while you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have ever tested the outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's mostly a question of education.
[SPEAKER_00]: The market, you educate the market
whichever way you want when you're the one
[SPEAKER_00]: who runs the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like the dispensaries have been
running the show and deciding basically
[SPEAKER_00]: quality and standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what goes on the menu?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who should create the standard?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growers that should create the
standard, the grower and the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the moment, we cannot really speak of
quality, because we do not have quality
[SPEAKER_00]: standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to move on to another topic
really quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are three esteemed growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people in this room may not
grow cannabis or are thinking of getting
[SPEAKER_03]: started on growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like each of you, if you could
give one piece of advice to beginning
[SPEAKER_03]: growers, starting with David.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you could just give one person one
piece of advice about growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: what would it be?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say first read a lot of books.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that you realize that it's a
very complicated process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes many, many, many years of hard
work to master.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just like a get rich scheme.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people think getting into the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to grow a lot of pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to sell it and make a lot of
money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's not that easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I would say make sure that you,
depending on where you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're close to hopefully getting over the
hump.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's still issues with cops kicking
in doors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still happening in California to this
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check out your local law and read a
lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are my two bits of advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kyle?
[SPEAKER_02]: Simply start small.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because observation is key.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're overwhelmed trying to learn
systems, how the HVAC works and where the
[SPEAKER_02]: vents for the dehumidifier should be as
opposed to the exhaust for the AC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're trying to learn all these
systems, then you're not going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: time to focus on the plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're really getting started,
just start small.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like I like to say, learn the language
of the plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all observation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You look at the plan, and it will tell you
whether what you're doing is a positive or
[SPEAKER_02]: a negative effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you get the confidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can go bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can concentrate on learning more.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frenchy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Me, I'm actually not a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am like a winemaker.
[SPEAKER_00]: I receive the bounty of the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you want is to wait for the peak
of the flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want perfect ripeness.
That's my
[SPEAKER_00]: advice ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frenchy's absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: The amount of time that you put in
cultivating those plants, how many times
[SPEAKER_02]: you had to water them, how many times you
had to transplant them and prune them and
[SPEAKER_02]: prop them up and give love to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to pull it in a week
early because you're going to be hasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you're going to hang it up,
and you're going to dry it really quickly
[SPEAKER_02]: because you're hasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_02]: This man is not going to appreciate
working with material like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trust me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Agreed.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: For Ashmaker, you really receive the final
expression of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole magical process of
transformation of the bounding of two
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules that you find in spades in a
plant kingdom happen in that little resin
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I don't make quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I receive quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like a winemaker or a chef.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm depending on my farmer to receive that
quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why for me, to protect them and to
make people realize how important they are
[SPEAKER_00]: to this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no industry without those people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more than this, here in California,
you have something that is called the
[SPEAKER_00]: terroir.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wanted to ask me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was going to ask you about
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't go as deep as a winemaker,
the terroir is the uniqueness and the
[SPEAKER_00]: power of the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: The land is so powerful that every plant
on the planet was born only in one place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they adapted to others.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has so much in it that it literally
makes the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is made from the water it
receives from the ground and the sun of
[SPEAKER_00]: the ray.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here, in many places, you have the
geology that makes the soil very special.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have microclimates by the Android.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the genetic that became heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the genetic that is around the world,
the land race, they were born in one place
[SPEAKER_00]: and moved from that place to wherever they
are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before becoming land race, they were
heirloom.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant that is adapted to a new habitat
but didn't become something totally
[SPEAKER_00]: adapted to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can explain it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no other place in the planet with
that type of cannabis cultivar potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's literally a national treasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we have something that we really
need to do, it's to protect those pockets,
[SPEAKER_00]: the Emerald Triangle, Veracruz,
Yosemite.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a bunch of little pockets like
this, because if we protect them and we
[SPEAKER_00]: can make the world understand that there
is a cannabis terroir, we can have
[SPEAKER_00]: appellation control, so that nobody in the
world can use the word Mandosino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody in the world can use Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot use champagne.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use our methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use spectrum in your lamp that
mimic of a special climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make soil that mimics the soil we
have, but you will never be able to do
[SPEAKER_00]: what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what is the core foundation of
the wine industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a multi-billion dollar industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started in one little city in France,
and in front of you, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not only making money in the
industry, but do you want to become the
[SPEAKER_00]: Bordeaux of the cannabis industry that the
whole world has reference to you,
[SPEAKER_00]: that all standard of quality are made by
our grower and our lab?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we want, because beyond making
money, it's qualities that will set us
[SPEAKER_00]: apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's being the standard of everything that
will really bring financial freedom,
[SPEAKER_00]: but generation after generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only for you today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for all the generations that come.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to add that there is actually
language written into Prop 64 called the
[SPEAKER_02]: Appalachia Rule.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why it's called that,
but that's, I believe I'm stating it
[SPEAKER_02]: right, and they're creating brands for
Sonoma, for Mendo, for Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_02]: that will not be able to be infringed on
in other parts of the world, so that these
[SPEAKER_02]: communities that have created these
valuable, not commodities, but what's the
[SPEAKER_02]: word I'm looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: Brands.
Brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: These things will be kept in the home
front.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, on 64.
[SPEAKER_03]: I second that.
[SPEAKER_03]: David, I know that you manage several
large scale cultivation projects,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I think something people are afraid of
is big marijuana, but I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: inevitable, given the money that's behind
everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk a little bit about the future
of cannabis cultivation as it relates to
[SPEAKER_03]: large scale projects, and where the
difficulties are in large scale projects?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for sure the difficulty in the large
scale is to produce the quality that a
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller scale cultivator can't produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And personally, I wouldn't want a 30,000
square foot facility to produce quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's very difficult to do on that
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also difficult when you have
investors that don't want you to run
[SPEAKER_01]: strains out to 90 days or 80 days,
so I think that the connoisseur growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: the cultivators that focus on really high
quality don't have to worry about those
[SPEAKER_01]: 30,000 square foot facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just producing quality like they
produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as they do all the things that
they do, the care they put into the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, and the things that an investor
wouldn't think about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every large scale cultivation facility
that I've been a part of has investors
[SPEAKER_01]: that have specific bottom line they're
trying to meet, and they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily going after quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say it's going to be difficult
for them to hit the quality of the smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and I think one thing that gets
lost in the cannabis cultivation future is
[SPEAKER_03]: you look at the alcohol industry in terms
of craft beer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ten years ago it was Budweiser and Miller,
and now Budweiser and Miller are buying
[SPEAKER_03]: every craft brewer they can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's room in the cannabis
industry for the smaller cultivators who
[SPEAKER_03]: have a better product and maybe a unique
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm excited about all the different
strains we're hopefully going to get to
[SPEAKER_03]: see when Prop 64 passes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kyle, have you worked on any large scale
projects?
[SPEAKER_02]: A few, just recently gotten out of the
garage and the rental house type situation
[SPEAKER_02]: into the warehouse space and fortunate to
grow with some legal dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I definitely have some commercial
experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the biggest issue for large scale?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it's the quality issue?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm about to tackle that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fortunately for me, I think that it's
all about the people that you hire to work
[SPEAKER_02]: with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, there's a bottom line,
but I'm not concerned with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm more concerned with creating jobs
for people that want to be in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm going to stay away from machine
trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to bring in dozens and
dozens of hand trimmers that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_02]: personally train on how to trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to train the trim manager.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the trim manager is going to be
responsible for making sure that that
[SPEAKER_02]: quality level stays up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's still in the dream phase a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a naked flower guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse me?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a naked flower guy?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not exactly sure what you're asking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you cut all the leaves off the flowers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sale commercially, you want that bud
to look as you just want to smoke the meat
[SPEAKER_02]: of the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want the filet mignon.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to give a little spread on that
when you're trimming so that the leaf stem
[SPEAKER_02]: pops out and you take the point of the
scissors and you take every little leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: stem out so that when you're done,
you have a bud that has a unique shape to
[SPEAKER_02]: it because it hasn't been haircut bud,
I call it, when they just hold it and just
[SPEAKER_02]: go up around the sides.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just carefully remove each leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to constantly move the
scissors and the buds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's laborious.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, there are people that do it
really, really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I lived in Mendocino for about four or
five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I met troops of housewives who made a
really good living going from place to
[SPEAKER_02]: place.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would come to my house and I would
call them up and I'd let them know a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple days ahead of time because as you
know, when you're getting ready to trim,
[SPEAKER_02]: it might be tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might be the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not exactly sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you really want to do this properly,
you got these people waiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come over.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do their business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, unfortunately, there was a high
incidence of carpal tunnel syndrome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to need a trimmers union so
that we can get them health benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell us a little bit about the
line you're creating, the veganics?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk a little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'm not familiar with it and I'm
not sure if you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Vega Matrix is a veganic plant nutrient
line that's complete.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have to buy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been growing with solely Vega Matrix
products and beneficial organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've started losing track.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's about six years now.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were going on six years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I still get really good compliments
from everybody about my weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think I'm on the right track.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, it's a line of nutrients
that I can be proud of because you can
[SPEAKER_02]: pour it down the drain.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can ingest it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 100% safe and non-toxic for all
living things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's between 95 and 100% natural and
organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a line of products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So some of them, we need to leave a little
bit of room for minerals to make sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: it was strong and performed properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I have a personal belief that if
everything in the world was made from less
[SPEAKER_02]: than 5% chemicals, I don't think we would
have any big uproar about the overuse,
[SPEAKER_02]: misuse, or abuse of chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it creates extremely clean
medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of our biggest claim to fame,
other than terpene profiles that certain
[SPEAKER_02]: labs have said they've found a higher
number of terpenes than they've ever found
[SPEAKER_02]: in any other samples, is the heavy metal
count.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our most recent testing, we did some heavy
metal testing and sent it to laboratories
[SPEAKER_02]: that have done thousands of cannabis
tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And initially, they got zeros.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything came back zeros.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, they said there's no such
thing as zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't have any trace amount of heavy
metals that's present in water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they actually recalibrated the machines
from parts per million to parts per
[SPEAKER_02]: billion.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they found that our produce ranked
from between 300 to 600 parts per billion
[SPEAKER_02]: of the heavy metals arsenic, cadmium,
mercury, and lead.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to me, that's virtually undetectable.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have to recalibrate your machines
that are not used for anything else,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can have up to 100 parts per
million in an organic peach, I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're creating really pure medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that that's really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: It may not matter at all to the average
user, but to the portion of the population
[SPEAKER_02]: who actually have immunoefficiency
diseases, or autism, which is believed to
[SPEAKER_02]: be linked to heavy metals, or Crohn's
disease, or any kinds of diseases where
[SPEAKER_02]: the slightest bit of contaminants can
really ruin your day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had people come to me and just say,
my migraines, I've gone all over LA and
[SPEAKER_02]: gone to dozens of dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And until I found veganic medicine,
I couldn't smoke weed without having a
[SPEAKER_02]: migraine.
[SPEAKER_02]: This person is extremely hypersensitive
and not of the normal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to say if you're going to call
it medicine, you better make sure it's
[SPEAKER_02]: actually good for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So before we turn over the floor to
questions, I'm going to ask each of you if
[SPEAKER_03]: there's anything else you'd like to talk
about the future of cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Start with you, David.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there anything that you want to add to
our conversation?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I covered as much as I remembered.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll wait for questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's hear it for David.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's doing a great job.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Tom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Frenchy, anything you want to add before
we?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could add a lot, it's always.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get your microphone working before
the end, I promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Him and Donald Trump.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something's wrong with Frenchy's
microphone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Donald Trump was saying his microphones
didn't work, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's what the type of quality
Cal is talking is the type of quality I
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be able to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be able to receive that,
I need to be able to protect my grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we really work together,
it's a long way because even the wine
[SPEAKER_00]: industry didn't want to tackle appellation
control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appellation control gives you a lot of
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has to be local.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very stringent regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's literally what we actually need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are stepping into history,
but we don't even know what we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of the genetic that is up north is
not known by 99% of the people here in
[SPEAKER_00]: California and even less in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a treasure trove to discover and
use as a standard of quality for the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no way that you can bring any
strain and tell everybody that that strain
[SPEAKER_00]: is so miraculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: When there is no standard to compare to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that is massively
important for us to do because everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: is looking at us in California and at the
US in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have really everything to create
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the south, you don't really have
that relation with the grower I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: But and being a French also give me that
step back of the world situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are really at a time in the history
where not only cannabis will change the
[SPEAKER_00]: face of medicine, but to create the
standard in one industry and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: professional of that industry that set the
standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has never happened in any industry but
the wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it would be really important for us to
start working on this before we start
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about making money because we
don't even know exactly what treasure
[SPEAKER_00]: trove and how much we have in our hand to
share with the world literally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any last thoughts, Kyle, before we open it
up for questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was lost in Frenchie's thoughts there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like his world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to live in Frenchie's world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to live in Frenchie's world too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think you can get platinum emoji
cookies there, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the question?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you had anything you wanted to add
before we opened up the floor to
[SPEAKER_03]: questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pot is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if you call it marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care if you call it weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pot, I don't care what you call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana is good for the world and
legalization is a step towards world
[SPEAKER_02]: peace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
