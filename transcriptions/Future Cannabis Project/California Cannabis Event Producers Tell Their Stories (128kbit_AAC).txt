[SPEAKER_06]: Open it up to the panelists so that we can
hear about your experiences pre-regulation
[SPEAKER_06]: and how those events took shape and what
that was like during this heavily
[SPEAKER_06]: regulated transitionary period where you
didn't have really clear guidance until
[SPEAKER_06]: the emergency rigs came out last year
right around the middle of November.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Justin, what were some of those first
events like compared to the ones that
[SPEAKER_06]: you're planning now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a cultivator from Northern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't come at this with a sort of a how
are we going to make money doing events?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we going to do with our events?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was throwing a farm to table dinner
series in Mendocino County for the last 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was bringing local agriculturalists
together to basically share and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: promote local agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had these farm to table dinner
series.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody brought their wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was having the just the best
time of their lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean we'd have an entire you know day
where everyone would just bring things to
[SPEAKER_02]: the kitchen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did an impromptu curated menu which was
like whatever got brought there we cooked
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we served in the five course like
fine dining style setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So of course in Mendocino we all you know
most of us grow and most of us
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculturalists support our practices of
growing food by growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were bringing you know our cannabis
to the events and we were smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were drinking wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't drink wine but everyone else was
and we were eating great food and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: Tim Blake you know of course throwing the
Emerald Cup and all of us every year we
[SPEAKER_02]: would have this just amazing it was like a
family reunion every December.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all of us would get together show off
what it was that we were doing and one day
[SPEAKER_02]: it just changed like Colorado just decided
to bring all their slabs of dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I remember walking through the
parking lot and just seeing all these
[SPEAKER_02]: freaking vans painted with like you know
just oil and I remember seeing all these
[SPEAKER_02]: people just bringing cases of dabs and
then all the farmers that you know that
[SPEAKER_02]: you know we've been working together we're
just like bringing pounds out and then it
[SPEAKER_02]: just became this thing like all of a
sudden just one day it became all right to
[SPEAKER_02]: have pounds of weed and slabs of dabs on
the table and I looked at Tim and I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like holy shit like what's what's
regulating this he's like I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: he's like we're just gonna do it it's
gonna happen and because every we were
[SPEAKER_02]: very careful into that point in time so we
jumped into straight into farmers markets
[SPEAKER_02]: we're like this is this is gonna happen
all the time so we started farmers markets
[SPEAKER_02]: linked to the dinners so we'd have a
farmers market during the day and at night
[SPEAKER_02]: we would have one of these really
beautiful dinners and he's usually
[SPEAKER_02]: fundraising for a nonprofit or a local
organization advocating for local
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture so we didn't really get into
it like we're gonna do this for you know
[SPEAKER_02]: publicity or anything like that we were
doing it to actually support local
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture and bringing that into Malibu
I feel like was our medicine culture and
[SPEAKER_02]: our small batch cultivation network
looking for a place that would honor that
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine right that one spirit culture you
know mirroring or matching another spirit
[SPEAKER_02]: culture the teepees and the medicine
ceremonies and all the things that we had
[SPEAKER_02]: on site of the original exchanges those
days prior all the prayers that went into
[SPEAKER_02]: the events to say we're not pulling a
permit we never pulled one permit for any
[SPEAKER_02]: of the Emerald exchanges not one permit
and people are bringing down van loads of
[SPEAKER_02]: weed I'm telling them to bring the rest of
their weed and put it in the van because
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to introduce them to the rest of
the people I know in Los Angeles and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like this is gonna be great but all
backdoor and all you know and all
[SPEAKER_02]: unregulated and then Michael Katz is like
okay like January 1 2018 he's like the
[SPEAKER_02]: funds over you guys can't do this like
we're fully fully compliant fully legal
[SPEAKER_02]: and like he wouldn't even like drive with
weed in the car it was hilarious like we
[SPEAKER_02]: you know we applied for like the first
events permit or one of the first you know
[SPEAKER_02]: temp events permits got it and as soon as
we get entered into the BCC I don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: like we weren't even like really talking
about cannabis was like it was just so it
[SPEAKER_02]: just felt like such a sterile weird
environment so we got out of events for
[SPEAKER_02]: that period of time the farmers market
shut down the the farm-to-table dinner
[SPEAKER_02]: shut down of course the Malibu events shut
down and we moved into you know trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: enter into retail and now like sort of
figuring it all back out so Susan I'd like
[SPEAKER_06]: to know about from somebody who started it
with an educational mission and being able
[SPEAKER_06]: to experience the plant through a
conference how having these new
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations came out really affected the
ability for you to showcase event and
[SPEAKER_06]: provide both context and content and where
you see that developing in your
[SPEAKER_00]: conversations with the regulators in my
case I'm purely educational driven and
[SPEAKER_00]: some somebody has to pay for that so I
have to have sponsors that can give them
[SPEAKER_00]: some type of ROI to help pay for the
education I came from a background of I
[SPEAKER_00]: was an Orange County Republican soccer mom
leader in the Mormon Church and I had I
[SPEAKER_00]: sustained a head injury that left me with
a migraine headache that lasted two years
[SPEAKER_00]: long and I was going through a divorce I
had three little kids my life was falling
[SPEAKER_00]: apart and I was never not in pain and my
neighbor was growing weed in her garden
[SPEAKER_00]: and she said this actually might help you
and I knew that if it did if it worked if
[SPEAKER_00]: I tried it if it worked that I would lose
my entire community when you're a Mormon
[SPEAKER_00]: your entire community your family your
friends they will not accept you anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that was not okay back then this
was quite a while ago and I didn't really
[SPEAKER_00]: have a choice I needed to live for my kids
so I tried it and it worked and I promised
[SPEAKER_00]: myself that I would make sure that I could
change people's minds because my mind
[SPEAKER_00]: changed I mean I thought it was I thought
it was as bad as crack I thought cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and crack were the same thing they were
drugs you know and I just felt like it's
[SPEAKER_00]: you know just I have to do this I have to
I have to teach people and so I've been
[SPEAKER_00]: very driven to teach and before Prop 64 I
could have cannabis at the events I could
[SPEAKER_00]: show people what it looked like I could
have big beautiful plants all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place you know and invite in the the
regulators invite in local elected
[SPEAKER_00]: officials and they can stand next to a
plant and take their picture and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna you know start shooting heroin
so it's interesting I've I've I'm trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to rediscover myself I didn't know what I
was gonna do this year I didn't know how I
[SPEAKER_00]: was gonna figure it out somehow I did next
year I don't know I don't know how it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna work I do an event during Coachella
and I give the artists that perform bags
[SPEAKER_00]: full of weed I can't do that next year I
don't know how it's gonna work out so
[SPEAKER_00]: things need to be fixed we we have a lot
of work to do to you know just the alcohol
[SPEAKER_00]: thing the premises and I was gonna ask you
Pam you said premise you said premise I
[SPEAKER_00]: think the the permanent regs use the word
premises 290 times and the word premise
[SPEAKER_06]: once well it's about context right so if
we're talking about the premise where
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis commercial cannabis activity may
be taking place cannot be in the same
[SPEAKER_06]: location where you have alcohol premise
then the use of the single word is
[SPEAKER_06]: important so just like lawyers live to
argue over commas and comma placement
[SPEAKER_06]: whether or not there are premises right or
you can use a premises in in that instinct
[SPEAKER_06]: that's gonna be very important and Susan
you raise a great point for all of you
[SPEAKER_06]: that are upset about the events and the
lack of accessibility as you're hearing
[SPEAKER_06]: about we have this wonderful unique
opportunity to comment on the draft
[SPEAKER_06]: permanent regulations that opportunity
ends November 5th at 5 p.m.
[SPEAKER_06]: you can call you can email you can send in
a letter to the three regulatory agencies
[SPEAKER_06]: the Bureau of Cannabis Control the
Department of Food and Ag or the
[SPEAKER_06]: Department of Public Health in this
instance you will focus your comments on
[SPEAKER_06]: the Bureau of Cannabis Control Lori Ajax
herself said she thought she would receive
[SPEAKER_06]: a 1,000 comments the last go-around she
received in excess of 4,000 so people
[SPEAKER_06]: speak in numbers this is an important
issue and events access is and being able
[SPEAKER_06]: to be a responsible consumer and enjoy
cannabis if you want to enjoy cannabis and
[SPEAKER_06]: learn but also enjoy alcohol if that is
what your preference is and you are an
[SPEAKER_06]: adult over the age of 21 you should have
that right there was nothing that you
[SPEAKER_06]: voted on that said that you couldn't have
the right to consume one or the other now
[SPEAKER_06]: there is a responsibility and that's both
on the operator and on the attendee to do
[SPEAKER_06]: so without causing any problem but you can
comment on that and help Susan to
[SPEAKER_06]: understand and ask for clarification on
that particular point not to belittle
[SPEAKER_06]: labor it but it is important same thing as
when your operators go to your local
[SPEAKER_06]: jurisdictions and ask for them to support
their event please show up it is is so
[SPEAKER_06]: important as I'm sure Doug will tell you
to have support of the event that you want
[SPEAKER_06]: to do and even though now we are allowed
to have them not on the fairground so we
[SPEAKER_06]: wouldn't naturally go to the city of
Victorville I'm sure for anything ever
[SPEAKER_06]: again but you may want to go to a
different city and if you're in that city
[SPEAKER_06]: if you were to show up and there was an
outpouring of people that show up that
[SPEAKER_06]: would frequent the restaurants that would
frequent the hotels that would frequent
[SPEAKER_06]: all of these other ancillary businesses
that would be making money and they saw
[SPEAKER_06]: that support it's going to motivate that
city to not only have a process but one
[SPEAKER_06]: that is easier and can maintain some of
this great culture that Justin was talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about so with that in mind Doug I love to
have you talk about what your experience
[SPEAKER_06]: was like for Chalice during a 215 and then
this most recent iteration of difficulty
[SPEAKER_04]: that you experienced okay how you guys
doing appreciate you coming out maybe you
[SPEAKER_04]: could raise your hands who's familiar here
with Chalice Festival okay for the people
[SPEAKER_04]: who aren't I'll start by saying my name is
Doug Drake up I'm from Boston
[SPEAKER_04]: Massachusetts from the East Coast you know
in the building Red Sox you know but I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: not from the California culture I am
someone who has really been blessed by the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis plant on all levels in my life
from my friends and getting to know people
[SPEAKER_04]: and networking to relief using the plant
as relief or also using the plant to make
[SPEAKER_04]: money and getting benefits on of the you
know from this plant health issues happen
[SPEAKER_04]: that's another point of you know what a
blessing I've had with this plant you know
[SPEAKER_04]: in my life and the relief it's given me
and it's I moved to California in 2011
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking that medical marijuana out here
was a lot more legitimate than it actually
[SPEAKER_04]: is or than it was at the time I thought
the you know from a East Coast perspective
[SPEAKER_04]: I expected I expected more type like more
of a control of it as far as the medical
[SPEAKER_04]: side of it and when I got out here being
someone who sold weed on the East Coast
[SPEAKER_04]: out of my apartment and that's how I paid
my bills and did shit I just it took me
[SPEAKER_04]: about a month to realize it was just a
bunch of people hustling and selling you
[SPEAKER_04]: know selling weed out of storefronts and I
guess the difference was I mean yes it was
[SPEAKER_04]: more above board out here but people had
the balls to go for it and just do it and
[SPEAKER_04]: you know you'd get shut down and you'd
open the next day like on the East Coast
[SPEAKER_04]: that shit's not happening and if you're
from there you know what I'm saying that's
[SPEAKER_04]: just not like gonna happen at all on the
East Coast out here people are cocky and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're about it because it's not just a
lifestyle or something it's a way of life
[SPEAKER_04]: for people in California and that's I
think the difference that from my
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective I've seen you know like it's
you're much it's a plant for you it's you
[SPEAKER_04]: knew some cousin or some uncle who was
delinquent growing some weed a lot more so
[SPEAKER_04]: than on the East Coast where if you knew a
grower it was a big thing well the reason
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm bringing this up is the desirability
for me to move to California was how open
[SPEAKER_04]: it was right and it was more accepted than
where I was living and I was gonna go to
[SPEAKER_04]: jail for being a weed person on the East
Coast a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_04]: so I was somebody who went to the
Amsterdam cannabis cups when high times
[SPEAKER_04]: was doing them in Amsterdam and I you know
like I was that stoner who got out of high
[SPEAKER_04]: school who went to Amsterdam a bunch and
went to the cannabis cups and I really
[SPEAKER_04]: like expected this experience from high
times and how they presented it in their
[SPEAKER_04]: magazine was that the being a judge was
fucking awesome I mean you got this crazy
[SPEAKER_04]: experience how they presented it and got
to try the flavors but in reality that
[SPEAKER_04]: unfortunately wasn't the case and what it
was is a money grab now reason I bring
[SPEAKER_04]: this up is it helped sculpt what I created
with Chalice Festival is this experience
[SPEAKER_04]: of expecting an experience as a judge and
expecting a certain level of you know a
[SPEAKER_04]: bar to be set by who I thought was the
ultimate leader in the space and what it
[SPEAKER_04]: really was is a lanyard saying you're a
judge so you look like a fucking custy out
[SPEAKER_04]: in Amsterdam and you get charged top
dollar to go around and indicate that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're there as a tourist to get charged
top dollar for some bait and switch weed
[SPEAKER_04]: that the coffee shops switch up when the
Americans and out-of-towners come into
[SPEAKER_04]: town now like after judging high times a
few times which I'm grateful to have had
[SPEAKER_04]: that experience as a private judge I was
able to go be in the upstairs room with
[SPEAKER_04]: Nico see how they run their competition I
was there when they developed the first
[SPEAKER_04]: category for concentrates you know I'm
blessed to have been there through this
[SPEAKER_04]: whole evolution of concentrates and that's
what really stood out to me I always loved
[SPEAKER_04]: hash oil from the moment I took my first
dab I immediately wanted to know how to
[SPEAKER_04]: make it did that for years don't currently
make it anymore but what I created and
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll start with just the judge kit to
break it down here is is an experience
[SPEAKER_04]: where anybody if you look up here at these
boxes okay on top of these cases this is
[SPEAKER_04]: the chalice festival judge kit now what
this came with is everything you could
[SPEAKER_04]: ever need to smoke weed when you picture
coming into town okay you have got to go
[SPEAKER_04]: to a bunch of spots you got to go grab
products you got to go get butane and a
[SPEAKER_04]: torch or whatever to smoke this provided
everything and it gave you that experience
[SPEAKER_04]: what I realized when I was a private judge
for high times it's all about the
[SPEAKER_04]: experience it's all about feeling warm and
fuzzy and getting to taste the entries and
[SPEAKER_04]: get to tell people you're a judge and
that's what I was able to harness and
[SPEAKER_04]: convey into a revenue stream for a
festival to be able to scale my festival
[SPEAKER_04]: up to proceed the other events that
happened in the space now what I was able
[SPEAKER_04]: to do is build an event based on
everything high times wasn't doing and I
[SPEAKER_04]: bring this up to people who are
considering throwing events I think wait
[SPEAKER_04]: there's way too much copying in this space
and you know you need to put yourself into
[SPEAKER_04]: it and think about it and if you're not
part of the actual culture you're gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: have a real hard time targeting the
audience that we actually are and I can
[SPEAKER_04]: say I am part of it you know and I am a
weed person and on every level and while I
[SPEAKER_04]: might not be running the extraction
equipment right now or growing or anything
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm emerged in the culture enough to that
my entire social group are these weed
[SPEAKER_04]: people so I started chalice festival in
2014 in the parking lot of the national
[SPEAKER_04]: orange show and I went for it you know
2013 I started the 710 cup in Colorado
[SPEAKER_04]: which was the first concentrate centered
competition and it had my business plan of
[SPEAKER_04]: of selling the judge experience that would
come with a you know complimentary
[SPEAKER_04]: collective there's judge rig from the
thing and really like put my heart and
[SPEAKER_04]: soul into making the experience
unbelievable for people and it's because
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm passionate about this shit and I you
know I think there's too many people in
[SPEAKER_04]: this industry for money and unfortunately
it's got me to a place where I'm fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: broke you know but what I'm not broke on
his passion and heart and soul you know
[SPEAKER_04]: and like I think that's what separates me
from everybody else you know and and are
[SPEAKER_04]: for a lot of people and I'm not gonna say
other people don't have passion but you
[SPEAKER_04]: know they're they didn't achieve what
chalice has achieved in the space because
[SPEAKER_04]: they weren't willing to put themselves in
debt for a cause and they weren't willing
[SPEAKER_04]: to make the sacrifices so that kit was
fucking unbelievable for everybody you
[SPEAKER_04]: know and I did and I'm doing everything I
can to keep the brand above water it's
[SPEAKER_04]: it's been a real struggle running a
business at all on this shit with the laws
[SPEAKER_04]: changing before the laws change just
winging it and betting on some shit you
[SPEAKER_04]: weren't sure of you know and this year
it's a harsh reality I was all in on
[SPEAKER_04]: something and it's difficult to even talk
about honestly it's when you read the law
[SPEAKER_04]: and you're doing something on my scale
where it's a multi-million dollar
[SPEAKER_04]: production it costs about three something
million dollars to throw chalice festival
[SPEAKER_04]: and nobody understands that I think I made
money well actually I've lost you know I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: it cost me a lot of money to build my
brand and a lot of sacrifices that you
[SPEAKER_04]: know it doesn't seem like people
appreciate a lot of the time and you know
[SPEAKER_04]: it should be encouraging to people that at
least there is somebody who gives a fuck
[SPEAKER_04]: about this shit like I did because like
and you maybe I'm too passionate about it
[SPEAKER_04]: and get my emotions involved too much but
the reality is look this hasn't been easy
[SPEAKER_04]: to build these platforms in a gray area
market and when you talk about
[SPEAKER_04]: transitioning this is the frustrating part
that a lot of you aren't aware of so I was
[SPEAKER_04]: first in line to get that temporary event
promoter license I got it I was number one
[SPEAKER_04]: in the thing I was first in line to do
that and be compliant they gave me the
[SPEAKER_04]: option to do it I went for it to build
something legitimate that was tangible
[SPEAKER_04]: right wanting legitimacy for the industry
the reason why I didn't stay on the black
[SPEAKER_04]: market which I should have and that's a
real thing and that's a fucking message
[SPEAKER_04]: and it sucks to say but you know what they
put me in this situation to say that is
[SPEAKER_04]: that I should have just thrown it and not
tried to get them tax revenue and I think
[SPEAKER_04]: the state of California has been
incredibly short-sighted when you talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about what they set out to make on their
tax revenue and decisions like chalice is
[SPEAKER_04]: a perfect example of what poor decisions
this Bureau of Cannabis Control is making
[SPEAKER_04]: for a small mom-and-pop business like me
to be borderline put out of business as
[SPEAKER_04]: they favor my competition and show
preferential treatment to my competitors
[SPEAKER_04]: and you got to put yourself in my shoes
for a second understand how fucking real
[SPEAKER_04]: that is because I deserve the same shot
that high times are some corporation does
[SPEAKER_04]: and you guys I'm sure not everyone to use
all funded up or is you know and we're all
[SPEAKER_04]: in the rat race here and this is a fucking
some rat race shit and you know what I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: not comfortable with having to pay off
politicians and do all this scumbag shit
[SPEAKER_04]: it shouldn't be part of it shouldn't be
about that and unfortunately it looks like
[SPEAKER_04]: that's what it's turning into and I think
it's fucking disgusting and I think that
[SPEAKER_04]: the one thing about cannabis I loved was
even if it was dirty even at pesticides it
[SPEAKER_04]: was pure because it was the intention was
there for people of why they used it you
[SPEAKER_04]: know and I think that's getting clouded
and I mean I could sit here all day and
[SPEAKER_04]: talk I don't want to ramble but a if the
next festival I throw is called chalice or
[SPEAKER_04]: it's called something else it's from
somebody like me who really is gonna make
[SPEAKER_04]: sure that the competition ain't isn't
corrupt there's no conflict of interest
[SPEAKER_04]: and I mean that's a big reason why my
brand means something so to everybody
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to build a brand out there when you
think about it think about me and the
[SPEAKER_04]: struggles I appreciate you I feel those
struggles and I'm fucking here man so my
[SPEAKER_03]: name is holding it's a lot to follow Doug
I knew before I should have switched with
[SPEAKER_03]: you so I throw much more boutique and and
smaller events I've been I've been in the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis event space since 2015 I met
Justin at a at a cannabis event in
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt County at the 2015 Golden Tarp
Awards and prior to that I was I was in
[SPEAKER_03]: restaurants here in Los Angeles full-time
I'm a zag at 30 under 30 award winner I
[SPEAKER_03]: you know I pretty much had the career that
I'd set out to when I was a kid and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: I was really I had this eye-opening
experience at a cannabis event and I was
[SPEAKER_03]: there with my sister who's my business
partner representing publication that she
[SPEAKER_03]: runs and it was you know after years of
taking the Greyhound to Humboldt when I
[SPEAKER_03]: lived in San Francisco and riding down
with a 20-pack in in some duffel bags and
[SPEAKER_03]: and some some dry bags I was like oh my
god there's like something here finally
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a community there's there's you
know there's a they're there and it was it
[SPEAKER_03]: was because it was an event it was because
there was this community on display and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know it was meeting guys like Justin
and and people that are still in my life
[SPEAKER_03]: today and part of my my cannabis story and
my story as a chef so obviously I have you
[SPEAKER_03]: know I have a lot that I owe cannabis as a
social loophole and it's a social
[SPEAKER_03]: stimulant for things that are you know
outside of the realm of what we consider
[SPEAKER_03]: classic classic hospitality experience but
I think moving forward and and definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: things that I participated in have created
you know a strong understanding in myself
[SPEAKER_03]: and then people that come to my events and
that people that you know read about them
[SPEAKER_03]: in the news and reach out to me afterwards
that you know hospitality and cannabis is
[SPEAKER_03]: is something that's it's it's got a very
strong future and it's not like it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have a strong past to begin with this
isn't anything new that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: rediscovering you know cannabis is is much
older than than the people that are
[SPEAKER_03]: responsible for the stigma that's
associated with associated with it would
[SPEAKER_03]: like us to think so I would say the main
difference between what happened in in in
[SPEAKER_03]: the 2000 the the 2015 era versus now would
be the I mean it was it was pretty lax it
[SPEAKER_03]: was it was very comfortable and I as
somebody that's sort of this added value
[SPEAKER_03]: to cannabis events where I'm doing a
chef's table or obviously like you know my
[SPEAKER_03]: bread and butter was in home private
dinners and still to this day like you
[SPEAKER_03]: know I think I think I have a little bit
more of an avenue to do it in a legal
[SPEAKER_03]: space but in the way that I've been doing
it classically it's not legal and there's
[SPEAKER_03]: no true revenue stream for me to to to
find a way to do that and have the the
[SPEAKER_03]: state or the city or whoever find a way to
tax that themselves you know I would say
[SPEAKER_03]: between November and sometime in March
between the transition I really I took one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the hardest hits I've ever taken as an
entrepreneur it was it was incredibly
[SPEAKER_03]: tough and it took a long time for me to
recover to the place where I'm at now and
[SPEAKER_03]: because of that I was I was this added
value to people that were hurting way
[SPEAKER_03]: harder than me you know people like Justin
that throw big events that that it
[SPEAKER_03]: trickles down and I'm able to support my
family because of and it's those big hits
[SPEAKER_03]: that hit somebody who's much smaller much
smaller fish in in this game but I you
[SPEAKER_03]: know I have I have a big voice because I
go into people's homes and I have that
[SPEAKER_03]: direct and I can I can promote his message
as a farmer and I can promote you know
[SPEAKER_03]: Doug's drive to have flavor driven
concentrates that you know are expressive
[SPEAKER_03]: as a chef that that inspire great dishes
out of me and I can also speak to people
[SPEAKER_03]: that are new to cannabis and I can I can
capture them table side and I can educate
[SPEAKER_03]: them and I can teach them about things
that otherwise they would have had no
[SPEAKER_03]: other way and and that hurt for me is just
an impact of what they've been going
[SPEAKER_03]: through and and what my people that
cultivate and what my and my people that
[SPEAKER_03]: that throw events and my people that are
you know part of every facet of this of
[SPEAKER_03]: this emerging industry and you know it's
just it's the effect that the state
[SPEAKER_03]: probably doesn't even foresee that
somebody like me who's taking this chance
[SPEAKER_03]: who's you know I feel like I'm doing good
work I feel like I'm making a positive
[SPEAKER_03]: change in this world and it's it was
stifling and it was difficult and I'm you
[SPEAKER_03]: know happy I made it through it and you
know I I see I see for the first time a
[SPEAKER_03]: path with with these smaller events
whereas you know the the struggle has
[SPEAKER_03]: probably put a big impact on the people
that have gotten me to the point where I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: at now I did an application for a social
consumption lounge in West Hollywood I am
[SPEAKER_03]: I am somebody that you know I like to
think that I have a pretty good idea of
[SPEAKER_03]: how to incorporate cannabis into the
hospitality space and and I got to put my
[SPEAKER_03]: input out there whether or not I'm picked
or not you know I got there's a whole lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of contemporary 90 applicants 300
applications city of West Hollywood 48
[SPEAKER_03]: spots brilliant people they're they're
very talented at what they do and if any
[SPEAKER_03]: of them get their thought through it'll be
great and and having I was just in San
[SPEAKER_03]: Francisco I went to the Barbary Coast and
it was an interesting experience for me
[SPEAKER_03]: but there was something heavily lacking
and that is that layer of hospitality and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's something that looking forward I
think we're really gonna be able to see we
[SPEAKER_07]: have one more person here who wants to
tell their story this is Danny who just
[SPEAKER_07]: did Hall of Flowers which I think you went
to right so why don't we all right Danny I
[SPEAKER_06]: went to your event I thought it was very
well done it reminded me of what the Las
[SPEAKER_06]: Vegas conference used to be it was more of
a b2b experience you saw the exchange of
[SPEAKER_06]: operators having true conversations about
the difficulties and how they can work
[SPEAKER_06]: together and we saw what a retailer giving
away discounted samples I will call them
[SPEAKER_06]: so I'd like to hear how you maneuvered
that because I think it was a unique spin
[SPEAKER_06]: on how to do an event that provided b2b
and also consumer education in both a
[SPEAKER_05]: willing DAA and a city yes so I'm coming
with the 15 years background of fashion
[SPEAKER_05]: trade shows myself and one of my partners
I guess in the last two years people came
[SPEAKER_05]: over and hey let's do a kind of be sure
kind of be sure and I really didn't made
[SPEAKER_05]: the effort to make the relationship until
basically Green Street I'm sure a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: you know Green Street drama and Josh
connected us and we decided to go for it
[SPEAKER_05]: so I started researching that back in
September 17 and coming about when did the
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation came beginning of December
November middle of November the emergency
[SPEAKER_05]: regs came out yeah I had my baby November
29 so two gifts in a row so so as I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: researching and learning I'm learning that
hey there's like no one even knows how the
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation gonna be and let alone events I
mean there's no way they're gonna be
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation for events and I'm just not
gonna even look into it I mean we'll see
[SPEAKER_05]: what happens I learned you know what I
learned and see what happened then the
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation came and I have a I have a
talent I'm an engineer by train but I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: very talented in the engineering the law
so important skill in cannabis so I read
[SPEAKER_05]: the regulations and figure out what I can
do it so the first thing I did was look at
[SPEAKER_05]: the map of all the fairgrounds absolutely
and realized that the the best the best
[SPEAKER_05]: place to do it will be in Santa Rosa yep
look at the website so that arch building
[SPEAKER_05]: a new right there and then that this is
the building with whatever that takes lock
[SPEAKER_05]: the space down and that's a basically how
I started the second part was actually the
[SPEAKER_05]: regulation was meant for consumer events
not for b2b event right so there's one
[SPEAKER_05]: thing of giving just free samples to let's
say consumer versus to trade some other
[SPEAKER_05]: want to try and put potentially buy them
to the store so we have to work with that
[SPEAKER_05]: well the dispensary that you saw inside so
basically samples for two dollars was in
[SPEAKER_06]: order to obey the law right they paid the
excise tax on the full retail price of the
[SPEAKER_06]: goods where they were all quality
controlled they went through a distributor
[SPEAKER_06]: sugar I believe has a distribution license
as well so they serve two functions and it
[SPEAKER_06]: was a very uniquely engineered way of
meeting all the ramifications of the law
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah and another another unique thing I
think that we're able to achieve was
[SPEAKER_05]: basically allowing the exhibitor to
exhibit samples that were not tested right
[SPEAKER_05]: so things that were giving us a sample had
to be tested had to be packaged but things
[SPEAKER_05]: that were just on the shelf for exhibition
or okay not to be and we got all that in
[SPEAKER_05]: writing from the BCC which was very
important to some of the brands so some of
[SPEAKER_05]: the bigger brands have compliance manager
some of them stronger some of them pay
[SPEAKER_05]: more attention some of them less and you
know it's a it took a lot of conversation
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes with compliance manager and a
sales manager marketing manager really
[SPEAKER_05]: wanted to do the show but compliance
manager we're not sure if we are following
[SPEAKER_05]: the law and regulation so that took some
time and gladly everything worked worked
[SPEAKER_05]: well I think also we randomly met in one
of the BCC events Lori Ajax and we just
[SPEAKER_05]: told her about what we do and she's like
wow B2B event yeah why not people and for
[SPEAKER_05]: some reason after that it was so much
easier to communicate with the BCC it was
[SPEAKER_06]: a it was magic it was really nice to see
because I had some of my clients that were
[SPEAKER_06]: there to see the conversations that we
were having with brands about the
[SPEAKER_06]: difficulties right I think it was the
packaging and labeling regulatory whiplash
[SPEAKER_06]: was happening right around that time and
how they were planning for the the new
[SPEAKER_06]: testing regulations how they were looking
at phase three what we were hoping to get
[SPEAKER_06]: out of the regulations there was some
really intensely valuable and meaningful
[SPEAKER_06]: conversations that can happen when
operators are able to get together and see
[SPEAKER_06]: what is happening and really have that
unique experience so I appreciated that
[SPEAKER_06]: from the Hall of Flowers it was definitely
different I think that it provided the
[SPEAKER_06]: bureau with a sense of all right this is
how operators really truly need to
[SPEAKER_06]: interact which I'm hoping fosters into the
development of protection of small
[SPEAKER_06]: businesses so that we don't see this
instead of seeing a robust events culture
[SPEAKER_06]: emerge harkening what brought us here
right because everybody I know including
[SPEAKER_06]: myself stands on the shoulders of those
that went to jail or lost their
[SPEAKER_06]: livelihoods or any other thing that
happened is you became a cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: ambassador during that time that led to
getting the regulation that we have today
[SPEAKER_06]: so that that to me I hope is a signal and
a signpost that there's more of these
[SPEAKER_06]: events but what I'd like to ask Justin is
specifically coming from doing these
[SPEAKER_06]: farm-to-table dinners what is and how do
those cultivators and manufacturers like
[SPEAKER_06]: we saw from B2B who could have these
experiences they're no longer able to have
[SPEAKER_06]: this direct conduit to the marketplace
because it's always going through a
[SPEAKER_06]: retailer and a budtender isn't a
substitute sometimes for hearing from the
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivator how that flower was grown so I
know that we lost the fight on 2641 but
[SPEAKER_06]: how is it that you're trying to infuse
that through the Emerald Outpost that
[SPEAKER_06]: could be at dispensaries and other
exciting developments leading into 2019
[SPEAKER_02]: thank you you have made my life so much
more exciting because I too have been a
[SPEAKER_02]: law engineer for a long time I grew up on
the East Coast I grew up on two blocks off
[SPEAKER_02]: of Thayer Street my parents are still
there like I ran away from home to come to
[SPEAKER_02]: Haight Street when I was 16 so I was like
and like been always I kind of like in
[SPEAKER_02]: that space and I love doing it it's so
much fun figuring out loopholes it's great
[SPEAKER_02]: and Michael is a brick wall when it comes
to a loophole there's no such thing as a
[SPEAKER_02]: loophole that exists with this guy you
think and then you guys did what you did
[SPEAKER_02]: and I was like see I was like told you and
Michael was I was like if we don't I said
[SPEAKER_02]: if we don't do something now we're
irrelevant and Michael said you're right
[SPEAKER_02]: you're right and I was like exactly so my
life since your event has been like every
[SPEAKER_02]: hour by hour by hour a different
conversation with my business partner
[SPEAKER_02]: about a different iteration of a loophole
to make and to make an event happen so
[SPEAKER_02]: thank you I'm like literally you've you've
you've impacted my life and that's great
[SPEAKER_02]: because at the at the end of the day I
mean like the stories are hardship and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like fuck I just want to like man I
like I want to like you know like just
[SPEAKER_02]: crying like all the fucking time we've
become grief counselors I mean it's like I
[SPEAKER_02]: have self-funded I lose my house on Friday
you know I'm saying like almost
[SPEAKER_02]: irreparably and I look at it and the money
that instead of paying the mortgage we
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking rented the stupid Victorian in
Santa Monica to throw an event and my
[SPEAKER_02]: ex-wife is going like you did what and I
was like but everybody needs access to the
[SPEAKER_02]: market in Southern California and we're
right there we're this close you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: retailers are happening you know like
they're they're like they're starting to
[SPEAKER_02]: break a little bit like this could happen
so like I think what it comes down to is
[SPEAKER_02]: that you know we have had to create those
look those small loopholes like okay no
[SPEAKER_02]: events right how do we gain access for
small cultivators into the marketplace
[SPEAKER_02]: right so what have I been doing for 22
years I've been broker and weed that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what I do I sell weed so it's like so how
do I continue doing that well instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: going out and getting a fucking million
dollar you know permanent with vans and
[SPEAKER_02]: security cameras and all of those things
it's like we can be brokers and
[SPEAKER_02]: representatives and we can create a a
scaled model for a farmers market so back
[SPEAKER_02]: there in the back you'll see what's called
the Emerald Outpost the Emerald Outpost is
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially like a farmers market in a box
that goes in a kiosk into dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: shelves it gives small batch mom-and-pop
cultivators every single one of those
[SPEAKER_02]: brands is linked to a mother and father a
lot of them in my children's pickup lines
[SPEAKER_02]: at school and in that box there are there
there are people that need to survive
[SPEAKER_02]: through selling their product they spent
the last of their money and you know this
[SPEAKER_02]: because I spend all day talking to the
brand managers and the people who are now
[SPEAKER_02]: operating and managing these brands a lot
of times though you know the wives you
[SPEAKER_02]: know it's like you know them and we're you
know that is their access to market they
[SPEAKER_02]: have got to get retail access it does
nothing there's you know farmers markets
[SPEAKER_02]: are great you know a stimulus of a certain
amount of income the retailers have come
[SPEAKER_02]: out against us they've shot down events
bills I I can't believe I'm saying this
[SPEAKER_02]: because I'm scared to death to piss them
off I'm literally like it's not about
[SPEAKER_02]: paying politicians it's also about like
we're in a fight with retailers for god
[SPEAKER_02]: knows what reason and they're the ones
that are going to make that are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: allow us to survive because people don't
wait four times a year to smoke weed they
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke weed every day they need to go to a
retail outlet that kiosk in that model is
[SPEAKER_02]: our ability to get daily access for those
small brands to market and I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: that's like the best play that we could do
on the daily with with the events not not
[SPEAKER_02]: going on not doing the pop-ups and not
doing the direct sales and my business
[SPEAKER_02]: partner who I respect greatly not allowing
me to set up an illegal farmers market in
[SPEAKER_02]: the back of someone's house and and and
sell weed and one of the thing about the
[SPEAKER_05]: small companies so coming from the fashion
industry specifically trade shows I mean
[SPEAKER_05]: I've seen it throughout the years people
going downtown LA and you know spending
[SPEAKER_05]: couple of thousand of dollars and creating
a line right having the samples paying for
[SPEAKER_05]: a boot in Vegas and all of sudden having
business going because they came back from
[SPEAKER_05]: Vegas with a quarter of a million dollar
orders and well now let's figure out how
[SPEAKER_05]: to produce it that's another story but you
know it starts there and actually that was
[SPEAKER_05]: my vision when I when I started to my
surprise a lot more of the bigger
[SPEAKER_05]: companies the established companies were
the first one to jump in but we had a good
[SPEAKER_05]: mixture but it's exactly that I mean I
think it's enabled it's enabled brands to
[SPEAKER_05]: do business without having sales force
spread throughout the state so it's
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially can reduce tremendously the
cost of doing business both through the
[SPEAKER_06]: Hall of Flowers and and Justin with the
Emerald Outpost I think what you're seeing
[SPEAKER_06]: is the one thing that I truly value so
much about the industry and even Doug and
[SPEAKER_06]: Susan with reinventing yourselves and
getting back to what that true part of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis is and that's innovative and one
more thing real quick you know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: hilarious three weeks ago I rented out the
Ren Gallery and threw a fashion show you
[SPEAKER_06]: did what look at your skill set growing
pajamas yeah so like talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: reinventing yourself but I mean it's
biomaterials mysterious materials from the
[SPEAKER_02]: waste stream is like super hippie but it
was still a fashion show so maybe you're
[SPEAKER_06]: just like systemic in there the vibes got
to you and you're just gonna take on all
[SPEAKER_06]: the personalities I love it but that that
is the truism of cannabis that it is
[SPEAKER_06]: breeds reinvention it breeds needing to be
creative there are legal loopholes that
[SPEAKER_06]: should consistently in this space be
utilized I never want to say manipulated
[SPEAKER_06]: but they should all be utilized because
through those loopholes the BCC sees the
[SPEAKER_06]: value in how we get to better events right
sometimes they have to get out of their
[SPEAKER_06]: own way just as operators do it's
difficult to play by a playbook that you
[SPEAKER_06]: don't know that's continuously changing
but if you go into it with an adaptive
[SPEAKER_06]: mindset I think you got to look always at
your location what you're gonna be doing
[SPEAKER_06]: and how favorable that jurisdiction is to
you but since we've got such an array of
[SPEAKER_06]: operators do you want to see if anybody
has any specific question when you were
[SPEAKER_01]: saying that you wish you hadn't gone
through the regulation process if you
[SPEAKER_01]: could elaborate on some of the pitfalls
and some of the pain points there through
[SPEAKER_01]: the through the point that you know going
through those regulations we're in a
[SPEAKER_01]: similar position we're on the fence going
through regulations we're private events
[SPEAKER_04]: but I'm curious is a bigger event like
yours I mean in a really direct sense it's
[SPEAKER_04]: a great question the reason I said that is
because I don't feel based on the BCC's
[SPEAKER_04]: actions this year this is my problem and
and I don't know I don't know you I have a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of respect for you you know hey I'll
shake your hand he met Laurie Ajax so his
[SPEAKER_04]: it seemed like his event was pretty
streamlined so I got to go meet Laurie
[SPEAKER_04]: Ajax and get all political to fucking give
me the same opportunity as other people do
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's bullshit and I'm upset and
I'd say it right to her I'm furious I
[SPEAKER_04]: tried to meet with her I have in a fucking
email that I tried to meet with her she
[SPEAKER_04]: met with high time she met with Emerald
Cup she didn't meet with me that's not
[SPEAKER_04]: fair and you know what I should have
thrown a black market event and what I'd
[SPEAKER_04]: say to people is don't bank on this shit
because you know what they can pull out
[SPEAKER_04]: the fucking rug from you at any point and
unless you're ready to grease the right
[SPEAKER_04]: people's pockets I don't see how you got a
fair chance what I was gonna say is I got
[SPEAKER_04]: no faith in the BCC that's why I don't
think you should go legal unless you got
[SPEAKER_04]: the money to pay to play and that's all
these new guys coming in that have no real
[SPEAKER_04]: roots in the cannabis industry but want
the money from it coming up with witty
[SPEAKER_04]: shit and a stick with your heart and you
know what stay tuned your culture and all
[SPEAKER_04]: these people fronting like they have the
culture's best interest in mind they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: and I don't know what next year brings and
I'm sure it's gonna be a bunch of raids
[SPEAKER_04]: and a bunch of people going to jail
because that's how they set it up and it
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't easy for us all to transition and
that wasn't fair and they didn't have
[SPEAKER_04]: anybody involved who had any knowledge of
the craft culture or what it was to use
[SPEAKER_04]: that plant to put food on your fucking
plate for your families or your future or
[SPEAKER_04]: to pay your bills or your mortgage and
what it created is I'm here at this coffee
[SPEAKER_04]: shop and I have people who come in here as
members that genuinely say I was going to
[SPEAKER_04]: the dispensary for a while but I can't do
that anymore because it just doesn't make
[SPEAKER_04]: financial sense the taxes are too high the
shit got it just wasn't right so when
[SPEAKER_04]: you're throwing an event I put a lot of
money out there and I got fucked because I
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't have the extra money to pay the
right people or something and who's to say
[SPEAKER_04]: that my competition didn't try to stay in
that this is the corrupt world we live in
[SPEAKER_04]: so when you're getting ready to throw an
event you got to be aware of the politics
[SPEAKER_04]: in your area before you're investing a lot
of money into this shit or you're gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: get left like me in a bunch of debt trying
to be ambitious so it couldn't be any more
[SPEAKER_04]: real than that like this plant really has
changed my world and it seems like you
[SPEAKER_04]: have these outsiders and this new
classification a person who's fucking
[SPEAKER_04]: greedy and money-hungry and it's not about
the same things and that's real and you
[SPEAKER_04]: know if I speak up on this I don't really
give a fuck anymore because no one else is
[SPEAKER_04]: speaking up on this shit and everybody's
coward to put it out there that the issues
[SPEAKER_04]: with the BCC stem from their poor
decisions and their approach on shit and I
[SPEAKER_04]: have put my comment in you know like hey
you got to speak up when when they say you
[SPEAKER_04]: can but why is someone able to get their
license expedited because they know
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody there how is that fair for you
man that's putting a mortgage on your
[SPEAKER_04]: house or taking your family's money to try
to build a business and I don't think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: a level playing field for any of the
platforms so again that's the best way I
[SPEAKER_04]: could answer that I think amen there's a
lot of heart and love into people who grow
[SPEAKER_04]: this plant for the reasons they always
have and they that won't change for a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of people you know and always buy my
weight on the black market man period so
[SPEAKER_06]: that's it first I think it's important to
say that I I empathize and I appreciate
[SPEAKER_06]: the difficulty of gaining a foothold in a
heavily regulated market I spend a great
[SPEAKER_06]: deal of my time having very upsetting
conversations you know the it's a joke in
[SPEAKER_06]: the office but it's true killing dreams is
a daily occurrence for my practice I do
[SPEAKER_06]: that not because I want to but because my
goal is to tell people the realistic truth
[SPEAKER_06]: of entering a regulated market and what
you can and cannot do right and how you
[SPEAKER_06]: can and cannot get there and how you
develop a pathway towards compliance and a
[SPEAKER_06]: pathway towards compliance is riddled with
pain points and with costs and with
[SPEAKER_06]: complications and with challenges but that
is never an excuse to conduct illegal
[SPEAKER_06]: activity because the only thing that
illegal activity begets is the stereotypes
[SPEAKER_06]: that everybody in this room I am assured
is fighting to not have on their backs I
[SPEAKER_06]: am a responsible cannabis consumer I am an
attorney I use it for my debilitating
[SPEAKER_06]: migraines that almost took me out on
disability from being able to work I do
[SPEAKER_06]: not and I personally will not endorse that
there is an alternative that is conducting
[SPEAKER_06]: commercial legal commercial activity on
the illicit market if we want to see
[SPEAKER_06]: federal legalization if we want to see the
ability for these walls to come down for
[SPEAKER_06]: economies of scale to be allowed to happen
to have better access to have more events
[SPEAKER_06]: to continue to have the rights and
privileges that we have then we need to
[SPEAKER_06]: respect them and the second that you do
not respect them then you will have
[SPEAKER_06]: hostility from those agencies and
everybody else will as well there is and
[SPEAKER_06]: we've seen it in every other industry
corruption we have seen it in every other
[SPEAKER_06]: industry money is a pay-to-play situation
there is no situation in life
[SPEAKER_06]: unfortunately that is not pay-to-play so
whereas I empathize I truthfully would
[SPEAKER_06]: love to be able to say that there is a
pathway for everyone but as you've seen
[SPEAKER_06]: that Justin Susan Holden Danny everybody
is working to carve out that pathway do
[SPEAKER_06]: exactly what Doug said to do look at these
jurisdictions there is 482 cities and 58
[SPEAKER_06]: counties in the great state of California
some of them are welcome we love you
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis please come in resurrect our
cities we have a population that voted
[SPEAKER_06]: higher than the state's average population
on 64 we want to regulate and then there
[SPEAKER_06]: are some cities that have a tried and true
tradition of opposing cannabis that had
[SPEAKER_06]: higher than the above the average of no
votes that had urgency ordinances with
[SPEAKER_06]: expressed bans on everything as an
operator it is incumbent upon you to do
[SPEAKER_06]: your due diligence and hire others to help
you do that you are your own best advocate
[SPEAKER_06]: you are the one that's going to foot the
bill at the end of the day so as these
[SPEAKER_06]: cities start to take shape as more data
points are available go to them as I said
[SPEAKER_06]: if you want to throw an event under 20
under 2020 on January 1 or in the new year
[SPEAKER_06]: go to them now and say you know what you
are interested in regulating let me show
[SPEAKER_06]: you what a compliant event can be as Danny
said he started a year a year before he
[SPEAKER_06]: wanted to have the event he was thinking
about planning it and the first thing he
[SPEAKER_06]: said is I educated myself in an industry
that I didn't know information especially
[SPEAKER_06]: in this space is your greatest ally if you
go into a city and you say here's how to
[SPEAKER_06]: be compliant I already went and got my
event organizer license so you know that
[SPEAKER_06]: I've already been cleared by the BCC that
my background is clear that I went through
[SPEAKER_06]: and tried to show you credibility then I
went and sourced a location and that
[SPEAKER_06]: location is supportive of the event that I
want to do I went and found brands that
[SPEAKER_06]: are going to support me that have a
license that are license holders and
[SPEAKER_06]: compliant and you package that up and I'm
sure Danny can speak to this and you go to
[SPEAKER_06]: the city and you tell them what you want
to do you get them interested they become
[SPEAKER_06]: your ally they go to the BCC for you part
of what happened with high times is Joe
[SPEAKER_06]: Devlin the pots are in Sacramento was
supportive of that effort and went to Lori
[SPEAKER_06]: and to the BCC and said this was important
that's not corruption that's called a city
[SPEAKER_06]: getting an ROI and an already favorable
city who was regulating other parts of the
[SPEAKER_06]: supply chain did it go over without a
hitch no right none of them do but every
[SPEAKER_06]: single time is a learning lesson and an
opportunity and if there is one thing that
[SPEAKER_06]: I can leave you with is please do not give
the opposition in these cities exactly
[SPEAKER_06]: what they're asking for which is to point
and say they're conducting illegal
[SPEAKER_06]: activity so not to be a Debbie Downer with
the law but I yeah I am in I am a lawyer I
[SPEAKER_06]: am an officer of the court I am a cannabis
consumer and I just it's hard and I don't
[SPEAKER_06]: take that away from anybody and I don't
like telling people no that's not my
[SPEAKER_06]: favorite thing to do but it is actually my
job how many of you guys have already
[SPEAKER_00]: produced a cannabis event how many of you
have a an event license from the state how
[SPEAKER_06]: many of you are looking to get an event
license and in 2019 I would love to help
[SPEAKER_06]: you truly that shows me that you want to
be a good steward of the industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody in this room should thank you
how many of you are planning on having
[SPEAKER_00]: private events how many of you that are
planning on having private events know
[SPEAKER_06]: exactly what that means would you like me
to explain the difference if you are going
[SPEAKER_06]: to have a dinner party in your private
home and you are not going to be an issue
[SPEAKER_06]: but if it's a private event and the chef
is coming and they've procured cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: elsewhere and you've procured the cannabis
and you're curating the event in your own
[SPEAKER_06]: private space that is fine the BCC cannot
touch it right you're a private residence
[SPEAKER_06]: if you want to call a dispensary delivery
service and have the people individually
[SPEAKER_06]: that are there that's different
[SPEAKER_06]: if it is private and it is not for
cannabis there are potential workarounds
[SPEAKER_06]: that we can discuss about semantics we
want to talk about legal loopholes mojo is
[SPEAKER_06]: making himself right at home I hope that
does not bother everybody so you're having
[SPEAKER_06]: a private event the second that you want
to have vendors come and do interactions
[SPEAKER_06]: with consumers how did those vendors get
to your private event like if we had
[SPEAKER_06]: vendors here this evening and they wanted
to have their product available for you to
[SPEAKER_06]: interact with how do you get how did the
products get into the Emmy banks Danny
[SPEAKER_05]: thank you so for my experience the
acquiring the event license not a big deal
[SPEAKER_05]: it's couple of pages to fill and whatever
provide financial reports and stuff like
[SPEAKER_05]: that I mean for me personally I was
waiting for the life scams and then I
[SPEAKER_05]: started freaking out and calling the BCC
and then I learned that I can get a
[SPEAKER_05]: temporary license yeah the temporary
events license really quickly but the
[SPEAKER_05]: biggest thing was the SOP standard
operating procedures that really means
[SPEAKER_05]: it's the all those areas I guess that
there's no regulations and there is a
[SPEAKER_05]: interpretation of regulation and basically
I'm saying here's how it should work and
[SPEAKER_05]: all your brands the you know decide if you
know that works for you or not because I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: taking responsibility on the process and
this is the hard part I think like you
[SPEAKER_05]: talked about vendors you can do private
event or a legal event or whatnot the
[SPEAKER_05]: vendors need to be happy so it's not just
you getting the license how do you
[SPEAKER_05]: convince the brands mainly compliance
manager that you are working within the
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations yeah and that comes down to
your plan so before we get there just if
[SPEAKER_06]: you're if you're private event in your
home don't sell anything the vendor comes
[SPEAKER_06]: to do interaction how we you know advance
a workaround for that is it goes through
[SPEAKER_06]: quality assurance it goes through a
retailer somebody you pick it up you're
[SPEAKER_06]: the event you purchase your daily
allotment somebody else is working with
[SPEAKER_06]: your company they get it they set it up
and somebody who's a representative can
[SPEAKER_06]: talk about the product but that particular
vendor cannot bring with them product that
[SPEAKER_06]: they have made at their lawful licensed
facility without going through a
[SPEAKER_06]: distributor who's responsible for the
quality assurance and the in the quality
[SPEAKER_06]: control check and going through a retailer
and having that product go through excise
[SPEAKER_06]: tap you know go through the whole system
and if you're doing an event license where
[SPEAKER_06]: you are licensed to do so to do so like in
Hall of Flowers you have to work with
[SPEAKER_06]: these brands to make sure that there is a
way for that clearance to happen and that
[SPEAKER_06]: process to go through so you work with
either a streamline distributor or now
[SPEAKER_06]: that we have SB 311 and distro to distro
transfer will make that event I'm sure
[SPEAKER_06]: even easier next year and so everybody has
to sign on everybody has to agree
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody has to provide to the event
organizer their license and their BCC car
[SPEAKER_06]: their agency's number and then as we enter
this new year and it's a momentous new
[SPEAKER_06]: week where the B or not the BCC but DPH
and DFA have both issued their first
[SPEAKER_06]: annual permit which means in 30 days
metric is upon us and that is going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: even more difficult for these sort of
quasi legal pop-up events to occur as more
[SPEAKER_06]: and more businesses become online for
track and trace it is going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: exceedingly difficult to show what
happened to this product if it did not
[SPEAKER_06]: emerge throughout the entire supply chain
the way it is intended so if you're having
[SPEAKER_06]: an event that is open to the public that
has consumption and sales you need to be
[SPEAKER_06]: an event organizer and set up an event
license do the SOPs work with the local
[SPEAKER_06]: jurisdiction that's going to be your
threshold right so you need that local
[SPEAKER_06]: authorization go through get the
credibility get the event organizer
[SPEAKER_06]: license draft up your SOPs go to the city
say this is the plan that I have if they
[SPEAKER_06]: have a process if they don't have a
process if they have a process to issue
[SPEAKER_06]: alcohol temporary alcohol permits if they
have a temporary events rhetoric in their
[SPEAKER_06]: existing ordinances then say this is just
another widget this is just another event
[SPEAKER_06]: it simply is cannabis and we've already
taken care of the devil in the details and
[SPEAKER_06]: here is the plan and I tell you that will
motivate an already motivated city
[SPEAKER_06]: one of your underage children it's just in
the hypothetical world it may have been an
[SPEAKER_02]: 18 year old exchange before and your non
infused lemonade yeah you're I look you're
[SPEAKER_06]: a parent your responsibility to your
children is yours now if you are at a BCC
[SPEAKER_06]: sanctioned temporary event you are not
supposed to have minors present so no if
[SPEAKER_06]: it's your private event then that 's going
to be an issue if somebody were to turn
[SPEAKER_06]: you in if you were going through a divorce
that could be used against you absolutely
[SPEAKER_06]: but barring that that's not cannabis
though look we're talking family law we're
[SPEAKER_06]: talking the difference between family law
and cannabis law cannabis law doesn't
[SPEAKER_06]: concern itself with that because it says
we don't regulate true private events
[SPEAKER_06]: that's doesn't mean the rest of the
California legal system doesn't see that
[SPEAKER_06]: there may be an issue there that I cannot
opine on and to Peter's question can I
[SPEAKER_06]: tell you all of the gray areas if cannabis
is a commodity information in my head is
[SPEAKER_06]: plus every circumstance is different and
the gray is is nigh we want to find a
[SPEAKER_04]: legal loophole I don't consider that the
gray what is the legality behind growing
[SPEAKER_04]: weed at your house and bringing it to an
event can I bring my own personal weed I
[SPEAKER_04]: grew at home and how much of that and
let's say that the ticket included some
[SPEAKER_04]: weed that I grew at home is that a
loophole is that real no well because
[SPEAKER_06]: here's the difference you're talking about
two different things one is if you are you
[SPEAKER_06]: don't you're an adult 21 years or over you
are entitled to grow six plants right the
[SPEAKER_06]: regulators though the municipalities are
entitled to regulate what that means we
[SPEAKER_06]: responsibly without banning it within
their jurisdictions it's a point that the
[SPEAKER_06]: city is often in or the local
jurisdictions often grapple with because
[SPEAKER_06]: what does that mean that means that it
needs to be shielded it meets bill of
[SPEAKER_06]: building codes you know residential
building codes that you're not harming
[SPEAKER_06]: your neighbor that is your right you can
grow those six plants you can buy the
[SPEAKER_06]: clones at the dispensaries that is all
lawful you can take that product and you
[SPEAKER_06]: can give it away to anybody that is around
you that is 21 years of age or older which
[SPEAKER_06]: you cannot do that under a brand no
because that would be conducting
[SPEAKER_06]: commercial cannabis activity and if you're
conducting commercial care are you gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: sell it what if it was just promotional
like these joints let's say these joints
[SPEAKER_04]: they're just promotional right so what's
the difference between me rolling the
[SPEAKER_04]: joints with the weed I grew at my house
and coming out and giving my friend a
[SPEAKER_04]: joint saying this is Dougie's joints
what's stop if you want to give people
[SPEAKER_00]: away your he's talking Martha Stewart
style it's homegrown but really fancy
[SPEAKER_06]: stickers it's fancy see if you're not
selling it and you're giving it away there
[SPEAKER_06]: is a that's a marginally gray area but if
you start branding but you got to wait
[SPEAKER_06]: because the bureau let's let's also think
about it this way you can only grow so
[SPEAKER_06]: much because you're only allowed your six
plants and also the bureau just came out
[SPEAKER_06]: with language against technology platforms
that are acting like a duck and trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: be a cat and saying if you are confusing
the consumer because let us remember the
[SPEAKER_06]: Department of Consumer Affairs is the
parent to the Bureau of Cannabis Control
[SPEAKER_06]: what is the main purpose and function of
the Department of Consumer Affairs to
[SPEAKER_06]: ensure that consumers in California are
not confused or misled or defrauded so if
[SPEAKER_06]: you are in essence appearing because
remember appearance or the likelihood of
[SPEAKER_06]: children or any of those things is in fact
enough to cause you to lose your license
[SPEAKER_06]: so if you are going to avail yourself of
looking like you are a commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: actor then yes that's walk in the fine
line in the wrong direction if you're
[SPEAKER_06]: given away enough joints where you got a
house full of weed that's way more than
[SPEAKER_06]: six your six plants can produce then
you're violating law so whereas they say
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a gray area if you just want to be
like a good sport growing your six plants
[SPEAKER_06]: and giving a product away I have friends
that do that and that's perfectly
[SPEAKER_06]: legitimately fine but the second you're
trying to make a duck act like a cat the
[SPEAKER_06]: Bureau is staffing up enforcement they got
some of the best social media I've ever
[SPEAKER_06]: seen I'd like to hire them for my business
but they just post all the time and who
[SPEAKER_06]: are they who are they hiring just today a
laundry list of enforcement agents and
[SPEAKER_06]: they shut down an operator in LA in the
city of LA that was a falsely conducting
[SPEAKER_06]: commercial cannabis activity took two
million dollars worth of product and is
[SPEAKER_06]: going to find them they are not playing
around anymore they are regulating the
[SPEAKER_06]: industry so legal loopholes are different
than trying to squeeze a you know a pea
[SPEAKER_06]: through you know a watermelon through the
size of something that's a pea they're
[SPEAKER_06]: they're different
[SPEAKER_05]: why do you have on your finger the tool
that associated you with the legal market
[SPEAKER_04]: so it's on my middle finger I have a
tattoo which is the regulated cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: thing universal symbol packaging on my
middle finger because this is my opinion
[SPEAKER_04]: of their job and and you know their
approach to the whole thing I think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: garbage again and this is my mixed
emotions with your bullshit BCC
[SPEAKER_00]: don't be mad so I wanted you say legal I
want to do a plug for public comment
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody in here seems like they're
really interested in events we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: make some noise Laurie kind of stuttered
and said we may or may not listen to you
[SPEAKER_00]: at NCIA's conference or she said we may
they're gonna listen to us there they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna make any changes is what she said
but I wanted to just throw this out there
[SPEAKER_00]: to put some ideas in your head for your
public comments there's close to a hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: different license types for alcohol there
should be a thousand times more for
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis because alcohol is alcohol you
drink it that's it you know cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: way more complex and Laurie Ajax came from
the ABC she knows this stuff one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things I really would love to see is an
instruction or tasting license they have
[SPEAKER_00]: that for alcohol why can't we have that
for cannabis instructional tasting you
[SPEAKER_00]: know consumption only you know we need to
come up with some some really good
[SPEAKER_06]: suggestions and make some comments and
even if they don't happen this time around
[SPEAKER_06]: the bureau is vested with the right to
create new license types actually all of
[SPEAKER_06]: the agencies are and not just during
rulemaking so this is not a fight that if
[SPEAKER_06]: we don't win today we can't win the war
situation so I don't want people to lose
[SPEAKER_06]: momentum if we don't see substantial
changes between now and when the official
[SPEAKER_06]: package goes to the office of
administrative law on the third of
[SPEAKER_06]: December these ideas of creating more
license types that make the market more
[SPEAKER_06]: palatable are definitely still there and
then we are gonna gear up for the
[SPEAKER_06]: legislative session of 2019 so I want to
take all the great momentum and make sure
[SPEAKER_06]: that it permeates through the entire next
year but with that Justin you want to talk
[SPEAKER_06]: about the Emerald Exchange
[SPEAKER_06]: for as a disclaimer there is no official
legal advice being exchanged I am simply
[SPEAKER_02]: giving my opinion it is once you are
retained
[SPEAKER_02]: on November 10th we're going to be doing
an Emerald Exchange the city of Santa
[SPEAKER_02]: Monica signed off on it they're allowing
us to do it they're allowing us to consume
[SPEAKER_02]: on site the chief of police said that he
sees no difference between cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking and cigarette smoking as long as
it's not done within a 20 feet of a window
[SPEAKER_02]: a vent or a doorway we can smoke weed so
we are gonna bring our farmers market back
[SPEAKER_02]: to Santa Monica or to Santa Monica for the
first time is the first time there's gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: be some of like a cannabis market in Santa
Monica in the same space where they do the
[SPEAKER_02]: weekly food farmers market which is gonna
be pretty sweet and our loophole
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially is we have partnered with herb
delivery herb delivery is going to be on
[SPEAKER_02]: site you have not partnered okay they have
come on to support us and okay thank you
[SPEAKER_02]: there you go see this is exactly why I'm
doing it can you edit that okay yeah so we
[SPEAKER_06]: are not partnered they are in a dispensary
that is a available to deliver to that
[SPEAKER_02]: location okay so what we are gonna be
doing is essentially you're gonna be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to see the product and then you're you're
going to be able to place orders right and
[SPEAKER_02]: herb is going to deliver it on site is
that correct how is the product getting
[SPEAKER_06]: there it's going to be ordered no no no I
get that so under the emergency
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations and there's a very big
difference right the permanent regulations
[SPEAKER_06]: going to affect some time in January right
now we are living under the readopted
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations and under the readopted
regulations you can have up to ten
[SPEAKER_06]: thousand dollars worth of product in your
delivery truck and as long as you're
[SPEAKER_06]: receiving orders from those that are 21
years of age or older you can be out for
[SPEAKER_06]: 30 minutes returning fulfilling orders now
point of fact this will not not work into
[SPEAKER_06]: 2019 if the regulations stay the way that
they are currently presented because
[SPEAKER_06]: dynamic delivery is significantly lessened
and there are more restrictions so during
[SPEAKER_06]: the emergency regulation period if people
that were attending this allowable
[SPEAKER_06]: consumption event happened to go on to an
app and happen to be able to place an
[SPEAKER_06]: order that delivery car from that licensed
delivery service can keep continually
[SPEAKER_06]: taking orders as long as they are
delivering to an address within the state
[SPEAKER_06]: of California that is a residence that is
an approved residence now I want to go
[SPEAKER_06]: back to the point where we were having
some product that is being displayed how
[SPEAKER_06]: are we getting said product there no no no
so the temporary that then type 9 delivery
[SPEAKER_06]: service has the product it's gone through
a distributor it's in their facility so
[SPEAKER_06]: there is no actual accept product that is
your personal that will be there that will
[SPEAKER_06]: be there right so there's no like there
can be education there can be educational
[SPEAKER_06]: things there but not cannabis there can be
empty cannabis branding things there can
[SPEAKER_06]: be up the quasi all that you want but you
cannot take right but or you can't have it
[SPEAKER_06]: on display either that's what I'm saying
it has to be the empty boxes the outposts
[SPEAKER_02]: thing all of that you'll see the empty
outpost that's what we call our hero
[SPEAKER_02]: outpost and it is empty empty no cannabis
products no cannabis product right but you
[SPEAKER_06]: can have education and you can talk about
them and then the products that are
[SPEAKER_06]: lawfully you can't display it because he's
not an event licensee this is a private
[SPEAKER_06]: event at a private residence that allows
for smoking and is a venue that is used
[SPEAKER_06]: for that activity that has been approved
by the local jurisdiction for only that
[SPEAKER_06]: activity so they don't have a ban on
consumption as we do in the city of Los
[SPEAKER_06]: Angeles actually they are saying the city
is saying this is used as a smoking area
[SPEAKER_06]: for this is my understanding I have not
spoken to the city I have not reviewed the
[SPEAKER_06]: contracts this is hypothetically we're
talking about so if that city has approved
[SPEAKER_06]: that there will be consumption there that
is not being the cannabis is not being
[SPEAKER_06]: provided but by the people that are
throwing the event and you're just they're
[SPEAKER_06]: equating cigarette smoke to cannabis smoke
and you're filing all of those rules
[SPEAKER_06]: because the second that you do not then
they can come in and enforce you cannot
[SPEAKER_06]: have any displayed cannabis like you did
at your event unless it was you know
[SPEAKER_06]: pre-purchased at a dispensary and they're
just it's a private event but in this case
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't even suggest that given that
the city has said that this is a public
[SPEAKER_06]: you know place that you're used for
consumption now because you can deliver
[SPEAKER_06]: anywhere under the temporary emergency
readopted regulation and you've got that
[SPEAKER_06]: ten thousand dollar thing and you've got
individuals ordering their individual
[SPEAKER_06]: orders going to them that is purely only
consumption you do not have a deal with
[SPEAKER_06]: them you do not have an agreement with
them they're just what people are talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about at the event going on to that
dispensary's website that delivery
[SPEAKER_06]: services website placing orders again this
will not work under the permanent
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations because you have significantly
less product that can be in the car it was
[SPEAKER_06]: now taken from ten thousand dollars in a
payload to five and only three thousand of
[SPEAKER_06]: that cannot be pre-ordered product but
then they clarified the BCC made an even
[SPEAKER_06]: further clarification that you can deliver
anywhere in California as long as you are
[SPEAKER_06]: following the delivery protocols in this
regulation it did not say follow the
[SPEAKER_06]: directions in this regulation which would
mean that you need local authorization so
[SPEAKER_06]: we may see some interesting pushback from
the League of Cities because they further
[SPEAKER_06]: clarified that you can deliver anywhere
into California so for Victorville for
[SPEAKER_06]: Doug they no longer will be able to bank
delivery under the proposed draft
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations as they are it's somewhat
ambiguous now although those would argue
[SPEAKER_06]: that that's exactly what they did in
advancing the readopted regulations so or
[SPEAKER_06]: the draft permanent regulations so we're
gay oh sorry hypothetically without any
[SPEAKER_06]: other details and I have many many many
more questions with all of the disclaimers
[SPEAKER_06]: that I have made you're heading in a
potentially viable direction
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a lot of caveats but you can see
if you start the conversation with the
[SPEAKER_06]: city if you use the laws and engineer them
creatively to meet those stringent
[SPEAKER_06]: requirements there are pathways and from
pathways come experiences that are
[SPEAKER_06]: positive which then may lead the city of
Santa Monica to develop a specific events
[SPEAKER_06]: license that allows you to do this event
with sales why because you listen to them
[SPEAKER_06]: you did the event the way that it was
supposed to be done in the most compliant
[SPEAKER_06]: manner and we can talk about that possible
and then you're gonna develop a rapport
[SPEAKER_06]: with the city can I sell tickets you can
sell tickets to the event that is just an
[SPEAKER_06]: educational bringing together of people to
have a cannabis and you can have food
[SPEAKER_06]: there that is not cannabis infused you
cannot sell tickets to the right to be
[SPEAKER_06]: able to call that delivery service in any
way shape or form because the city
[SPEAKER_02]: probably already said no but we switched
the name to a mixer versus a market and we
[SPEAKER_02]: created an event bright page to sell
tickets that's you an event where you can
[SPEAKER_06]: consume cannabis which you chew a mixer to
a bringing together of people that can
[SPEAKER_06]: consume cannabis not that you will be
providing in any way shape or form that we
[SPEAKER_02]: want so we eat at this event I did say
that with an actual face I won't sell any
[SPEAKER_06]: weed at this event at the event with a
large asterisk of all of the legal
[SPEAKER_06]: disclaimers and things that we need to put
into place I'm sorry I don't have the
[SPEAKER_02]: tattoo yet no okay but yes we will not
sell weed at the event what yeah no it's
[SPEAKER_06]: it's we've got to do a lot of things to
prove that we get the with responsibility
[SPEAKER_06]: you got it you got to do it you got to be
able to know what you want and scale back
[SPEAKER_06]: to what you can do to eventually get to
what you want and it's a hard thing to do
[SPEAKER_06]: it really is and I don't say it in an easy
way it's an exercise where you have to
[SPEAKER_06]: keep going back and forth and talk about
the same hypothetical and say okay so we
[SPEAKER_06]: did this and that gets me to here and then
I'm gonna go here and I want to make sure
[SPEAKER_06]: that this is very clear that I am not
confusing consumers about what they are
[SPEAKER_06]: purchasing a ticket for because the other
thing that I'm going to leave you with is
[SPEAKER_06]: your actions the BCC a you do something
illegal you can be banned from ever
[SPEAKER_06]: getting into the cannabis industry okay
and expungement works going backwards not
[SPEAKER_06]: when you do something you know is wrong
today right and the fines for that with
[SPEAKER_06]: the BCC are about what are they it's the
the fee plus half of what you should have
[SPEAKER_06]: paid in the in the amount of money that
you made so you're paying them money and
[SPEAKER_06]: then you're never allowed to operate in
this space again because when you go to
[SPEAKER_06]: every other jurisdiction in this country
and outside of this country they ask you
[SPEAKER_06]: if you've ever been convicted of a
cannabis issue and if it's a cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: issue after there was compliance in your
state I promise you it will be 15 to 20
[SPEAKER_06]: years before that is not held against you
if that is even when they start having
[SPEAKER_06]: that conversation I'm a real Debbie Downer
today but to lighten it up there are ways
[SPEAKER_06]: look this is a creative dynamic discussion
I'm sure there's discussions that Danny
[SPEAKER_06]: and Green Street and those attorneys had
is you keep going over it until you get to
[SPEAKER_06]: a point where you are comfortable with how
that protocol works and how you're
[SPEAKER_06]: presenting it to the public because that's
really the difference between a public and
[SPEAKER_06]: private event a consumption event and an
event where you have sales and so you got
[SPEAKER_06]: to walk it through multiple times like at
nauseam times and then you're gonna be
[SPEAKER_06]: you're gonna see wins and there are wins
and there are movement the needle is
[SPEAKER_06]: moving it is slow and it is difficult but
it is moving and can I just say that
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that happens at your private
event is going to be on the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: especially the stuff that you don't yes to
be on the internet and the city's and the
[SPEAKER_00]: BCC is watching the internet they are I
got spanked you know they are holding my
[SPEAKER_03]: so obviously I do I mean we're not in a
space where real I guess cannabis cuisine
[SPEAKER_03]: is truly legal but let's just say from
someone who's not in the space like a
[SPEAKER_03]: caterer that's outside that wants to
perhaps you know cater an event not in an
[SPEAKER_03]: infused fashion but just producing food at
these events do they run greater risks
[SPEAKER_03]: than they would and in the natural space
like through are they are they held to two
[SPEAKER_03]: different taxation brackets or anything
like that or is there any any of the BCC
[SPEAKER_03]: like influence is going to be like felt on
their end for as a normal catering
[SPEAKER_03]: business not like something like I was a
co-op event I mean at a certain point
[SPEAKER_03]: right you were collected and honestly now
you know we work exclusively with cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: brands but you know there are people that
that are you know chefs and caterers that
[SPEAKER_03]: are in my periphery that aren't in the
space don't and and are hesitant to take
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these jobs because of working with
the cannabis money in the first place and
[SPEAKER_06]: like running it through their their
avenues yeah the the taxation and how that
[SPEAKER_06]: affects your business unfortunately tax is
not my area of specialty it's very
[SPEAKER_06]: complicated as a general specialty even
more so when it comes to cannabis so I
[SPEAKER_06]: would refer you to a good tax professional
that would help you with that they run
[SPEAKER_03]: risks of their licenses with cannabis
being at these events and you know maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: not all of the there's gonna be a
difference between all the time let's say
[SPEAKER_03]: like let's say there's an illegal cannabis
activity going on and the person that's
[SPEAKER_03]: there catering worst-case scenario and
something happens there what what kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: risks are they running like added risks of
it being at a cannabis event the caterer
[SPEAKER_03]: is like like you know as as somebody you
know who would be caught in the crosshairs
[SPEAKER_03]: or something like that I'm not I'm not I'm
not necessarily worried about myself I
[SPEAKER_06]: mean no I I know that you're asking a
question I got into cannabis when the
[SPEAKER_06]: affirmative defense and criminal law was
not the that's not my area my area is land
[SPEAKER_06]: use sequel licensing and regulation but
what I will tell you is you know be
[SPEAKER_06]: responsible ask questions if you're going
somewhere and it feels wrong it usually is
[SPEAKER_06]: if you are conducting a private event you
know you're going and for the most part
[SPEAKER_06]: you're procuring your allotted allowance
of the cannabis and then you're curating
[SPEAKER_06]: this event in a private in a private space
for a dinner party has there been any test
[SPEAKER_03]: issues with that like in the private home
things going poorly or anything like that
[SPEAKER_03]: that people have actually you know gone
yeah it'll affect your insurance I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily I don't necessarily know if
I've answered the questions to the fullest
[SPEAKER_03]: satisfaction of what you're covered for
look you they played up ask you if there's
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis at these events now when you when
you get insurance for these things but I
[SPEAKER_06]: mean that's and then that that answers
your own question right if somebody saying
[SPEAKER_06]: they can't ensure you in that situation
then you're putting yourself you know in
[SPEAKER_06]: in where there's liability there is
cannabis if you're the one that's
[SPEAKER_06]: producing this product and you know this
is why testing became a thing in
[SPEAKER_06]: California and why testing is so important
everywhere if you're over can over serving
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody the same way if you were to over
serve somebody in you know in a house
[SPEAKER_06]: liquor and they leave you know a bar is
responsible for that but I pulled plenty
[SPEAKER_03]: of temporary license for ABC and like the
worst they do is just shut you down and
[SPEAKER_03]: take the license and maybe there will be a
small fine but it's it's I mean I feel
[SPEAKER_06]: like alcohol is light years away from
where we are in cannabis and you've got to
[SPEAKER_06]: be responsible with your business and and
with who you choose to do business with
[SPEAKER_06]: and how you choose to do that business I
my error specialty is working with
[SPEAKER_06]: licensees so you're really asking some you
know bright line rules between accounting
[SPEAKER_06]: and you know where the line is with yeah
there's a way there's certainly ways to do
[SPEAKER_06]: it and there's but like we said private
events consumption events where there is
[SPEAKER_06]: no sale these are different somebody's
throwing a dinner party you go same as if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're serving alcohol what I mean are
there are you think hosts should be
[SPEAKER_03]: hesitant and things like that I mean I
think host should be as responsible as
[SPEAKER_06]: they would be by opening the same amount
of mind-altering substance as they would
[SPEAKER_06]: if they were serving wine if you're
serving people 60 milligrams of marijuana
[SPEAKER_06]: throughout a meal and there's not enough
time and you don't know what everybody's
[SPEAKER_06]: endocannabinoid system is would you give
everybody a bottle of wine to drink I
[SPEAKER_06]: think that's where that's where the host
needs to be responsible and that's also
[SPEAKER_06]: where responsible you know cannabis chefs
come in and they curate a meal and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: enhancing and it's like having alcohol I
would be you know remiss to say that I
[SPEAKER_06]: think there's not ever a concern where
you're mixing substances potentially but
[SPEAKER_06]: you know have waivers people have dinner
parties they have waivers this is a new
[SPEAKER_06]: area it's important to protect yourself
and your business as you move throughout
[SPEAKER_06]: this process and there's ways for you to
do that so I think let's wrap it up you
don't know
