[SPEAKER_00]: We were talking and you said, oh,
you know, one of my beds or one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms has 19 cycles on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started trying to kind of crank out
the math on what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, I don't know how
many is doing this, three, four years,
[SPEAKER_00]: five years that you're putting into this
medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see that here outside all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the indoor environment,
that's not common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on any kind of scale, it's even more
rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple people you know that are
doing this small scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what kind of inspired you to jump into
that?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was really a number of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Getting introduced to permaculture was
like getting introduced to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: but for different reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: The same reasons, ways cannabis helped me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I felt like permaculture would help the
planet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then when we were put these obstacles
in front of us with our state regulations
[SPEAKER_05]: versus trying to bump our heads against
them, we try to work with them the best we
[SPEAKER_05]: can and adapt how we operate, how we do
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And indoor was one of the biggest
challenges we had to face.
[SPEAKER_05]: With the microbial testing, they weren't
really allowing us to really even
[SPEAKER_05]: entertain outdoor, even greenhouse for the
most part.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it really forced us to put our focus on
indoors and just being the most
[SPEAKER_05]: sustainable, regenerative as possible
indoor facility on the planet was kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: our goal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It had a lot of help.
[SPEAKER_05]: It didn't do it solo.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was definitely a journey and we're
still learning until the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when all this culminated and you
actually getting a facility and running
[SPEAKER_00]: it, was it you more coming from the
permaculture farming, gardening background
[SPEAKER_00]: or the indoor cultivation background or
neither?
[SPEAKER_05]: So for me, I was a medical man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wanted a patient.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hate to use the M word outside of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what they call it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, so I was on the patient program.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was strictly just growing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've grown food as a kid.
[SPEAKER_05]: I grew up in a farming community.
[SPEAKER_05]: People like to farm where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody has a little vegetable garden in
the backyard.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's kind of the culture I came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for the most part, I came as a patient
into the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my thing was more as a medicine,
plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when I was introduced to
permaculture, I saw that as, again,
[SPEAKER_05]: a medicine for the planet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just kind of thought putting the two
together, that's like, okay, we've got
[SPEAKER_05]: this gateway drug or gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's make it a gateway drug to sustain
the ability in permaculture and
[SPEAKER_05]: regenerative farming.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we try to put those two together and
really use cannabis as this lead to
[SPEAKER_05]: introduce people to this save the world
methodologies.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of good research out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to follow more Elaine on some of the
things she said and try to adapt what she
[SPEAKER_05]: says to indoor situations.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: What would be an example?
[SPEAKER_05]: As far as, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like something Elaine, an idea she had
that you then translated to indoor?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, just the soil food web in general,
how to manage it in beds.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a lot of the things that she does
outdoors, dealing with the seasons and the
[SPEAKER_05]: seasonal changes and just a lot of the
things that she's incorporated,
[SPEAKER_05]: we could incorporate those indoors,
just put a little spin on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what I've been tripping
off of as we kind of start talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: an actual soil food web and a living soil
system indoors is whether it be pollinator
[SPEAKER_00]: crops or whatever outdoors, we can bring
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can attract things in a way that's a
little bit difficult indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you achieve that really by bringing
these things into your garden?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we can bring anything into our garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could buy any bug on the planet and
bring it to my garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's not really a sustainable model.
[SPEAKER_05]: The idea is if we do inoculate our
facility, whether it be with a
[SPEAKER_05]: microorganism or some type of predator,
that we can keep it around and sustain it
[SPEAKER_05]: and potentially even finish its life cycle
so that we don't have to keep purchasing
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's been kind of my goal is to not
just focus on what's in nature,
[SPEAKER_05]: but how do I replicate it to where I can
finish not just a plant's life cycle,
[SPEAKER_05]: but all the beneficial microorganisms and
organisms' life cycles that are also
[SPEAKER_05]: involved in this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I see that very much in my own
garden spaces is that if I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: purchase something, I want it to be kind
of a one-time thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it thrives, then great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it doesn't, then I need to reassess
the situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys kind of just see a similar
thing in terms of how you build these
[SPEAKER_00]: systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess you're fortunate on the one
hand that that indoor cultivation probably
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe affords you certain flexibility as
far as pest management and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Certain control mechanisms we're able to
do indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we run a lot of the same strategies.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, we were able to catch to track
better data indoors because we don't have
[SPEAKER_05]: so many variables as the outdoor people
do.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've actually covered a lot of ground,
again, just using the same exact
[SPEAKER_05]: techniques just on an indoor model.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, my biggest thing right now is,
again, is just not having to re-inoculate
[SPEAKER_05]: because, again, that's not sustainable if
I have to have a bug truck show up every
[SPEAKER_05]: week and drop bugs from God knows where
they came from.
[SPEAKER_05]: So our thing right now is just to keep
things alive.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like everybody's real pumped on
living soils and living systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the truth of the matter is we're all
growing and dying soils and dying systems
[SPEAKER_05]: because we're so focused on the life cycle
of the plant that we're forgetting that
[SPEAKER_05]: there's organisms in our soil,
organisms below our crop that also have a
[SPEAKER_05]: life cycle that needs to be finished.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how do we take them into consideration
and still maintain a profitable business?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's one thing I've done is just
really try to map out a good system that
[SPEAKER_05]: models nature so we can allow all those
things to happen, the strong survive,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then they have a place in our system.
[SPEAKER_05]: But everything has a place in our system.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that I was kind of,
as I've been wrapping my head around this
[SPEAKER_00]: idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how deep of beds kind of roughly are
we talking in most of your systems?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have our facility right now in front
of our flagship facility.
[SPEAKER_05]: Me and my buddy, Matt Davenport,
actually, back in the day, when designing
[SPEAKER_05]: the beds, we actually went extra deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were like, man, this is still so new.
[SPEAKER_05]: The less soil, the better, the less
cushion we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we basically, I believe they're 18 or
20 inch beds deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's way more soil than I technically
need.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, I'm not that good of a
gardener.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it allows me to have some flexibility.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't have to be so on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then the reason I ask that question
is now I'm starting to think of volume of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like way higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the size of your facility,
a much higher amount of medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granted, you're not switching that media
all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that there's a big deal on
that end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're LED, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how do you feel that, have you
raised your room's temperatures to
[SPEAKER_00]: compensate for that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a great question, by the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if people catch that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so we run a warmer air temp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Back in the day, using the HID,
we typically run from 78 to 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we get the leaf surface
temperature right about where you want it,
[SPEAKER_05]: 81, 83 kind of range.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with the LEDs, they run so much
cooler, you have to raise your air
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature to achieve a good leaf surface
temperature.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, so we typically run our rooms
anywhere from 81 to 83, depending on
[SPEAKER_05]: season.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, that's kind of our sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something I definitely,
it's my only positive I really could throw
[SPEAKER_00]: out there for pots in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Setting it was really when we're talking
about more uncontrolled spaces is that
[SPEAKER_00]: allows greater sides in terms of surface
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting a little bit faster
warming up to the media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the indoor setting and LED,
do you guys feel like your media just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of holds a fairly consistent temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get cold or?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, indoors, we haven't seen much
change because our beds are off the
[SPEAKER_05]: ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel like if we're doing a greenhouse
project right now, we plan on slamming the
[SPEAKER_05]: beds on the ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to do some radiant bed
heating in the beds just to maintain soil
[SPEAKER_05]: temperature in the wintertime.
[SPEAKER_05]: But indoors, we haven't seen a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, we run the same cycle over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we really don't see much change in the
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The radiant heat definitely changed the
whole dynamic for me as far as growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking forward to playing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really exciting and just seems so
much more efficient to actually heat this
[SPEAKER_00]: giant sink, you know, heat sink that can
let off that heat slowly as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get the air or something like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, that's awesome to hear and it's
just about making it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know that for like for some of
my people that are trying to go with more
[SPEAKER_00]: regenerative approaches and indoors,
they catch a certain flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're like, well, you're
growing indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, but people don't work in their
confines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's so interesting to talk to
somebody that's kind of that's doing
[SPEAKER_00]: something like this is how we can meld
these worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And work from there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if I could grow outdoors,
I would, you know, so I was kind of pushed
[SPEAKER_05]: to the indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, I mean, it's really at the
end of the day, it's what are your
[SPEAKER_05]: intentions?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not growing indoors because I think it
grows a better crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not growing no till because I think it
has marketability.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing the best I can with what I have.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my intentions aren't I would have grown
a lesser quality product the same way and
[SPEAKER_05]: still been just as happy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just how it so happens to turn out
that this process creates a superior
[SPEAKER_05]: quality product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's just more of a byproduct to the
whole point of why we do this,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I mean, that's also spot on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really I see that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's I think it's a lot more
commonplace for people to wrap their mind
[SPEAKER_00]: around outdoor being grown in that fashion
versus the indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a trip like this is just it's it's
my two separate worlds coming together in
[SPEAKER_00]: a way that they like they haven't for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they aren't for other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I've transitioned from the
indoor to organic living beds or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't like transition that right
into an indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mind was still on fucking pots and
indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a big fan of beds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do I do like beds indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think it's a huge crucial.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done pots as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just too much to manage too many micro
micro environments.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hey, buddy, I was warned not to pet this
cat, but he seemed like he's friendly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they said he had to actively touch
his back and stomach.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen how people pet him.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still nervous.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see you guys started petting you,
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did he bring herbs?
[SPEAKER_00]: Larry, Lawrence, you got herbs?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got something?
[SPEAKER_00]: You got something?
[SPEAKER_00]: Some outdoor moves?
[SPEAKER_02]: Show him some of what you grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you got?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what these guys grew.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been enjoying smoking this.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is you guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, this is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can smell that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is mimosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's black garlic.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some seed crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's some friend of ours.
[SPEAKER_05]: It almost has like a super lemon kind of
this to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's it's really enjoyable for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like super not marketable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unlike all the marketable stuff,
I've been like, that's what it's already
[SPEAKER_00]: like two times.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk about the marketable versus the stuff
you like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah, that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what do you like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you do you do you grow for market the
stuff that you would smoke yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you got to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Mimosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so John, what's the question?
[SPEAKER_00]: See how you have a smoker or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, oh, as far as, oh, what I guess we're
rolling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I realize this certain hypocrisy that I
got going on recently that were where I
[SPEAKER_00]: like the the strains that I that I grow
that I sell the most of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I have these other varieties that
I love and I think are wonderful like
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but because they have they're less
photogenic or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their name isn't hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not in the right family.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they don't they don't have market
play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as such, I'm like speaking about how
awesome these these strains are and how
[SPEAKER_00]: more people should consume them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not really putting them out to the
market because I got to go through these
[SPEAKER_00]: channels and get distribution and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're saying, no, that won't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'll just sit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see for yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see for yourself?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's very similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I remember when we first opened
up, I tried to grow everything that I
[SPEAKER_05]: liked.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be honest, it's always changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, in Vegas, I thought it was going
to be more of a sativa dominant city
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's the city that goes all night,
you know.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I came out with a bunch of sativas,
but everybody wanted to get knocked out
[SPEAKER_05]: with OGs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then so then we switched up our
catalog.
[SPEAKER_05]: We started growing a bunch of heavy
indicas.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then everybody kind of came around,
was tired of falling asleep at eight o
[SPEAKER_05]: 'clock and was asking for sativas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like you're constantly going to be
behind the ball.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what I found is it's always have your
finger on at least a little bit of the
[SPEAKER_05]: hype just to stay relevant, just get
people's attention.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's also to try to create your own
hype.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I mean, a fight's not a fight
unless you can create hype and you can
[SPEAKER_05]: sell it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like strains that I like, I'll try to
pre-hype them, knowing that, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the market might not respond to them well,
but I'll pre-hype it just so they get
[SPEAKER_05]: excited about it for a minute just so I
have something to smoke that I want to
smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so you guys know what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you got hype, you can sell it for at
least a minute, you know, and hopefully
[SPEAKER_05]: they catch on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nah, but I mean that word, it's like
anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about somebody about hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the other, it wasn't just hype,
it was hustle, hustle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a hustler's a bad thing, but hustling's
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all just fucking semantics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hype, or personal brand versus
reputation.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that term, people were using personal
brand and shit, I was like, what the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel that way with hype is that
if something's good, then it's good and
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll stand on its merit, but still it
needs some kind of, what else do you call
[SPEAKER_00]: it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some kind of pushing out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, it doesn't mean automatically
that it's like some falsehood,
[SPEAKER_00]: some fakeness.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_05]: When I think hype, again, I think more
from a price fighting standpoint.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't sell a fight unless you're
hyperfite.
[SPEAKER_00]: But do you feel like, I mean in the
California market, basically any
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor I talk to, they got a 20%
threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's under 20% THC, they claim it's not
moving, needs to be pennies on the dollar,
[SPEAKER_00]: all that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's the way that the market's
being run right now, though, because it's
[SPEAKER_05]: so focused on test results.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't touch, feel, smoke, taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to then look at the test
results, that piece of paper, and you have
[SPEAKER_05]: to put all your trust into that piece of
paper.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why focusing on your branding helps
kind of break through that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But even us in Vegas, we're a pretty
reputable brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, we try to keep everything above
20%, at least total campaign noise,
[SPEAKER_05]: if not THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just helps move, it just helps them
sell it better.
[SPEAKER_05]: On their standpoint, you got to
understand, from somebody who knows
[SPEAKER_05]: nothing and walks in, again, can't touch,
feel, smoke, they look at the results.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they don't want to have to sit there
and actually work to sell it and have to
[SPEAKER_05]: educate somebody that doesn't know
something.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, it's very test results based.
[SPEAKER_05]: It still is to this day.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you like that's going on in the
Vegas market, and what do you dislike
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going on?
[SPEAKER_05]: What I like is, originally it really did
spark education.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody had to learn about terpenes and
cannabinoid profiles, chemo bars,
[SPEAKER_05]: and all these different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it sparked a huge, huge just knowledge
sharing of everybody just kind of sharing
[SPEAKER_05]: what they were learning.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I don't like is that it's gone
corporate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's only going to get worse when
things go federal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to get better.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely going to get worse.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's trying to have an organic company
in a corporate industry can be challenging
[SPEAKER_05]: at times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you think of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, no, it checks off the boxes,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely got the vag appeal.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's got the nose.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just can't taste it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't feel it yet, but looking forward
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think touching on that point,
how the distribution and retail model is
[SPEAKER_00]: so broken that I'm going to be moving
forward in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I see, I don't really like my
herb trimmed before I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least when it was congregated
together on the traditional market or on
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical market, that's how we always
saw it, is you got your 8th and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled out fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it had been hanging out with its
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's all lonely in this little jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like oxidation, all these
things are sped up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was looking at some of my product
that was dated, that it was packaged in
[SPEAKER_00]: September.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really disappointed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pulled out the same herb when he was
over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I looked at this jarred thing
that he'd sent me to show me the jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what was inside, I was like,
oh, just not super stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's always part of the problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in our standpoint, we package
everything before we sell in eighths,
[SPEAKER_05]: no less.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do a lot of packaging.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really crucial that we make sure
that it's at its highest quality when it
[SPEAKER_05]: goes out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have our packaging room is
environmentally controlled.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not starting off with cured,
good flour, and then packaging dry dust.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we definitely control the environment
in that aspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just try to make sure that selling it in
smaller sizes as well makes people burn
[SPEAKER_05]: through it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We spread ourselves out, so it's not
sitting on the shelves for too long.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we try to have a fast turnover.
[SPEAKER_05]: That also helps with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you serve somebody up too deep and they
have to sit on several packs for six
[SPEAKER_05]: months, and then somebody's getting sick
and later has been sitting in a room at
[SPEAKER_05]: 110 degrees in the desert, you're going to
get some freaking complaints, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It sucks we've had them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, it's not our fault always.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we always try to just do our best that
we can to make sure that it goes out the
[SPEAKER_05]: best that we can send it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we try to put it in glass immediately.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the big thing, too, is I think a
lot of people will, in our situation,
[SPEAKER_05]: put it in plastic bags and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it just dries out, and it just
turns into crap.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: More than anything in the whole world.
[SPEAKER_05]: They shut down the licensing system for
five years since the first time they gave
[SPEAKER_05]: them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife would know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would be wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's got to be over 100.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: They just gave out another 66 licenses for
the first time in about four years at the
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was last year around this time they
gave them out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there were some issues with it as far
as the judging process was found to be
[SPEAKER_05]: corrupt.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was some weird stuff going on
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everything's tied up in court right
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they have 66 licenses that are just
pending until they figure this legal
[SPEAKER_05]: battle out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's definitely a very hard license to
acquire.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know who you got to know or how
much money you got to have.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's not an easy one to get in the
state of Nevada, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you say that your package units,
do you have a manufacturing license to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is that just part of your cultivation
rights?
[SPEAKER_05]: So in the state of Nevada, they have,
I think it's like five million licenses
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cultivation, which allows us to
package our own product.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then it's production, which is like
making oils and edibles and things of that
[SPEAKER_05]: nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Testing and then dispensing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then now they have distribution.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we also have a distribution license,
which we're really excited about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which I think a lot of people here should
really be focused on.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that could be that one connecting
factor where a good organic distribution
[SPEAKER_05]: company, like that's how the alcohol
companies do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have distribution companies that they
sell all their shit through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for us, it's tricky because it
seems like it really is split up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that we as cultivators can't package
unless we have somehow a manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: license.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, most of us don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they make it a challenge to get both?
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't delved into it enough to tell
you how hard it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a lot of ADA compliance
stuff, which for us in the mountains
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes tricky sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was an existing cultivator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to work around some of those
issues on the cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'd imagine if I brought in packaging
with the co-manufacturing, then all of a
[SPEAKER_00]: sudden I would be in a new place.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to see that happen more in
cities.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't realize that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a challenge, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't really make sense either in
any way, shape, or form.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see how they can justify that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a trap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because then we end up being a little bit
at the mercy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can go and get separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Packaging, done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times it's done with the
destro.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're tagging on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden it's kind of their
label with yours on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just kind of how it becomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's slippery slope into the whole
white label.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's definitely causing a problem for
branding.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's 100%.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can see that being an issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a big shift for us to realize,
OK, we need to do more of our own jarring
[SPEAKER_00]: and marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it costs us, we make more
money if we just sell the flower to
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who's going to put their label on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't work out well in the long
term.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was our thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Early on we had a lot of pushback.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everybody wanted to run more like a
Starbucks model in Nevada at first,
[SPEAKER_05]: where nobody knows where the beans come
from.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're at Starbucks, shut up at Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was kind of what they were going
for.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'd get pushback like, no,
we really need you to put it in our glass
[SPEAKER_05]: jar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just to preserve the quality of it,
but just to protect our brand and our
[SPEAKER_05]: future.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to do Milo?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to do bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the time, everybody was bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: No one was even thinking about doing
drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, that was the big thing was,
hey, we really had a fight to have our own
[SPEAKER_05]: brand and not just be selling beans to
Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they protect us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if people weren't asking
specifically for GOP these days,
[SPEAKER_05]: we wouldn't be in shops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it didn't really help us at that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're benefiting from it today for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just going to have this reach,
because it has that truth in the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: people know it is by getting your message
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so stoked to hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a lot of people that I think do a
really good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they all kind of seem to share so many
similarities in the indoor world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've kind of seen this focus on certain
styles of salt growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the model is the same in these
facilities that I visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to think about your facility where
maybe some of the technical aspects are
[SPEAKER_00]: similar, but you're bringing more of how
we see it in greenhouses and outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most outdoor guys when they come to my
farm, they geek out way harder than they
[SPEAKER_05]: thought they would.
[SPEAKER_05]: They go thinking, and they'd be like,
ah, they're kind of suspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they go and they're like, oh my god,
this is like, this is dope.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is on point with everything I heard
but didn't think was possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have to test it, because it'll
happen eventually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something's going to break.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anything that can happen will happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So example, today I just got news that our
power shut off.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we lost power, which is very rare for
the position we're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a big deal in the desert.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's rare for us, because we're located
between two power lines.
[SPEAKER_05]: So typically, if one goes out,
the other one picks up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I still haven't got a call back.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they've got to fix.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know everything is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you never know what's ahead.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to be prepared for everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've got to be able, again, just be able
to be flexible and be able to adapt and
[SPEAKER_05]: just respond creatively to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of lights do you run?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we started five years ago, or four and
a half years ago, five-ish, with an older
[SPEAKER_05]: light, Lumitex.
[SPEAKER_05]: They built a quality light back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was that blur-able, purple,
pink stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was a good light.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we got really good at using it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had everyone in the rooms a lot
warm with that light.
[SPEAKER_05]: To avoid photo bleaching was the main
problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had that light running cool
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we got really good with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then just recently, I've been looking
for a couple years to replace them,
[SPEAKER_05]: to update them, because technology and how
it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next year, the LEDs are going to be 10
times better than this year's LEDs,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So who knows?
[SPEAKER_05]: But I recently found a company that I'm
really confident with.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fos.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's called Fos?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Fos.
[SPEAKER_05]: They outbuild their LEDs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They make the most gnarly.
[SPEAKER_05]: F-O-H-S-E.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they just outbuild these LEDs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just gnarly.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're the biggest, strongest,
powerfulest, most well-built LED I've seen
[SPEAKER_05]: on the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: They overpower them.
[SPEAKER_05]: In my situation, they overpower them a
little bit, which is good for me,
[SPEAKER_05]: because then I don't have to run them full
bore.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can always turn them up later years
if they do start to lose their abilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, we're 100% LEDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who is the guy?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a guy, I think, from Oregon who
got his price per pound down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indoor, his price per pound way down,
and he was speaking at events.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you measure stuff in what you're
getting your price per pound down to?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're always evolving.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know for the most part, I don't want to
say it wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: My wife was here to answer this question.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's the one that hands all the books and
all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, you've got to have a competitive
bottom price, and no till indoors LEDs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our facility, I guarantee, is as efficient
as anything on the planet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I know our costs are extremely low,
not just on electricity, but also
[SPEAKER_05]: employment.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really efficient with my employees.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two women that run a 12,000 square
foot grow on the cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't do all the trimming.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's two women run three huge
rooms, and just being super efficient,
[SPEAKER_05]: able to execute proper tasks at the proper
time, and not waste time in the wrong
[SPEAKER_05]: areas, has been really key for us to
maximize everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Competent employees know to sell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, we've been for five years now,
we've tried the same thing every time,
[SPEAKER_05]: make minute adjustments every cycle for
the better.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just kind of worked all the kinks,
just made it as efficient as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really how you save money too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could do the same thing I did five years
ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I had six people running the exact same
three grow rooms that I have two women
[SPEAKER_05]: running now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you cooling everything?
[SPEAKER_05]: We use ACA air conditioners.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's indoors, so just traditional
air conditioners.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's definitely something that will
change a little bit in the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there's more efficient ways to
cool rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's high on your wish list?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, right now we're 2.0 in our
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's kind of like our 2.0.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a future build out, like water
cooled systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't remember the name of the company
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But a lot of the generator driven systems,
the natural gas generator driven systems,
[SPEAKER_05]: are really efficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually kind of a cleaner,
more greener way to cool a building.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we kind of looked into those.
[SPEAKER_05]: I looked into one of those for a project
in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have plans to do local power
generation?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, honestly with LEDs and the amount of
room surface space we have, I really think
[SPEAKER_05]: with solar panels in the future,
we can take a big dent out of our power
[SPEAKER_05]: usage.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, especially when it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot of sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I mean, the only thing we don't have a
lot of is water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what type of greenhouse are you
building?
[SPEAKER_00]: What type of facilities?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the state kind of made us jump through
some hoops.
[SPEAKER_05]: They made us attach our greenhouse
compound to our existing indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to enter our indoor,
dress out into our greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_05]: the corridors.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's pretty crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the end of the day, it's actually
going to keep our greenhouse safer and
[SPEAKER_05]: cleaner, I guess, than people just walking
in from the outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't hate too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a hoop that made us jump through
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ultimately going to keep more bugs
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we ended up going with the Agritech
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just did four bays.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just to finish off, I was saying
positive pressure Agritech greenhouse is
[SPEAKER_05]: what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're doing a positive pressure?
[SPEAKER_05]: Positive pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been inside of one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I really want to see one.
[SPEAKER_05]: For multiple reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what you're building out,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we did three separate bays.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are three separate grow zones.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we went positive pressure.
[SPEAKER_05]: We wanted to keep pests out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But also pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a lot of hemp in our area.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people doing open pollination,
males, females, not calling their males.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for us, it's just one way to reduce the
potential of cross-contamination with hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would love to see it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you walk around, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hit me up, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: We run the IG.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you ever want to hit me up on IG or
anything like that, dude.
We'll go to Vegas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It won't be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully, we'll be done by summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hoping to be done by summer.
[SPEAKER_05]: We already broke ground.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just haven't built it up yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be a lot of fun.
We'll see you next time.
