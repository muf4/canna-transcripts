[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've developed a technology that
we originally bought about a year ago and
[SPEAKER_00]: we've enhanced it a lot and we now have a
way of delivering cannabinoids through
[SPEAKER_00]: ingestion, through eating and drinking
that have the highest bioavailability
[SPEAKER_00]: rates ever measured and we've done in
vitro testing to make sure that that works
[SPEAKER_00]: and so far it does work and it works very
well and anytime anybody can absorb a
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule that's having some major effect
on them and they can absorb it more
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiently than they could before that's
a good thing because at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_00]: it means they can use smaller amounts to
get the effect that they need and anytime
[SPEAKER_00]: you're ingesting smaller amounts of
powerful molecules that's just better for
[SPEAKER_00]: your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of edibles out there and
there's a lot of different ways to ingest
[SPEAKER_00]: different molecules like cannabinoids and
there's some numbers that people need to
[SPEAKER_00]: know so generally if somebody smokes a
joint they absorb around 30% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they vape that number drops usually to
somewhere in the neighborhood of 20 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 22%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they go sublingual and put drops under
the tongue the absorption rates into the
[SPEAKER_00]: blood are usually around 12% and
unfortunately if you eat a marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: brownie or a cookie or what have you
typical absorption rates are only about 5%
[SPEAKER_00]: and so you can see that graduated kind of
range of absorption and this is all very
[SPEAKER_00]: well known to science.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because of the way the body absorbs
powerful molecules so although edibles are
[SPEAKER_00]: a preferred method of ingesting with
regards to societal objections they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: a very good method for absorbing molecules
so our science has done something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really cool and we actually work on a
molecular level this is patent pending
[SPEAKER_00]: technology both in the United States and
worldwide where we combine the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids with long chain fatty acids
and basically what we do is we kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulate these molecules I'm not allowed
to say exactly how we do that because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's our secret but we manipulate these
molecules and when we're finished the body
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizes the fatty acid as opposed to
the cannabinoid and what happens in our
[SPEAKER_00]: testing we did some in vitro lab testing
this summer the summer of 2015 and those
[SPEAKER_00]: test results came back and they were
marvelous they were remarkable and in one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the tests as an example we had 499%
improvement in absorption of cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to baseline without our
technology so a five-fold increase in
[SPEAKER_00]: absorption which is an amazing sea chain
change and what it means is you could
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively use one-fifth as much of a
baked good or an edible product with our
[SPEAKER_00]: technology as opposed to without it and
get relatively the same effect that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: everything different you can use less it's
easier on your body or you can use the
[SPEAKER_00]: same amount and have a more profound
effect that's up to the customer to decide
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all profoundly affected by the major
kind of impact we think we can have not
[SPEAKER_00]: just on our market or the cannabidiol or
THC market but on other markets so we've
[SPEAKER_00]: extended our patents and we filed patents
pending on cannabidiol on THC but also on
[SPEAKER_00]: fat soluble vitamins also on non-steroidal
anti-inflammatory so these are things like
[SPEAKER_00]: ASA, acetaminophen and ibuprofen we all
have that in our homes and the really big
[SPEAKER_00]: one from a market perspective is nicotine
we filed patent pending on the delivery of
[SPEAKER_00]: nicotine and all those other molecules
because we have reasons to believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: our technology actually delivers all of
those molecules at a more effective rate
[SPEAKER_00]: than they can be delivered today a lot of
people think that you absorb foods in your
[SPEAKER_00]: stomach and you don't only about 5% of
what you eat is actually absorbed in your
[SPEAKER_00]: stomach 95% is absorbed in your small
intestine and the small intestine likes
[SPEAKER_00]: certain molecules or is more efficient at
absorbing certain molecules than it is
[SPEAKER_00]: compared to others one of the things that
it's very well developed to absorb is our
[SPEAKER_00]: fats and that's not hard to believe
because there's an obesity problem all
[SPEAKER_00]: over the world so the body's very good at
absorbing fats and so our kind of brain
[SPEAKER_00]: trust if you will was well is there a way
that we can combine healthy fats so long
[SPEAKER_00]: chain fatty acids are things like
sunflower oil which is a relatively
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy fat very minute quantities of it
really minute quantities of that with a
[SPEAKER_00]: payload such as cannabidiol manipulated in
a very particular way that nobody's ever
[SPEAKER_00]: thought to do before and what we've done
is we've kind of tricked the body into
[SPEAKER_00]: saying oh I smell I taste and I absorb fat
and it also gets away from some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems with some of the edible markets
that have some kind of pretty strong
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors and pretty strong odors we
generally don't have that in our products
[SPEAKER_00]: or much much less because again we wrap
those molecules in a kind of bubble of fat
[SPEAKER_00]: if you will and what the body smells and
tastes are those very savory and good
[SPEAKER_00]: tasting fats so we've kind of gotten
around the problems of absorption by
[SPEAKER_00]: tricking the body into thinking that it's
absorbing something else so for example we
[SPEAKER_00]: have a product on the market right now
called vip over tea and it's tea it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp tea it's not marijuana tea it's black
tea it's Chinese black tea but we've
[SPEAKER_00]: processed it with our with our proprietary
technology and we've placed hemp oil and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabidiol and terpenes within that black
tea so when you drink that tea you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what you taste you taste black tea it has
a slightly earthy smooth kind of texture
[SPEAKER_00]: to it that black tea doesn't really have
black tea is a little bit sharper but
[SPEAKER_00]: other than that there is no hemp or
marijuana flavor or smell to it and we had
[SPEAKER_00]: such success with that over the last six
or eight months that we've actually
[SPEAKER_00]: unlocked launched a line of seven other
teas so we now have English breakfast tea
[SPEAKER_00]: we have green tea we have herbal teas a
whole variety of teas and they all benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: from avoiding the strong tastes which are
objectionable to a lot of people in fact
[SPEAKER_00]: we are launching a protein energy bar in
October of 2015 and it uses our technology
[SPEAKER_00]: no trans fats no artificial sweeteners no
artificial flavors or colors no corn syrup
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing like that super super healthy bars
with the benefits of full spectrum hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: oil and they taste delicious I have eaten
them we've gone through about 12 different
[SPEAKER_00]: recipe formulations over the last year
I've eaten them a lot they are delicious
[SPEAKER_00]: and they taste like a really really high
quality protein bar which is exactly what
[SPEAKER_00]: a food should taste like the food not
something else we have a two-pronged
[SPEAKER_00]: business strategy as well I mean we're
very proud of the technology we're very
[SPEAKER_00]: proud of our products but we're running a
business and so there are two parallel
[SPEAKER_00]: themes to our business the first one is
the cannabidiol space CBD so under the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule we are launching we've already
started with our Vipova tea we're
[SPEAKER_00]: launching coffee hot chocolate and the
protein energy bar in the next 45 days all
[SPEAKER_00]: of those products benefit from our
technology and we use cannabidiol that's
[SPEAKER_00]: sourced from the hemp plant and under US
federal law we are allowed to use extracts
[SPEAKER_00]: from imported hemp within our food
products and we can sell those products
[SPEAKER_00]: nationwide throughout America and in fact
we can sell them in certain other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries as well that from a business
point of view allows us to produce our
[SPEAKER_00]: product in one location and sell it
nationwide which is something that a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the other fragmented businesses in this
sector are not able to do when they
[SPEAKER_00]: operate in only one state and it also
gives us benefits of scale so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: establish a national brand which we're
well in the midst of doing and and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: conducting all of that so we are a CBD
company when it comes to products so when
[SPEAKER_00]: we're selling nationwide we also are able
to sell outside of the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: channels so for example if we were able to
get into a national drugstore chain a
[SPEAKER_00]: national grocery store chain herbal health
centers gyms any number of locations it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really up to us as a food products company
to be able to do that so that gives us a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of traction that a lot of other
companies in the medical marijuana space
[SPEAKER_00]: just can't have and then the second line
of our business is sort of the the IP or
[SPEAKER_00]: the intellectual property side of the
company and from that point of view we
[SPEAKER_00]: really see ourselves as the Intel inside
for the pot business and what that means
[SPEAKER_00]: is we know that our technology works on
cannabinoid absorption we know that it'll
[SPEAKER_00]: work very well for molecule THC we as a
company don't focus on high THC products
[SPEAKER_00]: but we have nothing against them
whatsoever and we are happy to license our
[SPEAKER_00]: technology to all of those companies in
the space that do sell THC products and
[SPEAKER_00]: again with our technology the benefit to
the consumer is that they can consume far
[SPEAKER_00]: less in order to get the effect that
they're looking for which is a public good
[SPEAKER_00]: and it saves them money as well so there's
an intellectual prop property licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: component to our company and as time goes
by if we're fortunate and if the lab tests
[SPEAKER_00]: in the future bear fruit which we think
and we hope it will if those things happen
[SPEAKER_00]: then we can also look additionally down
the road at the potential for licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue in some of those other molecules
the things I mentioned earlier like
[SPEAKER_00]: nicotine or non-steroidal
anti-inflammatories now those markets in
[SPEAKER_00]: some cases are 300 times larger than the
legal marijuana market so we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about completely different business models
and different competitors there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: things that would come into play there but
they're they're very significant markets
[SPEAKER_00]: and we'd like to have a role to play in
them we do think that the technology that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have invented is new it's novel and it
hasn't been discovered by neither the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical companies nor the tobacco
companies nor anyone else in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: which could mean that we do have something
here that really is a breakthrough one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things we hope is that people become
more educated about the way their body
[SPEAKER_00]: works in the way these these products are
absorbed in your body and and you realize
[SPEAKER_00]: in fact that not only not only may it
might not be a good idea to buy a product
[SPEAKER_00]: that has a hundred milligrams let's say of
THC in it that's a lot puts a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: demand on your liver it puts a lot of
demand on the rest of your body and with
[SPEAKER_00]: our technology you may get just as much
sort of bang for the buck out of a 20
[SPEAKER_00]: milligram product as somebody else who's
advertising a hundred milligrams now think
[SPEAKER_00]: of the differences that that brings to the
consumer it means they can pay less money
[SPEAKER_00]: because they need to purchase less it
means they're putting their body through
[SPEAKER_00]: less stress as it tries to absorb some of
those higher amounts and it's just a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing for the industry overall so we
really embrace the idea of using smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts but using it very effectively
that's really what we're all about so
[SPEAKER_00]: another thing that people should be
thinking about is what else is in that
[SPEAKER_00]: edible that they're consuming so for
example is the product made with butter or
[SPEAKER_00]: is it made with sunflower oil or is it
made with corn syrup or what and the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason that I that I mentioned this is
that people really need to know that the
[SPEAKER_00]: different ingredients that they ingest as
they're ingesting the THC or the CBD will
[SPEAKER_00]: affect not only how much of the THC is
going to be absorbed but if it's a high
[SPEAKER_00]: cholesterol fat it's just not good for you
so it's really really important to read
[SPEAKER_00]: the label just as important as it is in
the grocery store when you do your weekly
[SPEAKER_00]: shopping it's important to read the label
and know what's in there so Lexari energy
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the food products we produce or
ever will produce we are talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: truly healthy foods no artificial
sweeteners no high cholesterol fats no
[SPEAKER_00]: trans fats that really matters to how well
you absorb the molecules and to your
[SPEAKER_00]: overall health
