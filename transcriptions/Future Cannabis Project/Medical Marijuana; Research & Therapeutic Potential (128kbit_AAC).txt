[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna start by recalling back as a
junior high kid when This was late 50s
[SPEAKER_04]: when it was all the rage to be hearing
about the discovery of the double helix
[SPEAKER_04]: DNA and coding for protein synthesis from
these intertwining strands of DNA This was
[SPEAKER_04]: the biggest thing in biology that had
happened Probably ever in my in at least
[SPEAKER_04]: in my brief life at that time here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are 45 years later And and I have to
say that the endocannabinoid system is
[SPEAKER_04]: second to none as far as Discoveries in
biology and science that have come forward
[SPEAKER_04]: since that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing that even comes close
understanding cannabinoids and the
[SPEAKER_04]: endocannabinoid system is so unique and so
powerful and so underutilized in medicine
[SPEAKER_04]: that I think it's absolutely Criminal
really that we're holding back on the use
[SPEAKER_04]: of cannabis medicines so There are
researchers at NIH and who have been
[SPEAKER_04]: publishing papers quite recently saying
that modulating this endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: system basically can affect almost all
disease and they list them and it's many
[SPEAKER_04]: many lines of diseases that are noted that
are affected by the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_04]: including cancers and so forth and so
forth you know them and We the docs that
[SPEAKER_04]: are out here in the field doing this have
actually realized this for decades or at
[SPEAKER_04]: least many years and so we're in the
position of Trying to see cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: medicines really gain a stronger foothold
by way of more research because we really
[SPEAKER_04]: need to be able to do clinical studies in
order to know what is the best thing to
[SPEAKER_04]: advise I'm gonna not take too much more
time at least at the moment here Except to
[SPEAKER_04]: say I'm an MD.
[SPEAKER_04]: I practice in Sebastopol, California.
[SPEAKER_04]: My practice is cannabis consultations I've
been doing it with an office for 15 years
[SPEAKER_04]: and unofficially for about 35 years,
so I'm glad to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for the invitation
[SPEAKER_02]: Hey John tally ran also an MD and I guess
a reluctant businessman I've been in this
[SPEAKER_02]: business for 11 years started medican at
this point we've evaluated over 200,000
[SPEAKER_02]: patients over the 11 years we've I guess
the comment that I want to make is is to
[SPEAKER_02]: remark how few people are here And to
remark on the discussion that happened
[SPEAKER_02]: prior in regard to taxation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know this is not a medical talk,
but I hear a lot of wow we finally made it
[SPEAKER_02]: and the endocannabinoid system was
officially discovered in 88 92 right so I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know if you know science science
moves slowly and 92 is like yesterday,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we've got so much to know about how
Cannabinoids work with the body or how the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system works itself with
with the plant with the phytocannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: or with acupuncture This is a new system,
and it's not about weed anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about how well we can get
understanding the system and so that's
[SPEAKER_02]: really as they're considering legalization
being able to use this planet all the time
[SPEAKER_02]: are they understanding our legislators so
if you can grab them and say well What
[SPEAKER_02]: about the endocannabinoid system?
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that going to be reflected in your
new laws?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really what I'm curious about My
name is Tracy Ryan I am the CEO of a
[SPEAKER_00]: nonprofit collective Called canna kids I
originally got into the industry when my
[SPEAKER_00]: baby was diagnosed with an optic pathway
Glioma brain tumor I was forced into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry It wasn't something that
I even really knew that was happening or
[SPEAKER_00]: emerging behind the scenes this was the
time when children weren't being talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about when it came to their diagnosis and
when somebody first offered Cannabis as an
[SPEAKER_00]: option for my then tiny little baby I told
them I thought they were absolutely crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: and how in the world would I?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get my baby stoned when that's what I used
to do in college for fun I am NOT an MD I
[SPEAKER_00]: do consider myself a mom college just now
after two and a half years of going
[SPEAKER_00]: through this industry and chemotherapy
sessions and Working hand-in-hand with now
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of
other families and through a chain of
[SPEAKER_00]: events I was blessed to be put in touch
with some Incredible people that knew a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot about the medicine in the industry and
zelda's that's here today Was originally
[SPEAKER_00]: brought to us through Ricky Lake and Abby
Epstein who were doing a documentary on
[SPEAKER_00]: how cannabis kills cancer and pediatrics
and through Ricky Through and zelda's and
[SPEAKER_00]: through dr. Jeffrey Raybar and a lot of
other doctors and scientists and
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible minds in the industry my
education began My husband and I are
[SPEAKER_00]: continuing to treat our child who has now
been considered a medical miracle She was
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to be completely blind in her
left eye the right eye was supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: grossly compromised and I'm here to tell
you she has perfect vision her tumor was
[SPEAKER_00]: She has the kind of brain tumor that isn't
supposed to shrink with chemotherapy it's
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to arrest the development and if
you see Minimal shrinkage at best it's
[SPEAKER_00]: considered a huge success, and if you do
see shrinkage It's only for four to six
[SPEAKER_00]: months our daughter had 95 percent
regression of her tumor has completely
[SPEAKER_00]: disappeared and The doctors just couldn't
explain it so the other the other cool
[SPEAKER_00]: fact about another little thing that
happened with my daughter is that she
[SPEAKER_00]: suffered from nine blood transfusions and
four months before she actually stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapy she just stopped needing them
which is not how the human body worked and
[SPEAKER_00]: not how there wasn't anything the doctors
could explain except for that you Know
[SPEAKER_00]: what this this must be the cannabis so
after Realizing that this is really a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and this is something that really
can help and cure and kill these diseases
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how can kids was born it started as
a secret group on Facebook with now over
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,200 families that Are all treating their
children holistically using cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: therapy And I recognize that there was a
need in this industry for more people that
[SPEAKER_00]: had education and more voices that could
speak loudly and I can speak loudly that
[SPEAKER_00]: is one thing I've been gifted with is gift
of gab and And I just went on a mission
[SPEAKER_00]: and now we have several hundred patients
that we treat we are getting stories that
[SPEAKER_00]: would make the hairs on your arms crawl
Kids tumors are shrinking when they're not
[SPEAKER_00]: supposed to children are sent into
palliative care And they're given no
[SPEAKER_00]: chance to live and three months later
their cancer is gone and the doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: cannot explain it We've got children who
are celebrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got children who are celebrating 30
and 45 days now Completely seizure-free
[SPEAKER_00]: since their very first dose of CBD and
integrated in with some thca in many cases
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got PTSD patients who are off their
meds people who are taking Handfuls of
[SPEAKER_00]: opiates that now just don't need them
anymore because their pain is gone Crohn's
[SPEAKER_00]: patients who are gaining weight for the
first time in their lives and people with
[SPEAKER_00]: severe Anti-anxiety me being one of them
being a cancer mom that's relieving these
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a medicine I'm here to tell you I
witness it every day three phone calls
[SPEAKER_00]: just yesterday from parents saying my Kids
tumor is shrinking my child is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: live and I am you know first and foremost
just honored to be up here with
[SPEAKER_00]: Professionals that have been doing this
way longer than I have and I'm very
[SPEAKER_00]: excited to be a part of this industry and
I'm honored I feel blessed to have
[SPEAKER_00]: Accidentally fell fallen into this it's
it's been a blessing for us because we do
[SPEAKER_00]: now know why God made our child sick
[SPEAKER_01]: In part because I was very disturbed Mr..
[SPEAKER_01]: Korea's legislation last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was awful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent him a letter telling it was awful,
and I got very little response You had
[SPEAKER_01]: this one gentleman sitting up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So well we want to check on driving Well,
I don't know maybe they don't believe the
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Transportation that says
there's no increased risk from driving
[SPEAKER_01]: when you've used marijuana or maybe they
don't believe the Food and Drug
[SPEAKER_01]: Administration That says about THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what Marinol is or Trinabinol
prescription medication that was approved
[SPEAKER_01]: by the FDA and 1985 and that has the usual
Psychoactive drug warning warning don't
[SPEAKER_01]: drive operate heavy equipment or engage in
dangerous activity Until you determine
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not this interferes with that
activity pretty good advice I'm guessing
[SPEAKER_01]: that all the doctors up here and any
doctors that are out there give that
[SPEAKER_01]: advice you had The fellow from Los Angeles
who said gee maybe this stuff is useful in
[SPEAKER_01]: treating PTSD or attention Deficit
disorder well dr. Taller and has 200,000
[SPEAKER_01]: clients I'm guessing that there's more
than a couple that have been treated for
[SPEAKER_01]: attention deficit disorder and
post-traumatic stress disorder And I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that dr. Hergenrather, and I have seen
lots of patients, but we don't have the
[SPEAKER_01]: same patient population that medicam does
Why couldn't the state legislature
[SPEAKER_01]: reschedule cannabis to schedule to I?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Iowa State Board of Pharmacy
rescheduled to schedule five what we
[SPEAKER_01]: dummies here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't understand That it does have a
medical use whether they they don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the courage to take on the federal
government when the federal government is
[SPEAKER_01]: You know demonstrably wrong and how about?
[SPEAKER_01]: We've heard this thing about well gee
people don't know enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to know more I'll tell you who
needs to know more.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we teach it in our medical schools?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know they teach it a little bit at UCLA
so I can't Knock all of them, but there
[SPEAKER_01]: was a study that came out recently that
said 13% of medical schools teach about
[SPEAKER_01]: the endocannabinoids System whether any of
those teach about the effect that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: has on the endocannabinoid system I don't
know but for my money the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system is the largest neurotransmitter
system in the human body and as dr.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hergenrather said it's useful in treating
an enormous array of Conditions and I have
[SPEAKER_01]: to admit my own Slowness to learn I guess
I'm a slow learner.
[SPEAKER_01]: I probably heard about the medical Value
of cannabis before anybody else in this
[SPEAKER_01]: room, and it's only because I'm older than
most everybody else in this room But it
[SPEAKER_01]: was in 1959 my father who was a pharmacist
and I were talking about alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibition And he told me he said you
know in 1928 when I was a freshman at the
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Minnesota School of Pharmacy
One of our assignments was to make
[SPEAKER_01]: tincture of cannabis and he said and we
had to be very careful because the alcohol
[SPEAKER_01]: was illegal And I looked up in his
Remington's 1927 textbook of pharmacy and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're on page 999 and 1000 it tells you
how to make Tincture of cannabis and that
[SPEAKER_01]: is useful as an anodyne.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an archaic word for analgesic
Analgesia is the number one reasons why
[SPEAKER_01]: doctors recommend cannabis today And it
also I think it had an archaic word for
[SPEAKER_01]: tranquilizer like calmative so there it
was it must have taken me 15 or 20 years
[SPEAKER_01]: before I was able to shed myself of the
propaganda It wasn't that I didn't feel
[SPEAKER_01]: that marijuana should be legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that I didn't see how a plant could
be a medicine It took me 15 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm a little bit more patient when
doctors don't get it in 15 minutes But I
[SPEAKER_01]: this is not 1959 anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we have 20,000 22,000 research
studies on cannabis and cannabinoids that
[SPEAKER_01]: Been done in the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean if you have a doctor Who doesn't
understand even a little bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you need to get another doctor that
doctor is not reading medical journals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking about reading high times
I'm talking about reading medical journals
[SPEAKER_01]: by the way high times in 1975 had a cover
article on the use of cannabis as medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: And I thought oh, they're just pulling my
leg and a couple of years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought oh no Dave You're just dumb
again You know somebody else is a is ahead
[SPEAKER_01]: of the curve on this so the state
legislature should mandate That the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical schools that you and I are paying
good tax dollars for teach about the
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoid system And you know we
need to Have Regulations that protect
[SPEAKER_01]: people we need to treat this like a
medicine it should be tested absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: You got THC in this you got CBD in this
you got CBG in this what terpenes do you
[SPEAKER_01]: have in this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the dose that you're taking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and you know it'd be nice if the
people read the label some of you may be
[SPEAKER_01]: familiar with Maureen Dowd who is a
columnist with New York Times went to
[SPEAKER_01]: Colorado and She had a candy bar,
and she took a piece of that Nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: happened because when you take something
orally it takes 45 minutes to an hour 15
[SPEAKER_01]: minutes So she took another piece of
course nothing happened she waited another
[SPEAKER_01]: 15 minutes She ate the whole thing and she
wrote this column.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was miserable for six hours Well,
maybe if she had done some research You
[SPEAKER_01]: know and read up on it that would have
been useful and I think that these things
[SPEAKER_01]: need to be labeled I got a whole bunch of
other stuff I want to share with you,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think I'll leave a little air for
the rest of the Panel here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh there is you know even Time magazine
You know comes out with the highly
[SPEAKER_01]: divisive curiously underfunded and
strangely promising world of pot science
[SPEAKER_01]: and I do want to mention These guys want
to see whether cannabis interferes with
[SPEAKER_01]: driving I have a hundred page Response in
a legal case that I put together with Paul
[SPEAKER_01]: Armantano Paul is the deputy director of
normal knows more about driving under the
[SPEAKER_01]: influence of marijuana than anybody I get
the big gigs because I have MD after my
[SPEAKER_01]: name not because I know something about
this and We've got the information.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the data there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about spending this Money on seeing
whether or not cannabis cures cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks So every panelist here has seen
some amazing things with cannabis and as
[SPEAKER_03]: dr. Beerman just mentioned there are over
20,000 peer-reviewed studies in formal
[SPEAKER_03]: medical journals about the use of cannabis
or cannabinoids and their efficacy against
[SPEAKER_03]: many conditions and I was wondering what
several of you thought some of the most
[SPEAKER_03]: informative and influential articles were
that showed how and why cannabinoids were
[SPEAKER_03]: benefiting these diseases either studies
specifically on Specific conditions or the
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid system as a whole because
there's a lot of great ones out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to know what you think I Can
start this is actually more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient-doctor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anecdotal study that United patients group
posted recently that I found extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: intriguing and I have incorporated into
our practice which is how THC and CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: works with different forms of breast
cancer because there's estrogen-positive
[SPEAKER_00]: progesterone positive Hr2 and We have
found this to be true in our practice with
[SPEAKER_00]: our breast cancer patients as have the
nurses that I've worked with and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting to find that if you are
estrogen positive or triple positive the
[SPEAKER_00]: THC can actually influence the growth of
the cancer cells whereas if you do a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher CBD regimen you see the cancer just
get Annihilated and I found that very
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting because we all believe THC is
a cancer killer and in every kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: disease Outside of estrogen positive and
triple positive it is we are our average
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio is a 1 to 1 or a 2 to 1 and in some
cases even a 3 to 4 to 1 being teach see
[SPEAKER_00]: the highest but I found this very
intriguing which is you know one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons why I think that the science the
the trials like these things have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: happening now and We have to get this off
the schedule in order to really be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: study how the human body interacts With
these different compounds once we
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce them into our body.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had some incredible success with
breast cancer And and by following this
[SPEAKER_00]: anecdotal doctor driven patient driven
Type of regimen we're seeing it really
[SPEAKER_00]: work in these patients And I just I found
that so interesting when you know looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at all of the other studies out there And
that was the one study that really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: made us pivot a little bit on how we were
treating these women individually I Would
[SPEAKER_00]: like to it's actually it's if you go to
United patients group calm they have it on
[SPEAKER_00]: there, and we also have it on Rylan farms
calm if you go under our cannabis studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the first page We have summarized
their article and put a link to the full
[SPEAKER_00]: article on there And it's it's been driven
by anecdotal and doctor research I was
[SPEAKER_04]: wanted to make the comment that and I
don't have the name of the author,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there was a study come out of Israel
in May and it was speaking about the
[SPEAKER_04]: difference between Isolated CBD and CBD as
a whole plant extract just a quick show of
[SPEAKER_04]: hands who knows about this already Okay
about a quarter of you I'm going to just
[SPEAKER_04]: briefly describe it when you take a single
molecule CBD and look at the dose response
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a bell-shaped curve.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is to say too little and it doesn't
do a thing too much And it doesn't do a
[SPEAKER_04]: thing, but just in the right sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does a lot So this is something unique
in in CBD Well, it is unique, but there
[SPEAKER_04]: are are What I want to compare what they
compared it to in the Israeli Study is
[SPEAKER_04]: this they took a whole plant extract of a
CBD rich medicine, and it behaved as a
[SPEAKER_04]: linear curve So the more you gave the more
effect you got this is what we have in the
[SPEAKER_04]: plant And so when you isolate these
molecules and get out to these 99% CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: Extracts, that's not what you want you
want the whole plant now I'm going to move
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly on to three papers that I think
are valuable to for you to know about one
[SPEAKER_04]: of them is the Hustus paper Maryland
Hustus was published in 2007 on
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmacokinetics of cannabis, and this is
something that is a little out of date But
[SPEAKER_04]: it's the only thing we have right now,
and it talks about bioavailability and the
[SPEAKER_04]: blood levels and so forth of various forms
of administration of Cannabis so what
[SPEAKER_04]: we're looking at is the differences
between the metabolism of ingested forms
[SPEAKER_04]: oral buccal exposure rectal use of
cannabinoids You know she goes through the
[SPEAKER_04]: whole list so it's the best information we
have to date And I think it's something
[SPEAKER_04]: that you ought to have in your in your
folder of Cannabis information another one
[SPEAKER_04]: is called the keel study that came out of
England It was published in about 2005 or
[SPEAKER_04]: six what they did in England This is about
schizophrenia and psychosis And there's
[SPEAKER_04]: still quite a push by the federal
government to make you feel that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to cause a lot of schizophrenia and
psychosis by letting Cannabis be legalized
[SPEAKER_04]: this study went on to look at about two
and a half percent of the of the English
[SPEAKER_04]: population over a ten year span in the
clinic systems in Great Britain and over
[SPEAKER_04]: that span the 18 year olds or younger had
an 18 fold increase in the use of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: and During that interval there was no
increase in schizophrenia or psychosis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an important study to be able to
refer to and the third one I'm going to
[SPEAKER_04]: mention for a moment here is in 2010 the
paper by Marku and McAllister and others
[SPEAKER_04]: came out of San Francisco this is a very
important study in order to look at the
[SPEAKER_04]: effects of CBD and THC on the growth of
cancer cells and and what happens when you
[SPEAKER_04]: put these two molecules together which is
known as synergism and it's quite
[SPEAKER_04]: remarkable because as they increase the
doses of THC they began to see the cells
[SPEAKER_04]: either die off or not be able to grow both
with THC at a certain level in the micro
[SPEAKER_04]: five micromolar range and in the one
micromolar range when you give CBD
[SPEAKER_04]: Similarly, they had a drop in the in the
survival of these cells when they put them
[SPEAKER_04]: together The cancer cells practically
could not grow at all So very important
[SPEAKER_04]: when you're dealing with cancers get the
cat get the cannabinoids balanced more or
[SPEAKER_04]: less Exactly what balance we don't know we
would love to know and we had Love to be
[SPEAKER_04]: able to look at some some clinical trials
where we could tease this apart more I
[SPEAKER_01]: taking off from Taking off from what Jeff
had to say when I saw Justin's Questions
[SPEAKER_01]: my response was we don't know the federal
government has systematically Blocked
[SPEAKER_01]: research yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They deny it as a matter of fact I
recently wrote an op-ed piece that was
[SPEAKER_01]: published in the Seattle Times and they
denied it there their response was oh We
[SPEAKER_01]: approve research for THC and CBD as you
just heard dr. Hergenrath or say we're not
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about isolated Extracts we're
talking about the whole plant Dr. Donald
[SPEAKER_01]: Tashkin is an emeritus professor of
pulmonology at UCLA There was an old study
[SPEAKER_01]: dead in 1975 that said Cannabis is a
bronchodilator and this is why in the
[SPEAKER_01]: 1920s You had at least three cigarettes on
the market that were contained cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and they were for the treatment Of asthma
because it's like adver it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: bronchodilator.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an anti-inflammatory Tashkin is more
famous and I have an article that you
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely should have was his study in
Los Angeles where he took a look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: Los Angeles Los Angeles County can't
cancer research directory or blog and had
[SPEAKER_01]: 1100 patients matched him up with 1100
people of similar age sex and geographic
[SPEAKER_01]: area and He thought that he was going to
find that the more marijuana you smoke the
[SPEAKER_01]: more likely you were to get lung cancer
And he's a very straight shooter and what
[SPEAKER_01]: he found was the more marijuana you smoke
the less likely you were to get lung
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer And I mean then this guy was a
straight shooter he is a great deal of
[SPEAKER_01]: respect for me two more quick ones one is
not a scientific study it's a clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: study and it was done by dr. Hergenrath
around Crohn's disease and It was a very
[SPEAKER_01]: extensive questionnaire and it showed that
people with Crohn's disease who were using
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis This is you know sort of a skewed
study for treating their Crohn's disease
[SPEAKER_01]: had less abdominal pain fewer stools
better form stools and Many of them were
[SPEAKER_01]: able to stop using steroids Which not a
good thing to use on a daily basis unless
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you have Crohn's disease and then
two more quick ones one is a article that
[SPEAKER_01]: appeared in the scientific American in
2004 by Elger and nickel Entitled the
[SPEAKER_01]: brain's own marijuana, and it talks about
retrograde inhibition Which I think is
[SPEAKER_01]: very important in understanding the role
of cannabis in terms of the dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: migraines or seizures and Attention
deficit disorder and post-traumatic stress
[SPEAKER_01]: disorder and then lastly there was a
review article in 2008 out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: University of Wisconsin that touched on
about 12 or 15 different cancers in which
[SPEAKER_01]: numerous studies found that Cannabis
killed cancer cells in tissue culture and
[SPEAKER_01]: in mice One
[SPEAKER_02]: more article if you're writing it down the
care and feeding of the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system highly recommended It's a review
article, and it brings to light that this
[SPEAKER_02]: is not about the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about the endocannabinoid system
Excellent and yes that article that um dr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talley ran just mentioned Talks about all
these other things that you can do to
[SPEAKER_03]: enhance your endocannabinoid system like
acupuncture probiotics omega-3s So there's
[SPEAKER_03]: many things that you can do besides using
cannabis in order to strengthen your
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid system and make the
cannabis that you do use a lot more
[SPEAKER_03]: effective And I did want to throw in one
more study.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really great It's called the
endocannabinoid system as an emerging
[SPEAKER_03]: target of pharmacotherapy Which was
published in 2006 it literally goes
[SPEAKER_03]: through how the endocannabinoid system
plays a role in every single major disease
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you know any any relationship,
it's pretty incredible The endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: system as an emerging target of
pharmacotherapy by patcher Botchi and
[SPEAKER_03]: Kunos So great article so although We you
know there we do need a lot more research
[SPEAKER_03]: especially to make good recommendations to
patients about what to use But you know in
[SPEAKER_03]: the current environment What can you do to
make good recommendations to patients and
[SPEAKER_03]: what are the most important factors in
making those recommendations?
[SPEAKER_03]: What the What the most important factors
are in recommending?
[SPEAKER_03]: Academist protocol for someone and how you
go about making your recommendations about
[SPEAKER_00]: what they should use and do Well for us,
I'm not a doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't go to medical school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand drug interactions like
these professionals do so we have a team
[SPEAKER_00]: of nurses and doctors that we're training
currently that can really look at What is
[SPEAKER_00]: the disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they doing from a Western
medicine type of standpoint?
[SPEAKER_00]: How old are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much do they weigh and how do we need
to treat this patient based on their
[SPEAKER_00]: specific disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most frustrating things for me
is this a gram a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not how you should be Treating
yourself when you have a serious disease a
[SPEAKER_00]: gram of what no two oils are the same One
oil could be 40% in strength one oil could
[SPEAKER_00]: be 75 to 85% In strength, so telling a
patient go take a gram a day that'll fix
[SPEAKER_00]: your cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's not how it should be done We're
more advanced than that now The other
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that kind of frustrates me still a
little bit is this grain of rice theory
[SPEAKER_00]: the half a grain of rice the grain of rice
Well, it's a half a grain of rice to you
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't a half a grain of rice to me Yeah,
is it a long grain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it a short grain?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it you know, what what size is this
grain?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know what we have done is we've
really taken a step back and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay How do we treat these patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistently across the board especially
because we deal so heavily in pediatrics
[SPEAKER_00]: the last thing you want to do is send a
child into You know anxiety attack or make
[SPEAKER_00]: them uncomfortable or any in any way or
make them feel worse than they already
[SPEAKER_00]: feel so we start our patients out with
tinctures and we look at how many
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids per milliliter or in that
tincture and we start them off on a small
[SPEAKER_00]: dose as small as five milligrams and using
a tincture we can accurately weigh out
[SPEAKER_00]: using a one gram syringe that exact dose
every single time and then we slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: Increase them every three to five days
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is all specific to that disease We
don't treat an autistic child the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: as we do an epileptic child or the same
way do we do as a cancer child or an adult
[SPEAKER_00]: with cancer or Crohn's or PTSD all of
these different types of disease have
[SPEAKER_00]: different things that Anecdotally because
we're not allowed to do a lot of this
[SPEAKER_00]: research have found to be the most
effective so it's about working with a
[SPEAKER_00]: professional that understands exactly what
Pharmaceuticals are being ingested into
[SPEAKER_00]: the body how those interact with the liver
enzymes and the body as a whole and what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like Epilepsy for example a lot of
these like on fee and horrible drugs that
[SPEAKER_00]: they put these children on Can can block
the cannabis and can interact with the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in a very negative way So for an
epilepsy patient It really is quite
[SPEAKER_00]: important to have their physician on board
so that you can start to decrease the use
[SPEAKER_00]: of those Pharmaceuticals while you're
increasing the use of cannabis in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: make it actually work Otherwise the kids
just going to continue to seize And then
[SPEAKER_00]: also understanding the power of bringing
in something like THC a which is an
[SPEAKER_00]: Incredible medicine that we're doing more
and more research on and more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: studies on when it comes to our Epileptic
children we're finding that in in many
[SPEAKER_00]: cases the CBD does a fantastic job of
decreasing the seizures But it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: completely getting rid of them you add in
a little bit of THC a our kids are
[SPEAKER_00]: seizure-free We've got three of them right
now celebrating 30 45 55 days without a
[SPEAKER_00]: single seizure after having seizures Every
hour on the hour and some hundreds a day
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's really understanding each of the
diseases You know when you have a GBM for
[SPEAKER_00]: example if it's been completely resected
and there's no tumor still there Then the
[SPEAKER_00]: protocol could definitely be different
than someone that still has a mass in
[SPEAKER_00]: their brain and the cancer is still there
and active It requires a higher THC versus
[SPEAKER_00]: when there's no tumor present in a lot of
lot of circumstances a higher CBD with
[SPEAKER_00]: children like my little girl Sophie who
has an optic pathway Glamour we have so
[SPEAKER_00]: far seen a hundred percent success rate in
getting these tumors that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally Shrink to shrink using a
protocol of a one-to-one and in some cases
[SPEAKER_00]: a two-to-one and we're starting them
around the 350 milligrams of total
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids a day monitoring the scans
seeing if it works and keeping in there at
[SPEAKER_00]: the lower dose versus the 500 600 700
milligrams a day for a small child because
[SPEAKER_00]: why give them more medicine if they don't
actually need it the challenge that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have with cancer is that These kids aren't
getting scans every few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting scans every two and a half
months So we're really having to stick
[SPEAKER_00]: with the protocol For a certain amount of
time seeing how it works adjust and then
[SPEAKER_00]: continue the treatment but understanding
the science of it and what their
[SPEAKER_00]: Oncologists are doing or their
neurosurgeons are doing or neurologists
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing is very very important when also
introducing cannabinoid therapy into the
[SPEAKER_02]: body We adjust doses Depending on her
patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even with blood pressure medicine
You're gonna give start at a dose And then
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna adjust it over time And one
person might react well to 10 milligrams
[SPEAKER_02]: of lysine April and one person might not
react well at all So there's still
[SPEAKER_02]: variability from person to person but the
dosing how do we dose in medicine?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's very simple milligrams per
Kilogram of body weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So milligrams of what are you using?
[SPEAKER_02]: THC CBD Beta karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you using?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's in the place?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have your medicine analyzed then you'll
know how many milligrams you're taking on
[SPEAKER_02]: a regular basis and What's your body
weight because a big person may metabolize
[SPEAKER_02]: differently than a smaller person
especially important in the kids So really
[SPEAKER_02]: simple things understand Variability from
person to person and we're trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: standardize with milligrams per kilogram I
would add to that to say that Somewhere in
[SPEAKER_04]: this range of a half a milligram per
kilogram Per day is a decent starting
[SPEAKER_04]: point for many situations and I would also
add that tailoring the dose for any
[SPEAKER_04]: individual is Is what it's all about and
when I hear Justin's question,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of thinking how much time do we
have?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I do initially certainly at
the first visit and follow-up visits as
[SPEAKER_04]: well because it's an awful lot of it is
about figuring out what's going on with
[SPEAKER_04]: this person and how how they need to Best
utilize the medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for example, if it's an adult who's
picking up the grandkids at three o'clock
[SPEAKER_04]: at school That's gonna play into the
treatment plan as far as what kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: shape they're gonna be in after it after
their dosing So many times we're gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: dose a higher dose at bedtime for serious
medical conditions Often we're gonna try
[SPEAKER_04]: to get two or three doses in per day.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is orally I'm speaking of because of
the fact that orally ingested cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_04]: oils or tinctures of any kind or Products
of any kind have a metabolism over the
[SPEAKER_04]: course of about five to ten hours
Generally and we do have genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: variations not only in our genome to code
for this cytochrome p450 Metabolic pathway
[SPEAKER_04]: not everybody is the same and in many
people it's quite different So we really
[SPEAKER_04]: have to look at an individual's response
in order to know what kind of a dose they
[SPEAKER_04]: can tolerate another factor that was kind
of alluded to was drug-drug interaction
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a big deal, but not a big
deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a big deal because Well, it's a not a
big deal because over the use of sad of X
[SPEAKER_04]: coming out of Great Britain a one-to-one
ratio of THC and CBD roughly a couple of
[SPEAKER_04]: milligrams of each in an oral spray They
have then had these patients using the sad
[SPEAKER_04]: of X sprayed orally five ten times a day
is more or less what they're using it in
[SPEAKER_04]: 30,000 patient years And dr. Russo who is
the medical director there said it's
[SPEAKER_04]: probably more like 40,000 patient years of
experience there have been no
[SPEAKER_04]: discontinuation of drugs of the of the sad
of X because of a drug-drug interaction
[SPEAKER_04]: that is to say even though some some
pharmaceuticals such as Anticonvulsants a
[SPEAKER_04]: couple different anticonvulsants are
metabolized, but the same metabolic
[SPEAKER_04]: pathway as the THC and CBD it's not a
worry because probably the Dose of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids is small enough to where it
does not have a significant impact in
[SPEAKER_04]: altering the blood levels of these
Anticonvulsants now on the other hand a
[SPEAKER_04]: kid that might be on Anticonvulsants
that's the kid who you really have to be
[SPEAKER_04]: careful with because a you could run into
a drug-drug interaction and and the the
[SPEAKER_04]: quantity of of or the concentration of the
the Anticonvulsant may change
[SPEAKER_04]: significantly if they're on a very high
dose of cannabis oils Such as in a cancer
[SPEAKER_04]: therapy which in a kid with a brain tumor
They may very well be on an Anticonvulsant
[SPEAKER_04]: as well, but accepting that it just
generally isn't a problem I Think they go
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the question that I asked in one
of the previous Panels is we need to treat
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis like a medicine and that's what
dr. Telling around and dr. Hergenrather
[SPEAKER_01]: said There is an individual adjustment
that you make with most patients on Most
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines, so why should it be any
different for for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: I also need to admit my ignorance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a wheel that shows CBD CBN CBC I
Really don't have a clue as to what the
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate amount of percentages of them
That's why we need to have more research
[SPEAKER_01]: now GW Pharmaceuticals is doing some of
that research, but that's just the tip of
[SPEAKER_01]: the iceberg Now what I have used in terms
of determining dose is Dermatol which is
[SPEAKER_01]: THC I mentioned that before and what I
found is is that relatively low doses of
[SPEAKER_01]: THC like two and a half milligrams one to
three times a day Is good for most people
[SPEAKER_01]: who have attention deficit disorder who
have anxiety?
[SPEAKER_01]: five to ten milligrams of THC is Good for
helping people sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had treated a woman who had multiple
sclerosis and then she fell and tripped
[SPEAKER_01]: and Fractured her shoulder and she said
doc 10 milligrams didn't do anything But
[SPEAKER_01]: when I went to 15 milligrams it got rid of
the pain So then I started prescribing 15
[SPEAKER_01]: to 20 milligrams and what I found was I
got a lot of complaints about the side
[SPEAKER_01]: effects about dysphoria And you need to be
careful of that and that's that's why the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole plant as was mentioned earlier Is is
so important I had a Patient that came in
[SPEAKER_01]: about two three weeks ago And he had I
believe he had pain and so they took an
[SPEAKER_01]: edible and I said now try to get a
one-to-one THC to CBD so they did and I
[SPEAKER_01]: get a call and said the guy hallucinated
Well, how much did he take 30 milligrams
[SPEAKER_01]: and and then I said listen to yourself
Dave is CBD partially blocks the euphoria
[SPEAKER_01]: caused by THC and I don't know what that
partially Blocks means but let's say for a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute that it blocks 30% of the euphoria
So this guy had the equivalent 20
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams of THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can understand why for some people It
would be unpleasant and cause dysphoria.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you need to take a look at
the side effect profile you need to take a
[SPEAKER_01]: look at prescription drugs in which there
are recommended doses and they've tested
[SPEAKER_01]: it on animals and people and You need to
listen to your patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean Everybody's different and I've
learned more from my patients and I can
[SPEAKER_04]: possibly thank them for I wanted to
recognize that what Tracy Ryan had said a
[SPEAKER_04]: minute ago Regarding not oil not all oils
are the same This is something that you I
[SPEAKER_04]: become very aware of in in consulting with
people by phone across the country For
[SPEAKER_04]: example a fellow said gee I took the oil
and you know increase the dose and I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: still Not feeling it and so they finally
on advice went ahead and had it analyzed
[SPEAKER_04]: and the amount of cannabinoids in the oil
was something around 12% That's not what
[SPEAKER_04]: we get out here generally speaking So when
you get these oils that are 30 to 85
[SPEAKER_04]: percent cannabinoids, you've got something
much more potent another element of this
[SPEAKER_04]: is how much CBD is in there and the more
CBD it really offsets the psychoactivity
[SPEAKER_04]: significantly and one of my patients
brought Back to me some follow-up about
[SPEAKER_04]: treating cancer and poorly treated myeloma
multiple myeloma patient and I sent him
[SPEAKER_04]: home in recommending that he Up,
you know increases dose gradually over the
[SPEAKER_04]: course of a few weeks and when he came
back he said well I got home and said
[SPEAKER_04]: fooey and he took the whole gram of oil
just at one time and was Pretty pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: knocked out and he and his wife kind of
chuckled and he said yeah You're kind of a
[SPEAKER_04]: lump on the couch for five days He
continued to take the gram of oil a day,
[SPEAKER_04]: by the way He was determined so he kept
taking it on the fifth day.
[SPEAKER_04]: He got up and started acting normally
again The point is tolerance is our friend
[SPEAKER_04]: in this situation It really develops
rapidly when we use high doses of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids and it may not be five days
for everybody but generally over that
[SPEAKER_04]: course of about a week you see a great
deal of tolerance developed and People
[SPEAKER_04]: should you know be cautioned about a
variety of things including a fall risk
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's going to maybe affect their blood
pressure and so what so forth when they're
[SPEAKER_04]: using high doses of oil But eventually
they're going to become tolerant of it and
[SPEAKER_04]: be able to take high doses Which may be
necessary in some conditions particularly
[SPEAKER_02]: some really difficult tumors My concern
Jeff is down regulating the system the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoids if you take too much like
Rick Simpson oil Procedure, maybe you're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing harm because you're down regulating
your system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So What's the sweet spot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I agree with that completely
because I've got patients that come to me
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're like we're on 2,000
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, are you crazy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would you ever take 2,000 milligrams?
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of these kids have diseases like
DIPG which is in the brain stem where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's hardly any receptors at all and
With cannabis we're not seeing shrinkage
[SPEAKER_00]: in the brain stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing stabilization So they're
thinking if I just keep giving more more
[SPEAKER_00]: more Maybe at some point I'm gonna start
to see some shrinkage But there are just
[SPEAKER_00]: some situations and this is one an
individualized situation where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing stabilization and not, you know
apoptosis or cell death so it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: about finding that sweet spot and and you
know, like dr. Beerman said listening to
[SPEAKER_00]: your patients or listening to your body if
you are the patient and working up slowly
[SPEAKER_00]: we usually Advise our patients to go up
and dose every three to five days when
[SPEAKER_00]: once that psychoactivity starts to kind of
mitigate itself so that they can build
[SPEAKER_00]: that tolerance easily And the the mass
majority say 90 97 98 percent of our kids
[SPEAKER_00]: get to a point where they don't feel it at
all anymore My my child is gonna be three
[SPEAKER_00]: next weekend and you would never know that
she is on cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: She is wild So which is a great thing
considering she's on chemotherapy like
[SPEAKER_00]: she's a normal happy healthy functioning
Chubby little baby and and she loves life
[SPEAKER_00]: and she's kicking the shit out of cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pardon my French
[SPEAKER_07]: My question is I guess the not sure what
the proper word is cannabis potentiating
[SPEAKER_07]: the effects of chemo possibly and sort of
how that works if maybe asking your
[SPEAKER_07]: doctors for a Trial dose or I get fully
aware cannabis helps throughout through
[SPEAKER_07]: chemo, but are there instances where Maybe
cannabis allows the chemo to work more.
[SPEAKER_07]: I guess that's my question Synergistic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there is a synergistic effect with
told a temozolomide one of the cancer
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs and Cannabinoids that's been seen in
a study that's out there It's not uncommon
[SPEAKER_04]: for glioblastoma and other conditions
where over a course of a few months that
[SPEAKER_04]: the effect of temozolomide is weighing So
it looks like it's helpful initially and
[SPEAKER_04]: then it disappears if cannabinoids are
brought in at least in this study that it
[SPEAKER_04]: was published Not too long ago
Temozolomide seemed to regain its edge as
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabinoids were added So there is a
synergism with with the cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_04]: the and the chemotherapy As far as the
chemotherapy in general I don't think
[SPEAKER_04]: there's much question that the docs out
there even the square docs that have never
[SPEAKER_04]: done this before are recognizing that here
the cannabis Patients are coming in and
[SPEAKER_04]: they've gained weight during chemotherapy
and they're feeling great and in many
[SPEAKER_04]: cases it really mitigates the symptoms
significantly My daughter's on Temadar
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's on Temadar and Vincristine and
carboplatin and again This is where I
[SPEAKER_00]: always go back to these optic pathway
gliomas And this is one of the reasons why
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do everything in my power to
raise money to do a trial That's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: privately funded on these specific tumors
because these are tumors that the doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: told us This is not going to shrink Your
kid's gonna go blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chemo is not gonna make it smaller It's
gonna arrest the development of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we see a little bit of shrinkage,
it'll be considered a huge success 95%
[SPEAKER_00]: shrinkage you yes, the chemo is working
with the cannabis in this situation and
[SPEAKER_00]: all of her doctors are now Again doctors
who had no idea that cannabis was even in
[SPEAKER_00]: the medical books or it even been talked
about they had no research on it
[SPEAKER_00]: whatsoever like Dr. Pirman was saying
before they know now and now all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: other children that have these low-grade
gliomas that don't traditionally work with
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapy these tumors are shrinking
Like crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one dad who contacted me
yesterday another scan same same type of
[SPEAKER_00]: tumor OPG tumor is shrinking even more the
radiologist actually called the oncologist
[SPEAKER_00]: and said what new clinical trial do you
have this little girl on where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting her tumor to shrink this much and
the doctors like she's she's on
[SPEAKER_00]: Vincristine and carboplatin and The
radiologist like I can't explain this I
[SPEAKER_00]: can't understand how it continues to keep
shrinking month after month after month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So absolutely it absolutely makes the
chemo work harder and stronger and
[SPEAKER_00]: penetrates those cell deeper to cause more
cell death I've got a story to share with
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's at a cocktail party in February and
this fellow's late 20s early 30s said my
[SPEAKER_01]: stepfather has cancer the throat
metastasized to the regional lymph node
[SPEAKER_01]: the rib and the liver and the doctors say
he's gonna die What do you know about
[SPEAKER_01]: Simpson oil?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know too much about Simpson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Hergenrath Really knows about that,
but I told him what little I knew and
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't think much of it early June.
[SPEAKER_01]: He calls me up and said Last CAT scan
showed my stepfather is cured and he came
[SPEAKER_01]: into my office a couple weeks later and
Yeah, they couldn't find anything I did
[SPEAKER_01]: another CAT scan and found a little bit of
cancer at the base of his tongue or they
[SPEAKER_01]: did give him chemo along with this and so
now they're gonna give him chemo but not
[SPEAKER_01]: for palliation they're gonna give him
treatment for cure and so The problem goes
[SPEAKER_01]: back to what I think all of us have
touched on is you need to have some
[SPEAKER_01]: research To really answer this question on
the other hand Dr. Abrams has nailed it
[SPEAKER_01]: when he said there's more than enough
basic science evidence and the anecdotal
[SPEAKER_01]: reports to justify doing double-blind
studies and Everybody in this room should
[SPEAKER_01]: write the White House and say when are you
gonna start the double-blind studies that
[SPEAKER_01]: are federally funded for the treatment of
cancer?
[SPEAKER_04]: The only known injection I am aware of is
Manuel Guzman infusing TAC and to the GBM
[SPEAKER_04]: brain tumors in in Madrid and Otherwise,
I am not aware of anybody injecting
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis oil into tumors Breast cancer Dr.
McAllister up in San Francisco is doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: double-blind study with cannabis for
treatment of breast cancer And I think all
[SPEAKER_01]: of us up here are aware of breast cancer
patients whose Cancer has either gone into
[SPEAKER_01]: remission or be cured depending upon you
know what terminology you want to use from
[SPEAKER_01]: oral ingestion It's speculative as to
whether injecting it would be worthwhile,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's certainly something that be worth
doing research on what McAllister
[SPEAKER_01]: previously did a study on mice And I think
they injected The material whatever their
[SPEAKER_01]: subject material was I don't know was from
cannabis or THC or CBD into the peritoneal
[SPEAKER_01]: cavity and It cured the mouse's breast
cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't inject it into the tumor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They injected it into the mouse So we know
that you're we can cure your mouse's
[SPEAKER_05]: breast cancer I'm curious about the
resistance among physicians to accepting
[SPEAKER_05]: that medical marijuana is a fact of life
and whether you think that Perhaps one
[SPEAKER_05]: cause is this persistent belief that it is
either a gateway drug to addiction or
[SPEAKER_05]: addictive itself and also the prevalence
of addiction programs and therapists who
[SPEAKER_05]: combine it with opiates and alcohol
addiction and all of those
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a biggest part of it would
be education The other part of it is to
[SPEAKER_04]: stop the federal government wasting money
on on vilifying and misleading the public
[SPEAKER_04]: about what's going on That's on DCP.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's FDA.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's NIH that's NIH NIDA and FDA are all
involved FDA probably the least but
[SPEAKER_04]: they're all involved in in the
Misinformation that continues to come out
[SPEAKER_04]: in order to protect the best of interest I
see that among my colleagues But I'm also
[SPEAKER_04]: the demographic of all of this is changing
those docs that never Referred a patient
[SPEAKER_04]: before and I hadn't heard from him for 20
years are now sending patients over a
[SPEAKER_04]: local oncologist who had never seen a
result with cannabis and Saw a GBM
[SPEAKER_04]: disappear.
[SPEAKER_04]: So things are happening and they're you
know We're at the oh stage with some of
[SPEAKER_04]: these docs and it's really nice to be able
to see this But as long as the feds are
[SPEAKER_04]: vilifying it the majority of doctors are
not going to feel comfortable getting
[SPEAKER_04]: involved in this We do have to work on
both the education medical school side of
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't legislate medical schools
teaching cannabinoid medicine we That's
[SPEAKER_04]: what I'm told by the legislators in my
question today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to put pressure On every
medical school in the in the land That's
[SPEAKER_00]: been my experience with the doctors that
I've worked with and that our patients
[SPEAKER_00]: have been with is that you know You go in
initially and they have no idea what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're talking about And then they see
something miraculous happen and they start
[SPEAKER_00]: to go hmm You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe maybe there is something to this and
my daughter's been treated at Kaiser
[SPEAKER_00]: Sunset.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's now at CHLA We've collaborated with
doctors at chalk hospital and none of
[SPEAKER_00]: these people really understood what was
going on with her and her case And many of
[SPEAKER_00]: our other kids cases that are also treated
these same hospitals, but they started to
[SPEAKER_00]: see This this spontaneous regression if
you will in a tumor that clearly wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: spontaneous Spontaneously regressing and
more and more oncologists now are sending
[SPEAKER_00]: us patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with five major hospitals
right now holistic doctors Acupuncturists
[SPEAKER_00]: they're they're seeing the miracles and
they cannot they can't deny it We had a
[SPEAKER_00]: boy 16 years old with relapsed
osteosarcomia 22 tumors in his body His
[SPEAKER_00]: bones came in in a neck brace He was on
Percocet oxycodone and Vicodin every day
[SPEAKER_00]: just to get out of bed and they had him on
a palliative chemo only to help with pain
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here to tell you within two weeks on
our cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was completely pharmaceutical free and
within 90 days He was cancer free and that
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor has now said That doctor has now
said I'm a believer I want to start
[SPEAKER_00]: sending you patients and if AJ is still
cancer-free in the next two months when he
[SPEAKER_00]: gets his next next scan I'm gonna work
with dr. Ronnie Goldstein and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: publish this to medical journals,
so it's happening I Think that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to see As we have younger
doctors who at least are familiar with the
[SPEAKER_01]: recreational use of cannabis our greater
willingness to read about this and to
[SPEAKER_01]: accept what they read I had a orthopedic
surgeon write me a letter and I the papers
[SPEAKER_01]: in Santa Barbara the weekly is very
liberal and the daily is a libertarian
[SPEAKER_01]: thing and so they both love what I write
and He said why don't you talk about the
[SPEAKER_01]: side effects of marijuana in your op-ed
pieces I said because there's only 800
[SPEAKER_01]: words that they allow me here But if you
think I don't know anything about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I sent him a chapter from my book Oh,
he also carbon copied the paper because he
[SPEAKER_01]: thought he was being so clever and I
carbon copied the paper too because I knew
[SPEAKER_01]: I was being clever and they didn't publish
his his his letter I think the more you
[SPEAKER_01]: have doctors like Like dr. Hergenrather
and myself who are willing to speak out
[SPEAKER_01]: and stick our necks out you begin to have
people in the community who know us and
[SPEAKER_01]: say Well, they're not nuts on other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they really know what they're
talking about You know and and you begin
[SPEAKER_01]: to see these changes, but you know I mean
it takes years and years and one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: other things I noticed in Santa Barbara Is
that there have been two or three
[SPEAKER_01]: presentations at the local hospital?
[SPEAKER_01]: One two of them by a couple of residents
and the other by the doctor who's second
[SPEAKER_01]: in charge of Continuing education and
that's what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we're getting to have more
certification for category one CME and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think one of the most effective things
we're getting doctors to recognize this is
[SPEAKER_01]: what Tracy is talking About is the patient
telling the doctor This stuff works this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff works, and I should mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's a online program that
Deborah Malka worked on and I provided a
[SPEAKER_01]: little assistance through the What's it
called Cannabis Institute of Medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's it's 12 one hour continuing CME
things or you can give your doctor a
[SPEAKER_01]: present of my book You You You You You
