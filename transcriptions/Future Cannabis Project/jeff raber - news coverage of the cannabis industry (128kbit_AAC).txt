[SPEAKER_00]: So, certainly cannabis is a very
interesting and hot-button topic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very prevalently talked about by many
people in many circles and in the news
[SPEAKER_00]: it's exceptionally prevalent.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had the benefit of being involved in
news stories quite a bit and it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting from my perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have people that aggregate the news and
every day I get a feed that says,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, here's the top headlines and
things that have worked and what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: around in and around the world,
mostly inside of the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: predominantly in states that are talking
about things or have active programs
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I see some of these headlines,
I mean certainly they grab your attention,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the times I read it and say
there's just no way that's possibly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something seems to be misunderstood and
from my own personal experience being on
[SPEAKER_00]: the front page of the LA Times or being
involved in other articles that were
[SPEAKER_00]: written, I can certainly attest to how a
lot of that is not exceptionally accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, unfortunately they don't quite often
understand what was being said I really
[SPEAKER_00]: prefer reporters that have audio taped or
recorded things so they're sure that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can get all the words right and understand
the context that things were in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That seems to have worked very much and I
don't know if that's an individual thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in my case that seems to have led
towards much more accurate reporting and a
[SPEAKER_00]: much better article in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that person was just a little bit
more diligent than some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I feel that they're often so
rushed and these things are complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different parts to
understand in some of these stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not sure who to ask, who are the
experts, and they can understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: difficulties in that a lot of people like
to talk a lot or advertise a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since they're out there, are they an
expert?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they just have a really big mouth
and they just like to talk a lot,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it doesn't mean what they're saying is
actually accurate, valid, or true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other institutions have done really good
jobs about finding out experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes we're approached, hey,
you guys have published on pesticide work.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I go about understanding this more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I come back to you later if I have
technical questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: We always offer that type of resource to
the media and I think that that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: very beneficial for both them and for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're sure accurate information is going
out there and they get a really good story
[SPEAKER_00]: that they feel comfortable and confident
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: My one real pet peeve with them is
sometimes they try to make a sensational
[SPEAKER_00]: headline and most people don't read the
rest of the article.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just take that as the facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: While it is meant to grab, if you're not
saying good things or accurate things and
[SPEAKER_00]: have even seen headlines that were
grammatically incorrect and it makes you
[SPEAKER_00]: wonder how that happens, it's not going to
be to the betterment of everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be detrimental.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you say things like all strains are the
same, that wasn't what we were saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our comment was all these strains are
very, very different, yet sometimes the
[SPEAKER_00]: naming is misnamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they're abused in types of what
names are tagged to which products and
[SPEAKER_00]: patients have a hard time finding what
products they're actually looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we were profiling all of the
plant and looking at over 30 different
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline of the article said,
all pots the same, must all be stuffed.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just call it funny names and I don't
see the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has caused me probably two years
worth of answering questions and other
[SPEAKER_00]: work until we're finally at the point now
where we've gotten some other articles out
[SPEAKER_00]: there and published on peer-reviewed
journal articles about here is exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: what we were saying and why we see these
differences and how we need to move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward in a chemotyping sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: That article, it was personally relevant
to me because I gave the interview and to
[SPEAKER_00]: see it misconstrued and invade in the
improper fashion for a sensational
[SPEAKER_00]: headline was exceptionally frustrating.
[SPEAKER_00]: We feel ourselves, we have an utmost
responsibility to be accurate in
[SPEAKER_00]: everything we say, to be professional at
all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the media has to look at things
that way too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to take that as an exceptionally
important role.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't just say whatever they want to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't say things for sensationalism
or headlines.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be accurate first and
foremost and if it makes it a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more dry or boring, at least it's the
facts and everybody can count on that as
[SPEAKER_00]: being an accurate representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start to see, like trust,
one type of thing takes that away,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of a sudden you start to distrust all
of it and you're just not sure,
[SPEAKER_00]: well is the next story accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know my story really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they talked to me about the nuclear
power plant problems that were there,
[SPEAKER_00]: do they know that story really well?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if I'm confident if the
story I did know wasn't accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I be confident the rest of those
things are accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand it's a difficult job.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of complexities.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I've been interviewed, they don't
know science.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really sure exactly which
questions to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been tasked with go talk about
cannabis because it should be something in
[SPEAKER_00]: the press.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't really sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it takes a long period of time,
especially with something as complex as
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, to really filter through all of
the details and get a good factual,
[SPEAKER_00]: accurate representation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that are just trying to rush to
get the story probably scare me the most
[SPEAKER_00]: in this context because unless they've
been following this for years and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to report on something very new and
had all the background, someone that just
[SPEAKER_00]: shows up today to say, I want to talk
about reporting on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a lot to learn and it really
might be a very difficult story for them
[SPEAKER_00]: to write quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have done a good job if they stay in
a very narrow focus part and talk to a few
[SPEAKER_00]: experts in the area, but I've seen a lot
of misleading information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if they summarize and they're trying
to distill down and make it more simple,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can lose key details if they didn't
understand what were the key points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overgeneralization of some things,
sensationalized headlines, those are
[SPEAKER_00]: leading towards negative connotations and
pushing us backwards instead of saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's the accurate, actual, factual
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how we can move forward best from
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes that is negative information
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, these reports have said this just
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sight your sources, make sure they're
valid and understand where it's all coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the fact that being a good
reporter is a lot like a good scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I find what I found?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I validate and verify that that's
actually the case?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I go about representing this in the
accurate fashion in an unbiased manner so
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm not trying to personally
influence or skew these things?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually representing the facts that
were presented.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would do a lot more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that would be a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is always a hot button for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to polarize many people in many
discussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can certainly find people on either
end of the spectrum of, I think everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: should have it for every single thing to
absolutely no one should have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real answer is probably somewhere in
between for all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a broad section of society that
should benefit from accurate information
[SPEAKER_00]: and representation in that and then make
their own best informed decisions.
Thank you.
