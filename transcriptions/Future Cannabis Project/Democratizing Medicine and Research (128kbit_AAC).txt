[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Ariel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you for inviting me to participate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thank you for this wonderful
conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really fantastic what you guys have
done.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'll speak first to what I mean
when I say democratizing medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I first said that, I said people
think that we're trying to develop
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence-based medicine from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, we're doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you want to put evidence-based
medicine in the hands of patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more broadly, what we're trying to do
is democratize medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then she said, what's that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, ugh.
[SPEAKER_01]: The answer is healing is a noble art.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are many modalities of healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one we popularly call medicine has its
rules, its standards of care, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are also other forms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are other forms of healing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to be talking about some
of them later today, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the purpose of healing, the purpose of
medicine, is to serve humanity,
[SPEAKER_01]: to serve people, not profits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Profits may be a consequence of our
actions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when we make profits the reason we're
doing something, we lose our first
[SPEAKER_01]: principle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to help people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by democratizing, it means any human
being on the planet that is suffering
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to have, must have access to
appropriate modalities that relieve that
[SPEAKER_01]: suffering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Democratizing medicine is primarily about
access and affordability too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I mean when I say when I
talk about democratizing medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here mainly, I mean, yes, I have a
title as something at a company.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm mainly here as a patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a 19-year cancer survivor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take a drug every day that's oral cancer
medication.
[SPEAKER_01]: It saved my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was three weeks away from dying 19 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, that same healing medicine
has had deleterious effects on my kidneys,
[SPEAKER_01]: my lungs, and my heart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I spend a lot of quality time with
medical professionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I become a bit of a professional
patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that I find is that patients
need good information and good
[SPEAKER_01]: alternatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're often prescribed medicine that
creates more problems than it solves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's a good trade-off for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to live for 19 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I'm fighting heart, kidneys,
lungs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was worth it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is I had to fight to get on
the clinical trial for the drug to start
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to help people.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to put medicine in the hands of
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to help do what we can to
reduce human suffering.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Sheila.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sheila Gibson is the lovely woman who's to
my left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sheila is the founder of Aura IP Law.
[SPEAKER_03]: She started her career in intellectual
property at a nationally recognized IP
[SPEAKER_03]: boutique and practiced at several top-tier
law firms during her first 16 years as an
[SPEAKER_03]: attorney.
[SPEAKER_03]: She has worked with clients in many
different industries, such as biotech,
[SPEAKER_03]: medical device, cannabis, food packaging,
pharmaceutical, free technology,
[SPEAKER_03]: mechanicals, sports innovation,
beverages, and more.
[SPEAKER_03]: She brings a unique combination of strong
science and IP experience with a solid
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding of her clients' business
needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rather than tackling clients' IP
objectives in a vacuum, she uses her
[SPEAKER_03]: clients' business objectives and
considerations to guide her IP practice
[SPEAKER_03]: and recommendations in order to achieve
her clients' goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's an incredibly brilliant lawyer and
an amazing woman.
[SPEAKER_03]: And her bio was much more lengthy,
as was John's.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just would rather everyone hear her
speak, because she's doing really amazing,
[SPEAKER_03]: creative things.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's newly been to cannabis, I think,
in this last year or two years as an
[SPEAKER_03]: attorney.
[SPEAKER_03]: And recently, and I'm sure everyone knows,
the FDA has accepted comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd love it, Sheila, if you would
speak a little bit to some of the comments
[SPEAKER_03]: that you've recently provided in the FDA
public hearing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Ariel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And thank you for inviting me as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm glad to hear that you had the same
question when Ariel first mentioned to me
[SPEAKER_02]: that it was democratizing medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first question was, what does that mean
to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so after we talked about it more,
it made a lot of sense for me,
[SPEAKER_02]: even as a patent attorney, to be on a
panel like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so Ariel mentioned that I did recently
provide comments to the FDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did that largely based not on my
experience with what the efficacy or
[SPEAKER_02]: safety data is, because I felt like that
was really well covered.
[SPEAKER_02]: By a lot of the public, I did listen to
the hearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also went through as many of the
comments as I reasonably could.
[SPEAKER_02]: They received, I believe, well over 4,000
comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so looking at that, and based on my
experience with the clients that I've
[SPEAKER_02]: helped in this process, and while I'm not
an FDA attorney, most of my clients do
[SPEAKER_02]: deal with the FDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I do witness what they go through and
do help them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the flip side of that,
I've also helped generic drug
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturers deal with the FDA in terms
of looking through the Orange Book and
[SPEAKER_02]: invalidating patents so that they can
enter the market early and have some
[SPEAKER_02]: exclusivity for doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as I was thinking about what my
experience was and what I could bring to
[SPEAKER_02]: democratizing medicine, because the one
thing that I realized about the FDA is if
[SPEAKER_02]: they try to regulate all of cannabis like
a drug, as they've defined it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would just completely destroy the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think one of the aspects,
too, is that a lot of the pioneers in the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry who've really risked so much of
their... They've made so many sacrifices,
[SPEAKER_02]: and also professionally they've sacrificed
as well, that it could really destroy
[SPEAKER_02]: them, and those wouldn't be the people who
benefit from an onerous FDA regulation to
[SPEAKER_02]: come out of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my comment to the FDA was that there
needed to be at least two tiers of
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: One based on a generic drug model,
which I've had experience with,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that being that when you enter a
generic drug, or when you apply to the FDA
[SPEAKER_02]: to have a generic drug enter the market,
you aren't put through the complete
[SPEAKER_02]: process of providing your extensive animal
testing, clinical trial, all the data that
[SPEAKER_02]: you go through for a new drug application.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're actually gone through an
abbreviated drug, new drug application,
[SPEAKER_02]: and in that process it's more focused on
the chemistry, the testing, your
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratory, and bioequivalence.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for something where they have so
much safety data, I felt that that was a
[SPEAKER_02]: middle ground that could be applied at
least to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then to encourage, because right now
what I'm seeing is a lot of patents being
[SPEAKER_02]: filed, a lot of what I call land grabs,
where I'm seeing these very broad patents
[SPEAKER_02]: covering much more than what they're
deserving of, or covering what's in the
[SPEAKER_02]: prior art, because we don't know what's in
the prior art.
[SPEAKER_02]: There wasn't a lot of publications going
on during prohibition, so we have no idea
[SPEAKER_02]: what research was being done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so providing a model similar to the
generic drugs, where you encourage other
[SPEAKER_02]: companies to invalidate these overly broad
patents and enjoy some period of
[SPEAKER_02]: exclusivity once they're invalidated,
and then let everybody come to the market
[SPEAKER_02]: after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because one of the things that I believe
in terms of access is that really
[SPEAKER_02]: promoting price competition, having more
brands, and that's really what the Generic
[SPEAKER_02]: Drug Act was about, was this idea of you
still want to encourage innovation,
[SPEAKER_02]: and there's a place for patents and
innovation, but you also want to encourage
[SPEAKER_02]: more competition in the market so that it
can become more affordable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I
[SPEAKER_03]: think it's 43 weeks from now that I've
done everything I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, actually, you know, Dr. Silverman
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to answer that, but I'd like to
elaborate a little bit on what John said,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I think there's another part of
democratizing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To run a democracy, you need educated
voters.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question I got is education first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's, and I think I need to
bring that to the table, Ariel,
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recent ACR studies showed 90% of blood
tenders across the country have had no
[SPEAKER_00]: formal education.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking here about, other than
pockets like Pennsylvania where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually an embedded pharmacist,
generally the patient who's going to a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary doesn't really get good
information, they don't have any easy
[SPEAKER_00]: access right now to know warnings,
drug interaction, if they're on a blood
[SPEAKER_00]: thinner, if they're on insulin,
all those things, or anticholinergics,
[SPEAKER_00]: it all interacts.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second problem with the source of
information actually relates to physicians
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, I think that, I tell two
stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's the, when my patients tell me they
go to a doctor before they see me,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out of this picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: One person sees a doctor and the doctor
says, cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so that's the end of that
discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about 10 to 20% of physicians
nationally right now, at least by early
[SPEAKER_00]: surveys.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next group is a much larger group,
which is, that's cool, I support it.
[SPEAKER_00]: End of discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me how it happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, there is a very small minority of
physicians in the country who are willing
[SPEAKER_00]: to take the time to talk with the patients
about interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard a lot today here about hydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do kind of like another approach,
which is micro-dosing, so I'll start at
[SPEAKER_00]: one drop, increase by every two,
three days, all really with the same
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do agree, we need to individualize
therapies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third problem is, the problem I get is
when I make a recommendation, let's say
[SPEAKER_00]: for cancer-induced nausea, vomiting,
or any, or pain, is when the patient goes
[SPEAKER_00]: to the dispensary, they get overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is really, one, we do not have,
we've been hearing a lot about terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, we have no requirement,
because of the regulatory issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get patients who, you know,
I just looked at my fibromyalgia
[SPEAKER_00]: experience, I know I can do a better job,
but it's only about 50, 60% of my patients
[SPEAKER_00]: respond.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's because, quote unquote,
it stops working.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it stopped working?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I went to a different dispensary and I
got the exact same strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the issue is, because we got the
labeling here, I mean, the good news is,
[SPEAKER_00]: as you know, since this year, we have
toxicology labeling, and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: prior to that, many of the grows were
actually had mycotoxins and the like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and were there, but we're not quite where
Colorado is, which requires at least the
[SPEAKER_00]: major terpene has to be declared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, I think it's really
confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: My patients say, well, you know,
I got this one here, I got it out of
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, this high-end limoline,
and helped my brain fog for my fibro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, information, we've gotta make
educated voters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back to your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer is a touchy issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is that we don't really have any
specific data that I can say from our CTs
[SPEAKER_00]: that says it helps cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The general rule is actually one is it
helps the symptoms related to cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cancer, douche, nausea, and vomiting
are classic ones that clearly cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: does help.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's several moderate evidence there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is some case series.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a local physician here in the
community you may know, Bonnie Goldstein,
[SPEAKER_00]: who has done some gliomas in children.
[SPEAKER_00]: With some success in case series,
but we don't really have the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger challenge at the moment for us
as physicians at the moment is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a lot of my patient symptoms,
the lack of sleep, the anxiety,
[SPEAKER_00]: the nausea, really would be helped by
cannabis, but I'm giving them chemotherapy
[SPEAKER_00]: with Taxil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm giving chemotherapy with all kinds of
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, cannabis, and we said as an
immuno-modulator, are we doing a good
[SPEAKER_00]: thing when we're mixing cannabis and
chemotherapy, chemotherapeutic agents,
[SPEAKER_00]: are we actually inhibiting the effect of
the chemotherapeutic agent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're even making it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: No really good data.
[SPEAKER_00]: The preliminary data with a couple of the
chemotherapeutic agents suggests we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: doing any harm, and we probably could
combine, but we need more studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is an area of sparse data,
unfortunately, but it's something that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all trying to face now in the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I'm just saying, if anything,
I suspect it's gonna be adjunctive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna be a primary agent for a
giving cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not gonna give a cannabis compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: You use it in combination with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, and I guess that's what part of this
is about in educating.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you hear things like,
oh, cannabis has people, where's the
[SPEAKER_03]: information, where's we as consumers who
aren't medical doctors, or who haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: been patients for 19 years, where do we
find this information when you kind of dig
[SPEAKER_03]: more deeply?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is the granularity, and how do we
access that information?
So thank you for raising that,
I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I wanna point out for physicians,
if they're interested, and that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, UCLA, we have physicians,
our website, the Cannabis Research
[SPEAKER_00]: Initiative, also through LA County
Department of Health, actually have a list
[SPEAKER_00]: of recommendations and rules and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, a physician handbook for
physicians who are willing to consider
[SPEAKER_00]: recommending cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a start, but I don't know,
we need to work on butt tender
[SPEAKER_00]: certification.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you have a room full of folks who,
or at least many of them, are in that
[SPEAKER_03]: space, so I totally agree with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have Dejane here in front, who will
absolutely do that when she opens her
[SPEAKER_03]: shop, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so, we have Dr. Michael.
[SPEAKER_03]: No plug, no plug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Michael Masterman-Smith is an
entrepreneurial scientist, cancer
[SPEAKER_03]: biologist, pharmacologist, and healthcare
expert, who holds the distinction of being
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the co-discoverers of cancer stem
cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: He found his initial colony in medical
research while working with pediatric
[SPEAKER_03]: pre-entumer patients, as one of the first
seven trained scientists in historic
[SPEAKER_03]: California nanosystems to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: He developed advanced single cell analysis
technology for precision oncology,
[SPEAKER_03]: next generation nanoelectronics or SPAR
lenses, consumer electronics, wearable
[SPEAKER_03]: medical devices, digital health and
applications, and aerospace and aviation.
[SPEAKER_03]: His current efforts include
multidisciplinary approaches to
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding and treating pain,
combat, and opioid epidemic, improving
[SPEAKER_03]: clinical trials, reducing their costs,
enabling precision cancer diagnostics,
[SPEAKER_03]: and engineering a visible ultralight
nanomechanics for
[SPEAKER_03]: necropilots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing here, this gentleman has an
incredibly long and impressive,
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, and it was even longer,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, thank you for cutting it out
and making it easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, here's a question I would love to ask
you, Michael.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd love to hear your thoughts on the
current state of the healthcare system and
[SPEAKER_03]: research right now around candidate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow, can I, do you wanna take that one?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna, all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll back you up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, it's the healthcare system and medical
cannabis, so two questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: The healthcare system right now,
we're going through growing pains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our pharmaceutical, as we're recognizing,
we have some problems in our
[SPEAKER_05]: pharmaceutical industries that there's
gonna be some realigning that's gonna take
[SPEAKER_05]: place.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're now understanding that companies
that have produced these opioids are
[SPEAKER_05]: losing market share, and there's gonna be
some shifts that are gonna take place,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we might get control over this
disaster.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no way to explain it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a failure on every single level.
[SPEAKER_05]: That helps democratization of medicine
because people are saying we cannot,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're not sure about that healthcare
industry anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna go try things our own way,
and that's where medical cannabis comes
[SPEAKER_05]: into play, and so I think that's sort of
the, where we're at right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have to get control of our ship.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to get control of our healthcare
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_05]: We spend a tremendous amount of our
resources are put directly into taking
[SPEAKER_05]: care of patients, but we're not actually
getting particularly better, so that's in
[SPEAKER_05]: comparison to other industrialized
nations, so there's some issues that,
[SPEAKER_05]: which goes back to what John was saying
about where in the original thinking of
[SPEAKER_05]: healthcare was people going after
something difficult, people suffering,
[SPEAKER_05]: and going after and doing anything they
can possibly can to alleviate that
[SPEAKER_05]: suffering.
[SPEAKER_05]: That created our healthcare industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It created our pharmaceutical companies,
and it was just, things were a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: simpler 100 years ago, and they did rely
on plants for a number of treatments.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was an accepted thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we've become, now we've got all these
great assets and all these great tools.
[SPEAKER_05]: They now need to be applied to this new
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no way to go do this parallel
route.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hopefully we'll be able to, there'll be
some culling in the healthcare sector,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think, directly related to cannabis and
directly related to how it's gonna be used
[SPEAKER_05]: as a common, whether it's immunomodulator,
whether it's immune system function,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's pain, whether it's cancer,
these are a number of different diseases
[SPEAKER_05]: that we just don't have good drugs for,
so that's gonna be a natural phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our healthcare system can improve.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna take active voters,
and like Jack Harris said, two things,
[SPEAKER_05]: vote and run for office.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you wanna democratize medicine,
you now take the hill, do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I ran for Congress this year, and I ran on
a medical cannabis platform, and it was
[SPEAKER_05]: something because I was a scientist.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, I can help here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a pharmacologist.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's ways that we can do great things
if we just tweak what we're doing,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I think now we're realizing the
institutions are there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a whole new style of companies
that are now coming to fulfill healthcare
[SPEAKER_05]: response, fulfill things that we weren't
able to.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to educate our tenders,
and our businesses need to up their game.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doctors are ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: The doctors are ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're reaching the point where we're no
longer early adopters.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is now gonna be a part of our
healthcare system, but as an industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: we have to up our game so that the patient
feels comfortable, the doctors feel
[SPEAKER_05]: comfortable, and that everybody's together
on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did I answer?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: If I could back up, yeah, I agree with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're quite ready, but the point is,
as someone who also does clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: research, it's a real bear out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point I got, the institutional review
boards are generally very antagonistic
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about trying to do anything
related to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Institutional boards have been very
resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had long discussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I even had a simple survey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took three months to get approval,
but the point is, generally, they're
[SPEAKER_00]: asking that any kind of cannabis,
even hemp, has to be cupped in a locked
[SPEAKER_00]: storeroom somewhere on the institution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard all the problems of getting it
from Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Generally, it is really very difficult to
this point to do a randomized clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: trial.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost impossible at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is, if we're gonna get the
information we need, we're gonna have to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce some of these barriers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping now that the December 2018 farm
bill will allow us to look at hemp-derived
[SPEAKER_00]: products, hemp-derived terpenes,
that will open up a whole new,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the IRBs are just a couple months off.
[SPEAKER_00]: They haven't quite heard the message yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Real medicine is always gonna be a little
bit slow.
[SPEAKER_05]: The medicine doesn't come easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you can say, listen, this works.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're natural beings, human beings,
and plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all, they're really complicated
organisms.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some patients, but at the same
time, we're all inpatient, because we have
[SPEAKER_05]: a field that needs to be built.
[SPEAKER_05]: The clinical trial aspects are very,
in some ways, take away the
[SPEAKER_05]: democratization of medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: We now know this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We know our clinical trials are
ridiculously expensive, and they're
[SPEAKER_05]: time-consuming, and they're not getting
the outcomes that we should be getting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that presents opportunities in
this industry to take some of what our
[SPEAKER_05]: infrastructure is in the industry and be
able to do that type of, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: we have phenomenal testing labs that are
showing up, that are complying to
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations that are really sophisticated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we were saying, we need to understand
the terpenes and the cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they do have an impact on very
important conditions we have, and goes
[SPEAKER_05]: back to raising, you know, our game has to
get up in order to be able to go to the
[SPEAKER_05]: institutions and be able to say,
hey, listen, how are we gonna do this?
[SPEAKER_05]: How are we gonna get that?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a couple of, the federal
government is just starting to fund pain
[SPEAKER_05]: research grants.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's gonna be a real asset to get the
institutions on board.
[SPEAKER_05]: California has $100 million.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over the next five years, it's gonna go
once the taxes are paid, and there's
[SPEAKER_05]: revenue coming in that are gonna go
towards medical research, and I think
[SPEAKER_05]: those things will help the cause.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, the clinical trial aspects is a,
even for a normal drug, it's brain damage.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have improvements that are being
made, you know, hopefully faster than,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, sooner than later at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, Sheila, that really segues
all into the question I wanted to ask you,
[SPEAKER_03]: because you spent many years helping a
cancer immunology company build a massive
[SPEAKER_03]: global IQ portfolio.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those of us, like me, who are
really legacy cannabis folks, would you
[SPEAKER_03]: please give us an eye into what that
looked like, and then share whatever
[SPEAKER_03]: experiences that really informs,
from that experience, that informs how you
[SPEAKER_03]: work with your clients now, because you're
now working with Kansas companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, so I did that for a, it's a company
here in, well, not any longer,
[SPEAKER_02]: but in Southern California, and we started
from just one patent application.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was some research done at a university
that then was taken out and researched
[SPEAKER_02]: further privately.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we built the portfolio, and they were
getting very exciting results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, this is lab results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we moved to animal models,
and they were still getting very good
[SPEAKER_02]: results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in that process of going through that,
you know, I was very, we had built this
[SPEAKER_02]: from one single patent application to
probably hundreds of applications that we
[SPEAKER_02]: were prosecuting all around the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was overseeing all of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was because they were getting
such exciting results.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, up next would have been
FDA, you know, they started their clinical
[SPEAKER_02]: trials, you know, early clinical trials to
evaluate safety.
[SPEAKER_02]: And efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how that informed me was, you know,
one of the, and this is why I became so
[SPEAKER_02]: passionate about what the FDA is doing,
is because, you know, I was very involved
[SPEAKER_02]: in that work and very committed to what
they were doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then they had another division of
their company that was, also had an
[SPEAKER_02]: inhaled insulin product that, you know,
really looked promising in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: patient compliance, where you're inhaling
insulin versus injecting insulin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the FDA process for them nearly sunk
them completely, and it certainly killed
[SPEAKER_02]: off their entire cancer research division.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was so disheartening for me to go
through, you know, because that was all of
[SPEAKER_02]: my work.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just slowly abandoned, you know,
one patent family here, another patent
[SPEAKER_02]: family here, until just the entire
portfolio.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the unfortunate thing with,
you know, if you don't have patents,
[SPEAKER_02]: patents really are a tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about getting investors to put money
in and have a way for them to see,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, have the patents.
[SPEAKER_02]: What they do is provide them a way so that
they can see how they're going to recoup
[SPEAKER_02]: their money.
[SPEAKER_02]: The exclusivity is what's going to allow
them to recoup their money.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, to see when things are not
patented or something like this,
[SPEAKER_02]: where all their patents went abandoned,
you really don't see any research done on
[SPEAKER_02]: them after that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because once it goes abandoned,
it's in the public domain, nobody's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to want to spend any more money on it
because they can't see a way to recoup
[SPEAKER_02]: their investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's one of the ways,
you know, that's one of the reasons that I
[SPEAKER_02]: got very involved in thinking through,
you know, a couple different models for
[SPEAKER_02]: the FDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it also helps now because what I see
right now in terms of the work that's
[SPEAKER_02]: being done is, interestingly, most of the
patent applications that are being filed
[SPEAKER_02]: right now are not being filed by Big
Pharma.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know they're filing in Canada,
but not in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if that is, you know,
political reasons or they just can't
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want to do that yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I see right now a window where people
who are in this, the pioneers in this,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the research, getting the data,
you know, there's this window for them to
[SPEAKER_02]: file for patent protection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because we know what Big Pharma is
going to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it's federally legalized,
it's going to be all about an IP game.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know how to play that game.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't have a way to either
negotiate what they're asking you to pay
[SPEAKER_02]: in a royalty by, well, let me offer you
what I have patented or to defend against
[SPEAKER_02]: a lawsuit, then you're really just a
sitting duck and just waiting to pay
[SPEAKER_02]: royalties to Big Pharma.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of the patent game that I've
seen the cancer industry go through and
[SPEAKER_02]: just biotech and pharma, when it came to
cannabis, that was what really motivated
[SPEAKER_02]: me to get involved and to speak out and to
try to do more to educate all of these
[SPEAKER_02]: researchers and companies and everyone
who's putting all of this work into it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, find a way to make sure that you
have a post-legalization strategy.
They're
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of, I'm curious if you could do the
same, what it looks like here versus in
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada versus in other countries,
just so that we can get kind of a more
[SPEAKER_03]: global picture of the state of research,
how easy it is, what doctors, how they see
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, sort of that global picture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's really pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: policy towards cannabis research and drug
development is bone-in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one-headed, approaching criminal,
and there's no other way to describe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It pretty much forced us out of the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two divisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: One division cultivates, extracts,
sells products in Nevada, and we work in
[SPEAKER_01]: Louisiana, too, with LSU for the patients
of Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our research side, we were stymied
over and over again when we tried to move
[SPEAKER_01]: towards animal studies, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we finally threw up our hands,
and we created a new company that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: subsidiary of GBSciences.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has the very unpretentious name of GBS
Global Bio Pharma, and I didn't think of
[SPEAKER_01]: the name, but that's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They convinced me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we moved it up there and created the
company, and now Andrea is doing our
[SPEAKER_01]: animal studies with the National Research
Council of Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only were we able to do the research,
they opened us enthusiastically with
[SPEAKER_01]: welcome arms.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we first approached them,
they said, well, there's 25 or 30
[SPEAKER_01]: companies ahead of you in line,
and so we might be able to get to you next
[SPEAKER_01]: year, year after.
[SPEAKER_01]: That didn't work very well for us,
so I sent Andrea, Dr. Andrea Small-Howard,
[SPEAKER_01]: our resident assassin, who went up there
and showed them our data and made a
[SPEAKER_01]: presentation on what we were trying to do
and our research, and they moved us to the
[SPEAKER_01]: front of the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that wouldn't happen in the U.S.,
okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the situation is more favorable in
virtually any country.
[SPEAKER_01]: Europe, most of Europe, not all,
but most of Europe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Australia, we've heard some pretty good
pitches about coming down there and doing
[SPEAKER_01]: trials, and there's a more important
aspect to it I wanna speak to,
[SPEAKER_01]: is that in the U.S., if you have a
cannabis compound, you do an IRB test,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it results in efficacy and safety,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're bound to go to the FDA approach
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ever wanna open your mouth about
the results from your pilot study or
[SPEAKER_01]: trial, you gotta go through the full
10-year, billion-dollar, often death
[SPEAKER_01]: march, as you experience, to getting it to
the patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 10 years, a billion dollars later.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why drugs cost so much,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: In Canada, they do have a couple
alternative paths.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not necessarily shorter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They require evidence-based medicine,
but you have an alternative.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go what's called the medical
supplements route or the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: supplements route, which is a new
category, and you can do your trials,
[SPEAKER_01]: publish your results, make claims,
and start selling it to patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: That takes a matter of one or two years,
as opposed to 10, it's a matter of a
[SPEAKER_01]: million dollars, maybe, instead of a
billion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to figure things out and
help patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The U.S., FDA, 50% of their operating
costs are funded by the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in business to perpetuate a system
that profits the farm industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Earlier, Michael said that the farm
industry, like every industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: started talking about healing,
but that's just like politicians starting
[SPEAKER_01]: out talking about doing good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty soon, they get co-opted by the
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The money overtakes their sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, so if we could reorient the
pharmaceutical industry in the U.S.,
[SPEAKER_01]: open up research, then maybe we got a
chance, but right now, patients in the U
[SPEAKER_01]: .S.
[SPEAKER_01]: are getting a bad deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: John, we actually got some very good early
data on graft versus host, which could
[SPEAKER_00]: save children's lives, could not do the
study.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did the phase two in Israel and are
about doing phase three, and the FDA is
[SPEAKER_00]: aware of it, but wouldn't let us do it
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have deaf ears, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're plugged up with money.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing, and then I want to hear the
rest of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's marketing push and
there's demand pull.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a marketing guy, you either
convince them to buy it or the demand
[SPEAKER_01]: pulls it to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's our strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take these compounds,
we're going to develop them on a fast path
[SPEAKER_01]: as medical supplements.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to get them in the hands of
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of our compounds is a Parkinson's
compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's hope it works, knock on wood.
[SPEAKER_01]: Assuming it's efficacious, we're going to
start selling it in Europe and in Canada
[SPEAKER_01]: as a medical supplement or a cannabis
supplement based on the new category.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not going to charge an arm and a leg
for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have GIST, gastrointestinal stromal
tumors, the cancer I have for 19 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: 19 years ago, a group of us formed a
nonprofit called the LifeRaf Group,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's to help patients and sponsor
research, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were one of the first online viral
communities of patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got written up, case studies and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, the point is, right now,
every disease state on the planet has a
[SPEAKER_01]: viral support group.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to Canada and have a drug,
a compound, that helps Parkinson's
[SPEAKER_01]: patients, every Parkinson's patient in the
U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: is going to know about it and raise holy
hell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Raise holy hell nicely.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of us, we've got to,
it goes back to this, we're improving our
[SPEAKER_05]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: When the standards of our industry improve
and our businesses improve, we're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: start to get the, we are getting the
attention as a healthcare, as a treatment,
[SPEAKER_05]: as a preventative.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are words that get used by the FDA
as being, as rejecting the new medicines
[SPEAKER_05]: coming in saying you can't do this,
you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing is, what hurts this business is
when somebody in our industry doesn't do
[SPEAKER_05]: what they're supposed to be doing,
and then the FDA says, you're selling this
[SPEAKER_05]: product as a treatment, it doesn't even
have what you're saying on the bottle.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the kinds of things that don't
help any of us.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the rise of, these are the things
that are easily remedied.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you just improve, there's a desire to
improve and this industry can
[SPEAKER_05]: self-regulate and do and provide good
products, then we have an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_05]: do this in the United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: We already have the opportunity in the
United States to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The businesses are on the radar of the
companies that want to do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'm a pharmacologist, so I was
trained to go develop drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: This happens to be a broad-spectrum
compound that has a lot of use.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still trying to figure out those
exact uses and how it should be used and
[SPEAKER_05]: let you self-titrate and things like that,
but that's another that goes back to the
[SPEAKER_05]: democratization.
[SPEAKER_05]: Folks are trying to figure out what works
and if they find something reliable,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's a patient that's always going to
come back and be used and they're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: find the relief that they have.
[SPEAKER_05]: In some cases, we are already doing this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have an opioid epidemic.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has to be fixed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the data that's coming out from
folks who study the opioid epidemic is
[SPEAKER_05]: that cannabis is one of the things that's
relieving the opioid epidemic.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is happening irrespective of pharma.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's happening irrespective of the FDA and
it's happening irrespective of a Congress
[SPEAKER_05]: that is still trying to get a handle on
moving these things forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: The solution is have a good business do
good work, help people.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rewards will start to come and it'll
hopefully change our culture a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: because I know my folks that are in the
pharmaceutical industry, they're not happy
[SPEAKER_05]: pushing a drug that they got to create a
$10 billion market because it took a
[SPEAKER_05]: billion dollars to develop.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not happy with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're trying to find and their question,
they're starting to make phone calls and
[SPEAKER_05]: start to take the conversations with like,
well, what are you guys doing over there?
[SPEAKER_05]: We know we can help.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just have to find it.
[SPEAKER_05]: In some ways, like I said, raise help
would be nice because there's some really
[SPEAKER_05]: good people that are in these companies
that are trying to get their companies
[SPEAKER_05]: changed and get them on a track that can
be providing better healthcare that's
[SPEAKER_05]: cheaper and it's all the way up to the
boardrooms, right down to the mom and pop
[SPEAKER_05]: shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many, many, everyone I've ever encountered
in healthcare and all of my trials,
[SPEAKER_01]: tribulations really cared, really wanted
to help.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the system that constrains them in
their ability to do so.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the systems suck.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to tell you right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: The institutions are, they're going
through some pains.
[SPEAKER_05]: The government's going through some pains.
[SPEAKER_05]: The industries are going through some
pains.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are actually the right conditions
for opportunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: It falls upon, a lot of different things
happen to get us into a situation where
[SPEAKER_05]: we're taking too many drugs, we're not
getting health out, we're paying a fortune
[SPEAKER_05]: for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've got crises that are being managed by
individuals and we're managing the crisis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is an indication that we're doing the
right thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a thing about, I don't want to
make bad drugs.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know the drugs to treat cancer are very
expensive to develop, but cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_05]: seem to do the exact same thing as those
drugs that are really hard to develop from
[SPEAKER_05]: a lab perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have great faith that we're going to
self-right and get this right and the
[SPEAKER_05]: right people will be there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll have your right attorneys that are
fighting for you and you'll have your
[SPEAKER_05]: right business people that are saying,
hey, listen, just keep on going.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep taking care of people and we'll
figure out all the financing to make sure
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're stable and sustainable in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to have doctors that are,
everybody's fighting a battle somewhere in
[SPEAKER_05]: their institution or their industry or
their government to get, to move these
[SPEAKER_05]: things on.
[SPEAKER_05]: The profound statement of democratizing
medicine is that you're all involved in
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just happen to be up here because they
asked, they said, hey, you know something,
[SPEAKER_05]: come on up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how it happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know something, you have some idea,
you can lend some insight to this,
[SPEAKER_05]: here, come up on stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are great, these are the events,
the microscopes and machines.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the events that are enabling
everyone to get on the same page and
[SPEAKER_05]: become a unified network to be able to
handle some big boy, big pants,
[SPEAKER_05]: like I described in a conversation to the
health insurance industry, it was like
[SPEAKER_05]: it's grown up pants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put on the grown up pants and everything's
going to be great.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we have to get there and these are the
events that are going to bring us together
[SPEAKER_05]: and you're going to find your network and
you'll be like, okay, this is a very,
[SPEAKER_05]: very, very long, the supply chains in this
industry are just as complicated as big
[SPEAKER_05]: pharma.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if we already have really complicated
supply chains and we're resolving those
[SPEAKER_05]: complicated supply chains, then you're a
boutique pharmaceutical company at this
[SPEAKER_05]: point.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether you want to call it yourself that,
some people are scared of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't want to use the term
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my God, that's horrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the definition of my job is
pharmacologist.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't take my training and say that's
not important anymore because it's out of
[SPEAKER_05]: fashion.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I'm saying is, as a pharmacologist,
go do your jobs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go do your jobs and medicine will be
democratized and let's create an industry
[SPEAKER_05]: that is better than the one that we were
handed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so we're going to open it up to a
couple questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to chime in here because the
term that it was actually UCLA professors
[SPEAKER_05]: brought up was clinical observation study.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the medical community does
everything that they need to do in terms
[SPEAKER_05]: of monitoring care and with a reliable,
the conflicts of interest removed and
[SPEAKER_05]: support of a particular, oh my,
I have the ratio, the miracle ratio that's
[SPEAKER_05]: going to change everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then that's a vehicle.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to take a little bit to really
probably get that reliably, but the
[SPEAKER_05]: oncologists need people to, the
oncologists and pain management
[SPEAKER_05]: specialists are in a pinch because they
need to find a reliable business that they
[SPEAKER_05]: can refer patients to now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to figure out some study
things.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's also, with regards to how we're
going to redesign clinical trials because
[SPEAKER_05]: not only in the cannabis industry has
problems with clinical trials,
[SPEAKER_05]: the entire pharmaceutical industry is
having immense problems with their own
[SPEAKER_05]: clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: New tools are having to be developed using
better sources of data, better data
[SPEAKER_05]: collections.
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you recruit properly?
[SPEAKER_05]: How do you retain properly?
[SPEAKER_05]: Using social media for good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those peer groups that John mentioned
about the fact that those peer groups help
[SPEAKER_05]: people get on clinical trials and help
them stay on clinical trials.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we have to design a clinical
observation study with an institution,
[SPEAKER_05]: that can monitor affairs and you have a
reliable small business that is scalable
[SPEAKER_05]: and can do everything right, that has the
right tools, that's a real honest to
[SPEAKER_05]: goodness thing that, like I said,
if you have the data and you're doing your
[SPEAKER_05]: data right and you are perhaps making use
of some new ways to do clinical trials,
[SPEAKER_05]: then that's a model that can be presented
to regulators and let the barrier of entry
[SPEAKER_05]: go down and say, listen, we got to go
move.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then that lets the FDA and the powers of
B, that everything sort of shifts and
[SPEAKER_05]: hopefully we'll have a new way to do
clinical research because we're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think it's a great promise,
but the problem I have is that it's doable
[SPEAKER_00]: to do clinical observational studies and
registries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We discussed it several times this
meeting, but the problem is, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: educated consumer, I'm used to the big
data we get by looking at large databases,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the variables aren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't really help me know about pay
management if the patient writes down,
[SPEAKER_00]: yes, cannabis helped me and it was blue
drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which blue drink?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which terpene?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which ratio?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order for the clinical observational
stuff to really give us information we
[SPEAKER_00]: need, we're going to need to have the
consumer more knowledgeable about what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're putting in their body.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are big believers in patient-reported
outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The NIH has promulgated standards for
patient-reported outcome and how it can be
[SPEAKER_01]: used in clinical research.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's even HIPAA-compliant versions of
patient-reported outcomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What patient-reported outcome does is
leverages what you're talking about to get
[SPEAKER_01]: larger data sets, but the key in a PRO,
a patient-reported outcome system,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the questions you ask and their own
knowledge of what they actually were
[SPEAKER_01]: dosing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's an area that's very ripe for
development and will become a bigger and
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger factor in drug development and
we're going to be users of it.
One last question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, thank you all so much for being
incredible five years in each of the
[SPEAKER_04]: things that you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I absolutely am in awe and I thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do we as taxpayers in the great state
of California get the UC system to teach
[SPEAKER_04]: the ECS in medical school about
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis medicine and calcic?
How do we encourage that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I don't know a lot of doctors that
know about the ECS.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to do a better job of PRing our
first initial efforts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dejan Evans, who walked away from the
table, is actually somebody who's had some
[SPEAKER_00]: interest, for example, in the community
college course.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a whole bunch of initiatives that
are just starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we're much more aware now we need to
educate butt tenders at doctors and
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we need a concerted effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is who's going to actually pay
for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't necessarily benefit any given
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of it's grassroots at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we're trying hard.
How do we support you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we write our elected officials and say,
hey, we want our... What I think we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to do, actually, a horrible to say,
but dispensary people, if you're a butt
[SPEAKER_00]: tenderer, you should be required,
I believe, to have minimum certification
[SPEAKER_00]: to know side effects, ask people about
what med-cad medications are on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be minimal knowledge,
maybe not the highest knowledge,
[SPEAKER_00]: but minimal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, just like we're doing
toxicology, butt tenders need to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: better certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: Physicians, we're going to start off
trying to offer CME credit, which drives
[SPEAKER_00]: things that we can make it... Right now,
it's not CME.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make it CME.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep, physicians will... How do I help you
make it CME?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to work through our local medical
societies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're right about writing letters
and using your voice and never
[SPEAKER_02]: underestimating what your unique
experience... I think that's one thing I
[SPEAKER_02]: love about this industry is everybody
comes from a different background and has
[SPEAKER_02]: a very unique perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not an FDA attorney.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just close enough to the process that
I'd never written an FDA comment before,
[SPEAKER_02]: but when I started writing it,
I realized I've got this very unique
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective on something and it's useful
still.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't underestimate what your perspective
is and the power of your voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's going to be a lot of letter
writing and a lot of urging Congress to
[SPEAKER_02]: force the FDA is hand, and I think Dr.
Chen mentioned about, let's start
[SPEAKER_02]: regulating some of these terms that we're
using, either with certification marks or
[SPEAKER_02]: some...
[SPEAKER_02]: There has to be a starting point for that,
but I think it's all going to be about
[SPEAKER_02]: your voice and using the unique
perspective that you bring to this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: On this, what you can do to help these
things happen are... Well, the president
[SPEAKER_05]: of the University of California,
you can find her email.
[SPEAKER_05]: She happened to be in charge of our
Homeland Security, I believe, under the
[SPEAKER_05]: Obama administration.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is this kind of act.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an advocacy that go to the top people
and go to find the list of chancellors and
[SPEAKER_05]: the deans at all of the University of
California and say, listen, what's your
[SPEAKER_05]: plan here?
[SPEAKER_05]: Let them engage them in sense of,
what's your plan here because this is
[SPEAKER_05]: happening?
[SPEAKER_05]: I know there's a whole lot of folks that
could really use some guidance on this and
[SPEAKER_05]: show that the decisions that they made at
the University of California or any other
[SPEAKER_05]: university system, for that matter,
can help our communities with this
[SPEAKER_05]: research that needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: The medical boards, when I was lobbying
and trying to get funding and all the
[SPEAKER_05]: other things, one of the things that I
said, it was like the University of
[SPEAKER_05]: California and the state of California can
actually go to the medical boards in
[SPEAKER_05]: California and say, you need to give us a
plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: You need to have a plan to educate your
doctors on this and we're gonna do our
[SPEAKER_05]: part by putting together some curriculum
for med school.
[SPEAKER_05]: Med school's hard, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of stuff these guys have to
learn to fit into one, a couple of years
[SPEAKER_05]: worth of time, but it is kind of they have
to sort of adjust.
[SPEAKER_05]: What course has to get pushed out of the
way, but at the same time, we also know
[SPEAKER_05]: all the med students want to be trained in
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: The scientists are looking for jobs in
this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just happens to be that out of nowhere,
my alma mater, UCLA, invited me back to go
[SPEAKER_05]: talk to graduate students.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of us, when we leave campus,
we're like, we're outta here, thank you,
[SPEAKER_05]: time to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are kinds of things that are
happening in real time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think maybe next year, when we have this
conversation again, you'll say,
[SPEAKER_05]: we might be that much further apart
because some high level people might have
[SPEAKER_05]: said, yeah, we need to be doing what we're
supposed to be doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a lot of faith in the fact that the
med schools are gonna come around.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a hero right here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give him a round of applause.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any institutional medical school professor
that is trying to make this happen is the
[SPEAKER_05]: tip of the spear in all of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have to work day in and day out to
convince a very large, very difficult
[SPEAKER_05]: institution to deal with to change how
they go about their lives.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing it one doctor at a time,
one chancellor at a time, one dean at a
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: That really is the democratization.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna leave this to Ariel because now
I'm talking too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, that was wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for also honoring doctors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm honored to sit here with you and thank
you all so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm part of the faculty advisory board for
the UCLA Canvas Research Initiative,
[SPEAKER_00]: which includes professors from multiple
departments, whether it be social equity,
[SPEAKER_00]: justice, legal, because we're working on
issues of social equity for dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution, for expungement of felons,
et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a long, long list and we're
looking at it from multiple perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important that we don't focus on
just the medical aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You gotta have a university which can look
at all the aspects of going around and
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the impact on our communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to communicate with the city
of Los Angeles to say what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: positive benefits and also try to,
by social equity, ensure there's
[SPEAKER_00]: appropriate geographic representation in
communities that have been underserved.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
