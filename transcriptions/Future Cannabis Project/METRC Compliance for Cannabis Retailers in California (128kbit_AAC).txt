[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Brett Hartman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm director of operations for Alternative
Medicine Group located in Bel Air and I
[SPEAKER_00]: oversee purchasing project management for
Green Cross of Torrance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am community liaison for De La Motta
Cannabis Cultivation Company and I'm the
[SPEAKER_00]: founder of My Cannabis Trainer,
which is a consulting company that works
[SPEAKER_00]: from everything from compliance to
cannabinoid recommendations for two
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians and veterinarians.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work primarily with getting our stores
ready through licensing, preparing the
[SPEAKER_00]: stores for licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have received our temporary license
last year in February.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were one of the first stores here in
Los Angeles, Alternative Medicine Group
[SPEAKER_00]: and Green Cross and we are working on
getting our state's full certification
[SPEAKER_00]: which will come in in September.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time we'll be requested to meet
these metric track and trace situation
[SPEAKER_00]: where currently right now we are handling
our manifest just like we should every
[SPEAKER_00]: time we get an order and it's coming from
somebody who's legal and compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're getting their COAs every single time
that we get an order but these are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually protocols that we put in place
before January.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were already working with vendors that
we knew were going to be compliant and
[SPEAKER_00]: then in February we were put in a
situation where once we got our license we
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't buy product really from anybody
and our stores were pretty empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we were the first stores to really
be legally open.
[SPEAKER_00]: In February, on February 5th when the
stores got their license prior to that we
[SPEAKER_00]: could order from about 30 or 40 vendors
which was a massive reduction from who we
[SPEAKER_00]: could order from prior to January.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been having these periods of time
where every time we go through regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: we have an abrupt smaller amount of
product that I can buy for the stores and
[SPEAKER_00]: that means less product for the patients
which also means less tax revenue for the
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in February that was the situation we
were met with.
[SPEAKER_00]: In July 1st a lot of people were taken off
guard because everybody got temporary
[SPEAKER_00]: extensions on all of these things but they
did not extend the packaging and the lab
[SPEAKER_00]: testing requirements which a lot of people
had anticipated that they would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the issues that I see in
the cannabis industry is that we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have foresight into what is going to be
coming down the road for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may think that they're going to give
you an extension but you should always
[SPEAKER_00]: prepare that they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem with why stores were
not prepared for July 1st is because we
[SPEAKER_00]: were dealing with vendors that were
telling us that they were going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant however they were not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't for packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't have the lab testing,
the phase two lab testing and it put us
[SPEAKER_00]: all in a situation where as of July 1st a
lot of stores had zero product and those
[SPEAKER_00]: were stores that had no foresight.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not prepare until the last week
of June like oh I can't sell my own
[SPEAKER_00]: product anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's clear off all of our product that we
have so I don't have to send any of it to
[SPEAKER_00]: be destroyed and then we'll just buy
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it wasn't that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody was already cleared out of
stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we start on July 1st we probably
had max eight to ten vendors that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: that we had on our shelves that we could
work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the brands that we had were Island
up north, Floor Cowl for flower products
[SPEAKER_00]: and then for product wise we had Heavy
Hitters for vapor pens, Pure Vape and
[SPEAKER_00]: tincture wise we had Papa and Barkley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edibles we had Canico.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a vendor for each category but
the product diversity was so minimal that
[SPEAKER_00]: people were coming in the door on July 1st
and just terribly upset that you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have this and you don't have that and it's
our obligation to the patients and to the
[SPEAKER_00]: customers to explain to them the reason
why so they understand that their voice
[SPEAKER_00]: can be heard as well not just as angry
with us but angry you know talk to your
[SPEAKER_00]: representatives talk to the government go
in place you know a lot of people still
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to come out of the green closet
but this is the situation we're in and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we've made it through each of these
milestones and we have survived every step
[SPEAKER_00]: of the way and then here in September when
we have to go for our metric track and
[SPEAKER_00]: trace training we'll have 30 days after
that to comply and to be completely on
[SPEAKER_00]: metric which our point of sale system we
have switched to a point of sale system
[SPEAKER_00]: that will be fully integrated into the
system however it's still our obligation
[SPEAKER_00]: to verify that everything is in there
properly and we are going to be hiring and
[SPEAKER_00]: training an individual that is going to be
our compliance specialist for the store
[SPEAKER_00]: because there is no way that we can put
that on any employee that we have right
[SPEAKER_00]: now without that proper training in place
and it is we have to do our due diligence
[SPEAKER_00]: because even if my employee makes a
mistake I can't tell the state oh my
[SPEAKER_00]: employee made a mistake I let them go and
you know please forgive me we're still
[SPEAKER_00]: fully responsible for anything that any of
our staff members do here so we have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant has always been a huge issue for
us because we were a pre-ico property
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary so if we ever stepped outside
of that we could have our store shut down
[SPEAKER_00]: so I think for us we have always kept
compliance as the foundation of how we
[SPEAKER_00]: were moving forward in this in this
industry because it was the only way to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive and that's why a lot of the
companies have not I remember when we
[SPEAKER_00]: passed legalization and they came out and
said you know 90% of the companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: exist right now are not going to exist
into the future and I believe that and I
[SPEAKER_00]: actually think that that was not correct I
think it's like 95% previous to being
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed we switched from biotrac to trees
and there was many reasons why we switched
[SPEAKER_00]: to trees to meet a lot of the needs that
we had for our growing company we needed
[SPEAKER_00]: an inventory system that was going to be
integrated into metric we needed an
[SPEAKER_00]: inventory that we could do online menus
and that was going to be a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: user-friendly than this system that we had
I evaluated multiple companies when we
[SPEAKER_00]: when we went down that route and I can't
every company is growing every company is
[SPEAKER_00]: learning from their mistakes and I feel
that trees is doing that another company
[SPEAKER_00]: that I really recommend to people is green
bits I've been a big supporter of them as
[SPEAKER_00]: well I think they have an awesome team an
awesome platform but right now that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're currently using for our stores as
trees because they will also be metric
[SPEAKER_00]: track and trace integrated to where at the
end of every night I'm not going to sit
[SPEAKER_00]: there and have to upload all of ourselves
to metric the system should be doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically every 10 minutes the
requirements for us as a retailer for
[SPEAKER_00]: corresponding information to metric is
that the end of every day we have to send
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves that we have to the system every
two weeks we have to apply our inventory
[SPEAKER_00]: to the system which the way that we do is
we do a we do a different inventory every
[SPEAKER_00]: single day so either it's vapor and
extracts and we do that so basically we
[SPEAKER_00]: will be supplying that every week to the
system and we have the opportunity that
[SPEAKER_00]: trees will update that information into
the system to metric and it's our
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility if we want that to go
smoothly is to make sure that we're always
[SPEAKER_00]: on point that we didn't make any mistakes
when we entered manifests into the system
[SPEAKER_00]: and that is the point of using a system as
integrated as theirs is that it will do a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of that work for us to where we are
pretty much just auditing it constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are required to send ourselves
every single day into the system some
[SPEAKER_00]: stores specifically in Colorado where
they've had a little bit more time with
[SPEAKER_00]: some of this is they have been sitting
there for hours at the end of the day just
[SPEAKER_00]: uploading their cells into the system and
if one of those 24 digit numbers is off it
[SPEAKER_00]: kicks back the entire report and then you
have to go through there and find out why
[SPEAKER_00]: this number is incorrect and where it
ended up being incorrect is when it was
[SPEAKER_00]: received into the system to where somebody
did not properly put in that number and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why it's kicking back the report so
for us our obligation throughout the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire thing is to just audit every step
of the way to make sure that the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the night we have a smooth transition to
where we're literally just closing out our
[SPEAKER_00]: system closing out our drawers and go home
and to where it's uploaded everything
[SPEAKER_00]: verify everything's uploaded because if we
have one situation where it didn't upload
[SPEAKER_00]: we are no longer compliant we are no
longer meeting metrics track and trace
[SPEAKER_00]: standards and that puts our license at
risk it's huge fines all for what are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be is very simple mistakes and
that's why I think it's very important for
[SPEAKER_00]: stores for every single cannabis company
right now having a new department built
[SPEAKER_00]: just around compliance so things that
we've been doing to prepare for metric
[SPEAKER_00]: track and trace is obviously inventories
are crucial to our store and we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing that since before we even knew that
metric track and trace was going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: going into effect or when it was going
into effect a lot of stores don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: inventory like they should be they do you
know an all-over inventory once a month or
[SPEAKER_00]: they they do a half-ass job doing it and
for us it's I take my experience doing
[SPEAKER_00]: track and trace basically with control
drugs from the veterinary world where we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to send in a report every single
month on what is how much fentanyl we have
[SPEAKER_00]: and where was it used and why we have the
loss that we have I'm taking those
[SPEAKER_00]: inventory best practices from the
veterinary world and then from retail when
[SPEAKER_00]: we would do that in clothing when I
oversaw stores in retail and applying them
[SPEAKER_00]: all into here and I think that that's what
I'm really excited about in cannabis right
[SPEAKER_00]: now is now that we're legalized we're
starting to be able to bring professionals
[SPEAKER_00]: from other industries and bring their best
practices into that and that's what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: integrating right now is I have my sales
managers from Nordstrom my inventory
[SPEAKER_00]: manager has a strong background in
shipping and shipping manifest so this is
[SPEAKER_00]: all going to be a benefit to our store and
we're taking those best practices but
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been doing a lot of this stuff for
when we require when you ship me a product
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see your manifest I need to see
these type of things before manifest even
[SPEAKER_00]: happen I you were not delivering anything
to my store without a paper invoice
[SPEAKER_00]: without who it was going to without you
sending me your license beforehand and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was in your file and every time you bring
me this it goes into your file and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be continuing to evolve that
system to where it's you know we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to just scan it as soon as it
comes in the door and then we'll have an e
[SPEAKER_00]: version of it while the paper copy and
just doing our due diligence that every
[SPEAKER_00]: time we get an order delivered we sit
there and take our time and count it out
[SPEAKER_00]: with the delivery driver and I think that
that's been an issue in the past is a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of delivery drivers you know just drop it
off and you don't they they're just out
[SPEAKER_00]: the door and we require that you come in
through the back door that you wear your
[SPEAKER_00]: ID badge you check in at the front and and
that when you deliver the product we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to sit there and go through every
single one and make sure it matches that
[SPEAKER_00]: manifest so that when we bring it into our
system that we haven't missed a step there
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not putting something in our system
that isn't there and then I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do an inventory loss report here
when we go to the metric track and trace
[SPEAKER_00]: and honestly it's keeping a tight
inventory system to where there's a checks
[SPEAKER_00]: and balance it's not just one person
checking you know where if you count that
[SPEAKER_00]: it says that we're supposed to have 10
Kaneko cookies you make sure that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: 10 if there's not you have another person
count it to make sure where it's at and
[SPEAKER_00]: just using those best practices from other
industries on inventory to to fit ours
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're going to be under such tight
control that no missing product is going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be acceptable when I got into this
industry four years ago I was shocked that
[SPEAKER_00]: we didn't have requirements on lab testing
and that we did not have requirements on
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging and we didn't have requirements
on tracking you know if a product is grown
[SPEAKER_00]: with some chemical in it we need to know
where it ends up at and even though you
[SPEAKER_00]: know everything that's being tracked and
traced if something comes back that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a recall on it we know every
single product to every single patient to
[SPEAKER_00]: every single customer that we need to
contact and I'm a big proponent of track
[SPEAKER_00]: and trace I I feel like it is what is
going to professionalize this industry to
[SPEAKER_00]: move us into a national and international
platform and that is where cannabis is
[SPEAKER_00]: going it is going to be cumbersome it's
going to be difficult for us to all get
[SPEAKER_00]: through learning how to use a new system
it's any time you have to learn any new
[SPEAKER_00]: program it's going to be difficult but you
just have to go at it with confidence
[SPEAKER_00]: every time you have a training opportunity
deal with it explain it to your staff
[SPEAKER_00]: members so they know more about it as well
so everybody's feeling confident with it
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the things that I would like to
see with metric where it's going to put us
[SPEAKER_00]: into that same issue as January 1st and
February 5th for us and July 1st is that
[SPEAKER_00]: here in September when I'm able to take my
track and trace training I'll have 30 days
[SPEAKER_00]: to comply so does that mean that at the
end of that 30 days that here in October
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm only going to be able to purchase
products from vendors that already have
[SPEAKER_00]: metric track and trace and that is going
to again reduce the amount of product that
[SPEAKER_00]: I can have on my shelves which will again
reduce the amount of tax revenue that the
[SPEAKER_00]: city and the state are is going to see
from cannabis taxes so for me what I would
[SPEAKER_00]: oh for sure it will definitely it's just
another penalty for us however the way I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to think of it as is that you know as
being a pre-ico property dispenser both of
[SPEAKER_00]: the stores are and we've kind of gotten to
have this this we're ahead of the curve in
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of ways we've gotten to to work in
this industry long enough that we should
[SPEAKER_00]: have learned by now that this is how our
industry is going to continue to be it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to be over in October it's not
going to be in January there's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: constant updates to this and I feel that
the state will see some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: hindrances that they've put on us and see
that it's hurting two things it's hurting
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and customers from being able to
get their medicine and it's hurting tax
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue so I really do hope that the
regulators see when we start to move into
[SPEAKER_00]: trekker track and trace that they're just
going to set a date in the future say
[SPEAKER_00]: January 1st 2019 we're all on metric
everybody's in the same boat everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: grab a paddle let's swim you know and I
really do hope that that is what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to happen however it doesn't look like
that and I'm not going to feel I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to expect that to happen because I
feel that you know we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: presented with the same thing so right now
what I'm doing is I'm working with all of
[SPEAKER_00]: my vendors now updating their files on
when do you expect for you to be moving
[SPEAKER_00]: into track and trace so I know who to
order at what times because it's not I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: also the sole buyer for AMG and I oversee
buying for Green Cross and without product
[SPEAKER_00]: our store can't be open and that's where a
lot of stores are currently at right now
[SPEAKER_00]: is they just were not ready for July 1st
and that's why they have no flower on
[SPEAKER_00]: their shelves or they have no product on
their shelves and they're having to shut
[SPEAKER_00]: down temporarily while they get these
products in and I think that that's what's
[SPEAKER_00]: so important also about networking in our
industry is making sure that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting out there and you're going to
events and that you are going to you know
[SPEAKER_00]: available training seminars so that you
can meet people in this industry that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have product available for you
may even possibly be your next compliant
[SPEAKER_00]: officer for your company and I really do
hope that the state feels what we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: through right now in regards to they're
going to see the tax revenue drop from
[SPEAKER_00]: just this month alone because no stores
are having our able to sell what they
[SPEAKER_00]: would normally be selling I also hope that
they see that you know on average they
[SPEAKER_00]: were saying each manufacturer had over
$200,000 worth of product they were unable
[SPEAKER_00]: to move well that's $200,000 worth of
product for them that equates to $48,000
[SPEAKER_00]: worth of excise tax revenue that equates
to over 20 30,000 and basically tax
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue for the city on medical or adult
use taxes and that was a significant pain
[SPEAKER_00]: that each manufacturer is feeling right
now in the state is going to feel it that
[SPEAKER_00]: way I hope that they're able to see like
we need to make extensions at times when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're needed but at the same time let's
get through this together we'll move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and when we get into metric track
and trace we do that together as well you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I think that a lot of people are
really scared of it happening and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to learn about it because
they're scared of it and it's time to just
[SPEAKER_00]: like just suck it up you're a pioneer in
this industry and keep doing that if not
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to get left behind as I have
with countless friends and colleagues and
[SPEAKER_00]: companies they have been left behind
because they were too scared to really
[SPEAKER_00]: move forward with how do I get licensed
how do I get my permits how do I get a
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor license or work with a
distributor who to work with and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what this industry the the regulations are
cleaning that up you know before I'd have
[SPEAKER_00]: to set a meeting with a with a vendor so
that I could ask them everything from how
[SPEAKER_00]: was your product cultivated from the
beginning what you know what is your lab
[SPEAKER_00]: testing where you know basically all these
standards that I set in place and now with
[SPEAKER_00]: these new regulations it's a lot easier
for me you can go ahead and send me all of
[SPEAKER_00]: your license all of your lab testing
results all of your menus to where I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily need to have a sample of your
product to be able to know that this is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be safe for my patients just as
there is an issue right now with getting a
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant and quality products on our
shelves there's going to be a big issue
[SPEAKER_00]: with finding people that want to work in
our industry or that already work in an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry want to come to California to to
help us with this that we can hire on as
[SPEAKER_00]: our compliance officer for our stores and
for our companies and there's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: you know that's definitely going to be a
demand for those individuals and that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: also something that a lot of stores are
not budgeting into their into their annual
[SPEAKER_00]: budget is bringing on somebody with that
kind of ability and it's something that
[SPEAKER_00]: our industry here in California doesn't do
a good job of is is keeping people on
[SPEAKER_00]: their their payroll but you know this is
something that for a long time worth paid
[SPEAKER_00]: cash at the end of every day we do not
build our workforce to be a place where we
[SPEAKER_00]: foster the type of environment that is for
productivity you know we don't offer
[SPEAKER_00]: health insurance we don't offer paid
vacations we don't do a lot of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things and this is going to kind of force
us to step outside of that because these
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals that are professionals in
Colorado and other states are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: those type of benefits and if they're
going to be willing to move to a state
[SPEAKER_00]: such as California with such a high cost
of living and taxes we're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay for that and but it's also going to be
a necessary requirement you need to have
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody who can do this and we need to do
our due diligence on finding those
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals so I'm a big proponent of
LinkedIn I'm a big proponent of networking
[SPEAKER_00]: because this is where you're going to find
those individuals majority of the time my
[SPEAKER_00]: hiring practices I usually do a group
interview and then a one-on-one interview
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I do a working interview where
you come in and we just you get to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: with all the staff members and kind of see
what your job is going to be and make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that the entire staff is cool because
anytime you add somebody to the team it
[SPEAKER_00]: causes a staff dynamic shift and that's
what we need to be looking into when we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be bringing on another manager is
basically what a compliance manager
[SPEAKER_00]: officer is going to be for our stores we
need to know that they're going to fit
[SPEAKER_00]: with our current methods or we need to
change our current methods to meet their
[SPEAKER_00]: standards because this is going to be the
foundation of our industry moving forward
[SPEAKER_00]: if we do not have somebody that we can
fully trust and that is doing their job
[SPEAKER_00]: and it may be that we hire somebody that
with the experience from out of state it
[SPEAKER_00]: may be that we hire somebody with it from
another industry that is able to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: critical thinking skills to develop a
metric track and trace version of what
[SPEAKER_00]: they were doing and that is what we're
going to be doing it's what we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be finding every single one of our
directors for for stores or for companies
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be just as competent in metric
track and trace as their officer and that
[SPEAKER_00]: officer also needs to train have a an
assistant too because we are going to have
[SPEAKER_00]: to give these officers a break and a
vacation and they can't always be there
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's something that our industry has
a hard time too it's like we find somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who works hard and works long hours and
then we work them to death and then they
[SPEAKER_00]: they have poor work productivity after the
first year and then we lose them and we
[SPEAKER_00]: got to hire another workhorse basically
and so it's going to make us have to
[SPEAKER_00]: professionalize our working standards and
one of the things that I really try to
[SPEAKER_00]: implement is a more European business
model to where we have you have quarterly
[SPEAKER_00]: breaks you have you know I would love to
implement health insurance for our staff
[SPEAKER_00]: to where they can just focus on being
happy and healthy and happy healthy people
[SPEAKER_00]: are the most productive people my personal
movement in cannabis is to make it a place
[SPEAKER_00]: that really fosters what the cannabis
plant is about is about homeostasis
[SPEAKER_00]: finding that balance to where you can have
your own life and still come into work and
[SPEAKER_00]: take your time and to rejuvenate because
every time you come back from a vacation
[SPEAKER_00]: you fill back you come back and recharge
and you were able to look at your work
[SPEAKER_00]: from a different perspective so I really
do hope that with metric track and trace
[SPEAKER_00]: and all these things it's just pushing us
forward and making us more professional
[SPEAKER_00]: and there was going to be people left
behind and there is going to be stores
[SPEAKER_00]: that are going to shut down and there are
going to be companies that do not make it
[SPEAKER_01]: into this next realm but you got to fight
what's what are the requirements for who
[SPEAKER_01]: on your team you do put through the metric
training and then what are you going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: are you going to do more than that number
of people so currently for both of my
[SPEAKER_00]: stores we have a full management team of
an inventory manager a sales manager a
[SPEAKER_00]: purchasing manager to where and to where
each one of those individuals we're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to push through metric where we're going
to make sure everybody is metric on our
[SPEAKER_00]: management team so that training metric
training so to make sure that every single
[SPEAKER_00]: one of them is able to give information to
the other one so like in college I know a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people hate working on group
projects but I always felt like the
[SPEAKER_00]: classes I did best on is where I had a
core group of people that I was with that
[SPEAKER_00]: we would divide up the work and then we
would cross train each other on it and I
[SPEAKER_00]: feel like that's what we're going to do
here is each one of them brings each one
[SPEAKER_00]: of my management team each one of my
members of my management team brings a
[SPEAKER_00]: special to the special specialty to the
group that they're going to look at this
[SPEAKER_00]: from a different angle and we're going to
be able to train each other I think that
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where we're actually having issues
right now as is just the interpretation of
[SPEAKER_00]: the new regulations they came out so just
Matt you know just written down to where
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's interpreting differently it's
in my comparison is it's like it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: the Bible where it's this person is
interpreting over here and so I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: some Roman Catholics over here I got some
Jehovah Witnesses running around over here
[SPEAKER_00]: you know everybody's interpreting these
these this regulations as as their Bible
[SPEAKER_00]: is oh this is the way it has to be or this
is the way it has to be and there hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been a lot of of oversight from the
government saying no no this is how it is
[SPEAKER_00]: because in a lot of ways the government is
learning there they're interpreting it
[SPEAKER_00]: their own way with their own preconceived
notions so what I'm going to do is I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing myself all of my management team
is going to be going through training we
[SPEAKER_00]: will have a compliance officer for each
door and that is how we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: moving forward with metric and every
single employee is going to be added to
[SPEAKER_00]: their training manuals where they are
going to understand which metric is and
[SPEAKER_00]: why the importance of doing their due
diligence when they're doing inventory and
[SPEAKER_00]: when they're selling product and when they
give the receipt to the patient verifying
[SPEAKER_01]: that every single product on there is what
you are giving to that person yes the the
[SPEAKER_00]: the foundation of our store and our
training for every employee here is
[SPEAKER_00]: compliant so every single employee with
the stores will be going through that
[SPEAKER_00]: every even with our security companies we
will apply that they will have a training
[SPEAKER_00]: manual training portion added to their
manual over what is track and trace so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they know what their responsibility
is when we have a vendor come into the
[SPEAKER_00]: store or when patients are leaving and how
they're leaving the store with their
[SPEAKER_00]: product every single person in our store
will be briefed on it and will be trained
[SPEAKER_00]: in the way that fits their position best
some individuals will have significantly
[SPEAKER_00]: more training and some individuals will
have it understanding of how the product
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves the store and how it's in the store
and how you do inventories but everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: will have metric added to their training
and that's something I actually don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: with stores very often is that they
actually have training manuals or training
[SPEAKER_00]: modules for their patients to work I mean
for their patient consultants to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's something that I'm big on SOPs
I brought that from the veterinary world
[SPEAKER_00]: is is standard operating procedure
development a lot of stores don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: this regarding this is how we do
everything every step by step by step from
[SPEAKER_00]: our management team to our employees all
of the employees how you clean the
[SPEAKER_00]: restroom how you do inventory how you sell
a product everything needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: streamlined so that when we bring on a new
employee it's not like the old days where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just like let's get them on the floor
and just see how they do and see how they
[SPEAKER_00]: can do it's like it's not that anymore you
know training takes a full 30 days for
[SPEAKER_00]: every employee before we let them go on on
solo I just really look forward to this
[SPEAKER_00]: next this next chapter in cannabis history
I feel like we are about to launch to a
[SPEAKER_00]: national platform metric is going to
assist on making a national platform so
[SPEAKER_00]: that when we're able to sell California
cannabis all over the country that we know
[SPEAKER_00]: where it came from this is what metric is
doing for us and though metric was built
[SPEAKER_00]: on us to track strawberries in Florida
many years ago it is now grown into this
[SPEAKER_00]: system that is going to allow us to have a
properly regulated national cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: market and soon after that international
cannabis market and like what we're seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: in Humboldt County where they have sick
but which is their version of metric it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a way for them to track everything that's
coming from Humboldt you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: champagne of champagne is basically what
Humboldt is and it's going to allow us to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that we know where every product
came from that if you're selling product
[SPEAKER_00]: on a shelf in a store in Texas that says
it's California cannabis you know for a
[SPEAKER_00]: fact it was growing in California and
California has always been the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: producer for the United States for
cannabis so I'm just really looking
[SPEAKER_00]: forward to us going national and
international and metric is a component to
[SPEAKER_00]: making all of that happen and if you don't
jump on it you're going to get left behind you
