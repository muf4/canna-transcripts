[SPEAKER_03]: So, just quickly, Lydia, do you have time
to give a quick intro to solar
[SPEAKER_03]: biosolarization?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, wait before you go, before you start
it, let me cut to the one graphic I could
[SPEAKER_03]: pull up so people know what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a reasonable graphic for what
we're talking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at those fun words, digestates and
mesocosms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, this is okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, this is bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: This last image is real helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, basically, the general process and
thought that we're talking about here is
[SPEAKER_02]: the use of different types of plastics to
cover up, to cover soil and heat it up to
[SPEAKER_02]: a certain temperature for a certain number
of days that basically thermally
[SPEAKER_02]: inactivates weed seeds and pests and
disease within a certain depth of the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, we were chatting about this
privately.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our other IPM friends in the
cannabis space had shared a slide from Jim
[SPEAKER_02]: Stapleton's work over at UC Kearney Ag
Research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, basically, this is a practice that
you see implemented in like strawberry
[SPEAKER_02]: fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, when you drive past a field and there
are furrows and then in between the
[SPEAKER_02]: furrows, there are these sheets of plastic
that are just covering like long,
[SPEAKER_02]: long rows in these big fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, the purpose and the point is
to, like I said, like knock down anything
[SPEAKER_02]: that would be causing a difficulty in
managing pests or disease once the actual
[SPEAKER_02]: crop comes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They utilize this type of thing when it
comes to managing spring mix, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: like the greens, you know, there's a zero
tolerance policy for having weeds in your
[SPEAKER_02]: spring mix crops, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't go through and hand weed,
you know, acres and acres as exactly right
[SPEAKER_02]: there that you just put up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't go hand weed acres of spring
mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just something that's, you know,
it's a limiting factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: The number of people that you're going to
have to do that, you know, their capacity
[SPEAKER_02]: to get it right every time, like it's
pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, what's been going on with the
biosolarization is essentially taking the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil solarization topic, you know,
the whole background of heating up the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil to inactivate these things that
you're not wanting in your system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the bio part is adding organic
material into that heating process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the organic material decomposes,
there are toxic breakdown products that
[SPEAKER_02]: eliminate soil pest organisms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we're talking about something
that's as little as an addition of 5% of
[SPEAKER_02]: something like they tested tomato pumice,
white wine grape pumice and red wine grape
[SPEAKER_02]: pumice, saying that the tomato byproducts
from the traditional, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: food ag was really helpful in eliminating
some of these plant pathogens that they
[SPEAKER_02]: were concerned about.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, as with everything,
it does have limitations on its
[SPEAKER_02]: effectiveness.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you wouldn't want to complete
this type of solarization and then move
[SPEAKER_02]: all of your soil or till it or,
you know, get it all mixed up because
[SPEAKER_02]: you're only inoculating or you're only
really inactivating those first top
[SPEAKER_02]: inches, you know, six inches ish of
topsoil up top.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the kind of the thought process
is that the beneficial organisms,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, earthworms and other,
you know, fungi, bacteria that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they're used to a larger range
and change in their environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're much more like plastic and capable
of managing environmental stress and
[SPEAKER_02]: change differently than perhaps disease
and pest organisms that are going to more
[SPEAKER_02]: similarly need an environment that matches
their host plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, there's lots of information
that UC Davis, UC Kearney has put up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other scholarly papers that have
been put out about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when I worked for BASF,
we would put all of our media into this
[SPEAKER_02]: like deep, deep freezer and freeze
everything for a period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'd have to take all of the big
bales of material and let them thaw before
[SPEAKER_02]: we use them in the greenhouse for
pesticide research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it kind of works on the polar
opposite end is that if you create this
[SPEAKER_02]: like massive environmental change or
temperature shock, that you can reduce,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, pathogens and pests and disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bet that Scott and Eric and Kevin
and Sarah have all seen this employed,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially down in Salinas Valley and
other places where there's a lot of crops
[SPEAKER_02]: and a lot of dirt instead of soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a cannabis company that does like
a whole steaming thing actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't know what they bring in to do
it, but they tarp everything over.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually inject steam in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is where I really started to defer to
what I learned from Dr. Lane and that like
[SPEAKER_04]: all the problems live in decreased oxygen
conditions and all the good things live in
[SPEAKER_04]: the increased oxygen conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's like a gray area in the
center.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, I think what's been missing
on the growing community at wide,
[SPEAKER_04]: whether it's Big Ag or the small cannabis
farmers that, you know, there's aerobic
[SPEAKER_04]: strategies for dealing with problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's something that Dr. Lane
has discovered and communicated that
[SPEAKER_04]: hasn't really settled in with the market
too much, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it still wouldn't, this sounds like
you're also dealing with weed seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a pretty good strategy for
dealing with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they're doing this in preparation then
on these rows for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the thought process is that plants or
the soil solarization can take four to six
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks, you know, at a certain temperature
during the hottest part of the year,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to have, you know, bright sun,
really high temperatures for it to be
[SPEAKER_02]: effective.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what they're implementing the
biosolarization is they're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: reduce that time and then also reduce the
temperature window requirement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're changing something that's
like four to six weeks of your soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're also going to reduce the
time of your field being down,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, not, not cultivating anything to
making it, you know, seven to 10 days and
[SPEAKER_02]: achieving a similar effect, uh,
without going anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like Scott mentioned, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to like drench your soil
and then put a bunch of plastic tarping on
[SPEAKER_02]: it and just hope for the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's not the goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was just interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter brought it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sounds like it by adding, It sounds
like what they're saying is by adding
[SPEAKER_04]: plant material, they shorten the duration
of what's needed to be effective because
[SPEAKER_04]: they're composting in place essentially.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by adding the grapes or the,
you know, any of the agricultural crop
[SPEAKER_04]: residues, you're adding organic matter
that probably, probably gets hotter
[SPEAKER_04]: quicker or something because it's
composting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a little unclear how that process is
totally, you know, layering out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you chop the season up, there's no
benefit in that either.
[SPEAKER_05]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you must have to do it in a crop
rotational form where you're doing grid A
[SPEAKER_00]: and then grid B is the one where you'll do
solarization and then application of
[SPEAKER_00]: material to develop a better tilth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, you'll mix it and then
next year you would reverse it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're taking like, you know,
a hundred thousand square foot and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: only growing on 50,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you do 50,000 this year,
50,000 next year, but this way that
[SPEAKER_00]: solarization would work in the hot part of
the summer because how can you cut a chunk
[SPEAKER_00]: of the growing season out and get paid?
It's a tough one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the hard part is that some of this
stuff is just tough for us with,
[SPEAKER_00]: because the benefit outdoor is doing it
outdoor and catching the season.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have anything but that window.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say maybe this is a
strategy for like, you're seeing a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp people move into old agricultural
grounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe this is like a before we start
strategy or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the three year fallow pride organic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you're right.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as it doesn't create any like
disease, as long as it's, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the goal and the actual effect of it is to
bring it down to something like neutral
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're not actually causing disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see a problem with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like it could fit somewhere,
you know, as long as I'm always mindful
[SPEAKER_01]: that whatever we do produce as a solution
has a, it doesn't linger around for eons
[SPEAKER_01]: of generations and plastics and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we go forward, if we can come up with
solutions that don't that biodegrade or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever as they come into the
environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but it sounds like to me that if you
did bring it down to neutral in a strategy
[SPEAKER_01]: like this, you could easily then revive it
with a good inoculum like the compost and
[SPEAKER_01]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is where like, you know,
we spoke about some of the obstacles that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, maybe a late Dr. Lane has,
but like, this is where I put her as the
[SPEAKER_04]: undisputed world champion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we have yet to run into a facility
that had a soil pathogen problem that we
[SPEAKER_04]: couldn't get under control in a reasonable
amount of time with the same strategies
[SPEAKER_04]: that we use to increase yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that that's where what Dr. Lane has
not missed once, you know, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: despite her views.
[SPEAKER_04]: On mineral balancing or what she thinks is
the correct goal.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when we take strategies and
cultivation that lead to an aerobic root
[SPEAKER_04]: zone, we don't have those problems at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I could see it being
utilized as a first time strategy to
[SPEAKER_01]: implement in a field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as you go forward, so the way
that in soil ecology, as we deal with
[SPEAKER_01]: weeds, as we move along the ecological
succession underground in the microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's how we start just selecting
for which plants then thrive in the
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's a much longer term strategy,
depending on, you know, what your base
[SPEAKER_01]: soil is starting out with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could see this being something
definitely utilized as a start of a
[SPEAKER_01]: system.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your system is a young system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say you're doing greens all the
time and it doesn't take much to inoculate
[SPEAKER_01]: it every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could do this every time because
you're not growing trees that need a very
[SPEAKER_01]: long, you know, growth ecological growth
time to get that fungal component up.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a much lower threshold of
biological numbers that they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for something like greens, I could see
that being a good strategy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're introducing this as an alternative
to conventional fumigation, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: fumigating your soil, which we all agree
is not an option for candidates.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not a good idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: Methyl bromide.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how they do organic walnuts,
because it takes four years before there's
[SPEAKER_05]: nuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they dig out the old tree, methyl
bromide the whole plant a new one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then in four years when it produces,
it can be deemed organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a loophole though, you know?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the most profound moments in my
entire, you know, growing career was I was
[SPEAKER_04]: at a greenhouse in Salinas and,
you know, the owner of the property also
[SPEAKER_04]: is growing strawberries and they brought
in like a flat of clamshells of
[SPEAKER_04]: strawberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all the white weed people were just
devouring down, but like not one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: non-English speaking agricultural workers
would go anywhere near those strawberries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I even kind of was like, you want
some?
[SPEAKER_04]: And their face was like, that was a really
profound moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they've been in the trenches.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know what goes down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And which I think is the beauty of
regulated cannabis right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we're getting a real strong snapshot
with major financial losses tied to the
[SPEAKER_04]: things that we regularly do in agriculture
that affect cat three testing,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I think is really the kind of poetic
aspect of cannabis is so good at
[SPEAKER_04]: bio-remediating that it's like cleaning up
the agriculture that's next door because
[SPEAKER_04]: of the contamination that's leading to a
cat three failure and a loss of
[SPEAKER_04]: investment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now there's a motivation to look at how
toxic our farming is and how far that
[SPEAKER_04]: spreads away from the actual agricultural
field.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's remediating the cultivators too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
