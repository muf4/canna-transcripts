[SPEAKER_00]: This show used to be so small that we
didn't need a large room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside of, you know, obviously,
so what are we, 10 times where we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of the size of this, like three
years ago?
[SPEAKER_01]: More than 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they started with like 700,
then it was 2,000, then it was 7,000,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we went to 20 last year,
which was unheard of, and now it's 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: 40,000 people coming to see cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an emerging markets guy, and I've been
investing around the world my career,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've also been investing in new asset
classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, this kind of stuff gets scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I see this relative to, you know,
I was here two years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't here last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two years ago was my first.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been investing in the sector for
about three years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this gets me a little concerned when
we also know what's going on in public
[SPEAKER_01]: markets and how some companies that
launched two weeks ago at a $3 billion
[SPEAKER_01]: market cap were cut in half.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won't name names.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nick, the floor is yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as I don't have any.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not my name.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, I got into cannabis 2006
after the military, and when I saw,
[SPEAKER_02]: like from Colorado standpoint,
medical markets evolving, then pre-adult
[SPEAKER_02]: use transferring to other states,
other countries.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's growing, but when I think even this
conference in doubling in size,
[SPEAKER_02]: of the companies that were here last year,
two-thirds of them aren't here,
[SPEAKER_02]: and now there's like all these new
companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's happening where there's all
these new states, new markets,
[SPEAKER_02]: new opportunities, ancillary hands-on,
hands-off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard for cannabis companies
without liquidity or without institutional
[SPEAKER_02]: cap to really get the capital they need.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then how do investors choose
individual portfolio opportunities,
[SPEAKER_02]: do the due diligence on them, the team,
the license, their revenue, even
[SPEAKER_02]: understand is this a profitable business
model?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because normal investing is one thing,
cannabis is another.
[SPEAKER_02]: So being able to bridge cannabis
knowledge, capital knowledge, those are
[SPEAKER_02]: the teams who like either private funds or
some of the public offerings have a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for most of these organizations of the
30,000 here, 20,000 won't be here next
[SPEAKER_02]: year, but then there'll be another 40,000
new ones ramping up at the gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk to the man who's running a
big business right now and how you see the
[SPEAKER_01]: world, because bottom line, you're in a
position to be consolidating a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: different markets that you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're growing your markets right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe you've been referred to as the
beast of the East, or you would certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: like to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk to me about that, Bob.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Nick said it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry is, first of all,
it's been legalized state to state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the normal things of businesses
doesn't exist in the cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have banking, we can't cross
state lines, we have unusual taxes with
[SPEAKER_00]: 280E, we've got a federal government that
is lurking in the shadows, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get state governments to try to
figure out how the industry works.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think some of the states have done a
good job, and it's been the private
[SPEAKER_00]: sector.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been the entrepreneur that took the
risk with private money, rich guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: took a risk, and helped build these,
incubate these companies state to state,
[SPEAKER_00]: different licenses, not for profit,
for profit, the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think now that the Canadian public
market got involved, and all this
[SPEAKER_00]: capital's being invested up in banks,
they see a way of aggregating multistate
[SPEAKER_00]: operators like ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, my company, Maramed, MRMD on the
OTCQB, 16 consecutive growth quarters.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I think that what my company
was based on was operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we believed in strong management,
best practices, best of class in
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation, production, distillation,
and merchandising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we always thought that earnings and
revenue and assets would make everything
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a little scared of the capital
markets and the multiples of projected
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we worry about the entrepreneur state
to state that might be getting killed by
[SPEAKER_00]: these category killers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's interesting, and I'll then
toss this to Nick, because it sounds to me
[SPEAKER_01]: like, though, that the capital markets
have been your friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's face it, you've built an incredibly
strong company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the position with your stock,
also potentially to be a vehicle for
[SPEAKER_01]: making acquisitions or cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have sophisticated investors that have
been drawn to your company, and actually
[SPEAKER_01]: are investors because they kicked the
tires, they looked under the hood,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they really see a good operator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then the question is, Nick,
he's building a company that's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: public markets, and he continues to grow
at an aggressive pace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet, a lot of these companies that we
see trading in Toronto or OTC here
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't ever have gone public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so why are people rewarding some of
these other companies when, in fact,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've all seen this before at other times
in asset cycles?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dare I call them bubbles?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say the current bubble is actually
three times worse than even the dot com
[SPEAKER_02]: bubble, and it's going to really be felt
in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, from what we saw in Colorado to
multiple states, we've worked in 30
[SPEAKER_02]: states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our consulting company, having done
licenses in most of those, understanding
[SPEAKER_02]: the underhood operational companies were
actually, this is agriculture,
[SPEAKER_02]: this is manufacturing, this is retail,
brand licensing, triple net leasing,
[SPEAKER_02]: property management companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not master growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's when you have major failures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seeing how that worked on a multiple state
level to then all the licenses
[SPEAKER_02]: internationally, we started to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We saw that international opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, we've worked in Canada like
five, six years, done licenses,
[SPEAKER_02]: have LPs, genetics companies, used them
even to help win our German licenses,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the beginning, but now with all of our
partners internationally and 12 licenses
[SPEAKER_02]: that are all privately held with exclusive
rights to capital for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're fighting against Tilray with
one license and I have the other and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're worth 13 billion market cap and I
have exclusive capital rights,
[SPEAKER_02]: operational control, that's where there's
major opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the international side, you think
Colorado four years ago, zero dollars in
[SPEAKER_02]: revenue of adult use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now it's like six, seven billion plus the
velocity of capital, which is almost seven
[SPEAKER_02]: X of a normal industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have almost a $50 billion economy
created in Colorado of jobs, workforce,
[SPEAKER_02]: taxes, that people say there wasn't even a
billion in sales internationally last
[SPEAKER_02]: year, so it's too early.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Canada, by being nationally legal on a
medical basis initially, allowed those
[SPEAKER_02]: public markets to happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem is they also didn't realize by
legalizing adult use, they're violating
[SPEAKER_02]: international law.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll break federal law if I'm following
state law, but I don't like to ever break
[SPEAKER_02]: international law.
[SPEAKER_02]: You gotta know the rules to play the game
and many people don't focus on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a lawyer or accountant,
we hire lots of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've worked with hundreds of them and
hundreds and hundreds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I invest in a lot of these
companies and I'm also a guy that,
[SPEAKER_01]: by the way, look I lived in Russia for a
few years, so if there's a guy that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be scared traveling across
borders, it's going to be me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well those were the things like homeland
security, all those initial fears.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean we probably lost 50 million of
investor confidence based on some of
[SPEAKER_02]: those.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they've kind of lifted those
provisions, but in the industry this is an
[SPEAKER_02]: emerging opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabis industry was the gutter for
so many years, illicit, so then it didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: really bring the best people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the first people willing to take
these high-risk markets, that's like maybe
[SPEAKER_02]: not the most seasoned, normal,
triple-A type investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that we're seeing institutional
capital being interested, we do have
[SPEAKER_02]: banks, we do have finance, but
internationally I'm legal medical,
[SPEAKER_02]: legal for the ancillary side.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1962 single convention on psychotropic
substances, World Health Organization
[SPEAKER_02]: doctrines, we look at these and tax
treaties, where we can do this,
[SPEAKER_02]: what countries based on standards can
actually do what they say, not just to
[SPEAKER_02]: Cyprus, not just to Malta.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do things just for a press release
to be worth 50 million dollars more in a
[SPEAKER_02]: market cap the next day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm confused, it sounds to me like you're
telling me that Canada is not only
[SPEAKER_01]: violating standards that are established
in the 1962 treaty, but that there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: complete disregard for something that,
first of all, are other countries doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this differently?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it seems to me, if you listen to
the Canadians, the Germans are welcoming
[SPEAKER_01]: them with open arms to help them build out
their fledgling cannabis business,
[SPEAKER_01]: etc.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you think about international,
Germany was a major, there were 10 initial
[SPEAKER_02]: licenses issued from the bee farm,
and it was literally the smallest grow I'd
[SPEAKER_02]: had to model in almost 10 years,
like 200 kilos of annual production.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that market of 83 million people that
also taught us about the bee farm,
[SPEAKER_02]: how the government's paying for cannabis,
and healthcare, a standard like socialized
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as long as I meet the high quality
standard at the lowest cost of production,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the generic in every pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unless a doctor writes bedrican red in
an API for recommending pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs, which it's considered there,
I'm the generic, I'm the lowest price,
[SPEAKER_02]: highest quality, I take the whole market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Canada thought they were gonna take
over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from northern Wisconsin, but Canada's
not where you do giant greenhouses to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: pineapples for the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So low class places like Columbia for oil
production, one standardized, or these
[SPEAKER_02]: other markets, will be so much more
advantageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it sounds like though,
there's an argument, an easy argument,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, I agree with you that I don't
know why the Canadians are necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: taking over the world, other than their
capital markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, I love my Canadian
friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the international dynamics you're
talking about, I think are interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, Bob, how do you weigh in here?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously, you've been extremely
cautious about building your business
[SPEAKER_01]: state by state, not breaking federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Compliance, to me, is taken as a given.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any company that's survived this long
started with compliance as the first thing
[SPEAKER_01]: that they had.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, does this concern you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the Canadians opened the door,
the Trudeau effect, national federal
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom, but I think there's only 34
million people in Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the cannabis business in
California will probably make that small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that everybody is watching the
years in the US, and as the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer market in the world, will
ultimately take our place in the leader in
[SPEAKER_00]: innovation and science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that what's happening in
Germany is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain, Portugal, I mean, it's happening
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is it being driven by money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we looking for jurisdictions where we
can go down and get cheap labor?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is capital the reason that cannabis is
making this emerging industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it drives it like everything
else, but I think there's a bigger thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that we try to do in Marimed is to care
about people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, care about building products and
interfacing with physician outreach where
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually help people, whether it's MS
or anxiety or nausea or PTSD and some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the things with epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Rhode Island, we run a clinic with 48
families with mothers with epileptic
[SPEAKER_00]: children that come to help see their kids
stop talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're shaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I saw you last week in
Maryland where we ran the Maryland Medical
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis Forum where we had five of the
foremost doctors in the world talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about using cannabis to take people off of
opiates and to create interface with the
[SPEAKER_00]: physicians in the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems to be happening all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have 40,000 people here want to be to
learn, but I think money drives something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulation drives something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's all good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, hopefully, we'll have an
emerging industry that has validated
[SPEAKER_00]: medical principles that is helping people
and where people aren't hiding and afraid
[SPEAKER_00]: of the federal US law.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a big difference between medical
in the United States and medical
[SPEAKER_02]: internationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like our clinical trials research is so
lacking in the United States that when
[SPEAKER_02]: we're looking for those drug placements or
drug discovery in these other markets,
[SPEAKER_02]: international markets, that's where if
five companies are doing MS research and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're projected to take 10% of the MS
market by 2027, 30 billion, a few in
[SPEAKER_02]: Israel, a few in some other locations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you're getting early mover
positions on that, let's say with a hedge,
[SPEAKER_02]: getting into all five when they're going
towards approvals, doubling down on the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones moving more towards approvals,
having the shares to lend to short the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones that won't get approvals,
it's that anti-fragile mentality.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in cannabis, like pharmaceutical
international is one thing, but everything
[SPEAKER_02]: in the United States medical adult use
will kind of merge into one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this medical is that quasi-legality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the federal protection, but anyone
can, I'm a disabled vet, that's how I got
[SPEAKER_02]: into this, but anyone can take somebody
with epilepsy, prop up these things to get
[SPEAKER_02]: markets legalized.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or how medical transitions to adult use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very different from attack spaces,
but even medical is less safe in Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: than adult use based on testing standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we're looking at these
international markets, Canada violating
[SPEAKER_02]: international law of that convention for
legalizing something for an adult use
[SPEAKER_02]: purpose that's on these controlled
substance lists, that could hurt so many
[SPEAKER_02]: other sectors of markets of Canadian
pharmaceutical companies, non-cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: related, from being able to export to
other markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we see this velocity effect of how
those things happen, the wise Canadian
[SPEAKER_02]: companies are taking that liquidity,
investing internationally into these other
[SPEAKER_02]: markets, sometimes for press release
value, other times for revenue share of
[SPEAKER_02]: these new markets, but they're doing it in
a way that they know capital, they know
[SPEAKER_02]: how to manipulate these public markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Tilray, a few of those have done
a very good job with press releases even
[SPEAKER_02]: though you look at their revenues to
earnings.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're actually buying a lot of these
toxic assets that when you buy the good,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're buying the bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where if you buy this US extraction
company that has fake science and has
[SPEAKER_02]: lawsuits pending for all these other
issues, you're buying all of that with
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then I won't push those lawsuits until
right before a sale, right before a
[SPEAKER_02]: listing, right before an offering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And right now, that's why investors
choosing individual deals or individual
[SPEAKER_02]: stocks, it's way too hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not gonna choose the unicorn,
but private funds that have exclusive deal
[SPEAKER_02]: flow, track record in cannabis and
capital, that's where investors should be
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for the longer term impacts like
100X VC funds, PE models, like our PE
[SPEAKER_02]: models will come in and cannibalize
Canadian assets of like their intellectual
[SPEAKER_02]: property and staff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting really confused.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like our conversation is
having, we're having four different
[SPEAKER_01]: conversations at once, which are all
incredibly important conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in summary, what I think we're talking
about, first of all, we're, Nick's brought
[SPEAKER_01]: up the fact that not only is Canada
operating internationally potentially in
[SPEAKER_01]: an illegal fashion, you believe they are,
but that also, this is then perpetuating
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these Canadian companies to around
the world go out and consolidate,
[SPEAKER_01]: by the way, good for them from a capital
markets perspective, taking their stock,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is arguably an overpriced stock and
going out and buying companies in the US
[SPEAKER_01]: or higher growth markets, which will be
accretive to their shareholders because
[SPEAKER_01]: they arguably don't have a very large
markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've talked about the size of the
Canadian market the limitations of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that possibly that the Canadians
aren't the right people to be following
[SPEAKER_01]: around the globe.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're an investor, unless of course
you think that a company in Canada is
[SPEAKER_01]: buying a very good asset in the US with an
overpriced currency.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing we're talking about
though, is the social good of what's going
[SPEAKER_01]: on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, we're all here for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people are here for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as someone that again, the allegory to
this in, I could be in Rio or Sao Paulo in
[SPEAKER_01]: 2002, investing in Brazilian resource
companies at a time when there'd be a room
[SPEAKER_01]: this full of people also of US investors
that said, oh my God, we've got to own
[SPEAKER_01]: commodities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God, the bricks and all these
emerging market companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, and these Brazilian companies are
really trustworthy guys and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: give all our money to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen this before and it doesn't
always go well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the conversation that
everybody can agree upon is that there is
[SPEAKER_01]: not only a social good of what's going on
here, but that there's a massive benefit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Nick, you even talked about
how, sounds to me like you think if the
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadians just stuck to medical and didn't
go adult, we would have stayed away from
[SPEAKER_01]: some of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They would have had less exposure,
but then you always have to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: Netscape to have a Google kind of emerge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love to learn from others failures.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's plenty of successes in Canada and
like I said, as a disabled veteran,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's how I got into this and pushed
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I also know that many of the companies
that are using that social good component
[SPEAKER_02]: are either not doing it as profitably or
correctly as they should be because they
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't had the same standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: So international, GAP, GMP, GACP,
GDP, all of the different standards that
[SPEAKER_02]: in the US it's state by state.
[SPEAKER_02]: But all you had to do in the US was just
follow the federal guidelines and
[SPEAKER_02]: standards and then you would have always
been compliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But this is the first time I feel like in
the history of business and capitalism
[SPEAKER_02]: that actually doing the right thing is the
most profitable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I love putting indoor out of business
giant greenhouses, like 22 pounds of coal
[SPEAKER_02]: to make one gram of indoor cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you love the earth and it's saving
like people in cancer, but you destroy
[SPEAKER_02]: like killing your grandchildren to feed
your children mentality.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like large things that are making
super cashflow companies that are better
[SPEAKER_02]: than a B Corp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all about our investors, but through
revolutionary profitable businesses,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the right market, the right time and
the right capital for it, that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: challenge where institutional capital is
not there, but even private will still do
[SPEAKER_02]: 18.8% interest on real estate,
backed by real estate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But even that, 100 million of that to make
18 million over five years is a waste of
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would have taken that hundred
and made a billion in five.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like knowing when, where and how
and how investors need to look at this in
[SPEAKER_02]: classes, ancillary medical adult use.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have different risk profiles for each
dichotomy of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of them just see the cannabis
industry instead of property management
[SPEAKER_02]: company brand licensing companies,
all of the different verticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the most profitable part of your
business?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the part you're most excited about?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you're, you're straddling the
integration between, first of all,
[SPEAKER_01]: adult and medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you're, you're involved in
infrastructure, build out your,
[SPEAKER_01]: your company also helps other companies,
uh, get to the places they want to go
[SPEAKER_01]: because of your presence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you most excited about?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people think that if the U S if
the States are just a state to medical,
[SPEAKER_00]: we might've gotten a federal law pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I'm most excited about, uh,
branding and distribution, creating new
[SPEAKER_00]: lines of products, uh, that cross state
lines and puts America back at the
[SPEAKER_00]: forefront of what it does best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we just made a, we just made
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think, uh, I think the new farm
bill, uh, unleashing CBD from hemp is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to create a whole new industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we'll get, uh, that will parallel
track cannabis delay integrate in five,
[SPEAKER_00]: six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we're excited about that opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're excited about more and more people
getting the benefit of feeling more
[SPEAKER_00]: familiar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've made major head roads and
getting physicians to come out from under
[SPEAKER_00]: the hospitals and take a more vocal stance
about how this thing can really help
[SPEAKER_00]: people at a fraction of the cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love when we help kids and I love when
we help senior citizens, uh, that are
[SPEAKER_00]: taking, uh, narcotics, uh, because they're
difficult when they could have a bite of a
[SPEAKER_00]: cookie, uh, watch a movie and go to sleep
and not bother anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the industry is doing instead
of Netflix and chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's chill.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't tell you what my mother used to
do, but it's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so by the way, Nick, I can't seem to
get rid of this guy because we were
[SPEAKER_01]: together on a panel a week ago and I do
want to bring up and I'm curious your view
[SPEAKER_01]: on this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was a medical, it was a medical
cannabis panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it was in conjunction with the medical
cannabis commission of Maryland.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we had regulators there and we had
three of the foremost doctors,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, one of slash PhD who are spending and
devoting their life to science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and what was so impressive about this
event was the, not only, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the, the, the, the social kind of
reverberation you're, you're feeling from
[SPEAKER_01]: the doctors who see the impact they're
having in the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also the other powerful thing was the
frustration that exists right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, when there's so much good that can be
done with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yet it's, we're still so far away
from, um, properly educating the medical
[SPEAKER_01]: community, educating the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, let's face it, you know,
the dispensaries, I hope no one here,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, um, hope you guys don't own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, Bob, you own
dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how are you guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Nick's, Nick's turn to talk,
but I want you to, I want you to help us
[SPEAKER_01]: understand how the dispensaries are going
to try to better educate, um, and,
[SPEAKER_01]: or to do what we hear from the doctors is,
is overcoming an issue where patients are
[SPEAKER_01]: going into facilities and not coming away
with either the, the, the prescribed
[SPEAKER_01]: product and, and, and, and, you know,
medical cannabis that they came in there
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: You use the word prescribed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means you're talking about
international markets because in the
[SPEAKER_02]: United States it's doctor recommendations
because they're not able to actually
[SPEAKER_02]: prescribe medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical is a term that we use in the
United States for one classification.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see it from the tax rate and the access.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what are the qualifying conditions of
that market?
[SPEAKER_02]: Normally back in the day, if it didn't
have pain or PTSD, we wouldn't invest or
[SPEAKER_02]: go into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a short squeeze market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doctor education is important,
but like in Germany, doctors, when they go
[SPEAKER_02]: to make a prescription for cannabis,
they're going onto a database of an API
[SPEAKER_02]: network that has all of the prescription
drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's there in the United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have those, but cannabis is not listed,
even though it's been a part of our
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmacopoeia.
[SPEAKER_02]: For 150 plus years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So medical cannabis in the United States
is very different than medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: internationally or pharmaceutical FDA
clinical trial, like efficacy,
[SPEAKER_02]: BMI.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can never get those confused.
[SPEAKER_02]: Doctor education is lacking, but I think a
lot of them just realize if the market
[SPEAKER_02]: allows it where it's, this could help
potentially help my client with X,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, ailments, those like California
law, Guam, some of those others,
[SPEAKER_02]: the really restrictive states and markets
without doctor education, we have no
[SPEAKER_02]: patients, patients or clients,
clients, revenue, revenue business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not about bud tenders, but some
states like Pennsylvania, you had to have
[SPEAKER_02]: medical doctors, pharmacists, like having
dealt with like controlled substances in
[SPEAKER_02]: the past.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each state's different, but most
dispensaries, you're not telling the false
[SPEAKER_02]: claims.
[SPEAKER_02]: This cures, this has been shown to like
following normal FDA guidance and having
[SPEAKER_02]: bud tender retail sales associate patient
advocate education.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like the good groups, like the great
nonprofits, like Americans for safe access
[SPEAKER_02]: patient focused certification,
like when they're actually educating how
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk about medical cannabis,
not falsely make medical claims,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though we know like how efficacious
this is, even you think the CBD side here,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, 95% of those products in the US
don't even have CBD and it's like heroin
[SPEAKER_02]: based on legality right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, you know, we've dealt with hemp,
we've dealt with cannabis and all the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, but it's just that
misinformation, which has really hurt our
[SPEAKER_02]: markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hurting investor confidence.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's why the right investors like trusting
those right sources just because a public
[SPEAKER_02]: company is public doesn't mean they're
actually disclosing everything about the
[SPEAKER_02]: market because many of them don't even
know where you're seeing how they're
[SPEAKER_02]: operating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just press release, press
release, market cap, market cap versus
[SPEAKER_02]: revenue versus long-term ownership and
control.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's quick returns to be made here,
but the real investments into the
[SPEAKER_02]: long-term multi-trillion dollar industry
right here coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we only have a few more years to get
all those early positions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise you're just going to like be
trading Apple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, Hey, Apple's got some room to
grow or like you want to share the Hong
[SPEAKER_02]: Kong dollar with me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is now urgent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the big players are seeing it to
get up those M and A's like when federal
[SPEAKER_02]: legalization happens here, big M and A's
internationally, and then like reverse
[SPEAKER_02]: IPOs and those true bona fide IPOs go
public.
[SPEAKER_02]: When ready 95 plus percent of those
companies have not, and it'll hurt
[SPEAKER_02]: investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some will make a little bit now,
but not like the cargills that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: creating privately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it just seems to me, look,
there was obviously a run to market and
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a, again, we've talked at some
length of why the capital markets,
[SPEAKER_01]: we know why they're necessary,
but, but we, we also know why Canada fed a
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of an asset bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it seems to me that this is a market
that's incredibly more discriminating than
[SPEAKER_01]: it was a year ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not only because people have gotten
smarter and realize there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that, that, you know,
even, you know, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, I use my emerging markets metaphor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to talk about the potential and
the consumption growth patterns that are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to change and the demographics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is at some point a company
needs to be worth something that's
[SPEAKER_01]: relative to something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it needs to be fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know why people just gotten smarter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, there's just more things to invest
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before you just had this, this,
you know, effectively a proxy play where
[SPEAKER_01]: someone would own, you know, one or two of
the big Canadian LPs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know who they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make them bad guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't mean that they were
terribly cheap or a good investment beyond
[SPEAKER_01]: the first, you know, 50% move higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other dynamic that I think is as a
capital markets guy, that's maybe the most
[SPEAKER_01]: important one right now on a, on a,
in terms of the investor part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation we're having, one of the six
conversations we're having in one tonight
[SPEAKER_01]: is that you, you, you ultimately have a,
I think a dynamic where a lot of these
[SPEAKER_01]: companies will need more capital in the
future are going to have to go to markets
[SPEAKER_01]: and actually prove proof of concept.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, Bob's been doing this
from day one and obviously the capital
[SPEAKER_01]: markets have continued to reward him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That may be about to happen in a
marketplace where capital is not free.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am talking about Mr. Market now and
what we've gone through in the last two
[SPEAKER_01]: months of volatility for global markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, the, the real genesis of the cannabis
capital markets happened in a world where,
[SPEAKER_01]: where capital was free and, and volatility
was zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and that's also an under talked about
dynamic for investing today because I
[SPEAKER_01]: won't get into a wonky conversation on
global central banks and investment
[SPEAKER_01]: dynamics and that kind of one-on-one
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a cannabis show, but it's critical
to the path for investments and the growth
[SPEAKER_01]: of capital markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Bob, you get, do you get worried
about the changing capital markets
[SPEAKER_01]: environment from a market perspective that
we could have in the first quarter of
[SPEAKER_01]: 2019?
[SPEAKER_01]: In other words, it could get really nasty
out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fed could overstep their bounds as
they do every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Volatility, if you follow the VIX,
is at 25 right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It averaged 11 for the preceding 12 months
or 11 and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So does that even enter your, your sphere
of reference as you think about your
[SPEAKER_01]: capital market strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're always cognizant of all those
sophisticated things and what happens in
[SPEAKER_00]: other industry or historically in the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think cannabis has broken a lot of the
rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think two things are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, everybody in the States know
prohibition is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it comes, the big companies,
the pharmaceutical, the alcohol are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to come in and whoever had the courage to
make the investments, whether on the
[SPEAKER_00]: private side or even on the public side
are going to make out rewarded big time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the, it still starts day to
day of earnings and revenue and helping
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I think it will sort its way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The multiples in Canada, they'll be
winning winners and losers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, whoever doesn't make their numbers
next year based on what they value today
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to have to answer to their
stockholders in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maramed, we have consistent growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try not to get ahead of ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people think we're valued too high
compared to other realities and other
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other companies that look just
like us that are five times more valuable
[SPEAKER_00]: than us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are they too high or me too low?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think only time will tell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the next 2019 is going to be a
major year for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of like you said about volatility,
volatility, where there's volatility,
[SPEAKER_02]: now there's opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other thing about cannabis is we
are recession proof.
[SPEAKER_02]: We literally grow money on trees and our
like alcohol, tobacco recessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're in a category there where
it's not just the adult use like side,
[SPEAKER_02]: but from a medical standpoint,
a hemp standpoint, everything that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing, the verticals are so much larger
than other markets that if you're in those
[SPEAKER_02]: public markets, you're exposed to that
volatility even of other unrelated
[SPEAKER_02]: markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Private companies that are cash flowing
themselves based on this much more
[SPEAKER_02]: insulated from some of those changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I can't just do a press release and
have $100 million the next day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that takes maybe a quarter to raise
at a time like on private capital now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But where there's these major volatile
markets and people are going in and buying
[SPEAKER_02]: these toxic assets or creating like new
positive asset classes, it's that moment
[SPEAKER_02]: that where you know where to put the
capital, when to hold, when to sell,
[SPEAKER_02]: or now even with our hedge fund strategy,
how to actually do market regulation and
[SPEAKER_02]: profit from it, from the market
volatility, from the wrong players who got
[SPEAKER_02]: into the wrong boat for how they were
going to raise their capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: But going public for like initial
liquidity for investors, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that play.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now all of the companies listing
reverse merger splits all from the US
[SPEAKER_02]: there, see easy access to capital,
but they're exposed and they're all part
[SPEAKER_02]: of that same part.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when that sector goes down,
you saw a couple weeks ago, like that 20%,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was not a fund for a few days for a
lot of those public companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't feel any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually had days there that new
purchase agreements happening based on
[SPEAKER_02]: lower prices.
[SPEAKER_02]: So vertical integration, owning the means
of production, like seeing that hands on
[SPEAKER_02]: side, the biotech, the drug discovery,
what these things will be worth.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are times that you could never get
these positions again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though it's volatile,
opportunities are vast.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you know where to put those,
or if you've worked in this for a decade,
[SPEAKER_02]: go and make those individual investments,
either stocks or private.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if not, not just pushing ETFs here or
certain REITs or ancillary or hands on,
[SPEAKER_02]: but some of the private funds now are
great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then even some of them look at
acreage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then by going public and then some of
these lawsuits that are happening,
[SPEAKER_02]: things were done early.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just because you have a great advisor
and great pedigree does not mean you know
[SPEAKER_02]: capital and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: One point that I would fail to make is the
black market of cannabis is around us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The $80 to $100 billion that already
exists in the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the shadows, all the legal market
is doing is bringing that out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: shadows and into reality and into taxes
and into health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's a good summary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the industry is in a good
foothold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as all markets do,
they all shake out to some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the point that I would be hoping to
make is not to dispute that this is going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a countercyclical high growth
industry for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The nature of the product, the nature of
the usage is not necessarily attached to a
[SPEAKER_01]: boom bust economy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But and I would, it's impossible dispute
to me as someone that invests in public
[SPEAKER_01]: and private companies, that private
companies are less volatile on a day to
[SPEAKER_01]: day basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no mark to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, a lot of companies suddenly
become worthless overnight in a market
[SPEAKER_01]: where capital markets fall apart and
businesses that are starved for capital.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would just simply say, that we all
believe in what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all believe that this is a market
that's going to continue to attract bright
[SPEAKER_01]: minds and deep pocketed investors,
whether they be institutions, whether they
[SPEAKER_01]: be strategic partners, whether they be
family offices, the rich guys that Bob's
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about, that actually were brave
guys coming out here, laying, reaching
[SPEAKER_01]: into their wallet and investing in
something that most people said they were
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've seen it time and time again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I kind of feel like I know when my dad
used to talk to me about my grandfather
[SPEAKER_01]: who lived through the depression and how
he was changed by that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, look, I managed money through the
crisis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I lost half my financial wealth in the
crisis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone who went through that says markets
can do almost anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, for a fledgling industry
that is capital starved, as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: there's money floating around here,
everybody here needs money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you cut off the spigot to that
in a shock fashion, all I'm saying is,
[SPEAKER_01]: first of all, good, healthy companies will
go out of business because they weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: planned for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And investors will be on the wrong side of
investments with great companies and great
[SPEAKER_01]: management teams and wonder what happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to scare everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're all cognizant of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's important to understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spoke out at a conference on the West
Coast a few months ago when everything was
[SPEAKER_01]: at its peak, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I gave my Japan in the 1980s speech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the way, I'm not Nouriel Roubini,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he's doom and gloom and this and
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want to make this really clear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, Nouriel.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, really.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do think that Japan is still getting
through the excesses of cash rich without
[SPEAKER_01]: a plan is not a way to invest where
they're building golf courses to nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is one of the first things I was
thinking about when I was given a keynote
[SPEAKER_01]: pitch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sorry for being Timmy Downer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, Bob, just sum up for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what your expectations were
for MJ Biz 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, it's been insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018 has been great.
[SPEAKER_00]: More people, more deals, more more
education, more new systems, more
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, more doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think the the atmosphere and the
health of our industry is growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thankful for events like this,
not just for like the business generation,
[SPEAKER_02]: but like you're seeing this movement and
really taking traction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every one of these people that comes to it
is really an advocate for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then like through education,
driving business, it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we need more foot soldiers out there
that are educated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we've lacked in the United
States forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a business standpoint, I mean,
the new clients are great.
[SPEAKER_02]: The new referral partners, the new
vendors, the new access to different
[SPEAKER_02]: technologies is always spectacular.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like walking around thinking which
companies I want to buy, which ones I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to short.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from our standpoint, I think we had
seven new countries, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: with engagements here from a consulting
standpoint, you know, probably 50 plus
[SPEAKER_02]: million of private capital commitments
based on meetings that have happened here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing what these things do for the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the long term, we're creating something
to pass on to future generations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to remember that, like you
said, with the responsibility of our
[SPEAKER_02]: companies, to our shareholders,
but also knowing there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity here, a lot of ways to make
money, a lot of ways to lose money.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't know how diversifying that
risk, putting things together,
[SPEAKER_02]: like which seed to sales work,
which ones don't, choose one company,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's probably not going to be a unicorn.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like diversifying across the sectors,
a lot more insulation when it's backed
[SPEAKER_02]: with real estate assets, intellectual
property, a little bit more insulated than
[SPEAKER_02]: the public market volatility.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to be in both.
[SPEAKER_02]: But public, when ready and established,
I think long term, they'll write about how
[SPEAKER_02]: this happened compared to dot com bubble,
and then Luxembourg exchange, Tel Aviv
[SPEAKER_02]: exchange.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you look at revenue on those
companies too, or how a limitation on a
[SPEAKER_02]: market not allowing export, will change a
multi-trillion dollar industry trajectory
[SPEAKER_02]: within a few years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without these events, we would
literally be still in the basement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really honored for MGBiz, what they do
for your companies, and major news
[SPEAKER_02]: covering this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I think we're obviously not
in the basement here, but the good news
[SPEAKER_01]: for everybody here is we're barely on the
first floor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're building the foundation
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we're building the foundation
right here.
