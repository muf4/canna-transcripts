[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Gretchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Adrian Giovenco, CEO and co-founder of
Inspire Transpiration Solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the opportunity to share
some information with you guys today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump in on the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned earlier from Corinne that light
plus CO2 plus water equals the sugar and
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen that we're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants need to make sugar because this
is plant food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can't do this effectively,
plants suffer and your outcomes will
[SPEAKER_00]: suffer in the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the people who work with plants
tell us that there are nine cardinal
[SPEAKER_00]: parameters, we must remember that CO2 and
light are only two of the nine important
[SPEAKER_00]: things for plant growth and vitality.
[SPEAKER_00]: As providers of HVACD systems,
we designed equipment knowing that we had
[SPEAKER_00]: direct control over four of the nine
parameters, the ones we highlighted in the
[SPEAKER_00]: circle on the left side of the slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But indirectly, we affect the four
parameters in the root zone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even more importantly, if you want to
take advantage of the investment that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've made in your lights and the full
spectrum of photons they provide,
[SPEAKER_00]: you ideally want to have the healthiest
plants to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now all of this comes down to the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take it so seriously because we
recognize that environmental control is
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the backbone of an IPM or integrated
pest management plan is environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, our team has a mantra and that
is you must control the culture or the
[SPEAKER_00]: culture will control you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And managing your environment correctly
will prevent a whole host of more costly
[SPEAKER_00]: interventions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just heard a little bit from Chris
about the importance of the biosecurity
[SPEAKER_00]: mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can talk about that a little bit more
and dig deeper into it, but it's something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, you can truly say that an
ounce of prevention is worth a pound of
[SPEAKER_00]: cure or in this case, cured bud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move to the next slide and discuss
the importance of temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is significant because the actual plant
cells will thrive in a narrow band of
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and outside that they'll
assimilate less and less of that precious
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2 that they need to drive the sugar
making process.
[SPEAKER_00]: But keep in mind that leaf temperature and
room temperature are sometimes two very
[SPEAKER_00]: different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do growers balance the room
environment to control the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move to the next slide and take a
look.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most sophisticated growers will use a
VPD chart, which is the chart on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start with some definitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant will move water through the root
system, up the stem, into the leaves and
[SPEAKER_00]: out of tiny pores on the leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pores are called stomata.
[SPEAKER_00]: This process is called transpiration and
is driven by the fact that just inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaves on the other side of the
stomata are saturated wet pockets of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The high humidity inside the plant creates
a pressure with the external environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is at a lower humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This pressure is called the vapor pressure
differential or vapor pressure difference
[SPEAKER_00]: or vapor pressure deficit or differential,
all abbreviated as VPD.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, difference differential
deficit mean the same thing when you hear
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take a leaf at a specific
temperature and set of temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity conditions and generate the VPD
metric most typically calculated in
[SPEAKER_00]: pascals to measure that pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now a sophisticated grower uses this
particular chart to try to maintain a
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature and humidity most conducive to
the stage of life that the plant is in.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a mechanical engineer, we use a similar
tool called the psychrometric chart,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is this chart on the right,
to design an environment that delivers the
[SPEAKER_00]: VPD to the grower that is we deliver an
environment that allows the plant to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a VPD that is suitable for its appropriate
stage of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: In doing so, delivers maximum vitality and
yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take note that the axes on both charts
have temperature and relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: which allow for these charts to be used
together in conjunction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now moving from the theoretical,
this chart can often be misapplied by
[SPEAKER_00]: people who don't understand that the VPD
chart is not a static diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it starts by knowing that the
temperature of the leaf relative to the
[SPEAKER_00]: room around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is most directly impacted by the
type of lighting that serves the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move to the next slide and look at
this in practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: This VPD chart is drawn on the condition
whereby the room temperature and the leaf
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature are the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is usually indicative of a room at
night where there are no lights shining on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move to the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a VPD chart showing optimal
conditions for a plant when it is exposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to LED lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now take note that in this case,
the leaf temperature is cooler than the
[SPEAKER_00]: room temperature, or in practice with the
HVACD systems, the room temperature is
[SPEAKER_00]: held on the warmer side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move to the next slide and look at a
VPD chart showing optimal conditions for a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant when it is exposed to HID lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here the leaf temperature is warmer than
the room temperature, or in practice with
[SPEAKER_00]: the HVACD system, the room temperature is
held on the cooler side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, can you see the difference in how the
chart is redrawn each time we've gone
[SPEAKER_00]: through that exercise between those three
different charts?
[SPEAKER_00]: The real point to drive home here,
hang on one sec, the real point to drive
[SPEAKER_00]: home here is that VPD is a moving target
in any room and it really requires a deep
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding than what a downloaded VPD
chart off the internet and taking that and
[SPEAKER_00]: treating it like gospel would allow you to
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully growers are coming around to
understanding this and can use our
[SPEAKER_00]: horticulture specific environmental
control systems to bring dynamic VPD to
[SPEAKER_00]: their rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move to the next slide and talk
about the significance of data metrics and
[SPEAKER_00]: KPIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so important to be able to take
advantage of data and learn from data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you don't have a funnel and a means
of taking that data, turning it into
[SPEAKER_00]: metrics and ultimately KPIs for your
business to be benchmarked on and be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to take actionable corrections or
direction from that data, what was then
[SPEAKER_00]: that purpose of gathering that data?
[SPEAKER_00]: Benchmarking is a key function in figuring
out where you start from and where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you can use different types of these
metrics and KPIs, whether it's grams per
[SPEAKER_00]: watt, dollars per gram, operating cost per
pound, condensate capture over total
[SPEAKER_00]: water, things like this from a high level
cultivator perspective and business owner
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the lighting side, we can talk about
micro moles per joule.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us on the HVACD side, we talk about
pounds per hour of moisture removal per KW
[SPEAKER_00]: of electricity that it costs to remove
that moisture and it's such a more
[SPEAKER_00]: impactful measure than tons of cooling
type metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's move on to the next slide and talk
about some HVAC design considerations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a, as Chris from Livewell
documented, it's come up a number of times
[SPEAKER_00]: through the panel today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a moisture removal challenge,
not an air conditioning challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Knowing that and knowing that this is
really based upon understanding your
[SPEAKER_00]: actual daily watering rates is such a key
component.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll talk a little bit about sizing in a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Room conditions are key to that because
different, as we just talked about,
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of lighting systems
require different room conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then those as such then those room
conditions have a either positive or
[SPEAKER_00]: negative effect derating or increasing the
capacity of any given HVAC system based
[SPEAKER_00]: upon what those room conditions are and
the amount of moisture that you wish to
[SPEAKER_00]: remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air flow considerations have just been
touched on significantly in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: couple, especially with Chris,
which is great, just consistent,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean, trying to remove micro climates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Air flow is really one of those things
that can significantly positively impact
[SPEAKER_00]: your facility with not a whole lot else to
it if you're having big challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really glad that he talked about
biosecurity that's, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these topics are things we could
have much deeper dives on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to quickly flash up for you,
what we use as a basis of figuring out the
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds per hour of moisture removal to
size HVAC equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pounds per hour is truly the daily
watering rate times the percentage of
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture removed during the day divided by
the number of photo period on hours and
[SPEAKER_00]: then converting from gallons to pounds of
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just a graph that'll give you an
example of a particular room.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to the next slide, this is
really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're advocates for growers to know and
understand this equation and be able to be
[SPEAKER_00]: an active participant in the design of
their systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with any rule or equation really comes
nuances and exceptions to the rules and
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding that there's different
rooms, different bedrooms versus flower
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms versus mother rooms, also different
proportion.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have different proportions as well
as different crops will have different
[SPEAKER_00]: proportions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very important to understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's recap on the last slide and give you
a few nuggets to take away to the Q&A
[SPEAKER_00]: section.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultural control is the foundation of
success.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really are big believers in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The environmental control via the HVACD
system, D for dehumidification,
[SPEAKER_00]: is key to any IPM strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The third bullet here of different HVACD
system types, we could go into another
[SPEAKER_00]: multi minute hour conversation about all
the different types of systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's mostly important to understand that
there's many different types of HVAC
[SPEAKER_00]: systems out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really important to be able to
evaluate the limitations and risk of
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of systems, be able to
look at different types of energy saving
[SPEAKER_00]: features, work that in conjunction with
your utility early and often as mentioned
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, and then be able to balance that
with CAPEX, OPEX, and cash flow in your
[SPEAKER_00]: speed to market plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just leave you with, advocate for
choosing your partners with care.
[SPEAKER_00]: We always want to say treat those plants
with respect and have fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
