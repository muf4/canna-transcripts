[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, please It is absolutely absolutely
so anyone who brings so we have we have
[SPEAKER_00]: our nursery Which is a commercial nursery
we sell plants mostly b2b license to
[SPEAKER_00]: license to license cultivators We
occasionally do like clone drops at
[SPEAKER_00]: festivals and at dispensaries as well but
we also have Services that we offer to
[SPEAKER_00]: other private individuals and that's all
done through what we call our non
[SPEAKER_00]: propagation agreement and that's
ultimately spelled out By the client if
[SPEAKER_00]: they can spell out exactly Who they want
to have access to the genetic materials
[SPEAKER_00]: and most of the time we propagate stuff
for people We can't even grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves, you know, it's all contract
based.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely So yeah, I mean the only But a
and they kind of screwed him over they
[SPEAKER_00]: were totally dying They were mutating they
were covered in tasks and he brought us
[SPEAKER_00]: like the saddest looking slips like I've
ever seen and he was desperate And we did
[SPEAKER_00]: we on a handshake deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like look we'll take it and we'll
take care of you You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We took in his pink panties his acai his
original son shit sherbert all of this
[SPEAKER_00]: parent material to You know a lot of the
hype shit that people are talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: right now again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry part of my language but the So yeah,
that was the first time and luckily it
[SPEAKER_00]: worked out Well, we did eventually put a
contract in place over time But it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: handshake deal that we did with him and
now we're providing For a lot of his farms
[SPEAKER_00]: that are contract to grow his products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're providing all the clones to those
[SPEAKER_00]: So So is it That depends it ultimately
depends on how much so It depends on how
[SPEAKER_00]: many plants you have that you want to bank
It depends on what your so I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me back up to clarify your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you saying is it economical to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Use us as a germplasm is a genetic banking
of material or is it economical for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a propagator for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say the the latter must much more
likely the germplasm process again the
[SPEAKER_00]: initiation like what we because it takes a
It takes a lot of time To when a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: comes into culture to R&D it to figure out
what media it grows healthily on there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: big R&D expense that we incur bringing in
new varieties into culture we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: Shorten that process up and streamline
that process by starting to do genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: screening And being able to look and see
hey this new variety that we're bringing
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: How does it look genetically?
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to other varieties that we have
does it have some of the same genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: markers that this other cultivar has So if
it does let's try it on this media first
[SPEAKER_00]: and save ourselves three months of having
plants not grow and die on the wrong media
[SPEAKER_00]: To back up for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the things that we were
really really surprised about is there was
[SPEAKER_00]: a huge variance in Cultivar to cultivar to
how they performed and grew on media much
[SPEAKER_00]: more so than other agricultural crops Like
there's a there's a grape media and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a banana media and there's an
orchid media and you can grow Symbidians
[SPEAKER_00]: and thalinopsis and lady slippers all in
the same orchid media We didn't find that
[SPEAKER_00]: with cannabis, which was pretty
interesting each cultivar really seemed to
[SPEAKER_00]: want a specific media to grow on so The
the initiation process is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna sugarcoat it for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive You know, I mean it's
thousands of dollars to take one of your
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties and come in, you know So banking
that material Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we have insurance as well So the
and backup facilities all of that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean we keep multiple copies
not all in the same site You know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: But um, yeah, I mean it is it is Certainly
what we've found at least for economical
[SPEAKER_00]: even for smaller people in the 10,000
square foot range who either Don't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to mess around with propagation
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like dude You can devote all your
square footage to all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need a team to do propagation
You don't need to keep moms around anymore
[SPEAKER_00]: either use choose from our genetic
library, which is over 120 cultivars or
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take your your genetics in and we'll
propagate them from you in next season
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll give you all the plants you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean and you it's volume it's obviously
sliding scale volume dependent,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I mean, but yes No, we sell the
clones back So I just got the word that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got five minutes left.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just gonna look real quick to see if
there's anything That I didn't hit And if
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yeah the one thing that I did want
to say like being back up in here I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just a really it's a really good time
for The kind of communities to come
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really really hope that Through my work
with finest and my work in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: that I can try to be a bridge between The
scientific community and the grassroots
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community because that's where I
came from And I think it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: important that these two communities work
together to preserve this industry and put
[SPEAKER_00]: it on the right Track the track that we
all want to see it on And with that said
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll open it up if there is any more
questions that people have that we can I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully be able to answer No good
awesome well, thank you all again
