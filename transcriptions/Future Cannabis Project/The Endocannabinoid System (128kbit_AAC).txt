[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for having me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a lot of time so I'll just
give you my background real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Raised in New Jersey, went to Rutgers
undergraduate and then went to Rutgers
[SPEAKER_03]: medical school, hated the weather and came
out here for internship and residency and
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Been out here since 1990.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did three years of internship and
residency at Children's Hospital Los
[SPEAKER_03]: Angeles and stayed for a year to be chief
resident.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went into critical care transport and
emergency medicine after that and I did
[SPEAKER_03]: that for about 12-13 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Completely burned out after having a child
of my own, trying to be mommy during the
[SPEAKER_03]: day and doctor at night lasts only a few
years before your endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_03]: falls apart and you need a mental break
and during the time that I took a leave of
[SPEAKER_03]: absence, a friend of mine developed breast
cancer and her husband called me and said
[SPEAKER_03]: we think we want to go get medical
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's really suffering with the treatment
and this was in late 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2007, early 2008 and I was ashamed to say
that I knew nothing other than what I
[SPEAKER_03]: experienced back in college which was not
medical at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since I had time and I'm a science geek I
decided to do my research and sure enough
[SPEAKER_03]: I was astounded.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you start reading and looking you
will find some incredible things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's criminal that I'm one of the few
doctors that knows this.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sad that all you guys are here and
are there any doctors in the audience?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean come on, where are we?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I decided to go into practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I joined a very nice professional practice
in Long Beach and then ended up buying
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis centers which is my practice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also do some medical consulting for a
group called Ghost Group and they've been
[SPEAKER_03]: very supportive so that I can keep my
prices down so that I can see patients for
[SPEAKER_03]: one fee and then take care of them for a
whole year.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: They subsidize and they don't ask me for
very much at all so they're kind of a
[SPEAKER_03]: behind the scenes group.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to talk about the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to go fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have questions at the end feel free
to approach me or email me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some cards too if you have
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically you have to remember that
people used cannabis for thousands and
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands of years as a medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: They saw it as a medicine and then what
happened in the late 1930s, early 1940s is
[SPEAKER_03]: that for political and economic reasons
mostly there was propaganda against
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and it basically got taken off of
kind of the medical formulary and was made
[SPEAKER_03]: illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then fast forward to 1970 Controlled
Substance Act.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the meanwhile in Israel in 1964 as
you can see Dr. Rafael Mishulim who's
[SPEAKER_03]: still around today doing cannabis
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's really a tremendous contributor to
all of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was trying to figure out what
compounded in the plant made people feel
[SPEAKER_03]: the psychoactive effects and so he
isolated in his very crude 1964 lab THC
[SPEAKER_03]: from CBD and from some of the other
compounds and he gave isolated THC to
[SPEAKER_03]: young healthy men and sure they felt the
psychoactive effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave CBD to young healthy men and they
didn't feel anything and some of the other
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds as well and nobody felt
psychoactivity so he achieved his goal
[SPEAKER_03]: which was to find out what caused
psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_03]: But remember that that was in 1964 you
know just a few years later Controlled
[SPEAKER_03]: Substance Act shuts down a lot of research
and we really didn't know how THC worked
[SPEAKER_03]: for another 24 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in 1988 scientists discovered this
little guy right here called the
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid receptor or cannabinoid
receptor and initially that was actually a
[SPEAKER_03]: known receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember a receptor acts like a lock and
the chemical key has to come along and
[SPEAKER_03]: unlock it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay so scientists had actually seen this
receptor and they had tried different
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds different keys and they couldn't
figure out what it was so they called it
[SPEAKER_03]: an orphan receptor because it didn't have
a key.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in another research lab elsewhere
someone decided to take synthetic THC and
[SPEAKER_03]: radioactive dilabel it and follow it in a
rat's brain and lo and behold THC went
[SPEAKER_03]: every time to that orphan receptor so they
changed the name from orphan receptor to
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: What scientists knew at the time very
smart scientists is that we do not have
[SPEAKER_03]: receptors in our body for something that
exists outside our body.
[SPEAKER_03]: We must have a chemical key inside our
body that works at that receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was in the looking for how THC
worked we found basically the
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it took four years you can see I write
it right here oh 1992 there was the
[SPEAKER_03]: discovery of the first endocannabinoid
endo from within like endorphins okay and
[SPEAKER_03]: it took them four years to discover it
because it's a fat based molecule and they
[SPEAKER_03]: were looking for a water based molecule so
it took them a little while but they did
[SPEAKER_03]: find it and lo and behold in 1992 they
found the first endocannabinoid called
[SPEAKER_03]: anandamide and then subsequently five
endocannabinoids have been found in
[SPEAKER_03]: humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the role of the endocannabinoid
system?
[SPEAKER_03]: From 1988, 1992 when all of this research
was taking place if you looked at how much
[SPEAKER_03]: research there was on THC and CBD you know
there was just a few little studies here
[SPEAKER_03]: and there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since then it is hundreds of thousands of
papers have been looked at because this
[SPEAKER_03]: was a receptor that once it was mapped out
they realized it's the most widespread
[SPEAKER_03]: receptor in your body and most doctors
don't even know that it exists.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people don't know that it exists.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this research they discovered and a
tremendous amount of research has been
[SPEAKER_03]: done just in the last 20-25 years that the
role of the endocannabinoid system is to
[SPEAKER_03]: maintain balance within the cells of your
brain and your body and balance is called
[SPEAKER_03]: homeostasis and so what the cannabinoid
system does is it sends signals between
[SPEAKER_03]: cells to balance the neurotransmitters.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see in the brain it controls
and helps to balance cognition,
[SPEAKER_03]: motor control, emotional response and
motivated behavior and in the body mostly
[SPEAKER_03]: immune function but also gastrointestinal
microcirculation and the autonomic nervous
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay in this slide please don't be
overdazzled by it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's a neuron and it's talking to this
neuron by sending neurotransmitters so
[SPEAKER_03]: dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and so
on and notice they have their own
[SPEAKER_03]: receptors if it's too much message,
it's usually too much sometimes not enough
[SPEAKER_03]: but usually it's an excitatory message or
brain-inspiring, think about anxiety,
[SPEAKER_03]: epilepsy, ADHD, autism, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Too much message actually disrupts the
cell and makes the calcium go up.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the calcium goes up, this is a plus
sign, turns on the factory that makes your
[SPEAKER_03]: body's natural marijuana-like substance
which then spins up here, key in the lock
[SPEAKER_03]: to send the message to turn it down,
turn it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: If anybody's used cannabis you know for
many people it turns down anxiety,
[SPEAKER_03]: it turns off pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there are other ways that it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can turn on things too like hunger but
basically remember what it's doing is it's
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to say hey cell turn it down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like me knocking on my 15-year-old's
door and saying turn your music down.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's basically what your endocannabinoid
system is doing and remember that the
[SPEAKER_03]: receptor itself does not know the
difference between your endocannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_03]: the one you make within or the
cannabinoids from the plant and that is
[SPEAKER_03]: why many people can achieve medical use of
cannabis without feeling psychoactive and
[SPEAKER_03]: so on which I'm not against but many
people do find a nice balance because they
[SPEAKER_03]: figure out the dose that just kind of puts
them right back in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really the way I like to think about
the endocannabinoid system is that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: a boat in the ocean and you start to tip
and your endocannabinoid system kicks in
[SPEAKER_03]: and balances you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really what the job is.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of my favorite quotes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's by an Italian researcher who's has
done tremendous work Vincenzo de Marzo and
[SPEAKER_03]: it says the endocannabinoid system is
essential to life and it relates messages
[SPEAKER_03]: that affect how we relax, eat,
sleep, forget and protect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So receptor location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those receptors are not on every cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're only on certain cells and if you
look at this slide and this is pretty well
[SPEAKER_03]: laid out on the internet if you want to do
more research you can see pain,
[SPEAKER_03]: memory, stress, learning, appetite,
higher cognitive function, movement and
[SPEAKER_03]: over there I think that's nausea and
vomiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember in the brain stem right here is
where you control heart rate and
[SPEAKER_03]: respirations.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are no receptors in that area of the
brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are opiate receptors but no
cannabinoid receptors and that's why
[SPEAKER_03]: nobody turns off their breathing or their
heart rate with even the hugest overdose
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may be trippy but you won't die.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also cannabinoid receptors from
the neck down and actually they've also
[SPEAKER_03]: found these second type in certain areas
of the brain and what's interesting is
[SPEAKER_03]: this slide shows you the density.
[SPEAKER_03]: So red and yellow is the highest density.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can see they're everywhere,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Highest concentration in the immune
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So spleen, tonsils, your thymus,
your white blood cells and basically they
[SPEAKER_03]: mediate the way your body responds to its
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cytokines can cause inflammation and
that is why we know cannabis to be a very
[SPEAKER_03]: potent anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're also found on certain cells in the
brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: The microglia of the brain, just think of
those as like the Pac-Men that clean up
[SPEAKER_03]: inside your brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not the neurons but they are the
cells that help clean up and they also
[SPEAKER_03]: have cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the gut cannabinoid receptors modulate
inflammation and also they mediate pain
[SPEAKER_03]: response in the peripheral nervous system.
Next slide.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now in 2003, Dr. Ethan Rousseau who's a
very well known, very proliferative
[SPEAKER_03]: medical cannabis specialist, he's a
neurologist by trade, he floated this idea
[SPEAKER_03]: of people possibly having a clinical
endocannabinoid deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if the same way type 1 diabetics
don't make insulin, people with
[SPEAKER_03]: hypothyroidism don't make thyroid hormone,
what if you don't make your natural
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoids, how does that manifest?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it turns out that research just in the
last 10 years has shown that all of these
[SPEAKER_03]: diseases listed here, there is scientific
evidence to show that there's an
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid deficiency or dysfunction
that is maybe causing these.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will tell you that I have migraine
patient after migraine patient coming into
[SPEAKER_03]: my office finding incredible results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fibromyalgia hands down, patients getting
off hardcore opiates and all kinds of pain
[SPEAKER_03]: medications.
[SPEAKER_03]: Irritable bowel syndrome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to tell everybody that
migraine, fibromyalgia, and irritable
[SPEAKER_03]: bowel are three conditions where,
and I'm sorry to the men in the room,
[SPEAKER_03]: but male doctors say, oh, she's one of
those women, it's in her head.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well it is in your head, it's your
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask them if they've ever heard of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So other conditions as well, chronic
motion, anorexia, FTT is failure to thrive
[SPEAKER_03]: in babies.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to have a normal functioning
endocannabinoid system for a baby to
[SPEAKER_03]: suckle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anxiety, depression, Parkinson's,
Huntington's, schizophrenia, and the list
[SPEAKER_03]: goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is a big area of research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, pharmaceutical companies want
to come up with a pharmaceutical that's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to work at that receptor,
but I say why recreate the wheel,
[SPEAKER_03]: Mother Nature has what we need.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so I'm going to talk just very
briefly about receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: The number of receptors that you have can
change in response to the environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people who are sick, seizures,
Crohn's disease, nerve pain,
[SPEAKER_03]: sleep-deprived rats have been shown that
in these types of medical conditions or
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental stresses, your body makes
more receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like your body's saying, feed me more
cannabinoid so I can get the boat back in
[SPEAKER_03]: balance, okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Very interesting study since someone
brought up autism.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this was in 2013.
[SPEAKER_03]: They drew white blood cells, regular blood
tests from children with autism and
[SPEAKER_03]: children without autism, and across the
board, children with autism in their white
[SPEAKER_03]: blood cells, part of their immune system,
they had increased number of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm seeing tremendous results for a
number of my patients with autism.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, the increase in receptors is
thought to be protective.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the cells are just saying,
please send more cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Down regulation of receptors is the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you overstimulate the receptor,
what basically happens is the receptor,
[SPEAKER_03]: remember I showed you it's sitting on the
cell wall, it can get pulled into the cell
[SPEAKER_03]: if it's being inundated usually with THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's how tolerance builds up
because your receptors basically hide
[SPEAKER_03]: inside the cells waiting for the all
clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why when people take a break
from cannabis and then they come back to
[SPEAKER_03]: it and say, oh my gosh, it's so strong,
well that's because all your receptors
[SPEAKER_03]: popped out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people don't realize this,
but there was a study done where they took
[SPEAKER_03]: chronic heavy users and they mapped out
their receptors and they had very few
[SPEAKER_03]: receptors compared to somebody who I call
cannabis naive who's never used cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they took those people, volunteers,
and locked them in a lab where they made
[SPEAKER_03]: them abstain and get a scan every seven
days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by day 28, they had the same amount of
receptors as a cannabis naive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So patients would say, oh, I took a five
month break.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you need to, psychologically,
that's fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But physiologically, based on your cells,
28 days, 30 days usually does the trick
[SPEAKER_03]: for you to establish your receptor count
to normal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of my patients with severe medical
conditions can't go that long,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we tell them even two or three days a
break in between will help your receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see if there's anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what I wanted to say here,
otherwise is, oh, the receptors can be,
[SPEAKER_03]: you can develop tolerance at different
parts of your brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some people come and say, well,
I don't feel, I still get high,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's not helping my pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, so the part of the brain that's
feeling the psychoactive effect is still
[SPEAKER_03]: working, but the receptors in the part
that are perceiving pain may actually be
[SPEAKER_03]: developing tolerance.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not tolerance all around the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's different parts can develop
tolerance.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's really explained why that happens
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then down regulation, so receptors
hiding in the cells can be advantageous
[SPEAKER_03]: for those that require high doses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't mind me talking about
Sophie, little Sophie who has a brain
[SPEAKER_03]: tumor, she's on high doses of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good that she developed tolerance,
because now the cannabis can work to fight
[SPEAKER_03]: the cancer, but not like wipe her out all
day where she's sleeping the whole day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So she actually has tolerance to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for most people, like I said,
if you're not getting the pain response
[SPEAKER_03]: that you want because you're overdoing,
that's a disadvantage.
[SPEAKER_03]: I recommend to people, it's very
individual.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we treating?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where are we going?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the goal?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for me, I recommend patients to
maintain sensitive receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I joke around that I'm going to
make a t-shirt that says respect your
[SPEAKER_03]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's been shown that low doses and
acute doses, what acute doses mean is just
[SPEAKER_03]: not all the time, actually enhances the
way your endocannabinoid system works.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you feed the system and are nice to it,
it works better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's been shown that low doses,
acute doses of THC increase production of
[SPEAKER_03]: your natural endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you may be deficient, but your body may
actually run a little bit better once you
[SPEAKER_03]: start using low doses of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also increases the number of the
receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It increases the way the receptors bind to
the THC so that they're actually a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit more sensitive to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in rats, it's been shown that
just low doses compared with medium doses
[SPEAKER_03]: or high doses actually enhanced the pain
relief because when they measured the
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoids in those animals compared
to the start of the study in the end,
[SPEAKER_03]: they had extra cannabinoids that they made
on their own.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by just feeding the system,
you can widen the own, the system actually
[SPEAKER_03]: widens its own therapeutic window.
[SPEAKER_03]: If cannabis use is below a certain
threshold, you get this response.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's over that, then sometimes,
you know, you get into that tolerance
[SPEAKER_03]: issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I always joke around about this,
but the difference between THC and CBD is
[SPEAKER_03]: very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: THC likes the receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's monogamous to the receptor,
okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD is a promiscuous molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't make that up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I stole it from a researcher, but I love
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works at lots of different places.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has some effect on the receptor,
but it really has non-cannabinoid receptor
[SPEAKER_03]: effects that really explain why it is such
a profound medical molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I've listed here, and I don't want
to, I know we don't have that much time,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's not a lot of affinity for the
receptors, but it modulates how other
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds bind to the receptor,
specifically THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: It blocks certain non-cannabinoid
receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It activates certain non-cannabinoid
receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of which is the GABA receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you know anything about GABA,
GABA promotes calmness, anti-anxiety,
[SPEAKER_03]: and CBD binds to that receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It inhibits the uptake of some
neurotransmitters, so your natural
[SPEAKER_03]: neurotransmitters may hang around a little
bit longer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It modulates the flow of ions like sodium
and calcium through the cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: It inhibits the enzyme, and this is wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wrote the wrong thing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It inhibits the enzyme that breaks down
your natural cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when your body releases that
cannabinoid and it binds to the receptor,
[SPEAKER_03]: an enzyme comes along and breaks it down
right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD blocks that enzyme so your natural
endocannabinoid can work a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: longer at that receptor and give a longer
response.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very important because I hear a lot
of people not understanding this.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can develop tolerance to THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it works at that receptor and the
receptor pulls into the cell.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no evidence scientifically of
tolerance to CBD, and I have lots of
[SPEAKER_03]: patients that once they find their dose of
CBD, they can stay there for a very long
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to just include this slide
because this is a big area of interest
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the endocannabinoid system in
different age groups, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we know a normal functioning
endocannabinoid system is critical for
[SPEAKER_03]: fetal development.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, implanting into the uterus,
you have to have a normal endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: system, and there's some evidence to show
in animals that if animals miscarry,
[SPEAKER_03]: they may have an endocannabinoid
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: So by giving them cannabinoid,
they actually can carry pups to term.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you have a normal endocannabinoid
system and you use cannabis, you actually
[SPEAKER_03]: might get the opposite effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's always the state of the person or
the animal that's using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not all the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all start from a different baseline.
[SPEAKER_03]: Normal functioning endocannabinoid system
is critical for advanced brain development
[SPEAKER_03]: in adolescence.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been interviewed.
[SPEAKER_03]: How can you promote this?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's teenagers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a teenager in my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: He can tell you the difference between THC
and CBD, what the indications are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's already told me, I'm curious,
Mom, but I'm going to wait because my
[SPEAKER_03]: brain's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've said to him, if you get sick,
we're going to use this medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're not sick, so just wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he keeps asking me, what age again,
Mom?
[SPEAKER_03]: What age?
[SPEAKER_03]: But he's 15, and so far we're good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I told him that I have a drug dog's nose
so I can sniff it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now one interesting thing is that in
children, there's some evidence to show
[SPEAKER_03]: that their cannabinoid receptors are not
fully developed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they may actually be fairly insensitive
to the psychoactivity of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I will tell you that my adult cancer
patients have way more trouble tolerating
[SPEAKER_03]: high dose THC than my pediatric cancer
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's no question that that
happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in aging, and this is very
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Remember, as the brain ages, there's
accumulation of free radicals and damaged
[SPEAKER_03]: molecules and what we call
neuroinflammation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we start to lose cell function.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know elderly people who struggle a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's interesting is that some
initial research, recent research is
[SPEAKER_03]: showing that activity at the
endocannabinoid system, feeding that
[SPEAKER_03]: system, actually helps protect the aging
brain and slows down some of the aging
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so how do you take care of your
own endocannabinoid system and encourage
[SPEAKER_03]: people around you to take care of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, chronic stress impairs your
cannabinoid system by decreasing your
[SPEAKER_03]: body's natural endocannabinoid levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I call mindful stress reduction,
meditation, yoga, deep breathing,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's some evidence to show that that is
helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, exercise, which some of us are
programmed to do and some of us are not,
[SPEAKER_03]: moderate to high intensity voluntary
exercise, increases your endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some evidence to show that
actually the runner's high may be
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid and not endorphins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dietary omega-3 fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course, in the United States,
our diet is high in the omega-6 fatty
[SPEAKER_03]: acids, which you have to have.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't want it at a very high
ratio.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want your omega-6 and omega-3 to be
like a 3 to 1 or a 2 to 1.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most people are like a 10 to 1.
[SPEAKER_03]: So supplementing, I have all of my
patients that I have severe illness,
[SPEAKER_03]: I get them on a dietary supplement of
omega-3.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't tell people to get a huge
amount of supplements because it gets very
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult to take a lot of things when
you're sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is definitely something that will
help the endocannabinoid system function
[SPEAKER_03]: better.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's evidence in animals that social
interaction increases your endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's a number of
interventions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So probiotic, acupuncture, osteopathic
manipulation, and curcumin, which is in
[SPEAKER_03]: turmeric, which is anti-inflammatory,
have all been shown to enhance
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And obviously, chronic alcohol use and
binge drinking decreases the
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid system and can actually
affect it negatively.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not a glass of wine a night.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about people who are
overdoing.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the last slide, I just want to
show you this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was honored to be able to participate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not selling anything because I get no
money from this, but I was asked to be
[SPEAKER_03]: part of the faculty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Deborah Malka up in Santa Cruz,
who's part of a group that I belong to
[SPEAKER_03]: called the Society of Cannabis Clinicians,
developed a 12-module CME credit,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I believe nurses can get credit as
well, for this program.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you just go online, and it's an online
program, and you sign up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little pricey, but I will tell you
it's worth every dime.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 12 modules plus a few extra modules,
and you can go back through them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: The faculty speaks, and you can hit play,
and hit pause, and do whatever,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then there's credits at the end,
and you can print out a certification at
[SPEAKER_03]: the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, every cannabis expert that's
standing out now, including Dr. Abrams,
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Dustin Suwak in Maine, Dr. Malka have
all participated, and it's a fantastic
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm gonna tell you, just in summary
here, that in my experience, and to answer
[SPEAKER_03]: one of the questions that you brought up,
to what's one of the biggest barriers,
[SPEAKER_03]: is that people who are sick and people who
have loved ones are open-minded.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot figure out why my colleagues in
the medical field are so close-minded.
[SPEAKER_03]: It drives me insane.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'll say, what's an endocannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know about the endocannabinoid
system?
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it's one-on-one, with me,
they're very open, but as you all well
[SPEAKER_03]: know, there's a lot of ego in the medical
community, and it's very hard to break
[SPEAKER_03]: through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have a doctor that is
questioning and saying, well, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: sure, you can use cannabis, and then they
don't know anything about it, give them
[SPEAKER_03]: this website.
[SPEAKER_03]: Say there's this wonderful, you can get
CME credit, which you need to have for
[SPEAKER_03]: your medical licensing, and they can use
this so that they have some basic
[SPEAKER_03]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find that most of my patients know more
than any doctor I come across,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's kind of getting depressing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we really have to push the
physicians by saying, we need you in this
[SPEAKER_03]: fight.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I was in medical school, I was taught
cannabis is a drug of abuse.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is not a drug of abuse.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a very therapeutic drug,
and we have to undo some of that
[SPEAKER_03]: brainwashing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I encourage all of you to take this
website and to share it with whoever you
[SPEAKER_03]: can share it with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so it's here to produce,
and it's properly working to produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of a state of homeostasis for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, and what it does, and which I,
you know, I couldn't include everything,
[SPEAKER_03]: but what I'll tell you is that your
endocannabinoid system sits a little
[SPEAKER_03]: dormant until there's a trigger,
which is imbalance, and then it brings it
[SPEAKER_03]: back up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you make those endorphins in response
to a trigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Inflammation, injury, illness,
and that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and so that from a medicinal
standpoint, when it gets into a severe
[SPEAKER_00]: state of deficiency or the presence of
disease is when you need to introduce
[SPEAKER_00]: external cannabis to get the system back
in balance again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I wouldn't say extreme deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I see people who are coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sufficient deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, sufficient deficiency,
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people come in and say,
I have migraines, fibromyalgia,
[SPEAKER_03]: irritable bowel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they have an endocannabinoid
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've taken 15 different medicines that
don't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they say, oh, my friend gave me a
cannabis edible and I've had the best day
[SPEAKER_03]: of my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, you know, where does it
work?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not magic fairy dust.
[SPEAKER_03]: It worked at the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they did their own test to figure out
what their deficiency is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over there.
Which one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, my name is Deje, by the way.
Hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've read some research where they've done
just research where they've given people
[SPEAKER_04]: just THC or just CBT.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to see how it works.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they found that just CBD on its own
doesn't work unless there's some THC and
[SPEAKER_04]: vice versa.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was wondering if you might be able
to speak a little bit about the synergy
[SPEAKER_04]: between both.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a great question because that's
what's holding up the pharmaceutical
[SPEAKER_03]: companies from reproducing this is they're
interested in single molecule cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis plant has 400 different
compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dr. Meshulam, who has been studying
this for, you know, as long as I've been
[SPEAKER_03]: alive, he basically discovered that each
compound has its own medicinal properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when added together, it is very much,
much enhanced.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what he named that is called the
entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need all those compounds to get the
benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now, we're seeing some
pharmaceutical CBD on the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's from a company called GW
Pharmaceuticals in Great Britain.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're producing a drug called Epidiolex
for pediatric epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've removed all the THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, for some patients, it does work,
but not the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not seeing the same success as what
we're seeing with what is called whole
[SPEAKER_03]: plant extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't take an apple and pull out
one little vitamin out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You eat the whole apple, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is mother nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't fit the business model for
pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that is why we shouldn't treat it
like a pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be treated in its own special
category.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had some friends who have had people
back east who are very, very sick,
[SPEAKER_06]: and they're being, you know, when it's
cancer or Crohn's or whatever,
[SPEAKER_06]: the gist is that they're being given
synthetic marijuana, Marisol or something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Marinal.
[SPEAKER_03]: What Marinal is, is just isolated
synthetic THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not getting the same results.
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what happens with isolated THC is you
either get really stoned and it's
[SPEAKER_03]: uncomfortable, what we call dysphoria,
or you don't get any result at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I had a patient tell me it's like
eating M&M's.
[SPEAKER_03]: He didn't feel it at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the fact that they were saying that
they didn't even, they were hoping they'd
[SPEAKER_06]: feel something to tell them that they got
it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some patients do get the nausea reduction
and the appetite improvement, which is
[SPEAKER_03]: what it's indicated for.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you compare and there is a very
elderly psychiatrist at Harvard by the
[SPEAKER_03]: name of Lester Grinspoon, if you ever get
a chance, you should Google him.
[SPEAKER_03]: He says anybody given a choice between the
two who's tried between the two will
[SPEAKER_03]: always 100% pick the whole plant extract
over an isolated synthetic.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in your position then, you would not
ever condone the synthetic version because
[SPEAKER_06]: you don't see the results as positive?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I live in California, so I don't
have to use synthetic cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have patients who live, I mean,
I do see sometimes see out of state
[SPEAKER_03]: patients who are very desperate.
[SPEAKER_03]: I cannot tell you how frustrating it is
when somebody gets a CBD only product
[SPEAKER_03]: because they have these stupid CBD only
laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand it may be a foot in the door,
but politicians want to stop there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's millions of people that can
benefit from cannabis and CBD only cuts
[SPEAKER_03]: that down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is not how it should be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those patients say, well,
CBD didn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'd add THC and try to find the
balance between the two compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand we may not want big
psychoactivity, especially in a child.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, we can find a
balance between how much CBD and how much
[SPEAKER_03]: THC that will work for that particular
person.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no reason to discard THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is medicinal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me crazy when people say it's
recreational.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is medicinal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be recreational, but so can bike it
in and alcohol and all these other things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, I think we got time for one
more here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to do it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Take it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a cold.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've done a lot of research, and my
understanding is hemp versus marijuana.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hemp has more CBD, less THC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And cannabis has THC, more THC,
less cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was told that if I wanted to not get
high, I should look at hemp and hemp oil
[SPEAKER_05]: as opposed to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of confusion about what is hemp and
what is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, it boils down to the
genetics of the plant, which nobody talks
[SPEAKER_03]: about.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't hear about that in a collective
or in a doctor's office.
[SPEAKER_03]: But basically, cannabis sativa is actually
a hemp, fibrous, and cannabis indica is
[SPEAKER_03]: really programmed to make more THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, everybody thinks it's the other
way around, and so there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: confusion.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you have to remember is go back to
the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want every part of the plant that you
can have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't even get into what's called
the terpenoids, because there isn't time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you wouldn't want to take just a piece
of the cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemp is a very good nutritional source of
omega fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I encourage people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a bonus nutrition product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody should incorporate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemp oil, hemp hearts, whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I do not see it as, quote,
medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can enhance your endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you are a sick person, you should
be using the cannabis plant that makes
[SPEAKER_03]: both THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you have to remember is that freedom
to grow cannabis in California,
[SPEAKER_03]: and now we're going on 20 years of medical
legalization, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what's happened is that with that
freedom to grow, people have been crossing
[SPEAKER_03]: strains and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that growing of cannabis, what happens
has happened is everybody wants to max out
[SPEAKER_03]: the high THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody's like, my car has more torque
than your car, if that even makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's more THC at the sacrifice of CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you go and look at any test results
of cannabis, 99% of the plants in
[SPEAKER_03]: California are 20% THC, 0.02% CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's happened over the last few
years because of kind of the media
[SPEAKER_03]: attention to CBD and the scientific
knowledge that has come out is that we now
[SPEAKER_03]: recognize that we need to have some CBD as
balance in these plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I find that my patients, look,
I have lots of patients that do really
[SPEAKER_03]: well on THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they come in and say, well,
am I kind of distracted from it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really helping.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I ask them what they're using.
[SPEAKER_03]: Invariably, they're using all THC with no
CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we add in CBD, they're going to get
better results.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's kind of been bred down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're talking about bringing it
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've kind of come full circle back to
what Mother Nature may have meant with
[SPEAKER_03]: some CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: One other thing about hemp that's very
important is hemp is considered as a plant
[SPEAKER_03]: that's considered a bioaccumulator,
which means that it sucks up a lot from
[SPEAKER_03]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it can suck up heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually had patients come in who
have gotten cannabis tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's some nasty stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The FDA, if you go to the FDA,
which is not my favorite group,
[SPEAKER_03]: but if you go to their website,
they actually have a list of products that
[SPEAKER_03]: are supposedly hemp CBD products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of them don't even have any CBD
in them, because there really isn't any
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation of what's going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hemp that you would buy at a grocery
store usually is somebody's bothering to
[SPEAKER_03]: make it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The hemp right now, unregulated,
that's available in some collectives is
[SPEAKER_03]: not regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're better off just going and buying
and adding that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want medicine, I recommend a
medical cannabis plant with some tested
[SPEAKER_03]: ratio of THC to CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends on what illness you have.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of my epilepsy patients use high
CBD, low THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: A recent study of patients with
neuropathic pain, nerve pain, and chronic
[SPEAKER_03]: pain, they found four to one.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD is always first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so four parts CBD to one part THC
seem to work across the board for many
[SPEAKER_03]: chronic pain patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some patients may find that still a little
psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could bump up on the CBD a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a lot of patients that use high CBD
during the day so that they're not feeling
[SPEAKER_03]: under the influence.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can still drive their car,
go to work to care their kids,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then at night they use a higher THC
product so that they can get sleep and
[SPEAKER_03]: relax and get a little bit more pain
relief.
[SPEAKER_07]: My question is then a follow-up to that.
[SPEAKER_07]: When making your whole plant extract,
how critical is it that it's all in the
[SPEAKER_07]: same plant or can you mix extracts from
different plants?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like say you have a high CBD strain and
then a higher THC strain, would that still
[SPEAKER_07]: be the same effect or would it be
beneficial if you just have a single plant
[SPEAKER_07]: extract?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the amount of THC is going to be the
amount of THC in that plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you add more to it, you just add it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The big difference is the other oils that
are in the plant called the terpenoids,
[SPEAKER_03]: which you may have heard of.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're looking at terpenoids,
remember, so I'll just share one example.
[SPEAKER_03]: A terpenoid is essential oil found in the
plant and it's cross species with other
[SPEAKER_03]: plants, meaning you can find a terpenoid
called linalool in lavender.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all know lavender is kind of calming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Linalool is also found in certain strains
of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of them have a name that hints
towards lavender, like purple,
[SPEAKER_03]: purple princess, granddaddy purple,
purple haze.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes the names aren't just stupid.
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually refer to what the plant is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you mix, though, something with
linalool with something with mircine,
[SPEAKER_03]: you may not know exactly, unless you
measure it, you may not know exactly what
[SPEAKER_03]: end result you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm all for the right answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all for the regulation so that people
can walk into a collective and see how
[SPEAKER_03]: much THC, how much CBD, solvents,
pesticides, and the terpenoid profile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if I know I need linalool,
I don't want to buy a plant that doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have any linalool in it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is just the same way food is
labeled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my doctor says, you know, eat more
calcium, eat more fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to look at labels.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to be able to know, you know,
those artichokes, what do they have?
[SPEAKER_03]: I look on the internet and I can see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the same thing with these plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is completely doable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just California kind of got it
backwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: We legalized first and then didn't really
regulate the way we should have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
