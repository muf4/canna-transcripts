[SPEAKER_02]: Behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Low budget productions.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so Tom, we're in the valley
right now and you've been on set to a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of valley porn shoots.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to compare and contrast the
production level of the porn shoots to our
[SPEAKER_02]: home cannabis cultivation shoots.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're killing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You haven't seen this raised bed since?
[SPEAKER_02]: Since round one, yeah, they're beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Absolutely beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the green.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the turgidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I love the health.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's growing just like a
standard seed stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you can already smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, I loved last week.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smelled it for the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: How does the soil look to you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Soil looks beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, the canopy now is kind of making
some shade for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're probably watering less.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the moisture is perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at the roots.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: Roots are actually coming to the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you can get in close
there, but yeah, there's a lot of root
[SPEAKER_05]: growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for this particular one, we didn't add
the mycorrhizae at the root zone,
[SPEAKER_05]: which usually is what you'd want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't have any.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for that time, where'd it go?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the box right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you guys added some prior,
like last week or a couple of weeks ago?
[SPEAKER_05]: About one week ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so we do have mycorrhizae fungi in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so first of all, time, you said we
planted these exactly a month ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do believe if we look at the tape,
it was about June 22nd, something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is July 20th?
[SPEAKER_02]: 21st, 23rd.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, exactly a month or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I brought them over, they were
about a week after popping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they look beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means that this is what,
like five and a half weeks from seed?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we can start to determine a couple of
factors here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, it's a little early,
so I'm not going to jump the gun on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll wait a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you want to be cognizant of these two
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, because we're still looking at
them now.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so let's look at this for a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so even though they're vegging,
right, even though they're vegging,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's just something to look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom, sadly, probably two of these are
going to have to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think two, maybe possibly even
three.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tom, would you be sad or very sad if all
four of them were?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be one giant plant though.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: But look at this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this isn't veg, so this is still
jumping.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not jumping the gun.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just something throughout experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: You start to look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to try to get the early signals
of what could be male, what could be
[SPEAKER_05]: female.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll see on this one, you just have,
you know, and these could very,
[SPEAKER_05]: very well grow some hair pistols to
indicate that they will be female.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can kind of already get an
indication from there on the sides there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go real close.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's still vegging.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we don't want to jump the gun,
but it's just you look at it and you go,
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, these are the ones that I may want to
look at as we go into transition.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because you'll see ones that are
definitely more dominant on the male side,
[SPEAKER_05]: given the given the given the structure as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: You see how the nodes are kind of
staggered a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we have nodes here that are
completely symmetrical.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are these are just some things.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not a certain thing, but it is just
something through experience that you look
[SPEAKER_05]: at and say, oh, wow, the ones that are
symmetrical usually not all the time
[SPEAKER_05]: turned out to be male.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the ones that were a little bit more
staggered and such actually were were were
[SPEAKER_05]: female.
[SPEAKER_05]: A couple other things, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just looking at it, you can see some of
this internode where where you would see
[SPEAKER_05]: male organisms popping out on these
corners here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just we just want to take we just
want to keep our eye on these three seeing
[SPEAKER_05]: them popping there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It just looks like they might they might,
you know, and then given the the length,
[SPEAKER_05]: the length.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, these could these could be
really nice males, Tom.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that right there, like let's say you
want to take that smell and apply it to
[SPEAKER_05]: another female that you also like the
smell but needed something extra.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the these are the genetic traits
that you look for.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you look at a male, you're not,
you know, it's not it's not horrible.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like, man, maybe I want to put this
aside or maybe I'll I'll scoop it out,
[SPEAKER_05]: put it in a pot, move it, move it,
you know, to another area, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and and maybe cut off a few of the
branches and wrap one, collect some some
[SPEAKER_05]: dust, some pollen.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you can keep it and carry it and
hold it and maybe apply it to other other.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's a whole, you know, you'll
probably cover that whole segment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there's a lot of guys that that
can really help, you know, figure all the
[SPEAKER_05]: experts in that thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just looking at overall growing,
just you want to look at a couple of those
[SPEAKER_05]: traits in the plant so that, you know,
it's like, man, I don't want to mess up
[SPEAKER_05]: the entire crop or my neighbor's crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So let me make sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so it's just something we want
to look at down the line.
[SPEAKER_05]: But overall, the health is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, some people would maybe wait
have grown a couple of weeks and then have
[SPEAKER_05]: maybe topped so then you can get a busier
plant lower, especially when you're,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, have neighbors and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't really know what what their what
their thoughts are on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do we want to top them today?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I usually don't top them when
they're this big.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can, though, because, you know,
you have like let's say you were to just
[SPEAKER_05]: go just go, you know, kind of if you want.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you could just top that right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That whole thing can go, you know,
and so now you have one, two, three.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you have some some staggered here,
which is good.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then that'll start to grow these ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then what's going to happen to it's
going to be easier for you because this
[SPEAKER_05]: top is off and not in the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be easier for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe even put a trellis over this,
Tom, and then move these down a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and then what's going to happen
is because it's beautiful sun,
[SPEAKER_05]: this will grow up.
[SPEAKER_05]: This will grow up.
[SPEAKER_05]: This will grow up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now you have two, four, six,
eight extra arms on one arm.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now that you've increased your yield,
you increase your own your medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's a moth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, probably a little moth or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd say it's a little aggressive for a
leaf miner.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But those are ways you can increase yield,
you know, more medicine and even just like
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant itself really likes to likes to
be trellis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, again, you can keep them bushy
away from view from time to time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you should go loud and proud.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let the neighborhood know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but I personally, I love seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love how they grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: And sometimes I just I let them do their
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I let them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So wild.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like wild.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long will it take before we know for
sure what the what the sex is?
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll know like probably at the first
week of transition.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so that's a few weeks away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably like a couple probably a couple
of weeks away.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this year has been I don't know
if you guys seen it, but things have been
[SPEAKER_05]: flowering a little earlier this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's interesting.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So just a little warming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just keep your eye on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And and you know, but so far, I think the
health is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you can even cut a couple clones
off the bottom here, can do a little
[SPEAKER_05]: trimming, just kind of eliminate some of
the stuff that isn't that's being more
[SPEAKER_05]: shaded.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, why don't we cut?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we could certainly cut one or two.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, what I've done in the past and
worked for me is all we I we put them in a
[SPEAKER_02]: plastic bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whatever at home, you know, and I've
actually even put them in a cup with a
[SPEAKER_05]: little FPF.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you just if you can get get back to
the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also have a turbo cloner.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do some.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Aeroponics cloning.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could do some into the we could clone a
bunch of different ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's so many ways to do some,
you know, it's there's so why don't we cut
[SPEAKER_02]: a couple and and Tom, do you have like
like a sandwich baggie to do a little
[SPEAKER_05]: cleaning?
[SPEAKER_05]: Clean up and then we'll cut a couple
clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Tom, we're just going to leave that for
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bring bring three three bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're going to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're going to start documenting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to label the plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's great, though.
[SPEAKER_05]: The health is awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beautiful sun out here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love these leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, since we're going to trim a little
bit, we could cut a couple clones,
[SPEAKER_05]: take off a few leaves that gives us room
to maybe plant some.
[SPEAKER_05]: I brought some of the cover crops or
companion plants, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we can put them in both.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are each of these?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the which ones are the auto?
[SPEAKER_02]: These three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this the auto or the full term?
[SPEAKER_02]: Full term.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, this this was in your pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember this was in your small
pot?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Tom, you got to remember this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom, let's start from the top again.
[SPEAKER_04]: This brings back memories.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which ones are this is not too much to
keep track.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whoa, is that an auto?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that an auto pulling them out from
everywhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: I saved every single one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good Lord.
[SPEAKER_02]: This little run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tom, we only had four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we can figure out the four auto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's these four.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, but why is there a fit?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's this?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, put that next to the clinic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is the tomato.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here are two tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So first of all, I'm just going to get set
up with a little bit of condensation or a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit of water to create a home for
our clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, usually we want to have our domes,
our trays.
[SPEAKER_05]: But hey, in the world of COVID,
sometimes the stores are closed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you work with what you got.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is what we got.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it works really well, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just goes to show you how resilient these
plants really are.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we're going to do is we'll just
take the FPF because we're going to we're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to we're going to we're going to cut
some clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're just going to use a little
bit of the FPF as a as a as a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: of a root home.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hormone, given its high fulvic content.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fulvic acid is really good for
propagation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So look at look at how much I'm taking
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is just a drop.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a one milliliter a gallon product.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when we're filling up just our little
spray bottle, you really don't need much.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm just going to kind of hold that
there and rinse off.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't need much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: We use this will actually once we're done
cutting, we're going to use FPF to do a
[SPEAKER_05]: full year as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that'll kind of kind of help the areas
where we've cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: And keep and keep the plant really healthy
right after we've created a little bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: stress for it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, at first it might create a
little stress, but after after a moment,
[SPEAKER_05]: they really thank you for cleaning them
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can you can actually watch watch them
pray once they're done.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we have here is we have four
different four different.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are these all three the same?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are these four the same?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're all the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so we have four set here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we want to do is we want to make sure
that we take cuts because taking cuts off
[SPEAKER_05]: the seeds is the funnest part,
because if you really, really love one of
[SPEAKER_05]: the seeds, the smells, the tastes and and
the medicine it provides, then you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: make sure you've held on to it to
something that you can grow and
[SPEAKER_05]: continuously grow that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this this to me looks like a really
nice, nice cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's not super thick like this,
so it's not going to overburden its needs
[SPEAKER_05]: when it's in a when it's in a cloner.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this one looks looks really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going to address the same thing
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do is we're going to take
the clones as well as trim the flower,
[SPEAKER_05]: trim the plant back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So doing them together just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we're going to do is just kind of
kind of take it from the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see there's a couple of little
plants here or little little stems here
[SPEAKER_05]: that just aren't getting the light.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're taking energy more than they're
providing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we want to do since we're in here,
we'll just kind of snip that back,
[SPEAKER_05]: snip that back that that as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're going to just take this whole
thing here.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see it's a it's it's a nice it's a
nice cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then what I'd like to do is usually
kind of find an area where you're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: have some nodes because there's some
activity going on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so from here, I'll probably just take
the same the same direction the leaf is
[SPEAKER_05]: spinning and basically take that angle.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll trim that off, kind of move that to
the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so just made ourself a little clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we want to do is just want to
make sure we label it so we know which
[SPEAKER_02]: plant we took it off and label it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, labeling is always the easiest,
hardest.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the sharpie.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's literally true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't know what to write.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grab the sharpie.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so where's the sharpie?
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's on the table.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, that's a nice clone right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put that in a in a rapid router,
you can put it in a clone, but you can see
[SPEAKER_05]: we've taken the the 45 mark here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what I what I'll usually do is I'll
usually we dip it in some tea or get extra
[SPEAKER_05]: live tea.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could do that, but I'll give it just a
little bit of moisture and I'll even spray
[SPEAKER_05]: the end now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that just water?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it will.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll get that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll send that video.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys can watch the video.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a video where we're actually dunk
this in tea and that'll help kind of clean
[SPEAKER_05]: up some of the cut areas of disease
pathogens don't breed there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also as a hormone as well,
dip it in the microbial solution and then
[SPEAKER_05]: we'll dip it in FPF.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a video on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But for now, this is this is this is
another way that's honestly it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: It works really well, but just kind of
give it some moisture there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Make sure you get a little bit on there on
the on the cut as a hormone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we're just going to store this
now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're just going to store this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not going to keep them in here to
root or clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is actually just storage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you're at a buddy's house and you
go, man, that thing smells great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me get a piece that there's nothing
around.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just take it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You cut it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You place it in a bag where you can get a
little bit of of humidity and just kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: store in a cooler place.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, this one is going to be a little bit
longer than we'd like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what usually get a bigger bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want, yeah, we can do that this
way.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can keep the cut.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the node was now, you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not going to hurt it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look, this plant is so resilient.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can really live through almost
anything.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could just take a cut from here as
well.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to work just as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just a just something we've done
through experience and just something I've
[SPEAKER_05]: been doing forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we tend to what works for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just continue.
[SPEAKER_05]: We continue that SOP basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's something that works for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Tom's got a bigger bag, so it's
perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: So get that and then thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also your wife's going to be
making sandwiches tomorrow for the family
[SPEAKER_02]: and be like, where are the sandwich bags?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll actually just wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you use the paper to and why do you cut
the edges?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the purpose?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's so much there's a lot of
there's a lot of gross science,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's factual or not factual or
experience or just time over over the
[SPEAKER_05]: years we've actually cut the cut the ends
off, redirects transpiration.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's there's some science to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of people don't do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some people do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just something we've been doing
forever.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's probably some some some
very, very smart people that'll tell you
[SPEAKER_05]: exactly the reason why or why not to do
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But just for experience, this is this is
something we've done a really long time
[SPEAKER_05]: and it works.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've actually put some FPF,
a little bit of FPF in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we've also put it in the bag and
then I'll lay that right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, so let's get that in the shade
and then I'll root it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we can label that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can label it and just plant one plant
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where that's.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we could cut another one and put
another one in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long are these good in here for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Before you want to.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I've had a mail to me from
across the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as long as you can get them back into
an area where they're going to like,
[SPEAKER_05]: you could probably get a good one day or
two days or three days.
[SPEAKER_05]: In there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But generally, if you can get to the hydra
store and get it, you know, get the proper
[SPEAKER_05]: materials, that's probably going to be the
best, the best bet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom, that thing will be in.
[SPEAKER_02]: A plug in two hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if it's a plug, that's perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we'll do it since we're let's just
make sure we got enough.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's another one and we're just going
to snip it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can see why we were discussing
earlier, you can see actually a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: of hair coming out of this one here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're just going to keep our eyes on
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so you see the hairs,
Tom?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a little bit of hair.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is something we want to keep our
eye on.
[SPEAKER_05]: And make sure this one doesn't turn
female, also seed sometimes become
[SPEAKER_05]: completely symmetrical and there's a three
pack on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's something that's that's a trait
also to look at.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you could almost see a little.
Preliminary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Male part, but it's not certain yet,
so we're just going to keep our eye on it
[SPEAKER_05]: and see what transpires here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom, which plant is this?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is plant number two, plant number
one.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still on plant number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're still on plant number one because
we're here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're just going to take another 45
clip the ends there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a snip off the top, just kind of
re-examine it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe take a couple here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this also provides a little bit of
space to between clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not actually everybody rotate
90 or 180.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom, always know where your camera is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our back to the camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll throw in that same bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Tom, we'll just give it a little.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just give it a little rinse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give it a little rinse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Deeper breathing off the ends there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think two for that plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should I put this in?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, put it in the same the same bag or
plant number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll keep we'll keep these,
you know, I like these.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are these are these are tall.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're they're large.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we can do is kind of just go in and
let's just kind of eliminate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the burden.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: They take up a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: The sun is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Shade is not getting directly to there,
but the tops are still.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, there's and then there's all the
sorts of different ways, Tom.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, if you don't if you feel like
they're getting too tall, you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily have to top them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could have talked to them a little
earlier, but, you know, cannabis is so.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's it's malleable, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, everybody can grow so differently
and achieve something similar.
[SPEAKER_05]: So on these, if you'd like, you could
really you can kind of spend them over.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, just take a trellis and begin to
kind of bend them over a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you could do that after a foliar,
after a watering plus a foliar spray and
[SPEAKER_05]: in the back and in the morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so if you just and if you don't mind
it coming out here a little bit,
[SPEAKER_05]: then you could just, you know,
just bend that over like sometimes in the
[SPEAKER_05]: sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a little bit a little bit harder for
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But when when you first water,
you know, you see that kind of that
[SPEAKER_05]: they're a little more flexible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So so stick it through the trellis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we'll do is like we'll come in.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if you guys are going to do a
trellis segment, but we can come in and
[SPEAKER_05]: trellis it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd probably do it right away before
transit before transition, because you're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to get a multiply effect on the
stretch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we definitely want to do that,
you know, the next few days or next week.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just you can just bend that over like
this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I just snapped it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got to.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what we want to do is see it and snap
it all the way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are break methods as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's actually that'll probably end up
being a very strong part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we could do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it will.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, sometimes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why watering it and do it in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is kind of just this is
learning.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is a learning learning situation for
us here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can see just the inside cambium is
broken.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no tear on the outside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we can do is if you want to take a
little bit of a green strap, you can just
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of Miyagi it a little bit on the and
kind of keep it tight, make sure we're
[SPEAKER_05]: good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's generally what you want to do
is just kind of bend them, bend them all
[SPEAKER_05]: over a little bit and and sort of out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just kind of out and underneath.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then everything is because then all
this inside is going to be able to come
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so so without topping, that's another
way you can know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have a what's going on over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are just old leaves, you know,
like we're then that's why it's a second
[SPEAKER_05]: stall.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So so these are so basically right now is
a good time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these are all the reason they're just
not getting enough sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're everything's trying to
reach to new growth, new protein
[SPEAKER_05]: development.
[SPEAKER_05]: So honestly, we're just we're going to get
rid of all this bottom scruff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So funny, I could have sworn that this
this one I didn't think was going to
[SPEAKER_01]: survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So puny for so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Tom, what plant number are we on now
who are just on number one?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, are we going clockwise?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say let's go number let's call
this one, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can go three and four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could have sworn it was a different
strain from the others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're saying everything here is the
same here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now you have a clean, you're real clean
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, oh, it's all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, this is this is going to be a
look that I get was actually going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can get a steak.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then and then we can get like a little
green tape.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_05]: But honestly, this may seem like an issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, it's the plant will thank us
because there are some more intermediate
[SPEAKER_05]: and expert type of grow methods,
one of them being breaking the stem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, again, you don't want to you don't
want to break it too much.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more of a turn and snap.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can even I mean, if you want to get
close and try to hear it even come come
[SPEAKER_05]: come you you can put your finger right
here, Tom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Watch this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You hear that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The inside snapped.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's these are all ways that you can
not work.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need a little bit taller.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need taller.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we can get that we can get that going.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you'll notice that you have any long
pieces of bamboo.
[SPEAKER_05]: This will callous out and actually become
stronger.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're where you break inside stem,
not the outside, but the inside.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those areas are actually callous up and
become strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: So trellising over or bending arms over is
the first stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually the first stage to the
tricks and tips.
[SPEAKER_05]: To increase yield breaking stems.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, these are old school ways that
have been around for a long, long time
[SPEAKER_05]: that that increase the yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we've done a little cleaning.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've taken a lot of clones, taken a
couple of clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did we clone?
[SPEAKER_05]: We didn't do we take a clone from number
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: I leave it like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there aren't tons of stocks right
now, this one might be a better candidate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Number three.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, I like the way this one the
structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is on this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You do?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I like this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, you know, usually I wouldn't want to
take a clone just off of three.
[SPEAKER_05]: But really, I want to make sure we do keep
this in stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll probably end up I'll just take a
little clone off this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I had another stake somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have used it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So be actually a very good part of the
segment here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll keep that going.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this one actually looks it looks like
something we can
[SPEAKER_05]: come check this out right here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look how thick that stock is right there
coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Almost looks like it was topped naturally.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love growing from seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically, we're just going to kind of
get rid of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from here,
[SPEAKER_04]: take off the rest of those there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll give it time to stand out
here all night.
[SPEAKER_04]: All night.
[SPEAKER_05]: So keep this some moisture on this one as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any string that we could tie
it to the one of the caddy corner one?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's this here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's that's just a we can we can
use that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had that in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, it was going right in there to
put my shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to come off.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go grab something.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll save it.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, this plant number two.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can use this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to go get find some tape.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to get a little root break in
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, these plants are tough.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're tougher than nails.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this plant was so happy 20 minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's getting beat up, but it's going to
love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be the biggest,
the biggest and the yieldiest of them all,
[SPEAKER_05]: actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: So then we'll just strap them together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that, it'll be like it never
happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so we got plant number two.
Just.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can tell somebody is just I only have
black tape.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's off.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll do is we'll save that for a clone,
save that for a clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can take the the cannabis leaves
and just you can just top dress them if
[SPEAKER_05]: you like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, should we should we be putting some
more of your soil?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we can definitely do a top dress
like after we after we go through all the
[SPEAKER_05]: stress of the plant trimming it and
cloning it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think breaking it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate breaking it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can definitely add some some beneficial
biology.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, they'll thank us.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's plant number three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you cut a piece for me here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, will this impede or trellising?
[SPEAKER_05]: At this point, this one will probably
impede a little bit of the trellising.
[SPEAKER_05]: The rest of them you can you can bend over
this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, you could take the stake off and
trellis it and then and then I got you and
[SPEAKER_05]: then kind of.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we might do that as another segment,
mend it and.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was there, so we have a couple
more clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the type of the size of trellis I would
want to get would be just like a yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: they make the little four by fours like a
four by four.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the trellising for these,
but we would need to change the elbow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we need to add a top one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think just actually we could just
stick a stake inside a simple stake.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just tie it in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just something anything to keep them bent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, keep them from, you know,
just kind of keeping them bent and keeping
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and then Tom, we're getting all these
ones that aren't really getting any sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of redirect and transfer that energy
to the ones that are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, so the preferable topping would be
done in like two, three weeks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you would gauge the plant,
but generally like the first like this
[SPEAKER_05]: after the seventh node would be a would be
a good time to to top.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just kind of given the formation of the
plant as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's that's a that's a good
indication.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then from the seventh, then you can
start to kind of arm out a little bit and
[SPEAKER_05]: then easier to to to trellis and top out
again, especially with seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they grow, they just go real
straight and tall clones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes depending on the genetics,
sometimes clones don't even need to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: Topped or trellis just depends on the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some really Indica's that are that
are really bushy and and short to begin
[SPEAKER_05]: with.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of the anything kind of cross with
the OGKB is going to be definitely bushy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then things like tall down some things
like a Tahoe OG or OG.
[SPEAKER_05]: You want to you definitely want to trellis
any kind of GGs.
[SPEAKER_05]: They definitely want to be trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell that from the distance
between the nodes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that indication of what the size or the
type of the bushyness?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you'll you'll see that sativas,
they stretch, they stretch big.
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitely when they're when they're
growing tall like that, sativas will
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely need to be trellis because
they're they're not only are they tall,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they're heavy yielders.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the second they start to get big,
they'll start to, you know, they'll start
[SPEAKER_05]: toppling over.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they'll they'll want something to
hold them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this way those round the round things,
those tomato things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I used to use those.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, those are those are OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing with those is just
depending on how you cure, you're going to
[SPEAKER_05]: have to do two different ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: One is you're going to have to snip it and
kind of pull that thing out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if your nugs are too big, then they're
going to be trapped.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's also other circular ones that
don't have the the grate.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're just the circle.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then those you can actually put in and
kind of tie to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: But these you'll you'll notice your
trellis is probably going to be multilevel
[SPEAKER_05]: as they grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: So depending on, you know, your how you
want them to to to grow, that'll be
[SPEAKER_05]: determined on your trellising too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So trellising, you can you can bend them
over really, really well with those tomato
[SPEAKER_05]: ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are almost made really to actually
hold up stems or trellis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can actually train the stems.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a couple of different ways.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So these look pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, generally, I don't like to go
too far up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, a lot of people have different
ways of doing things.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, this is you can tell just from
the from sundown, it's clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so now you're not going to really get,
you know, you're not going to get a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: wasted energy and or disease, you know,
because there's places that don't that
[SPEAKER_05]: don't get a lot of sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: You could possibly get a little bit of
disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm just going to go in and give
everybody a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from number three where I cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And talk to Tom about spraying water onto
the leaves at high noon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now, you know, the segment was it
was good for a foliar.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we want to do is we want to always
foliar first thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you're outdoor, you want to you
want to foliar in the mornings.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely high noon, a little tougher for
the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's windy, you can get away with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but generally the rule is that
the little balls of water magnify the sun
[SPEAKER_05]: and kind of give a little bit of a burn.
[SPEAKER_05]: So usually mornings is going to be the
best, best time to foliar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can foliar all over the top of the
leaves and underneath.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm following these because when
they're not really these are all still in
[SPEAKER_05]: the shade.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and we just made some cuts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like to just I always like to just
add a little bit of nutrients where the
[SPEAKER_05]: cuts are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, this is just there's so many ways
to do things, you know, and these are just
[SPEAKER_05]: ways that we're doing this.
[SPEAKER_05]: The organics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: These are the ways we realize that work
for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so this is this is one of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now you have some clean plants ready to
be trellis clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, they look good.
[SPEAKER_05]: They look really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm interested to see what that one does.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's bag up three.
[SPEAKER_05]: So.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is number three.
[SPEAKER_05]: So and already you can see how fast once
they're cut, how fast they remember that
[SPEAKER_05]: one we were just doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this was maybe that one we snipped,
went straight to the bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one we waited like five minutes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, if that, you know, and you can see
the water is already starting to drain
[SPEAKER_05]: out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is this is definitely a sensitive
situation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to make sure we get them where
they need to be as soon as possible,
[SPEAKER_05]: because they will perk up.
[SPEAKER_05]: They will perk back up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you can see already the leaves are
beginning to to curl out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Losing water, so we want
[SPEAKER_05]: to just have a little SPF left in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need the intense, dramatic music.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it is a race, the race for time
right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're going to do is just kind
of dip, dip that bottom into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Put her out of the sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool her down right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: It could be a him.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this one, I think, can go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a hermy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, we're.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Hermes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely is not what you want,
because sometimes when you when you look
[SPEAKER_05]: at the top and you're going, all right,
I got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a female and making you that five.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so even though the plant is starting
to flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: You still want to look at the lower parts
of the plant, because that's really where
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to see her hermaphrodite
traits.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's one of the reasons why we
cleaned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so we can try to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are we looking?
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're looking at when you're trying
to look for males or hermaphrodites,
[SPEAKER_05]: you start don't start the top,
start the bottom.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so because that's really where the
shaded area is really where hermaphrodites
[SPEAKER_05]: grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where their traits are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you're walking and you just kind
of look to the top, you go, oh,
[SPEAKER_05]: wow, it's flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have no seeds, no male traits or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: You walk away.
[SPEAKER_05]: You think you've done an inspection,
but really you got to get low and you got
[SPEAKER_05]: to just kind of look at all your corners
really carefully.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it is something that you really
have to be aware of, especially growing
[SPEAKER_05]: from seed, because you could ruin the
signs of hermaphrodites.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like a flower, but then
there's male parts, essentially balls
[SPEAKER_05]: coming out from that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if those pop, then your whole crop
will turn become seeded.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it essentially ruins the entire
crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So hermaphrodites are I mean, if you got a
male and that pops, well, then it could
[SPEAKER_05]: possibly be a fun experiment for next
round.
[SPEAKER_05]: But hermaphrodites are something you do
not want breeders and growers definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, is that is that three?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, that's three as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep, two on each.
[SPEAKER_01]: What was this in the little one?
[SPEAKER_01]: That was this one here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The single number two.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so herms are no, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: And breeders should really.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then are there seeds more likely to
have hermaphroditic traits as well?
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if a hermy pollinates a bunch of
other plants versus a male pollinating a
[SPEAKER_05]: bunch of females, you're going to get
herms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those seeds will also.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're going to be like propagating.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's Herman, Herman after Herman.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's really.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, some will tell you different,
but I.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be, you know, go,
you know, that's why herms are the worst.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you have a male and you don't
see it, which they're really easy to tell,
[SPEAKER_05]: herms, herms sneak up on you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and I had one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very sad.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: This is number four.
[SPEAKER_05]: Four.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number four.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, let me get a bigger bag.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, herms are really a.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're definitely problem causers.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's just going to be a little
shorter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like, but sometimes just got to work
with the.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I got to use these big bags for.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking clones off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so growing from seed is definitely
got to just kind of be on top of the
[SPEAKER_05]: garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, walk the garden, inspect the
garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's a lot of fun because you
can get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, at a homegrown scale, it's like
totally manageable.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's easy to do exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really fun with times for plants for
and then.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, and if you're growing with seed,
you know, I like to grow kind of at least
[SPEAKER_05]: 25, sometimes 50 percent more plants,
because it sets you up for if you have
[SPEAKER_05]: males, you still have the plant count that
you need.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just put number four in this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's fit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, just what I'll do is I got a bigger
one here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah, we definitely want to get these
to where they want to put a little of that
[SPEAKER_05]: in here, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right away.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know, the ways we're doing it
right here are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, number four.
[SPEAKER_05]: Number four.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a professional backyard outfit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We run a tight ship back here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Windex for plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom actually controls six houses on this
block and he's running indoor grows and
[SPEAKER_02]: all six.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one helicopter was an alternating
porn shoot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there there you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: You got a you got a couple of Tom clean
around over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got some cleaned up plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got one that's going to be pretty
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't want I haven't water for two
days knowing you were coming.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your your watering is fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, these beds are so they're really
nice because you just don't need to walk.
[SPEAKER_05]: They retain so well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why we have the granular in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're always going to get some sort of
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants, you know, when I noticed after
we've put some other smaller beds together
[SPEAKER_01]: was this one is like really aerated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell when I go down, there's it's
like it's looser.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just more room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's denser in like and I assumed it was
your the soil that the castings are dense.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you don't really don't need
castings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Super dense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was your premium, your premium that
we didn't have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me, was it your premium?
[SPEAKER_01]: Soil that adds the the air, the room?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's actually the premium is
vegetable compost and worm castings and
[SPEAKER_05]: minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is it that makes this lighter than
I believe?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, on this one, we had the Berger,
which is a Pete was fluffed it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, you know, the Fox farm we used
on this one was the ocean forest.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, the happy frog is a little bit more
dense, a little more rich.
[SPEAKER_05]: It has more animal byproduct in it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where the ocean forest is more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I went and bought some ocean forest
and we use that in some of these other
[SPEAKER_01]: ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was it was must have been the
Berger.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, Berger.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do that with a lot of different
things, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you can blend a Fox farm with a with
a basement mix or something just to fluff
[SPEAKER_05]: it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just that's all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, I blend sometimes I blend
a 707 with the OG planting mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the other day we needed
something on the fly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really couldn't wait for hydro stores.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the nursery down the line sent us some
pro and happy frog.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go in a hydro store,
what's a good a good aerating brand?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like I like to use root 707.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like that one a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the and what's the percentage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that like a 20 percent that you add
that with with the root 707?
[SPEAKER_05]: I like to add about 10 to 15 percent of
the of the premium mix in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that'll that'll just add your biology,
add your carbon nitrogen ratio 30 to one
[SPEAKER_05]: and then just make it some mineral roles
make it really, really healthy again with
[SPEAKER_05]: the biology.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that 707, I think, has a really good
aeration blend that goes well with
[SPEAKER_05]: castings and vegetable compost.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you start off with something
like Fox Farm and you don't have a Berger
[SPEAKER_05]: or another peat source or a royal source
or something to to kind of make that,
[SPEAKER_05]: as you're saying, fluffier, then you're
going to it's actually going to go more
[SPEAKER_05]: dense.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you'll water less.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, in some like this, either one
should be OK.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Again, there's different ways to do
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: But generally, that's our you know,
the fluffiness is so you can water a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit more as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, then the royal gold, I brought the
tupper because it's basically I told them
[SPEAKER_02]: we wanted to build our own soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just wanted something that is airy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that tupper is really nice to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so we got our.
[SPEAKER_02]: So first of all, with the with these
plants, like what do you like about each
[SPEAKER_02]: one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like start with plant number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I like I like the health.
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely like the health.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Except for after.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, after we're after we tore this one
up.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I like the health.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like the rigidity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the way the plants are.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like the color.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see the color is really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like what is this nice color.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell us that it's that about about these
plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the color indicates a lot,
because if you had any discoloration,
[SPEAKER_05]: you have deficiencies straight off the
bat.
[SPEAKER_05]: So right now, these being such as if the
nutrients nutrients, the soil,
[SPEAKER_05]: the sun, the water, everything being done
right now from when we started until this
[SPEAKER_05]: point has been done really well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this way, you know, you you you have,
you know, you the bend there is really
[SPEAKER_05]: nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll see, like if you grow with
sometimes if you grow with just synthetics
[SPEAKER_05]: with not a nutrient rich soil,
you actually get flatter, less turgid
[SPEAKER_05]: leaves.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'll still get good nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now when we had the triple digits like
a week ago, I got these little spots down
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They went away or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not on these down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And contrary to rumor, I haven't been
watering them during midday sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but what is this?
[SPEAKER_06]: You did that one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was earlier than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what is this when they're discovering
on the leaf?
[SPEAKER_05]: That it's not any bug.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, I don't think it's a leaf.
[SPEAKER_05]: Minor it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the only plan here that it
happened to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it also the autos and it was the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The triple digit days, then subsequent
outgrowths improved.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could just been really hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's been a really hot day,
but I don't see any indication of bugs or.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, any kind of miners do you have a
little something there?
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, you're outdoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's always going to be something.
[SPEAKER_05]: But good biology will keep the keep the
keep it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Keep that infection low.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know, there's so I think the
colors looking good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the structure on this one is
actually looking really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like this one a lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the nodes are a little bit tighter
than the other seeds and seeds generally
[SPEAKER_02]: are number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, Jesus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you turn those off?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that turn off at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you got to time these things to not
be at one in the afternoon either.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, we're getting a good foliar spray
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It cooled it down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have no idea when they're coming
on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's bring that back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a couple of things I would have done
maybe in the beginning was maybe top a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit sooner and then and then the
power of the energy would focus on these a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit, probably tightening up the
nodes.
[SPEAKER_05]: But generally from here up, it looks
really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why I say if you get into the
trellis, everything will kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: everything will like not slow down,
but stop its vertical growth and kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: start to go horizontal a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then if you if you trellis them,
all these interspacing nodes are going to
[SPEAKER_05]: start growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so you're going to give yourself 20 to
30, 40 more arms per plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we want.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a trellis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So should we do a trellis segment?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just I can go get trellises
easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, that's just kind of I really
just need to stick them in here and just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of you know, because it would
basically be the training.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ideally, like 45 degrees to a point just
before you break it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they like to be a little stressed,
but a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Stress on the on cannabis plants,
a certain type of stress there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you can I did something with this
guy who actually has a trellis system that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll bring over.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he he was like a professional bonsai
competition contestant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he was like, with bonsai, it's like
you're getting medieval on them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're bringing them just before death
on like all these like vicious growth.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Honestly, cannabis plants like you'll see
this you'll see a little one grown amongst
[SPEAKER_05]: them and like you'll treat her,
you know, a little bit less than this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's just so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know what?
[SPEAKER_05]: That little runty one usually is going to
turn out because it's just been.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: The adversity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every time you walk by them around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that was amongst these.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the I really like the formation of
this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like this is the run.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one was the run.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think these two are going to be your
your winner.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's always been this one's probably
going to be male balance, probably going
[SPEAKER_05]: to be male.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we'll you know, we'll get to that
point again.
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally be wrong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has more females.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're healthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're looking they're they're great.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then, Tom, if you didn't want to
trellis them, I would just get I would
[SPEAKER_05]: just get a couple more a couple more
sticks and time up.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this way they can they can they when
they do, they know they're getting some
[SPEAKER_05]: support.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they'll grow bigger buds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then and then it'll just kind of hold
everything in place.
[SPEAKER_05]: OK, so they're starting to get heavier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one way or another, you need to sort of
give them some support structures and
[SPEAKER_01]: training support.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom, we can do that next week.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So but if say we kept it with this with no
trellis, what would that mean of taller?
[SPEAKER_05]: It would just go taller.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: You'd probably end up with probably pants
about this big.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is not bad.
[SPEAKER_05]: About seven feet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably about that big once they once
they're flowering.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: About that big.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still below the fence.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I like it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fun to kind of see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I just downloaded all the regs.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom, are you excited?
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's only one thing, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have some autos that will be ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, let's look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's look at these.
[SPEAKER_02]: They should.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll start flowering because even
though they're in a different environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been following all the same feeding
regimen with these.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, these look great.
[SPEAKER_05]: The structure is great.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like how they're stout.
[SPEAKER_05]: They probably have a little more indica in
them, given that that stoutness.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, the color is looking great.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've done a great job, Tom.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're they're really looking good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in terms of stunting, cutting,
trimming back and then and then these ones
[SPEAKER_05]: over there on the autos, I would leave
like on the autos, I would probably just
[SPEAKER_05]: do very, very minor cuts, maybe some just
with the hands, just kind of some of these
[SPEAKER_05]: little ones.
[SPEAKER_05]: But with things with autos is,
you know, autos really need to remain
[SPEAKER_05]: stress free.
[SPEAKER_05]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, they're really designed to be
stress free, at least at least in my
[SPEAKER_05]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, is this its final home?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is it's this.
[SPEAKER_05]: This should be.
[SPEAKER_05]: This should be because, again,
the stress.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I've seen I've seen people
purchase thousands of autos from a
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: They bring them to a place.
[SPEAKER_05]: They give it just a little bit of stress
and then they go into flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know from there, that's premature.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you you'd like to at least get as
much veg out of them as possible because
[SPEAKER_05]: they tend to flower a little bit early.
[SPEAKER_05]: But from seed, once that seed is planted,
it's a home and you want to you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: keep the autos stress free.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they look great.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I put them on these little
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wouldn't pick this up because every
time you do, you shift the dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now none of the dirt shifts because
they're on their little.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you are so delicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really trying to be a gentle lover.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a great job.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great job, Tom.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking really healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's now, by the way, with the amount of
porn you've watched is your wife like,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, Thomas, you'd be surprised.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, Thomas, where'd that move come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I have watched a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Should we throw this together real quick?
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a good gig.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, she didn't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grassroots is always loyal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beds always like these beds here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, OK.
