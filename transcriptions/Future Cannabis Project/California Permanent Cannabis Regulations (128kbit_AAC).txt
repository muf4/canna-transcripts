[SPEAKER_01]: We were talking about the politics of real
estate on my part and situating yourself
[SPEAKER_01]: in a multi-tenant unit and getting
approval of an association and vetting
[SPEAKER_01]: CCNR bylaws.
[SPEAKER_03]: CCNRs.
[SPEAKER_03]: People forget all the time the importance
they think of those and the limitations of
[SPEAKER_03]: those.
[SPEAKER_03]: And landlords misrepresent and put into a
lease, you know, that you've acknowledged
[SPEAKER_03]: and received the CCNRs and that they
shouldn't be a problem and then forget
[SPEAKER_03]: that certain tenants are in the
association that may in fact have a
[SPEAKER_03]: problem with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of the sudden you're in a
pickle where you can't get the property
[SPEAKER_03]: authorizations that you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this has got to be understood not just
by operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think quite often landlords may perhaps
be in a position to misrepresent or
[SPEAKER_01]: mischaracterize what exactly the
opportunity is there for tenants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also from the perspective of municipal
authorities, they quite often are looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at an application that looks good on its
face.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say most notably back in Santa
Ana, based on the initial lottery
[SPEAKER_01]: applicants, there was one I believe
prominent rapper with a veteran status in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis community who shall not be
named.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's my understanding that there was
an association that also prevented him
[SPEAKER_01]: from opening on time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we can talk about what needs to go
into a lease, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the state wants to see that not only
are you doing cannabis operations,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that the specific cannabis operation
and the specific commercial cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: activity you're conducting at that
facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've had as the annual licenses go
forward, landlords holding hostage,
[SPEAKER_03]: these express notarization forms that you
need in order to be processed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can ask for more money.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can ask for equity because at the end
of the day, you're stalled and can't move
[SPEAKER_03]: forward without these.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you don't build that into the lease,
that says this is exactly what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any and all necessary documentation that I
may need as I continue with this process,
[SPEAKER_03]: even during renewals, sometimes the cities
ask for updated notarized proof of
[SPEAKER_03]: ownership and acknowledgement of what
you're doing at that facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of a sudden you go back to the
landlord and ask for this information and
[SPEAKER_03]: they say, well, I didn't agree to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's going to cost you X and you
have no maneuverability.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think these are going back to the
ABCs of cleaning up your all of your
[SPEAKER_03]: documents that you need now that we know
exactly what an annual application is and
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no temporary relief.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's this expiration of all of
these temporary permits, which we can also
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: When should you apply if you're an
operator?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's this nice poison pill that
the agencies gave by saying you have some
[SPEAKER_03]: operators until August to get done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it was taking CDFA is a great example
for four to eight weeks to process a
[SPEAKER_03]: temporary permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Primarily time dedicated towards the
science team vetting a lot of the premise
[SPEAKER_01]: diagrams and water quality control program
membership participation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was understandable that that was
perhaps a high hurdle for many or a filter
[SPEAKER_01]: for many applications to have to meet
before moving forward with their
[SPEAKER_01]: temporaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's very interesting how the
licensing authorities and the staff
[SPEAKER_01]: assigned are going to be able to process
annuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's this provisional license
type that we understand is there in
[SPEAKER_01]: statute and they're in theory,
but we haven't yet seen them being issued.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, with provisional,
it's a whole, even though it's not an
[SPEAKER_01]: annual, it's a whole different kettle of
fish because it does require participation
[SPEAKER_01]: within the metric system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And CEQA compliance in order for you to
get one.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you weren't already going through
your CEQA process and you're somewhere
[SPEAKER_03]: they like LA city of San Diego or city of
Long Beach where there was no local
[SPEAKER_03]: authorization with regard to CEQA,
there was no determination that was made.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was no secondary land use
discretionary action that would trigger
[SPEAKER_03]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not engaged actively in CEQA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that is more of a concern from the BCC
camp who in their permanent regulations
[SPEAKER_03]: added five pages and two new forms with
regard to CEQA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those of you who don't know what
that lovely acronym is, that's the
[SPEAKER_03]: California Environmental Quality Act.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you're going through that and
you want a provisional, which we know only
[SPEAKER_03]: two out of the three agencies are even
considering, and that's BCC and CDFA,
[SPEAKER_03]: you need to be dealing with those issues
and you need to be engaged actively and
[SPEAKER_03]: early with the agency.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, you're going to be put to the
back of that licensing agents pile.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it's taking four to six weeks to
process and you have to go back and forth
[SPEAKER_03]: with that agency, if you wait and you're
terminating in August and you don't start
[SPEAKER_03]: until May, you may not get processed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're not processed, there is no
extension of a temporary.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a shutting down of your business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to start that engagement
early.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think operators are
understanding or heeding that warning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they get backed up and you don't
get that approval, there is no other
[SPEAKER_03]: requirement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, or mechanism for you to rely on
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you are in process with the locality
and you're getting your CUP, the time to
[SPEAKER_03]: start your annual is once you get that CUP
and you're going through TIs, you can go
[SPEAKER_03]: back and forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have a great conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, with the regulators to say,
is this lawful?
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I putting this wall here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I designing this correctly?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because otherwise, when they come,
they can say you need to redo and that
[SPEAKER_03]: means you're shutting down and not getting
your permit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So active, early, continuous engagement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do not rely on that temporary taking you
out and not starting the process until
[SPEAKER_03]: four to five weeks before, because all
you're doing is putting yourself in a pot
[SPEAKER_03]: of boiling water that you may not be able
to get out of.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other timing issue, and as it connects
to CEQA from a different perspective on
[SPEAKER_01]: the issue of environmental authorization,
is also going to occur this summer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe July 1st is the final date
with which municipalities can offer their
[SPEAKER_01]: complete comprehensive ordinance and not
be required to do a programmatic review of
[SPEAKER_01]: their cannabis framework at the local
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is due to a compromise that was
embedded in SB 94, which unified the Prop
[SPEAKER_01]: 64 elements with the prior MCRSA elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you see is many jurisdictions
were blissfully passing ordinances
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking that the very difficult work for
doing a complete CEQA analysis or an
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental analysis of some sort on
their local program was not necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that extension is contingent upon a
couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, the discretionary review has to be
pushed down onto the project level,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has been a very high burden for many
applicants to clear, particularly with
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you have all of a sudden the need to
do biological, archaeological assessments,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously water is going to be an issue,
as well as looking at granular elements of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cultivation plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of engagement and engagement,
not just with the state authorities,
[SPEAKER_01]: but engagement also with your local
authorities, I think it's helpful to
[SPEAKER_01]: consider that we've only seen extinction
level events happen to operators thus far
[SPEAKER_01]: or prospective operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it could be the case that we're seeing
extinction level events at the municipal
level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where municipalities that may have in good
faith been thinking that they were going
[SPEAKER_01]: to wait until other municipalities had
begun to suss out how to regulate it and
[SPEAKER_01]: waited until state regulations became a
little bit more solidified before moving
[SPEAKER_01]: forward with their local program.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, if they haven't gone through
their planning commission, and if they
[SPEAKER_01]: haven't gone through their local council
approval process, and if they haven't
[SPEAKER_01]: completed this by July 1st, keep in mind
that quite often June city councils go
[SPEAKER_01]: dark and don't have any meetings
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they have not completed this
comprehensive ordinance process by July
[SPEAKER_01]: 1st, that may extend enormously the amount
of effort necessary to develop a municipal
[SPEAKER_01]: ordinance framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it could cost upwards of several
million dollars to do the appropriate
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental analysis on ordinance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And perhaps if you look at some of the
CEQA analyses that are happening at the
[SPEAKER_01]: county level in either Yolo or Santa
Barbara, those are very extended
[SPEAKER_01]: processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I frankly think that a lot of
municipalities may just wash their hands
[SPEAKER_01]: and say, we don't want to do this
environmental review of an ordinance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that could be yet another extinction
level event that we haven't even talked
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to clarify, do you mean an extinction
level event for operators who are hoping
[SPEAKER_00]: to work in that municipality or for the
municipality's tax revenue?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's for both.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: For municipalities that may have
anticipated permissively granting licenses
[SPEAKER_01]: and may have even passed a local tax
anticipating those revenues.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they don't have their ducks in a
row on their ordinance by July 1st,
[SPEAKER_01]: it will be extremely difficult for them to
pass an ordinance to allow for those tax
[SPEAKER_01]: revenues to manifest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They couldn't just simply push off the
environmental review onto the individual
[SPEAKER_03]: projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: At that point, they would need to take
review of their actual ordinance.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in that, it's important to note that
in counties that cultivate, it's easier.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can, in fact, if they want,
tear off of the programmatic EIR that was
[SPEAKER_03]: done for CDFA at the state level.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the one acre cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the one acre cap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: But both Santa Barbara and I believe Yolo
found differently findings than the
[SPEAKER_03]: programmatic EIR.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's interesting is those
jurisdictions that want to engage in
[SPEAKER_03]: activities from CDPH, manufacturing,
or BCC, more importantly, cannot tear off
[SPEAKER_03]: of an environmental review document that
was produced by the state because the
[SPEAKER_03]: state produced a negative declaration that
no impacts, potentially concerning
[SPEAKER_03]: impacts, would apply.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you are, in fact, only regulating,
let's say, distribution and non-storefront
[SPEAKER_03]: delivery, well, you've just gotten
yourself into a sticky wicket with an
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental impact because you are
putting a tremendous amount of cars and
[SPEAKER_03]: light duty trucks on the road that
potentially has a significant impact that
[SPEAKER_03]: needs to be addressed from an air quality
perspective and from a traffic
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so now it's not just the individual
projects, but the project as a whole that
[SPEAKER_03]: these localities need to look at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're an operator working in one
of these localities that is starting to
[SPEAKER_03]: come online with a process, remind them
that you need an environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: determination, that it's somewhere along
the line there needs to be a discretionary
[SPEAKER_03]: action that leads the city to give your
project an environmental determination,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's a negative declaration,
whether it's an exemption applies,
[SPEAKER_03]: or whether there needs to be an NOD or an
NOE situation, because you can take that
[SPEAKER_03]: to the agencies and show that you've
complied with CEQA.
[SPEAKER_03]: Without it, you're sort of looking
backwards and maybe needing to do an
[SPEAKER_03]: environmental assessment of your already
existing business in which you're able to
[SPEAKER_03]: then get your annual license.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since we said that provisionals are
probably going to be allowed, although we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know, from CDFA to BCC, part of a
provisional is that you're engaged in a
[SPEAKER_03]: CEQA process.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is one of the triggering events.
[SPEAKER_03]: So CEQA, this silent killer that is
coming, can be an extinction level event
[SPEAKER_03]: that most people haven't been paying
attention to and have simply sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: passed it along.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's an annual requirement at the
state level.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not so much thinking about it locally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although to be fair, it was perhaps
difficult for many people to begin the
[SPEAKER_01]: determination, particularly I'm thinking
of one business model that let's go back
[SPEAKER_01]: to the annual regulations, excuse me,
the permanent regulations and the idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: dynamic delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you really assess?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you do a vehicle trip analysis if
you don't understand the frequency with
[SPEAKER_01]: which orders are placed and whether that
driver is required to drive back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: hub or they're allowed to get a phone call
every 30 minutes within a 30 minute time
[SPEAKER_01]: period and be able to continue on to the
next destination in a dynamic fashion?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult, I would argue,
to begin a vehicle trip analysis until,
[SPEAKER_01]: frankly, until those regulations were
announced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still don't know whether they'll be
challenged in any sort of a litigation or
[SPEAKER_01]: any sort of an appeal process by some of
the interested parties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that wasn't taken into consideration
in the BCC's initial assessment of their
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dynamic delivery came out after the NAGDEC
and I would think it would have an impact
[SPEAKER_03]: on their own internal environmental review
documents.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we see a lot of additional CEQA cases
that are popping up around the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're going to see them utilize
more.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're utilized both by opposition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think from a favorable standpoint,
we saw a lot of bans and urgency
[SPEAKER_03]: ordinances.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would argue that if you have
proliferation of a black market in your
[SPEAKER_03]: city or an illicit market in your
jurisdiction, that you could use CEQA to
[SPEAKER_03]: say that you are actively not addressing
the problem and that could change your
[SPEAKER_03]: baseline and have a significant impact to
not regulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we may see CEQA flipped around from
something that the opposition is using to
[SPEAKER_03]: stall or prevent regulation to something
that is empowering regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opening up cities, unlocking cities.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be really interesting for
me to see how that's being utilized.
[SPEAKER_03]: But work with a good CEQA attorney or
somebody familiar with CEQA because
[SPEAKER_03]: there's magic language in CEQA that how
you draft something to fall into a
[SPEAKER_03]: categorical or statutory exemption if one
were to apply.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then working with a good environmental
engineering consulting firm to get an air
[SPEAKER_03]: quality study that is certified by an
engineer to get a traffic study.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are all things that you should be
accounting for in your budget process of
[SPEAKER_03]: going through an application.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think that that's ever been
called out before.
[SPEAKER_03]: As clearly for operators and that may put
you in a situation to get behind the eight
[SPEAKER_03]: ball because a full CEQA review,
as any CEQA or land use developer will
[SPEAKER_03]: tell you, can be three months real
favorably all the way out to 12 months or
[SPEAKER_03]: longer, depending on what pushback you get
and what findings are made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while you may be in the process of the
land use permitting authorization process
[SPEAKER_01]: at the local level, and that gets you in
good standing obviously to continue
[SPEAKER_01]: forward with the state licensing
authority, at the end of the day with the
[SPEAKER_01]: land use processing authority,
should it not be appealed and should it
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately be approved, quite often,
particularly if it's something along the
[SPEAKER_01]: lines of a conditional use permit or a
minor use permit, there are then obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: conditions attached, conditions of
operation with some jurisdictions having
[SPEAKER_01]: condition monitoring programs that are an
additional line item that you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: factor into consideration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of those conditions may also have
additional costs associated with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm familiar with a couple of areas where
if you are in a really sweet spot,
[SPEAKER_01]: logistics wise, and that you are just off
of some sort of a highway or just off of
[SPEAKER_01]: some sort of a thoroughfare, there could
very realistically be road mitigation fees
[SPEAKER_01]: offset that are embedded within the
conditions on the project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is yet another line item that
frankly, unfortunately, cannabis operators
[SPEAKER_01]: all too often are deemed second class
citizens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So other business models out there in
California, a florist delivery service may
[SPEAKER_01]: not have to pay a road mitigation fee,
but you better be assured that the kitchen
[SPEAKER_01]: sink is going to be billed towards a
cannabis delivery operator simply because
[SPEAKER_01]: of, well, we believe that these operators
are made out of money, so we might as well
[SPEAKER_01]: bill them left, right, and center.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peter, do you have anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: You look like you have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have some audience questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, even better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know that was happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may know Susan Sorrez.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, good friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Susan, happy birthday.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually, so she has an event question,
but I want to turn it into, if we think of
[SPEAKER_00]: all the different license categories,
can you talk about like, so let's start
[SPEAKER_00]: with event organizers, but then move down
the line, like one or two big changes or
[SPEAKER_00]: confirmations in the permanent regs that
affects that license category and what
[SPEAKER_00]: you're hearing from operators in that
license category of either, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: shit, or this is great, or like,
so let's start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love events.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hold on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her specific question is, and then get
into the broader event stuff and then
[SPEAKER_00]: retail and delivery, but what does,
quote, local authorization mean in regards
[SPEAKER_00]: to events?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Susan, just for your birthday,
I think it's an interesting conversation
[SPEAKER_03]: that we're starting to see a lot of cities
grapple with, especially getting closer to
[SPEAKER_03]: 420 and wanting to have compliant 420
events.
[SPEAKER_03]: San Francisco yesterday was just dealing
with this issue and is local
[SPEAKER_03]: authorization, can that just be a simple
letter?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can that be that the state or the city
says, yes, we're giving you local
[SPEAKER_03]: authorization to do this event in this
place and it's a pilot program?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, they get through regulation because
as you have that 60 days that you need to
[SPEAKER_03]: notify the BCC for, we've got this big
industry holiday coming up and what a
[SPEAKER_03]: great opportunity to show how AB 2020
works and how you do a compliance
[SPEAKER_03]: compliant event versus having a bunch of
non-compliant events because there's no
[SPEAKER_03]: mechanism that's there for an event
organizer to go through the process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that's very much an engaged
conversation that needs to happen per
[SPEAKER_03]: local jurisdiction and that local
authorization is not defined other than to
[SPEAKER_03]: be given the authority to do something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we're going to find this
specifically interesting with the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation clarifications.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that local authorization look
like?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can jump around back to events,
but I think this is a nice segue.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you were a cultivator that had multiple
licenses, maybe only two, not 10 or 20 or
[SPEAKER_03]: 80, where you were aggregating your
nursery and your processing and now all of
[SPEAKER_03]: a sudden you're a small fish versus a big
fish and you still need to have either
[SPEAKER_03]: separate processing for your three
premises versus a much larger where you
[SPEAKER_03]: already have that designated, can the
local jurisdiction who said you can do
[SPEAKER_03]: nursery and processing just give you local
authorization and you get a state permit
[SPEAKER_03]: for the activity without getting an
identifiable permit because none of those
[SPEAKER_03]: local jurisdictions had a processor
license type when they first agreed to
[SPEAKER_03]: give you your cultivation license
activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if local authorization is as simple as
them calling and they local jurisdiction
[SPEAKER_03]: verifying or giving you a letter versus
having an ordinance, that will go more
[SPEAKER_03]: favorably both from an event standpoint
and from a cultivation standpoint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back with events though, I really like the
retail to retail transfer because does
[SPEAKER_03]: that allow you to send your product back
from your temporary retail location to
[SPEAKER_03]: your brick and mortar retail location?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because at the Emerald Cup, Lori
specifically said, well, I don't think it
[SPEAKER_03]: was the intent transported by the
distributor because it's just retail to
[SPEAKER_03]: retail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it says by the other acts of this
division.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would mean that a distributor
would need to do it, but that you could
[SPEAKER_03]: send it back from your temporary retail
hub to your retail hub because it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: say just that's under the control of the
same licensee.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's going to give a lot more
flexibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's presuming that you do indeed
have an event and that you do indeed have
[SPEAKER_01]: a compliant event.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do with excess product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully you don't have that problem at
the end of your event.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've made good sales and everybody had a
great time with the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how do you host first a compliant
event?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all too often I'm looking at a lot
of local ordinances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why I'm talking about local
ordinances is because of the dual
[SPEAKER_01]: licensure structure that requires that
local authorization first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, many ordinances do call
out specifically and exclude the
[SPEAKER_01]: possibility of having a cannabis event of
any sort.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there's many other local
ordinances that if we can go back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: CEQA conversation, and look at what the
impact, what the impact upon the
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood, what the impact upon
traffic, is this really a different event?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is a cannabis event different than,
for instance, a wedding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is a cannabis event different than,
for instance, a back mitzvah?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, is this really anything so out of
the ordinary looking at it purely from the
[SPEAKER_01]: neighborhood impact and the community
impact?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for communities that may be amenable,
I'm wondering whether there could be some
[SPEAKER_01]: configuration of a local authorization
that could sort of tear off of the impacts
[SPEAKER_01]: anticipated from other event permitting
pathways that are available for
[SPEAKER_01]: non-cannabis events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because keep in mind, this is not the only
party at play.
[SPEAKER_01]: There also has to be a licensed retailer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There has to be a licensed distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the perspective of the locality,
there is an abundance of regulation that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be attached to this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we all know that jurisdictions have
pushed for AB 2020 because not all
[SPEAKER_01]: jurisdictions have state-owned DAA or
county fairgrounds within their
[SPEAKER_01]: jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even if they do have in their
jurisdictions, sometimes there's a dispute
[SPEAKER_01]: as towards who has jurisdiction over those
properties to authorize and or prohibit
[SPEAKER_01]: events to go forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So none of these cities are ready for the
implementation of AB 2020, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: bill that Pamela referred to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That expands the scope of permissible
venues to any locally authorized venue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would really like to see
municipalities to not overthink this and
[SPEAKER_01]: to simply tear off of existing event
production pathways, acknowledging that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in and of itself is not what's
being regulated or permitted.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an event with a quantity of a
headcount of persons and cars and impact
[SPEAKER_01]: and look at it from that way rather than
something that's so exotic that it need be
[SPEAKER_01]: considered.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to say familiarity breeds
comfortability and they all have events.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no city out of the 482 cities and
58 counties in the state of California
[SPEAKER_03]: that does not have an events rhetoric
built in to their municipal regulatory
[SPEAKER_03]: authority.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you just put a widget where a widget
goes, then this is going to be a much
[SPEAKER_03]: easier pathway.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's important because it also serves
as a conduit to show what compliance
[SPEAKER_03]: sales, education and consumption look like
that all of a sudden, if you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: positive event experience, you may then be
more open to regulating all aspects of the
[SPEAKER_03]: supply chain, specifically retail,
because we're going to have an
[SPEAKER_03]: overproduction of the production side of
the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we have retail outlets throughout the
state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the events rhetoric can really help to
facilitate good conversations and
[SPEAKER_03]: education.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a new events committee at CCI A
we should probably talk about.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's an important committee
that people that are interested in this,
[SPEAKER_03]: both from an operational standpoint and
event organizers to be involved with so we
[SPEAKER_03]: can provide potential options,
avenues and draft language that's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: make this process easier and make the lift
easier for the cities, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're grappling with the taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're grappling with how you regulate
operators and how you go through this
[SPEAKER_03]: process to provide the tools and the
package and just going back to what event
[SPEAKER_03]: organizers should do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get your event organizer license.
[SPEAKER_03]: Locate your event location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Identify.
[SPEAKER_03]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Identify who your partners are and go to
the city with a comprehensive package that
[SPEAKER_03]: says this is what I want to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here are all the people that I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here is a proposed premise diagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's how I think we should do local
authorization and understand what the
[SPEAKER_03]: framework for events is already in that
jurisdiction you're operating in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sort of have an open conversation with
them so that you can get to a yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what's happening up north.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's certainly hopefully related to
the conversation that is being
[SPEAKER_01]: acknowledged statewide and is being
understood at the local level.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some rocky implementation
experiences, obviously, of things not
[SPEAKER_01]: moving forward as quickly as possible and
the unregulated market being dominant,
[SPEAKER_01]: frankly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, obviously, with the sun
setting of the SB 420 clause that allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: for the collective sharing of medical
cannabis amongst qualified patients,
[SPEAKER_01]: that in the situation of events,
obviously, there's been local SESH events
[SPEAKER_01]: and other sort of collective consumption
events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frankly, cities should acknowledge that
they might have messed up and not been
[SPEAKER_01]: sufficiently bold in regulating the
reality of cannabis consumption in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think in the situation of local
SESHs that have now found themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: stranded without the affirmative defense
of SB 420, if we can treat these cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: events as something that already are
there, already exists, best to bring it
[SPEAKER_01]: into the light and to regulate it in a
reasonable fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do a rapid fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your favorite part for each place
of the site?
I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just wanted to say, so going back
towards the overproduction and the under
[SPEAKER_01]: availability of retail, I know that this
is like, let's talk about a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: about non-California things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that this is an express aim by
some of the folks up in Oregon with the
[SPEAKER_01]: New Revenue Coalition.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that they're a couple years ahead
of us in some of their implementation,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we might as well learn from other
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know very much that Oregon has
overproduced quite a lot due to their
[SPEAKER_01]: small population size, but great growing
conditions in southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the New Revenue Coalition up there has
promoted on-site consumption lounges and
[SPEAKER_01]: events as an express way of getting rid of
a lot of this regulated supply in a
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated fashion.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's bring back the farmers markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do a rapid fire.
Let's do a rapid fire.
Let's do a rapid fire.
Let's do a rapid fire.
