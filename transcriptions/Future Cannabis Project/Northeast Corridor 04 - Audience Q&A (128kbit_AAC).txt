[SPEAKER_09]: Let's open it up to Q&A.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, what do you guys, I mean,
we've kind of covered most of the major
[SPEAKER_09]: issues within the industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: What questions do you have for our panel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_09]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we heard a lot of negative talk about
mom and pop shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm curious to hear your perspective on
what would be a good segment to get into
[SPEAKER_01]: for potential small businesses,
especially in the New York, New Jersey
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, so the question has to do with entry
level.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're a smaller player, if it's
becoming really difficult for a small
[SPEAKER_09]: business person to enter into the
industry, what's the area that they could
[SPEAKER_09]: enter into?
[SPEAKER_04]: Laboratory testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's state mandated.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every product's got to go through a
laboratory to be tested for purity and
[SPEAKER_04]: that it has the appropriate levels and
it's free from pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's state mandated.
[SPEAKER_04]: No matter how many businesses are out
there, they all got to go through the
[SPEAKER_04]: labs.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you still have to the laboratory
equipment and then hiring the scientists
[SPEAKER_09]: is expensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it seems like extraction is really
because you could buy an extra product in
New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: The states, the states like to keep that
firewall where they have the labs totally
[SPEAKER_04]: independent from.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in some states, in some states,
it's the state that does the testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are no independent labs like I think
it's in Pennsylvania that think it's
[SPEAKER_05]: Pennsylvania, maybe DC.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are some places where the states
actually and I just learned this week that
[SPEAKER_05]: in Arizona, there is no license for
testing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of our customers said, we'd like to be
in your database.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, great.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have a license?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we don't need one in this state.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, OK, we'll put you in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so it differs by state.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Connecticut, you need a controlled
substances license.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you go look at all those license in
Connecticut, there are the police stations
[SPEAKER_05]: and the universities.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you find a couple of that seem to
be more corporate or just their own
[SPEAKER_05]: business.
[SPEAKER_07]: So but just can't transport your own
product.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't test your own product.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's you know, I mean,
to me, I feel like extraction.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could buy an extraction machine for
what about 60,000, 100,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you have a license to be right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then then there's obvious well
distribution.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that starts to become.
[SPEAKER_05]: But to the question about New Jersey in
New York, I think the hard part is those
[SPEAKER_05]: are still oligopolies.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's only a handful of licenses out
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in New York, the licenses are stacked.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if I give you a license in New York,
you have to grow, you have to manufacture,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you have to run five stores,
four stores.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have to do it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is no easy way for somebody to
say, hey, I want to do that, too.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I think in New Jersey,
it's the same way.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a stack license.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's vertically integrated by design.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every state's different, though.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like in Connecticut, they've stacked it
where you have to if you get a grow
[SPEAKER_05]: license, you have to manufacture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's four of those licenses.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now they're moving up to 18
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's just now we have one license that
actually managed to vertically integrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they did that on their own.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Cuomo proposal for New York very
much models the California distribution
[SPEAKER_04]: change where there's going to be
cultivator licenses, manufacturer license,
[SPEAKER_04]: distributor license, retail and laboratory
testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Manufacturer are the guys who take the raw
cannabis material.
[SPEAKER_04]: They extract it out and make a product or
oil or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought I heard that you have to keep
the grow and the retail separate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like right now, it's vertically
integrated.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was reading that Cuomo doesn't want
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He wants to grow separate.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was going to say he just wants a
different separation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's either New York or New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't remember which.
[SPEAKER_04]: But one of them in their proposal does
have that quirk where if you're a
[SPEAKER_04]: retailer, you can't have your own
cultivation license.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is I don't know what the rationale
behind it where Colorado, they have a
[SPEAKER_05]: specific license.
[SPEAKER_05]: It does just that, which is like a captive
license.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's every state is different and comes
up with their own peculiarities.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to say, at least the
California experience, the retail market
[SPEAKER_04]: is extremely competitive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the ways that like brands have
set themselves apart is to be like a
[SPEAKER_04]: really great cultivator, have a retail
location in your name where you can only
[SPEAKER_04]: get certain products like it's a sneaker
drop.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a line two blocks out there to
get the latest harvest.
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually have a cottage license.
[SPEAKER_05]: They call it a cottage license,
I think, in California for those kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: scenarios where people are really craft
growers and sellers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's going to change, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just so like wherever we are now in a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's certainly a lot of people
only want to be self-employed and don't
[SPEAKER_09]: want to work for someone.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I certainly respect that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm self-employed.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there's tons of jobs.
[SPEAKER_09]: You could check out Vangst, V-A-N-G-S-T.
[SPEAKER_09]: Indeed, actually, post-cannabis jobs now.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you look at some of the MSOs,
most of them have career sections on their
[SPEAKER_09]: websites, whether it's Acreage or IANTHIS,
CureLief, some of the New York's.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even locally, I think that one of our
clients, KDS Staffing, they're in New
[SPEAKER_05]: Jersey.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're a recruiting firm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've built out a cannabis practice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're nearby.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a question over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mary's List as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mary's List.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mary's List is a website.
[SPEAKER_02]: You open it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's for independent contractors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a website.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically, you can either sign up as an
employer or as an employee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's for basically everything,
mostly non-plant touching.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's for independent contractors.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Mary's List, independent contractors.
[SPEAKER_09]: Flower hire.
[SPEAKER_09]: OK, flower hire.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Another question?
[SPEAKER_08]: And this actually goes out to all four of
you.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'd love to know if you've heard anything
about Monsanto's role in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: industry as it relates to cultivator and
what type of protections.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, have you heard any government
officials talking about rolling out
[SPEAKER_08]: protections for cultivators, farmers,
and growers?
[SPEAKER_08]: Who do create a certain strain and being
able to own IP on that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Readers.
[SPEAKER_09]: Very good question about first starting
about Monsanto, but then really going into
[SPEAKER_09]: like patenting strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the conversation, I represent growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there is growing concern about
Monsanto taking their IP.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's actually something that's
happened in states like Washington and
[SPEAKER_08]: Oregon where that has occurred.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was out in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I know California, you may know better
than me, but they were talking about kind
[SPEAKER_09]: of creating in Humboldt County this
standard, which would be similar to what
[SPEAKER_09]: you see in the wine industry, that you can
only claim champagne is from the champagne
[SPEAKER_09]: area.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that you can only call yourself
Humboldt finest if you're from Humboldt
[SPEAKER_09]: County.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then it gets into the tour and,
you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that is what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that there's been a lot of
discussion about trying to patent
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabinoids and such GW pharmaceuticals
just got rejected on that.
[SPEAKER_09]: They tried to do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know different people have come out and
tried to patent different strains.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I don't know if they've been so
successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's hard to patent a plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think, you know, and we've also seen a
lot of while you can call something sour
[SPEAKER_09]: diesel that when they've tested the
cloning and all that, that they've
[SPEAKER_09]: determined that half the time when you
think you're buying, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: cherry diesel sour, it isn't even really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like with lab tests, it really has to go a
step further besides pesticides and
[SPEAKER_03]: contaminants and all this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they really have to figure out how
to really test for these strains that are
[SPEAKER_03]: genetic testing the whole package.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's a really long way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's this industry has a lot of growth.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a company out in Long Island that
does DNA mapping and they did it with
[SPEAKER_09]: cotton.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's how they determine what Pima
cotton is versus not Pima cotton and
[SPEAKER_09]: Egyptian cotton and all these cotton
varieties.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's what they done is they DNA
mapped it and that they're they're trying
[SPEAKER_09]: now to get into cannabis so that they can
map the cannabis plants and resolve that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know everything, Deborah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a reporter asked one of my
clients a question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you concerned or should growers be
concerned about if they come out and say,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, I made gelato, somebody else
accidentally making gelato and calling it
[SPEAKER_08]: something else.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it winds up being the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, do you ever does your grower have a
concern for that?
[SPEAKER_08]: And he kind of laughed like this person
really doesn't understand genetics or the
[SPEAKER_08]: plants because each plant is like a
fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that it's fascinating you're
saying DNA mapping company does have
[SPEAKER_08]: technology that does that for cotton
because the applications could probably in
[SPEAKER_08]: some past be probably over cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's the open cannabis project,
there's phylos, there's medicinal genomics
[SPEAKER_06]: out of Boston.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of DNA mapping going on.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it's good, bad, better.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, and I think that that's,
you know, there are some strains that are
[SPEAKER_09]: very popular, but you have to wonder,
is it just marketing?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it really the strain?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, I think that the one thing that
I really haven't seen a lot of work on was
[SPEAKER_09]: the THCV, which is the cannabis that
doesn't give you the munchies and
[SPEAKER_09]: apparently is extremely hard to extract.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't see it very often.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's the only one that I've heard about
that hasn't really had a lot of success.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was at a conference, I think in
Toronto, and they had a person who really
[SPEAKER_05]: was starting to talk about all the tests
and trials that were running in Israel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he shared the number of terpenes and
other elements that are in these plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he said they're like decades of
research left to do because there are so
[SPEAKER_05]: many interactions to try and figure out
based on what's in each of these sort of
[SPEAKER_05]: fingerprinted plants, as she said.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, there's so much work to do that
that there's gonna be a lot of research
[SPEAKER_05]: and hopefully a lot of great discovery,
but it's incredibly complex.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when people just sort of boil it down
to, oh, it's THC or CBD, they're missing
[SPEAKER_05]: out on the other 110 things that you need
to, yeah, the whole spectrum that you
[SPEAKER_05]: really need to look at.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the question has to do with vaping,
what we're hearing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I know that it's clearly becoming a
product of choice that the consumers are
[SPEAKER_09]: gravitating more towards vape products
that give you a mood description,
[SPEAKER_09]: sleep, relax, action, inspire,
whatever, versus a vape that is sour
[SPEAKER_09]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_09]: Apparently, that's where the shopping is
going.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's according to E's data that will be
coming out this week in a report that I
[SPEAKER_09]: have written that will publish on
Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I thought that was super interesting
that the sales are gravitating to that
[SPEAKER_09]: mood-related vape product versus the
strain-related vape product, and vape
[SPEAKER_09]: products are definitely on the rise and
overtaking the sales of flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at Debra's conference a couple months
ago, one of the speakers that you had
[SPEAKER_05]: there tracks, does a lot of market
research, like consumer-type market
[SPEAKER_05]: research, and her point was that there has
been such an increase in the number of
[SPEAKER_05]: vape companies, and the point was sort of
like, how many can the market support?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the specialization that you described
makes a lot of sense, because now the
[SPEAKER_05]: market is starting to specialize,
and certain ones will win out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think her point was, we have 485
vape companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you really want to be number 486,
and how will you differentiate yourself?
[SPEAKER_05]: Marketing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, but still, only a few will win.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the interesting thing that we're
seeing with vape companies and just
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturers in general is that in an
open, I'm going to call it as opposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: like a closed state like New York,
where it's a very small number of
[SPEAKER_04]: licensees, in an open state like
California, where there's hundreds or
[SPEAKER_04]: thousands of manufacturing license issued
and they're making oil, is that folks
[SPEAKER_04]: aren't ready for the level of
manufacturing hygiene practices that the
[SPEAKER_04]: state requires in order to maintain your
licenses, because we're transitioning from
[SPEAKER_04]: an industry where it was just a bunch of
guys in a warehouse with a machine
[SPEAKER_04]: processing cannabis flower, to now the
state's looking at, all right,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, is your facility design logical?
[SPEAKER_04]: What quality control measures are you
implementing in place to make sure that
[SPEAKER_04]: there's no cross-contamination or
allergens in your product?
[SPEAKER_04]: And for a lot of these folks, it's a huge
wake up call, because they're used to
[SPEAKER_04]: running retail shops, and now they're
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're putting hundreds of thousands of
vape cartridges into the marketplace,
[SPEAKER_04]: and with that comes products liability,
what happens when something goes wrong?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you do when you have to implement
a recall?
[SPEAKER_04]: We talk about this constant tension
between the multi-state operators,
[SPEAKER_04]: the big business, the deep pockets,
and then the regular people who are
[SPEAKER_04]: working within this industry, and that's
like a real point of regulatory failure
[SPEAKER_04]: that's going to happen, is that a lot of
these mom and pop manufacturers,
[SPEAKER_04]: they just aren't going to be able to keep
up with the quality control standards
[SPEAKER_04]: necessary to produce clean products and
put it into the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_09]: I would say, though, that it doesn't take
that big of an office or factory to
[SPEAKER_09]: produce this, because your extraction
machine is really not that big,
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's maybe the size of that bar area.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your biggest inventory area is where
you've got all your raw product.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's because it's so chunky and in all
these bins and such.
[SPEAKER_09]: Your scientists, your lab people,
it's really, I've been to many of these
[SPEAKER_09]: operations.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not that big, but they're churning
out tons and tons of vape, and a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: the big vape companies, private label for
a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_09]: So open vape, private labels for numerous
companies, they'll just come in and say,
[SPEAKER_09]: hey, I want, you know, green marker report
vape pen, and they're like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_09]: sure, you know, we're going to charge you
an arm and a leg to do it, but yeah,
[SPEAKER_09]: we'll do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they make your vape pen for you,
and they slap your label on it,
[SPEAKER_09]: and they distribute it for you,
and you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_09]: But of course, you've probably given up
50% of your revenue for them to do that,
[SPEAKER_09]: but you're immediately in the market,
and very easy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really super quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're paying through the nose for
that, but I'll tell you right now,
[SPEAKER_09]: they're a private company.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're doing over 100 million in sales a
year.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying that it's big business.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, they're about the only one I know
that has really said how much money
[SPEAKER_09]: they're making off of vape pens.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, they were early to the market.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were early on in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: They do a nice operation.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a really well-run company.
[SPEAKER_09]: They take very good care of their
employees, and they've had no desire to go
[SPEAKER_09]: public.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think they'll eventually go public just
because everybody's going to go public.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, why not?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I've worked hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've worked long, long hours, week after
week, month after month, year after year.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, I'm tired.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm ready to get out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that may be why they go
public.
[SPEAKER_09]: But listen, they've only had to raise
money once, and they did it with one
[SPEAKER_09]: investor.
What company?
[SPEAKER_09]: Open Vape.
[SPEAKER_09]: They bootstrapped.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's an incredible story.
[SPEAKER_09]: They bootstrapped, and now they're doing
over 100 million in sales a year.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they're really smart about loyalty
programs.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're really smart about working with
the budtenders.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have loyalty programs with the
customers.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have loyalty programs with the
budtenders.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they were one of the first companies
that figured that out.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now almost all the dispensaries have
loyalty programs, but I don't know that
[SPEAKER_09]: that many of the product companies do
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've talked to a bunch of them,
and I usually ask them if they do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does Papa and Barclay do that?
[SPEAKER_09]: Does Candescent do that?
[SPEAKER_09]: And most of them say no, and it's just
crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, why wouldn't you do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing we're seeing with vapes,
and here's your side business,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you don't have the capital to get a
license, is just counterfeiting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go on Alibaba now and buy the
packaging for any big vape brand in the
[SPEAKER_04]: United States, and they're being sold
wherever.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a low-quality product that they're
putting into it, but folks don't care.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some of these brands have built up such a
brand recognition and status symbol
[SPEAKER_04]: associated with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Folks just want to get it as cheaply as
possible to have the look.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've gone from counterfeit Yeezys and
counterfeit Gucci to counterfeit vapes
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a market and product security,
whatever that technology is going to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that folks know that they have the real
vape cartridge, because folks in
[SPEAKER_04]: California are losing a lot of money to
copycats.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not being sold in the retailers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're being sold on the streets in
unlicensed stores.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're being shipped to places where
cannabis isn't allowed, as if it were the
[SPEAKER_04]: real thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but as these markets mature,
they have to be sold legally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the point I'm making is that people
just want to have the look of the product,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's being counterfeited out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So people are willing to buy the bootleg
knockoff version of these manufactured
[SPEAKER_04]: products, because they don't want to pay
the cannabis tax and all the costs
[SPEAKER_04]: associated with the real thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why buy the $70 dosage pen when I can buy
the bootleg dosage pen for $25?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who knows what's in it?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's never been lab tested, but it's white
and it vibrates and it looks like dosage.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's like that weed van that you see
around Union Square.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, that thing is so illegal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's so right out in the open.
[SPEAKER_03]: It should be.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I've walked up to that van before and
just asked a few questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: The minute I started asking a couple of
questions, they were like, no,
[SPEAKER_09]: we don't sell that at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like when I first walked up, yeah,
we got that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then all of a sudden I'm like,
but you can't do that because that's
[SPEAKER_09]: illegal, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, no, no, no, we don't sell that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like and they're completely they're
blatant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just driving around like a humor
man, like sort of like, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like an ice cream truck.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Mr. Sophi.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing, though, like about these vape
products, from my experience, like a few
[SPEAKER_03]: of them are made in China and they're all
made in China.
[SPEAKER_03]: All the hardware really, really poor
quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're it's almost like you're
sucking in chemicals of some sort.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they're not healthy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's clear they're literally is a
health risk with some of these products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the ones that don't have that problem,
they leak.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had some just busted in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which markets?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I've gotten I've had this experience
pretty much across the board.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I mean, if you go to MJBiz,
the big conference in Vegas, God,
[SPEAKER_09]: there were there's so many Chinese
companies there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they their signs are all all in
Chinese.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like there's they hardly speak any
English.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some do.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't sell those products in the
markets, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have to sell to go through lab
testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's the actual cartridge is has
to be tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: The actual product I'm talking about,
like if you think of a Pez, the battery
[SPEAKER_03]: and the component that you actually put
the ceramic heating coils and such.
Oh, that's good.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have a question over here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, it's it's all it's actually
contributing to the conversation.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's something that's so interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm really glad you brought this up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Earlier this year, I represented a vitamin
date company.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they got reamed by the media because
press were talking about the coil in the
[SPEAKER_08]: bait and the concerns that that causes for
lung cancer or bubble mumps.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's not hit the cannabis industry
yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as a publicist, it kind of like blows
my mind that these reporters just like
[SPEAKER_08]: went after my clients and the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have to help out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's not hit cannabis or vapes yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so I think that anybody who is going
to have a vaporizer does need to be
[SPEAKER_08]: prepared.
[SPEAKER_08]: For that, because it will eventually
happen.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there is a way to kind of counteract
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the heating coils, depending on the
quality of the manufacturer, some of them
[SPEAKER_08]: are better than others.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, like, for example,
Juul, those heating coils are much
[SPEAKER_08]: stronger and harsher on the lungs than,
let's say, like a dose.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that her point, you know,
is that we still have a long way to go to
[SPEAKER_09]: know what is going to be the effect of all
these vape pens.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you've got a variety of products
because you do have like a dry material
[SPEAKER_09]: type of vape pen where you put the dry
material in and it heats it up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you have that combustion and
you're basically smoking a dry product,
[SPEAKER_09]: whether it's tobacco or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: But then like Pax Pax has the dry herb
product.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then you've got the actual vape pens
with the oil, which is a very different
[SPEAKER_09]: product, but very convenient.
[SPEAKER_09]: But, yeah, I don't think we've really seen
very many studies on the effects of these
[SPEAKER_09]: items.
[SPEAKER_09]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think we've gone over a lot.
[SPEAKER_09]: I thank my panel for being here on this
very cold night.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I thank you guys for showing up on
this very cold night.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think it's been very informative.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I check out remarkareport.com for the
best journalism.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unbiased.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unbiased.
Unbiased.
