[SPEAKER_02]: converting CBD to THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're developing procedures, SOPs around
that and then trying to build equipment to
[SPEAKER_02]: do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not something people commonly do
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is... Not commonly.
[SPEAKER_02]: People do do it and it can be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can take CBD and convert it to THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and I think that that's a big
future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't say that so lightly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe four people currently are doing
anything that it's on such a small scale
[SPEAKER_00]: and it doesn't actually work correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll get like half isomers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So half your oil will be like that
converted oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it will be some Frankenstein... A
lot of it is Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some Delta-8.
[SPEAKER_00]: So doing it correctly to where you get
a... Conversion from CBD to Delta-9 THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a consistent conversion too at a very
specific yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning like the amount of material that
gets converted is changing in so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the industry shaking, revolutionizes
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you think about those like tens of
hundreds of thousands of acres in Colombia
[SPEAKER_00]: and Chile that grow hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And imagine the implications that it makes
for when places actually start legally
[SPEAKER_02]: legalizing THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it takes how long to grow a plant and
then get it to... Because currently it's
[SPEAKER_01]: something that isn't really relevant
because you can't grow a hemp farm and
[SPEAKER_01]: then process and then convert it to THC
and sell it through the dispensing market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the future... Wait, not the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now the USDA just opined on that
anything, any compound because of the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: bill derived from a hemp plant is a legal
compound.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of the language in the farm
bill there needs no other congressional
[SPEAKER_00]: approval like THC from hemp and CBD from
hemp are perfectly legal compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that looks like, and I think if like
the Senate Majority Leader like McConnell
[SPEAKER_00]: who's been pushing hemp for a long time,
that is the back door to legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why cannabis probably isn't legal
on a federal level.
[SPEAKER_01]: That crafty Mitch McConnell.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a crafty old geezer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like the guy in every single
Scooby-Doo show, you know, at the end he's
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh well, yeah, you got me this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You dime kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you dime kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I understand correctly, you guys see
a future where the massive, massive
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of hemp fields being grown can be
converted to THC which could end up in my
[SPEAKER_01]: vape cartridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and actually people are now starting
to grow hemp for terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: If people are worried about flavors and
cannabinoid profiles, well flavor profiles
[SPEAKER_02]: can all be done through breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: You eventually isolate those and then you
can isolate the terpenes and then from
[SPEAKER_02]: there you grow different cultivars for
different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we start to isolate these
cannabinoids and then we can form them
[SPEAKER_02]: into a concentrate that is tailored with
the right concentration of cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: with the flavor profile that's all natural
and works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to say when we're
talking, I just want to semantics,
[SPEAKER_01]: all natural does not mean like terpenes
coming from another site.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually doesn't mean anything,
all natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it really means.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really no definition to all
natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no agreed upon definition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what it means to me versus you versus
McConnell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's subjective, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ideally, I mean cannabis and hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you first said all natural,
so what's your definition?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I was just saying all
natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a really stupid thing for me to
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't mean all natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: I meant cannabis derived or hemp derived.
[SPEAKER_02]: So terpenes coming from the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't mean all natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what it means to me versus you versus
McConnell.
