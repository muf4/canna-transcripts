[SPEAKER_01]: Just 12 days ago on September 14th,
at 7 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: in the morning, a simultaneous raid
occurred in Yellow County as well as three
[SPEAKER_01]: of the homes of the farmers on one of
these licensed facilities by an
[SPEAKER_01]: out-of-county task force called Tri-County
Drug Enforcement Team, or TRIDENT,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is an initiative of the Central
Valley High Intensity Drug Trafficking
[SPEAKER_01]: Area, or HIDTA.
[SPEAKER_01]: They came into Yolo County with a Placer
County warrant and kicked doors in and
[SPEAKER_01]: took down a half acre of a legally
licensed farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Don, can you tell us how you feel about
an outer jurisdiction law enforcement
[SPEAKER_01]: agency coming in and taking down something
that you permitted and gave your blessing
[SPEAKER_01]: for?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said that there were about 53 growers
that are going through the permitting
[SPEAKER_00]: process about half of them are in place,
and one in particular, a couple of them
[SPEAKER_00]: have been really shining stars.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look at us and they look for
guidance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever we tell them, this is how things
will work, they immediately comply.
[SPEAKER_00]: They set up the irrigation system,
set up the drainage.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make sure that they're doing all the
right things.
[SPEAKER_00]: They apply for the regional water quality
control board permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get all of it in place, and then
something like this happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that many of you here in this
room have heard this story or even had it
[SPEAKER_00]: happen to yourself or to somebody you
know, but it's pretty darn scary when you
[SPEAKER_00]: think of seven in the morning,
the front door is broken in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody says, I'm a law enforcement
official, open your door please.
[SPEAKER_00]: They break the door in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They show up in unmarked vehicles in four
different locations in three different
[SPEAKER_00]: counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: With guns drawn where there are little
kids involved and they handcuff people and
[SPEAKER_00]: put zip ties on them and they're throwing
people against walls and they're making
[SPEAKER_00]: them kneel on the ground and they're
interrogating them without giving them
[SPEAKER_00]: Miranda rights for hours after a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a terrorist activity if you think
about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just think about what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the meaning of terrorism,
what this means is they're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: instill fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tactics deliberately instill fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it comes at a time for us when we're
walking to monitor our ordinance and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: working to develop tweaks, things that we
might want to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now have this added dimension of,
well, what was the offense?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was there something that's being alleged
that is illegal that we didn't know about?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not hearing any specific charges
even.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, none of the people involved in
this incident have been charged with
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet 1,800 plants that are designed and
connected to a collective for medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose have been destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people involved are very shaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: So psychologically shaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thought they were doing all the right
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're deliberately working hard to make
sure they do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're still sorting this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to have this be done from this shadowy
group that comes in unmarked cars with no
[SPEAKER_00]: license plate indication and from another
county.
[SPEAKER_00]: From another county.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even Yolo County.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not part of this three county.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's El Dorado, Placer, and Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, led by a Placer county,
a district attorney and his strike force.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are still struggling to figure out
exactly what this was about and how it
[SPEAKER_00]: affects the people involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that the people involved are
very stunned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think of it as an act of terrorism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Don, you just called this an act of
terrorism by Trident.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm wondering, do you believe that
this will hinder your progress as your
[SPEAKER_01]: county is making very big strides in
crafting sensible regulations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that it sets up a whole
series of questions that we have been
[SPEAKER_00]: working to look at the whole cannabis
world through the eyes of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does this commodity work?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we support it in the same ways that
we've supported other agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: commodities?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we regulate it and so on?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, we have not talked about
revenues.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't looked at this from a taxation
purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're charging fees that we think will
absorb the cost and allow us to do some
[SPEAKER_00]: code enforcement for the shadowy
operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're kind of looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also been looking at more and
more the medicinal value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited because I want to see us
all look into the greater research
[SPEAKER_00]: possibilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want Yolo County to be a place where
that's a center of that kind of effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a center of activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we have a whole other series of
questions that we know will be asked by
[SPEAKER_00]: members of the board of supervisors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, really, was there something going on
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there something in the shadows that we
need to shy away from?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that to the degree that we
allow that fear to come from our community
[SPEAKER_00]: members or from the decision makers,
to the degree that we allow that to change
[SPEAKER_00]: our course, then the terror has succeeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think there is going to be some
discussion about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, I need to say,
this is how I feel about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're assured that this is an
interesting comment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're assured that the
investigation is still underway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that means it's not over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's something yet to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this great specter of maybe
there's some illegal act that we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know about yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I probably shouldn't even talk about
it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen the affidavit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't look like it's criminal what
they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now we have this specter that's
certainly going to change the conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: to some degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how or when.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got the call about this raid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a farm that I had helped consult
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really have to say, Yolo County
regulators rose to the occasion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they got on the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Ag Department got a hold of this
lead detective from this outside county
[SPEAKER_01]: task force and said, please stop chopping
down these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a licensed farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that lead detective said, whatever,
Ag guy, and hung up the phone on him.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these people really did rise up to try
to protect that farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just so proud of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please give it up for Yolo County.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
