[SPEAKER_00]: The worst thing about the NFL is being on
a weight trip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're playing in New England.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cold as hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got to get on a flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to fly all the way back
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys have seen
football players in person, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these guys are pretty big.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember my rookie year, I'm sitting
next to Tony Fanotti.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's about 6'8", 3'70".
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sitting next to the guy,
and he's got some edible candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked him, I was like, you know,
what are these for?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, oh, these are my little weed
candies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, well, why do you take it
out?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't take it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the other thing that I knew
about weed was bad, bad, bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's against the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he says, man, I need something that's
going to help me with this inflammation in
[SPEAKER_00]: my hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, because by the time the wheel's
up on this plane, my hand's going to swell
[SPEAKER_00]: up to twice the size.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally, I watched his body just
bloat up.
[SPEAKER_00]: He told me that he was taking a lot of
Percocets and Vicodins, and he was getting
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of bloating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've just seen what damage can be done
with opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that a lot of players were
taken like candy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our team physicians would just give you
whatever you needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, especially not before a game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Guys that couldn't sleep or whatnot,
they would sit there and give out
[SPEAKER_00]: Ambien's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's no, I mean, there's supposed
to be a protocol for prescribing somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: something like, what are the side effects
of this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Announce to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they have a contraindication with
other medications people are taking or
[SPEAKER_00]: predisposed positions that might cause a
psychotic break, which I took Ambien one
[SPEAKER_00]: time and one time only.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember taking it and I woke up in the
middle of the night and my room was in
[SPEAKER_00]: disarray and I didn't know what happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my roommate was sitting over on the
side of the room looking like,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the hell's wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I don't know what happened,
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happened?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you just woke up yelling,
screaming, and throwing the bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You threw this through the desk,
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what's wrong with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And come to find out that Ambien had
caused some type of issue in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what it was from,
but I was a straight A student my whole
[SPEAKER_00]: schooling career and always looked at
drugs as bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you hear all the stories about reefer
madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back in the day, your mom's saying,
oh, that's the gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it leads you to all this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to be dumb if you smoke
this or you take this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just kind of avoided it my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never really did any research on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't use my scientific mind to sort of
figure out what the possibilities could be
[SPEAKER_00]: from using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sort of go through my whole career
playing college.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people give NFL flack for what
they give the players.
[SPEAKER_00]: But college is 10 times worse because
you've got to keep your athletes out there
[SPEAKER_00]: making money for the school.
[SPEAKER_00]: And athletes are not getting compensated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are they doing when they can't get
access to the drugs is they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: find whatever's cheap on the street,
which you know what you get when you go on
[SPEAKER_00]: the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know when I was in college,
I was taking Celebrex for joint pain,
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get to the league.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were taking Vicodin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vicodin made me sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had to take because I was in pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there was no alternative for that
because at the time, you can't take any
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis products because it's against the
rules.
