[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to speak briefly about SB 1294
that's currently on the governor's desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have five days to get a signature on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully he will sign that bill,
but this is the most comprehensive,
[SPEAKER_00]: inclusive social equity diversity bill
ever introduced in the space in the last
[SPEAKER_00]: year and a half that we've been doing
bills as it relates to the legalization of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm honored to have worked with various
entities through this space to craft a
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of legislation that is inclusive,
a piece of legislation that has 10 million
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars appropriated in that bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only cannabis bill with money
allocated in there upon passage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also creates four new positions within
the Department of Cannabis to assist
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals with getting licensed,
dealing with the hurdles of being
[SPEAKER_00]: permitted, even some grants for help
startup funds to refurbish a building if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a comprehensive bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bill that's really important
because as we all have to admit,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's an industry that's nine months old,
but for the most part, it's white male
[SPEAKER_00]: dominated right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want it to look like California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want women, we want minorities,
we want our military, ex-military folks
[SPEAKER_00]: that have an opportunity in this space,
in this billion dollar space, but we have
[SPEAKER_00]: to do it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also mentioned I'm the co-author of SB
930.
[SPEAKER_00]: I chair Senate Baker and I know in the
last panel, they asked the question of
[SPEAKER_00]: will we see a cannabis banking bill again
or is that dialogue already happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will introduce a new bill next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone said it was narrow in scope.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's narrow in scope because you eat the
elephant one bite at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we came in and we asked for the world,
it would never happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: The banking industry, the federal
government, everybody would push back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to nibble at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we nibbled around the edges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We worked closely with Fiona Ma,
who's on the State Board of Equalization
[SPEAKER_00]: and hopefully going to be our next charger
in the state of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Senator Hertzberg has spent hours,
months working on this to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: we get it right, working with be it a
blockchain type technology, a closed loop
[SPEAKER_00]: system where you can trade amongst
yourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to do it right because we
understand how important it is to get this
[SPEAKER_00]: money into banks.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they once asked John Dillon,
why did you rob banks?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the money is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's why they're robbing
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They understand that's where the money is
and we have to make sure that these
[SPEAKER_00]: industries are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If your industry is safe, the community is
safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So safety is part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, on 1294, it's going to just be
a comprehensive bill that makes sure folks
[SPEAKER_00]: who have been not only formally prosecuted
because we know what the war on drugs have
[SPEAKER_00]: done to poor people and people of color.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were talking about the
criminalization of marijuana, this room
[SPEAKER_00]: would be filled with nothing but black and
brown people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to make sure we balance the
playing field and provide everyone with as
[SPEAKER_00]: much opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you have a great panel that's going
to come up and talk about local
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent 12 years as a local city council
person and I know how hard it is for some
[SPEAKER_00]: of these local elected officials to wrap
their arm around this industry and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: to help change the narrative and quit
talking about it as some illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: substance.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plant that no one in here created.
[SPEAKER_00]: God created that plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's as natural as mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have psychotrophic mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have edible mushrooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we all know, there's poisonous
mushrooms, but nobody has labeled a
[SPEAKER_00]: mushroom as a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to move the cannabis space from
away from being a drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is medicinal benefits to it through
the CDB.
[SPEAKER_00]: But overall, we have to change the
narrative and we're working with local
[SPEAKER_00]: elected officials.
[SPEAKER_00]: More and more cities are embracing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our diversity program right now will
only be available to those cities who have
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cities San Francisco, Los Angeles,
Oakland, and Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if communities want to bring forth the
diversity department for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be resources available right
now or they're going to only be available
[SPEAKER_00]: to those cities who have made a strong
commitment to diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't want to hold you guys up
because I know your panel is ready to go,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I just want to briefly have an
opportunity to talk about 1294.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you are committed to this,
if you're committed to diversity,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would strongly encourage you to call the
governor's office and email him.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has to be signed by September
30th or dive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still on his desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping that it's going to be signed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have good indication that it will be,
but emails, fax, tweet, social media,
[SPEAKER_00]: the governor looks at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all helps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a Marie for this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
Thank you.
