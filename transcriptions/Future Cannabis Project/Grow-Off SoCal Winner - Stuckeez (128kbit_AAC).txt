[SPEAKER_04]: We were with Wonderland Nursery on this,
and Kevin Jobri, he is somebody who has
[SPEAKER_04]: made this competition happen in Northern
California and Southern California for the
[SPEAKER_04]: better part of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said he had something special,
and what he said is that there wasn't a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of fuel on the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that was real gassy,
something that could dump in a commercial
[SPEAKER_04]: setting, something that you guys could all
put your hats on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I talked to a few people, they were like,
yeah, the only stretch, this could work
[SPEAKER_04]: well in a homegrown environment,
this could do well anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know that some of you know this already,
but it was Dog Walker OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is one of the premier phenos of Dog
Walker.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think that you can do anything
better out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're growing for cards, if we're
growing for hash, that's what matters.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you grow strong plants, they tend to
be very turpy, very potent.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first time that we have ever
had somebody sweep both potency and
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes and did the damn thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please give it up for Keith Jordan,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the first overall championship
belt we've ever given.
[SPEAKER_07]: This contest meant more to me than the
commercial or medicinal facilities because
[SPEAKER_07]: it all comes down to the home grower.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're able to produce medicine for
themselves, and always having that peace
[SPEAKER_07]: of mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quality is different once you have it at
the source, in a sense.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's the source, he's creating medicine
for himself.
[SPEAKER_07]: To be able to have that peace of mind and
know everything that goes into it,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a whole different experience that
people don't know that go to dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even the people that are getting medicinal
quality products, it's sent for testing,
[SPEAKER_07]: it goes through a packaging process,
it's handled multiple times.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have that same, that visual
luster.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if you would agree with me
with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just something about it being
straight, one set of hands, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many people show you their jar of weed
and it's better than what you have?
[SPEAKER_07]: You have something that's never been
crushed in a bag, never been mishandled.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it and I hate it because now I look
at so much weed and I'm such a critic.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, this is why I grow though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to be what I want to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'd be a millionaire if you could just
tell somebody how to grow their weed
[SPEAKER_07]: because you're just like, this is just not
up to par.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just a lot of love that goes
into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not my job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a thing I love to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what brought me to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you ever grown commercially?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started growing less than two years ago
and got a couple lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually bought some cuts from the store
while I popped seeds in my first cut run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Allegedly, allegedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, allegedly, allegedly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all hypothetical.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 25 years down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm less than two years in and it's just
been a home grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I understand commercial in my head.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're from Florida, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm from Florida.
[SPEAKER_02]: How long would you come out here?
[SPEAKER_07]: California, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: 420, it'll be about two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had to smoke all my weed that I had
left for 420 and then we packed our shit
[SPEAKER_02]: in a car and we left and that was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just committed and that's the only way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I quit my day job and I was just
committed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank God it's paying off.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do a lot of research and I do a lot of
thinking on top of that research because
[SPEAKER_02]: you can just read all you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can be told all you want, but what
actually makes sense in your head?
[SPEAKER_02]: What makes sense for your conditions?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what everybody gets wrong,
in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: They try to copy somebody else's stuff
instead of you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was talking about this with families,
the age of technology.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not having things at your grasp.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it didn't exist in a Webster's
dictionary, to me, I had to use my
[SPEAKER_07]: imagination.
[SPEAKER_07]: The thing is you run out of creativity,
but at the same time, it's always good to
[SPEAKER_07]: learn by changing what you're doing,
to experience new things, meaning you may
[SPEAKER_07]: perfect something you thought you had
perfected.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've already learned quickly that I'm
always going to keep learning.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a changing thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not even something you can get
perfected, in my opinion, because of all
[SPEAKER_02]: the new technology, all the new sciences
coming out, everything we're learning.
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, I've always been a rockwell
grower.
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as your growing methods and the
mediums and the type of lighting you're
[SPEAKER_07]: using and even the nutrients, what goes
into the thinking of picking out each one
[SPEAKER_07]: of those individual items?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's really one of the things that
growers use is their advantage.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like a chef.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get any brand of pepper,
any brand of pan, any brand of olive oil.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: What went into you choosing the different
types of media, different things that you
[SPEAKER_07]: use this time?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question because it wasn't
just what is everybody else running.
[SPEAKER_02]: I watched quite a few people grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of my friends grow some really good
weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had luckily a lot of things to take from
theirs and some things not to take from
[SPEAKER_02]: theirs.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people were killing it with the
mills, so I decided that I was going to
[SPEAKER_02]: run that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Organics, it's intimidating, I'm not going
to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do a lot of work with live soil and
keeping things just beautiful.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't go that route for preference with
cocoa.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier and it helps.
[SPEAKER_07]: I call it hydroponics on training wheels.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard to overfeed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hard to overwater.
[SPEAKER_02]: The water retention is very similar in
saturation rates to soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you just don't have the nutrients,
so you have full control of whatever
[SPEAKER_07]: you're putting into there.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the training wheels.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true, but it works really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's working, why not perfect that?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot more work.
[SPEAKER_07]: You got to huck those bags of soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: My back agrees.
[SPEAKER_07]: For a lot of home growers, they're putting
them in black contractor bags and hefty
[SPEAKER_07]: bags trying to smuggle them into their
apartment or house, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: I remember those days.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a golf bag and a camping tent bag
that I could put two bottles of 20 pound
[SPEAKER_07]: tanks of CO2 and just bring them in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was golfing and I had a bag with
whatever in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't tell you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not going to tell you.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, everything's allegedly.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is all for entertainment use only.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool just the fact of I was
able to get cuts from a store.
[SPEAKER_02]: Neighborhood nursery gave me the cuts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They worked out really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was some mango train wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: All my buddies were giving me shit for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were like, oh, you're going to grow
some train wreck, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yeah, I'm going to grow some
train wreck.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I got.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to crush it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You said something to me earlier about
Miami mango.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: Somebody was like, oh, if you're from back
in Florida, there's this strain.
[SPEAKER_07]: What was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a it was a mango that we used to
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And everyone there used to be so much of
it that everyone would hit you up and be
[SPEAKER_02]: like, hey, do you have weed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I got some mango.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll call you back.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm the one that's sitting there
like, all right, I'll take all the mango.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the terpiest weed I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was just incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now I can't get that mango cut Miami
mango.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let me get that cut, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Give them the cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, one thing that comes to mind with
Florida is O.G.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kush.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's Josh D.'s story, you know,
that originated in Florida.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is your experience with O.G.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kush?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, we had O.G.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kush Fino tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone hates my palette.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody's I mean, not everybody,
but the majority of people are like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I hand them a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, this is my favorite weed ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, this is what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this is your favorite weed ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the gas?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, no, it's straight lemon.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like when you tell somebody you like
Blue Dream, they're just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like hypothetically,
Blue Dream might not be that bad.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you grow it right, I'm all about taste.
[SPEAKER_07]: I always joke.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, I'm going to smoke enough to get
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: O.G.'s are nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they get me, you know, dumb high.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's it's the flavor I smoke for
because I'm going to get high regardless
[SPEAKER_02]: off of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I just I really I really
love sativas, but not the did you treat
[SPEAKER_07]: this plant differently?
[SPEAKER_02]: This time, I mean, I didn't treat it
differently at all except for a veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was actually redoing my room and I got
kind of lazy with it, kind of put the time
[SPEAKER_02]: off.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we just came down to it like,
all right, this has to go into flower to
[SPEAKER_02]: get 60 days and some dry time and some
cure time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it has to go in today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it went in 60 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ran it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually pulled it 57.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I started to, you know, for whatever
reason, I started to see it pull across.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a couple of little nanners out and
it's like, I could pluck them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could see what they do, but I'm not even
going to risk it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I pulled it and worked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was scared that that's what had me
sketching the whole time is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: did I pull too early?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because everyone else is like,
oh, we're taking this really far.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, you know, I don't have time
for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, people talk about looking at the
trichromes with a microscope and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for me, on a commercial level,
we don't really do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We look at a monthly calendar and if it's
a day we need to pull, we pull.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also look at people like Moxie who make
a lot of concentrates and, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: they get, you know, bashed for pulling
early, but we pull early and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: always...
[SPEAKER_02]: For concentrates is different though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I like concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you know, where most of mine
goes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, that's, that's what I prefer
to smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of lighting do you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: I use Phantom DE's, HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: That grow off plant was grown under 500
watts.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Took up the whole four by four space.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, because of the issue in
the beginning, they gave everybody a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I use that for veg.
[SPEAKER_02]: What'd you get for yield?
[SPEAKER_02]: About a pound and a half.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: For a four by four?
[SPEAKER_02]: For a four by four under 500 watts.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of pot did you use?
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 gallon SmartPot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as far as the feeding, as far as the
amount of water saturation, irrigation per
[SPEAKER_07]: day, liters, gallons, how much did you
feed the plant per day?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I always just, you know, feed for about
30 seconds and then let it sit,
[SPEAKER_02]: go to another plant, come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this drip irrigation?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, this is hand feed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm on a wand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have it like for me back in the
day, I would be like, everyone's second
[SPEAKER_07]: counts different.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd be like one, two, three, four,
five, six.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel like mine starts slow and starts,
you know, getting faster towards the end.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did you ever sit there with a pitcher and
measure the milliliters?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, I tried, but I've got ADD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, even if I'm counting there,
I'm just going to be like, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, what is this thinking about?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like for me, when I'm hand feeding,
I would always jiggle the pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You jiggle with one hand, you know,
the retention level.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're just like, oh, this needs eight
seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll hit it for like 30 seconds and
move on to another pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I usually do like two rounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the next time I give it water until I
start to see just a drop, start dripping
[SPEAKER_02]: out for a runoff and let whatever runs off
of there.
[SPEAKER_02]: One feeding per day, though?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, one feeding for, it starts out
usually every two, three days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, towards the end,
it's, you know, I'm hitting it every day,
[SPEAKER_02]: every day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Any teas?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you flush once a week?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I do, you know, two feed days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the third time is just water and
Cal Mag.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's when you're spot feeding.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it'd be like a Monday feed,
Wednesday feed, maybe like a Friday flush.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, so every, so I just take care of
my flushes that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never have like a set, you know,
flush every two weeks or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I will hit it a little harder if I'm-
Do you want to give out any secrets on
[SPEAKER_07]: your flush?
[SPEAKER_07]: What?
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you flush with?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are secrets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just water.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just, you know, I'm just- What do
you think of people using flushing agents
[SPEAKER_07]: and different things?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've, you know, I've heard different
things and I've tried, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: something that one person said was good
and then the other person says,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, that's how you, you know,
kill your plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, well, you know, kind of is
the goal here, but not really,
[SPEAKER_07]: but it, you know, it- Do you look at the
amount of runoff and you're like this in
[SPEAKER_07]: your head looking, for me, it's about
reading plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're hand feeding, sometimes for
me- If they start telling me they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, getting too much water,
I start backing off, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: won't run them till runoff and then I'll
switch up my flush schedule.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, I noticed that most
plants will stay on the same regiment if
[SPEAKER_02]: you have a good regiment, you know,
like it's some plants are finicky,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also stay away from those plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got enough heaters that are easier to
grow and, you know, like to work with you
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit better.
[SPEAKER_07]: So- So when you fed it this time,
how many different varieties of plants
[SPEAKER_07]: were you sharing the same reservoir feed
with?
[SPEAKER_02]: Three different.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they all indica, hybrids, sativa?
[SPEAKER_02]: One of them is a sativa leaning.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other one's a jet fuel cross.
[SPEAKER_02]: With fabuloso.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other one was the grow off.
[SPEAKER_07]: So- Well, you know, with the grow off
being an OG, for me, I've always laughed
[SPEAKER_07]: at the OG strain because I feel like so
many people put names on it and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_07]: matter.
[SPEAKER_07]: It could be my better than your OG,
this one dog walker, OG, whatever it may
[SPEAKER_07]: be, it's an OG.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in our minds, we look for a gassy,
diesel-y kind of piney strain when it
[SPEAKER_07]: comes to an OG.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, have you grown OGs before?
[SPEAKER_02]: I tend to stay away from them.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be honest, everyone gives me shit for
growing the more fruity flavors,
[SPEAKER_02]: the more sativa flavors, but you know,
that's what I like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to grow because of what you
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm smoking this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to smoke my bag,
then you're going to smoke what I grew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, I, what's nice is that,
you know, I became friends with a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: bank who loves edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Oregon elite, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's made it very easy for me to get
my hands on seeds and I've just haven't
[SPEAKER_02]: stopped popping them.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's people who give me shit
for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other people are like, you know,
pop my seeds for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's hard because out of 10, 12,
whatever many seeds you have, you have to
[SPEAKER_07]: track the data for each one of those seeds
and see how each phenotype, I always tell
[SPEAKER_07]: people it's like, you know, seeds are like
parents.
[SPEAKER_07]: You may have the same mom, the same
father, and I've always referred to it as
[SPEAKER_07]: the Michael Phelps theory in my head.
[SPEAKER_07]: Michael Phelps is shit, you know,
he smoked weed, won the most gold medals,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when I look at plants, whether it's
taking the most amount of clones for a
[SPEAKER_07]: strain or even popping seeds, who's our
Michael Phelps of the family?
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing is, is so many different
attributes go into finding the different
[SPEAKER_07]: phenos of a strain and, you know,
picking those out really comes down to not
[SPEAKER_07]: personal opinion at a commercial level.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's, it's, it's public opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're looking what the market wants.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, when it comes down to
whether it's selecting different phenos or
[SPEAKER_07]: clones, what's your process?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like for me, you know, if I had to plant
10 plants, I was taking 50 cuts and I was
[SPEAKER_07]: throwing away quite a bit of cuts just to
find the ones that were accelerating the
[SPEAKER_07]: most at the beginning.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if I can, I do that, but you know,
sometimes space is limited on moms and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, it's just, you take the cuts,
you can run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as long as you, you know, give them
the right love, most of them, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: turn out well, but I don't go for what the
market wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody, you know, picks out what the
next best thing is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes what I like is the next best
thing, but that's pure.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have the millions of dollars in
marketing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like some shit gets so wiped up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know about you, but I feel like it
really gets hyped up and you actually see,
[SPEAKER_07]: and you're like, dude, I can show you 10
other strains.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like I can hype up something all
day, you know, I've always been a
[SPEAKER_02]: salesman, but it's like, it doesn't
matter.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as it's fired, the market's going
to like it anyways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So grow what you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are going to be people that,
you know, grow or that like what you grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't go after the, the gorilla glue
craze, the wedding cake craze.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mint lemonade is.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's your ultimate dream in this?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to grow for a living?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you want to own your own type of
facility to grow?
[SPEAKER_07]: See for me, it's always been a dream to me
to do what you love.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, I see all the, and the
reason I bring up marketing is,
[SPEAKER_07]: is there's so many strains that are so
hyped up that I feel like people don't get
[SPEAKER_07]: a true sense of what is actually good
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing is, is if we don't have the
type of money, we don't have the type of
[SPEAKER_07]: followers.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not put out there and people get
hyped up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think we all get caught up sometimes
no matter what it is in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do each of you think some of the
hyped up strains are?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, dude, you know, purple punch.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has a visual and smell appeal.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think it's, it's almost like the
blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that will knock me on my ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, purple punch, not so much for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, maybe it's, and I always
say, maybe I haven't had the right one.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, it's actually indica dominant.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's granddaddy purple and Larry OG.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'd think if you cross those two,
it'd be, you know, it actually have a
[SPEAKER_07]: punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't, you know, it's crazy too,
but you'll find the people that do love
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what, you know, the market is
the market is the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as long as you grow it well,
somebody's going to like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, um, you know, people say blue dream
is a hype strain and they don't want it or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I grow some blue dream, you're going to
want it, you know, like there's,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to turn out good.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like very white to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I don't tell you it's blue dream,
you're not even going to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: some people might, but all the people
that, Oh, I don't like blue dream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Half the people you put blue dream in
their face are going to be like,
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, what is this?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has a bag appeal and it has a smell.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think that's what sells a lot of
times.
[SPEAKER_07]: And really at the end of the day,
everybody has a different body and
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody's going to accept things
differently.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just like alcohol or anything else
you put in your body, you're going to
[SPEAKER_07]: react differently.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people can have spicy foods.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people can, some people, you know,
have alcohol and they act, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: normal.
[SPEAKER_07]: And some people fall asleep.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people act like an asshole and they
act violent and crazy and they black out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the thing is, is, is finding out what
works for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I think that so many people
discount different strains because
[SPEAKER_07]: something's hyped up to where they need to
open their mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like, really, it's all about full
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_07]: Full spectrum is everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just, I don't go for what people
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also with you, I think that's why a
lot of people hate me for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's basically what I'm referring
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, man, it it's nothing but that old
school Lemon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just strong lemon kind of I think lemon G
You know like I that's what I'm comparing
[SPEAKER_02]: it to is the lemon G We had a lot of lemon
G in Florida as concentrates when
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrates at the market somebody
flooded down there with lemon G Terpy
[SPEAKER_02]: batter is what I started on and you know I
found a shop that had a glass nail on a
[SPEAKER_02]: dry J hook and I went to town Everyone's
like what are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know at these parties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sitting there with a blowtorch.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're like I think he's going on you
know oh But it was you know I I loved that
[SPEAKER_02]: lemon G And that's what really got me on
it and then when I went to Colorado They
[SPEAKER_02]: had this you know 92 lemon og that I was
like I hit a dab of it And I said this is
[SPEAKER_07]: it I like how they say 92 did yeah,
whatever to lineage I don't think og
[SPEAKER_07]: existed to most people by 92 by the story
of it, so it's just funny to hear that
[SPEAKER_02]: very true I just you know that's that's
what I found and I was like holy crap This
[SPEAKER_02]: is the you know smell again and the taste
that I found and so I just started popping
[SPEAKER_02]: lemon seeds and Lemon tree all these other
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't find what I was looking for this
cinnamon cookies and lemon G cross is the
[SPEAKER_02]: closest I've found I've actually for a
while I was the only one that I could find
[SPEAKER_02]: that had Pop some and then now I'm seeing
a couple you know yeah, or grew it enough
[SPEAKER_02]: to post it Or some of the ogs that just
don't post you know who knows that could
[SPEAKER_02]: be crushing it in a closet somewhere,
but That's nobody really agrees with me
[SPEAKER_02]: that mint lemonade is their favorite You
know I got a few buddies that do but most
[SPEAKER_02]: people call me crazy And they're like
where's you know the triple x og where's
[SPEAKER_02]: the you know fire og?
[SPEAKER_02]: We want we want all those and I'm like
it's not my style.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're the same friends you could
probably Give them ten different ogs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They couldn't name each one of them anyway
Yeah, you know I've got some I've got some
[SPEAKER_02]: og connoisseurs that just don't like what
I grow and I respect it It is what it is I
[SPEAKER_02]: grow what I like they grow what they like
When we smoke if if it's not what we want
[SPEAKER_02]: to smoke we'll roll up our own you know
who cares I'm not I'm not in any
[SPEAKER_02]: competition with anybody I just want to do
what I love like you said and that's I
[SPEAKER_02]: quit my day job to come out here and you
know chase my Edible dreams is my you know
[SPEAKER_02]: growing dream, and you're gonna have to
pick a dream I have all sorts of ideas You
[SPEAKER_02]: know I'm always constantly trying to Find
something that's with the edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do chase the market that that is
something I don't want the cookies the
[SPEAKER_02]: brownies the gummy bears I Don't think the
market does either, but they don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: much of a choice you know they they want
those, but they want something else and
[SPEAKER_02]: the problem is with the baked goods is the
shelf life and So I've started making
[SPEAKER_02]: chewing gum that we're trying to get into
the 10 milligram bracket of Recreational
[SPEAKER_02]: because it will hit you better You're
absorbing it instead of digesting it and
[SPEAKER_02]: so you're getting a little more bang for
your buck on the 10 milligram limit that
[SPEAKER_02]: recreational sets and I also have how long
do you have to chew gum to get the 10
[SPEAKER_07]: milligrams?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious you know that I'm not sure Do
you get higher if you swallow it that's a
[SPEAKER_02]: test we need to take But I like it because
it's it's easy to micro dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know chewing gum only lasts 10 15
minutes tops
[SPEAKER_02]: I just I run chewing gum, and I've got
some other ideas for the rec market
[SPEAKER_02]: because of that 10 milligram limit The
ropes my sweet and sour ropes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't see being bite-size.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have them bite-size and We will go after
the market with bite-size, but you may fat
[SPEAKER_02]: people like me think I'm saving calories
with bite-size Very true, and you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I'm trying to get skinny But I
want to get too skinny because you can't
[SPEAKER_02]: trust the skinny candy man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's what I've always heard shout
out Claude the candy man You know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just It is what it is with that market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm chasing what other people aren't
tackling and Shelf life is what I'm going
[SPEAKER_02]: for as well because People you know they
have to refrigerate these cookies that
[SPEAKER_07]: still have this it's not like you can make
this Stuff on demand you know the thing is
[SPEAKER_07]: is if it was a perfect world it'd be like
a farmers market to me You know especially
[SPEAKER_07]: for home growers like you did tonight.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like you know there should be a home
growers Association it's like people that
[SPEAKER_07]: are not gardening to a commercial level
should be able to grow within their means
[SPEAKER_07]: or Actual state legally means and be able
to trade or barter or or sell their goods
[SPEAKER_07]: within a community without having the same
stipulations as a commercial Cultivation
[SPEAKER_07]: because let's face it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not like you're doing it to survive a
lot of people that are doing things for
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivating at home is for themselves I
smoke a lot, and I'm not trying to buy all
[SPEAKER_02]: the booth from the store.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that's that's the problem I do
still I I grow at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow my own stuff, and then I still want
to smoke other people's stuff I'm not you
[SPEAKER_02]: know I'm not the best grower out there and
told the night, but Let's just put it out
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a premonition that I was Gonna win
when I did way before and I did I told you
[SPEAKER_07]: tonight before you won I think you're
gonna win did I not I've been Telling
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody that I was gonna win from the
start because you gotta you know it's it's
[SPEAKER_07]: all about mental You know for me.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's mental strength.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know it's not being cocky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's having confidence in yourself Yeah,
and if you don't have confidence in
[SPEAKER_02]: yourself, then what's the point like I
chased the dream because I was confident
[SPEAKER_02]: you know and I I waited As well,
I should have been out here years before I
[SPEAKER_02]: did I waited because I was listening to
other people tell me that It's not gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it's too hard for you Why like
why didn't I ask myself why before that I
[SPEAKER_02]: was like you know you're probably right
like Kicking myself for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, but I finally had the
self-confidence to come out here Do the
[SPEAKER_02]: damn thing and how'd you hear about the
graph uh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Miss Rad reefer friend of mine she She
entered and I said well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I kind of want to enter too You
know and I saw the party last time I was
[SPEAKER_02]: like oh well even if I don't win it'll be
a cool time you know Blake is a Actually
[SPEAKER_02]: from my hometown, so it was cool to party
with him as well across the whole country
[SPEAKER_02]: you know have him DJ for us and Maddie
ghost and It was just a cool event to come
[SPEAKER_02]: to with my friends over here because you
know I only have a select few of them and
[SPEAKER_02]: Do they help you in the garden?
[SPEAKER_02]: No?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know I do everything myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do have You know my buddy who comes over
and helps me tremendously But you know
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's for the most part Hands-on
that's all me, and I'm in there all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time Music oh yeah, oh all over the board
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean you can't let them get too Too
bored I always play music you when I'm not

there, and they I why wouldn't they love
[SPEAKER_02]: it.

[SPEAKER_02]: It did the same the winter get music I
actually put the speaker in the tray with
[SPEAKER_02]: the grow off plant if that says anything
So for the first two weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I left it on Michael Jackson Pandora You
know how to get him amped up, and then I
[SPEAKER_02]: threw it all over the place You know I had
some reggae in there some rap some you
[SPEAKER_02]: know rock.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just Whatever I felt like listening
to they were gonna listen to and I'd walk
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the room and leave it playing and
you know that was it but I I have but you
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't hand me the aux cord because you're
probably just not gonna be stoked I will
[SPEAKER_02]: hit every genre that you Didn't even know
was possible so keeps life interesting And
[SPEAKER_02]: I truly believe that the plants like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, dude you got to look at Vibrational
patterns and tectonic plates and frequency
[SPEAKER_07]: and what it does to sand alone when they
play it at high volumes It's it's it's
[SPEAKER_07]: really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never even heard of that Look it up.
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll get real high or medicated and
Working on it that blunt you gave me is uh
[SPEAKER_06]: oh, dude.

bit because I can't help myself always a
[SPEAKER_02]: clowns clown and everyone's like what is
the strain and I kept telling everybody
[SPEAKER_02]: glue dream and Some people were believing
me.
