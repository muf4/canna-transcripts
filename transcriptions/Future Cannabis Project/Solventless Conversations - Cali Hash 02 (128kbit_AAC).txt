[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, so it seems like it's working out of
your coughing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just been chimneying away,
yeah, finally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even Frenchie would be proud of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, post this shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frenchie will say shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the Quasar ambassador.
[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, so tell me what's currently in
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, in here we currently have...
[SPEAKER_02]: Lava cake, derivative of wedding cake,
Afghani, I mean they're all empty now,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then double sour OG, super sour
diesel, and purple cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: All together.
[SPEAKER_07]: So is it working?
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that coal takes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think once this thing gets
pumping...
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll tag you in that, so... Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I should have brought more, I didn't
realize.
[SPEAKER_02]: You really need to put like 20 grams in
there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think he just fills the whole
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 grams, I think, because I brought about
15, so I don't think it was enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going up in instructions for the
Quasar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Be like, FYI... It really is nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're gonna have to go ahead and put an
ounce in the stuff now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really feel that in my nose,
with the turps, I guess, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, some of the raw line is very turpy
because we don't oxidize it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't cure it traditionally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's what everyone's smelling now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I added the turps, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're getting a lot of super sour
diesel and purple cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, look at Michael jumping in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it gets that tear drop in my hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome, I love it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Me too, I love this machine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like what you were saying, the Tujo,
like bringing the young generation to the
[SPEAKER_04]: old.
[SPEAKER_04]: This would give me back to the normal
hatch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The different types of raws and how...
Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoking it like this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, this is taking away from the newer
way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like them both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we do with the cold water
hash, especially when it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh-roasted, and it's that more
traditional hash flavor, most of the time
[SPEAKER_00]: it comes out pretty stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, super stable, but black.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's full melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is your hash rosin then,
huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, but it's not what we make for Kelly
Hatch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kelly Hatch for hash rosin is made from
live material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fresh, frozen, live material.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're pressing what we stuck in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I had showed it to you,
but it's our raw line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have two lines at Kelly Hatch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a pressed line and a raw line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our raw line is just, we don't cure it
traditionally, we cure it in a vacuum
[SPEAKER_02]: freezer, so it never oxidizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what that does is it preserves the turf
profile.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the whole point of our raw
line, is for people to enjoy the turpines.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas our pressed lines are people to
enjoy the CBN and the hashing profile and
[SPEAKER_02]: the hashing turpines.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where they're different.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so what are you pressing it on?
[SPEAKER_02]: We press on wood boards and we use,
oh, actually, we literally press on wood
[SPEAKER_02]: boards where we put plastic in between.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're not using like a press?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, we do a little bit of an old
school, we do the Frenchy way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use glass bottles that are with heated
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I mean, this is what we do is a lot of
it is artisanal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, some of the labs that I work
with get annoyed at me because they want
[SPEAKER_02]: to, you know, mechanize the process more
and use presses like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when they see what you do, they're
like, dude, we could totally, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you do 50 grams at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we can do 500 at a time.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does destroy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The end is, I mean, the fact that it's
artisanal and the fact that it's so
[SPEAKER_02]: idiosyncratic to each different strain
specific and different size trichomes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you really have to treat it like a little
baby.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have to baby, if you want it
to be the perfect representation of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to really treat it right every
step of the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: That tastes really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it definitely tastes that the hash,
the hashing terpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: I taste a little like kind of blueberry
ish.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm still about flavors though.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's from Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: But so what what's specifically happening
when you when you take that what looked
[SPEAKER_07]: like dry sift, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you press it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it creating a better flavor?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it create like what makes it in what
ways is it better?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why is it better?
[SPEAKER_07]: And are there some reasons why it might be
worse?
[SPEAKER_02]: So look, I mean, why is rosin better?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, when you're dealing with even the
most premium hash and we haven't talked
[SPEAKER_02]: about 710 labs, but we have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're going to talk about hash,
so 710 labs based out of Colorado
[SPEAKER_02]: originally now in three or four states,
including Cali, one of my top companies I
[SPEAKER_02]: have listed as you know, that I want to
and I can take my hat off to put it that
[SPEAKER_02]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing an amazing job and they've
done an amazing job from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Coming from the solvent world,
too, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they were solvent lists from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they do so they do butane now as
well, but they're they're whole I think in
[SPEAKER_02]: the beginning, you might be correct way
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: My knowledge only goes back three years
with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So honestly, my knowledge is like two
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I heard from Colorado when they were
starting to make waves and but but yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're they're they're premium product
that's made with fresh frozen material.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's testing on average between 80 and 90
percent total cannabinoids, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that product is is selling for one
hundred and fifty dollars a gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so yeah, so it's just a
different thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that product, I implore you not to
smoke it in a quasar, smoke it in
[SPEAKER_02]: something like that, you know,
and and that is the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and and again, going back to the
differences a little bit between rosin and
[SPEAKER_02]: cold water and wine, wine, what it comes
down to plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So within hash, traditional hash and and
cold water hash, you have retained some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant material in traditional Moroccan
dry sieved hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's around 70, 60 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cold water hash currently is between
40 and 30.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, with live product like 710,
what they do and want some of the higher
[SPEAKER_02]: end.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just 710 right now, really,
where they're making premium level cold
[SPEAKER_02]: water hash and they're getting a single
source, single source, 85 percent and
[SPEAKER_02]: above.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're using fresh frozen material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, they're getting 85 and all
indoor, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's and that only has what?
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 percent plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that plant material is like strictly
like a little bit of lipids and not much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you know, the point is that at every
different level, you can consume the
[SPEAKER_02]: product differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we have perfect examples in front of
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't want to put 20 grams of rosin
in a quasar.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just just just wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you could, but it lends itself to
smoking with a little bit of plant
[SPEAKER_07]: material, which is.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a better smoke with little plant
material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and this is a good example.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the best example is, you know,
whereas in the pop go you wouldn't want
[SPEAKER_07]: any plants here.
[SPEAKER_02]: None.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, in fact, it's you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no one you wouldn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You would never smoke good.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're going to have the cleaning to
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for dabbing and that's the whole idea
behind dabbing is you're accessing or
[SPEAKER_02]: behind rosin and hash roses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're accessing the dabbing market.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're getting your product to 90 percent
total cannabinoids and no plant material,
[SPEAKER_02]: really just lipids and fats.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so on a daily basis, what are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't smoke so much anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, I'm I've got in my pocket here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a tincture man now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, and I'm doing I hate to admit
it, but I'm doing anywhere between 1000,
[SPEAKER_02]: 2000 milligrams a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm doing a lot of tincture,
but but yeah, tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anybody is welcome to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just drop it in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd say a whole dropper full is
about 100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: MCT only, hash only.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a line coming out of this as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different company than Kelly has.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tastes like a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, of course.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've seen effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: More of a body high.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like an edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've actually found it to be better
than a lot of edibles because you
[SPEAKER_02]: metabolize.
[SPEAKER_02]: You metabolize a brownie in a cookie one
way, but you metabolize an oil slightly
[SPEAKER_02]: differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's slightly quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, MCT oil and specifically
specifically is very bioavailable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you actually absorb it very quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of where I've come to the
conclusion on the difference where I feel
[SPEAKER_02]: between an edible and a tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when people ask me, like, is it like a
tincture?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, yes, it's like a tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I found that even your edibles will
get me a little bit more monged out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tincture gives me energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't get a lot of couch lock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And edibles, you can't really time it that
much.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a good hash edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't care who you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't just put you on your ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back when, before they did something.
[SPEAKER_04]: You metabolize it so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: So slowly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back when they were on the market,
like the edibles, I grabbed like a 500
[SPEAKER_04]: milligram or a thousand milligram.
[SPEAKER_07]: Edibles are most people's entry into the
cannabis.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have people who are like,
which is scary.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those are usually pretty heavy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now it's legal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, let me eat a cookie.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that person is just like white
knuckling, holding on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's more of a relative person to
person with edibles than it is smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I have friends, they can smoke as
much as I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they eat 30 milligrams and they're
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need five, 600 milligrams to be
satisfied.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need a thousand plus to actually be
stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's everyone's body breaks that down
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're ingesting, it's far
different.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I find it interesting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're saying you don't smoke almost at
all anymore.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, you don't like the ritual,
the taste, the flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke my children.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's be clear.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still addicted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a Spaniard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoking since I was like eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sucks, but it's the truth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's so bad, but it really is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no rules about who could buy
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one ever IDs you for anything in Spain.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we really were smoking quite young.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, I still am addicted to the act
of smoking and I truly do enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I just smoke a chillum.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke the little chillum, not that big
ass thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you smoke that chillum all day
long?
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally, I'll smoke maybe a half a gram
on a big day, but usually a quarter of a
[SPEAKER_02]: gram a hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's probably 20 hits in total over the
course of the whole day.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what about you?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't want to know.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: But are you using the keek a lot or are
you rolling?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it depends what I'm doing and
where I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say you're at work.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm at work, I'll take dabs because
it's a little quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll dab the hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the rosy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I also like smoking the hash
with flour a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also smoke bomb with the hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: So being Spanish, are you doing tobacco?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do once in a while, but I can't smoke
tobacco anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: My lungs are just done.
Do you smoke flour?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't smoke a joint without hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to always mix my hash and my
flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, Cali Hash is releasing in three
weeks a complete line of pre-rolls that
[SPEAKER_02]: are infused.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm all strain specific on the hash and
the wheat side.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to have a lot of fun with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've signed on with some,
I can't name who it is and all these
[SPEAKER_02]: people we've signed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We potentially have some new involvement
with some really active NFL players in
[SPEAKER_02]: this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of our new investors are
musicians.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to be doing some launch
parties and some stuff with them and
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully using their Instagram and social
media to really push the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: High five.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hear a lot of them are itching to get
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them have been in it for a
minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the NFL players are very much
involved.
[SPEAKER_07]: I did an event where I had Kissim Osgood,
who was a wide receiver.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was basically opiates, cannabis,
and sports leagues.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I had my friend Kenny Florian,
who was in the MMA, talk about what him
[SPEAKER_07]: and all the other MMA fighters went
through with being handed pills and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then Kissim was the same thing with
the NFL, where the doctors just,
[SPEAKER_07]: they're like, here's a bottle of pills,
slap on the ass, go home.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're like, I'm addicted.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like Brett Farr.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the fact that you can't smoke weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ridiculous.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hypocrisy of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're basically creating addicts.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like sanctioned high level addiction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like people who will need the most pain
meds during their career.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then those things are super addictive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where tincture, because you
can't viably say to someone that smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: is healthy and do it for wellness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, it's smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's carcinogenic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I would that's where I'm very
passionate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you disagree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there is this guy, Donald Tashkin,
or is he's a pulmonary expert at UCLA.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: His research was funded by NIDA,
which is basically I love UCLA,
[SPEAKER_02]: so anything coming out of there,
I really believe.
[SPEAKER_07]: But NIDA's sole mission is to prove that
like drugs, and in this case, cannabis are
[SPEAKER_07]: bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: And his research proved the opposite.
[SPEAKER_07]: And his study was basically people who
smoke joints regularly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And his control group was people who smoke
three joints a day, which is like a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: weed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot of carcinogens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like these aren't people who smoke like
one joint a week or something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or one bowl hit a day.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's his study group.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then what he concluded was that
statistically, those people have less
[SPEAKER_07]: likelihood of getting lung cancer than
someone like who smokes nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cigarettes, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever is bad and carcinogenic in the
weed is offset.
[SPEAKER_07]: But there's a net positive.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it came out of UCLA.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm inclined to believe it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go back to smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think that's that's one part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like what I found with the tinctures
is that it's just more efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we're smoking right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: 15 grams of hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're being very wasteful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know how much 15 grams of hash is
in milligrams?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're being gluttonous.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like hash gluttony.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's roughly 10,000 milligrams of hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to be eating fatty pork and
drinking wine.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tinctures get to you quick though.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just more efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our tinctures are bioavailable because of
the MCT and stuff in about 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you feel it in about 20 minutes,
especially if you put it sublingual.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely want to start experimenting
with tinctures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we'll get you some.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're giving props to the 710 guys and
I totally forget what you were saying
[SPEAKER_07]: about them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is an example.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of someone you respect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're not only doing they're not
doing ice water hash on my level on a
[SPEAKER_02]: cured level.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're only doing live ice water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not directly competing with my
company at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at some point I will be doing what
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And and I just I just respect what they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's inspired me.
[SPEAKER_02]: My hat's off to them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope they welcome me in the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: And who are the guys there who are focused
on the solvent list stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: Their main team is out of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do not know them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're right now training their team up
in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Oakland team apparently is
creating really good stuff already.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, I just I'm more familiar with
their products and not their management.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but but they're coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they're they're doing amazing work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's why I think it'd be cool to go be
like, hey, Adu, I'll come apprentice with
[SPEAKER_07]: you for a couple of months.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: His facility is in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that where he's at?
[SPEAKER_07]: He's in Maywood.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maywood, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the solvent list outside of
Maywood.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's even better for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does he live down here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always a lot of respect for Berner
and everything he's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met him, you know, I think twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies is a great example of someone
understanding what was going on way before
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody else and executing on it
impeccably.
[SPEAKER_02]: My hat off to him 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, my hat off for hiring the dude to
run the solvent list.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was a good choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it takes passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making hash is passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's art.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to have passion.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really good now.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, I love that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to go pick Jim up in like 45
minutes an hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: Your daughter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: She her preschool is literally that works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of hard work to do it because I
mean, if you do it, I like to do it by
[SPEAKER_04]: hand, you know, washing by hand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's the best way.
[SPEAKER_02]: You always get the best quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But thinking at scale, you know,
hard.
[SPEAKER_04]: People have these Avante washers,
you know, so why don't you would like to
[SPEAKER_04]: try one of those to compare it.
[SPEAKER_04]: How big are those?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think they make a few different sizes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like I would, you know, make a few
different sizes at three cubic foot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen is one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sixty five gallons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like 70.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen them pretty big, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never had one in person, you know,
but I see them being used.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you guys washing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Currently, we're using bulk bag washers,
20 gallon washers, nothing special.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use a 20 gallon bags as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use just we basically set up our whole
lab with 12 of them, but they're all done
[SPEAKER_02]: in tandem.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's six stations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've seen we've done it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one person can run six stations.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to see that scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can send you some photos.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're sending it all up right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a new lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started this company in California
City, but we learned really quickly was
[SPEAKER_02]: that California City is in the middle of
nowhere and no one wants to work there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, even I didn't want to work there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like, we couldn't find anyone to run
the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so anyway, now we're downtown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is that literally in the desert?
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, Palmdale?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I went to the Mojave.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I went to the desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the town of Mojave in the desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it's 30 more miles like up in
the desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I think it's a population of 10,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, this is hopefully not
offending people from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, it's literally like it's the
only thing going on there is meth.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think it's where like I
think the Crips or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: They hide people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like we're gangs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hide people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, it's a place where I don't keep
them alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's when they're hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's no local police force.
[SPEAKER_02]: The local police force.
[SPEAKER_02]: I met them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one guy that you can pay off really
easily, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: In meth.
[SPEAKER_02]: In meth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking Cal City.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's trying hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, they're really building
a dry environment, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most importantly for us, we need a
controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And fighting that fighting that that dry
heat was terrible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're going to see like hash labs
popping up in deserts?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's run out of desert property.
[SPEAKER_00]: The drier environments in terms of types
of hash, it's better for like your dabbing
[SPEAKER_00]: hashes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better for life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like for shatters, for crumbles,
for other oils and so forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you're trying to pull out all that
moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with a traditional hash, while you are
trying to pull out moisture, you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to like completely decimate it of
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like like a good flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want your flower to be dust?
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the hash traditionally in the world,
where was it made?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rift Mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lebanese Mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nepalese Mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Afghanistan Mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shit's always grown in the mountains and
it partly and made in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And partly it's because weed grows better
at altitude.
[SPEAKER_02]: You get much better weed growing at three,
four thousand feet from from from surface
[SPEAKER_02]: from sea level.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other side of it is when you have
humidity in the air, you're allowed to
[SPEAKER_02]: retain more humidity in the trichome.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't dry out as fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's our game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like my game, making traditional hash
because you want to cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: The game is trying to cure it,
but not too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole game is trying to get it
right at that perfect moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the art form.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you can get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is a perfect cure?
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, usually it's five days after it's
been harvested, trimming around that time
[SPEAKER_02]: and then giving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I have that material right then and
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, not long because like if I get a
product that isn't supremely oxidized when
[SPEAKER_02]: it's come out, you'll naturally oxidize it
in the pressing process.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do have clients who are just adamant
that they want their stuff to be black,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and if it's a little brown,
they're like, no, it needs to be jet
[SPEAKER_02]: black.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a market.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a market for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they want it fully oxidized because,
you know, the blackness or the brownness,
[SPEAKER_02]: like you were saying earlier, has nothing
to do with the strain or any of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very little.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very little.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has entirely to do with trichome size
and then oxidization.
[SPEAKER_07]: But so what are what do they like with
something that's oxidized that much?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's just because it's traditional
and there's more CBN in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They like that more couchy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's like and more hashing proof or
150 proof of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's also like, like, yeah, wine's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like, like, do you remember,
do you remember cannabis oils from like
[SPEAKER_00]: early 2000s and before?
[SPEAKER_00]: There weren't a lot of light color
cannabis oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of a lot of the lighter color was a
real marketing ploy, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just it's an it's an older
trichome for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they created this thing
where people just naturally believe,
[SPEAKER_00]: like when I say people, I'm usually the
market at large, younger demographic.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, the market at large.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely a conception,
especially in America.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That any product that is not oxidized is
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of part of what we're
trying to dispel.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reality is not that the reality is
even in some cases, they're harvesting the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants premium.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maturely.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the trichomes not even oxidized on the
plant at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, forget milky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's translucent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're getting something that
that doesn't have any of the cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_02]: you want.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will give you some really premium high
that's like right in the head and it kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of gives you a headache.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, you want CBG.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want it to develop because most of
your cannabinoids start as CBG and you
[SPEAKER_02]: want them to develop into their
constituents.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you want it to be THCV.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want it to be THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want it to be CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want it to be CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't get there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't get there without oxidization.
[SPEAKER_07]: So those products are high CBG.
[SPEAKER_07]: They are.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's giving you the couch lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not giving you the couch lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, that's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's giving you like a cerebral effect.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's almost like a ton of caffeine or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's more like it's I don't like it at
all, personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have CBG isolates if you want to
try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it gives you like a rush right in
the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys aren't selling it well.
[SPEAKER_07]: He would though.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to try it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try this terrible thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, no, I'm good.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, like I'm just scratching the
surface as we all are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, even Frenchy would admit,
you know, we all are.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're able to apply real science
spectrometers and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then and really do testing,
you know, and blind studies and really
[SPEAKER_02]: figure out what each cannabinoid is doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there's upwards of 100 unique molecules
and cannabis called cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, we need to figure out which each one
is doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask how many cannabinoids
are there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's plus 100 plus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what do they do?
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to affect the human body.
[SPEAKER_02]: I read about one that I never heard about
recently that they're studying in some
[SPEAKER_02]: university where they actually put it
directly on a cancer cell and they saw
[SPEAKER_02]: some negative effect to the cancer cell.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been anecdotal evidence for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Isn't it a THC variant?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, but it was one I never heard of.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like THC V62.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a friend who did cancer research at
UCLA and it was stem cell cancer.
[SPEAKER_07]: And basically, they looked at all,
you know, you do your testing through a
[SPEAKER_07]: library of 30 plus thousand chemicals.
[SPEAKER_07]: And of those 30 plus thousand,
like the couple that showed promise,
[SPEAKER_07]: one was cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he wanted to do more research because
they were using synthetic cannabis and it
[SPEAKER_07]: had bad side effects.
[SPEAKER_07]: And he was like, if I could just get my
hands on the real thing, you'd eliminate
[SPEAKER_07]: the bad side effects, but keep the
benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were they using Cetivex or Marinol?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either of those two.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wouldn't have been anything else.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can get them on speakerphone right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's another thing you just
kind of segue into, which is the full
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrum entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very important.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're full believers in that in the
hash world and in my tincture products,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and we advocate for everyone to
be true believers in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm enjoying the full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's what you lose with the
isolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what, you know, a lot of people
don't realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on with like the CBD going
around and all those isolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people don't even realize that
most CBD product they get is hemp derived
[SPEAKER_00]: and more often than not, not even hemp
derived in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those hemp products that are even
being grown, not a BCC farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not going through the same
strict testing that the real cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry is going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so it's a completely different
ballpark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then not only that, but most of these
people aren't being told anything about
[SPEAKER_00]: the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they think an isolate is just enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these people, too,
that take a CBD, some of them,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're afraid of getting stoned,
but they don't realize that if they take a
[SPEAKER_00]: ratio that outweighs the cycle act of the
THC with the CBD, they're not going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're still going to be able to
benefit from that entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what are your thoughts as you look at
solvent extract?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like in like all the trends and
innovations, like one of the things we're
[SPEAKER_07]: just talking about is like making product
clear.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, I mean, I internally there's
something that I just don't like about
[SPEAKER_02]: taking something that is crude and full of
carbon and dirty and made in a violent
[SPEAKER_02]: manner and then ultra processing it in a
purification procedure to make it look
[SPEAKER_02]: something that it's not.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not selling this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not passionate at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no opinion about this whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I mean, I really think that the
entire solvent world is just selling
[SPEAKER_02]: something that I personally never
consumed, never would consume,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've never sold it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have not.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in this industry 15 plus years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never sold a solvent product.
[SPEAKER_02]: He used to sell them for me, but
technically it wasn't me.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I don't believe him.
[SPEAKER_07]: Did he just throw you under the bus?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, he doesn't either in a big way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we did our things back in the day
to make money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality is I truly don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never consumed wax in any of its
forms.
[SPEAKER_02]: I never would.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't taste good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's made really in a bad way.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's always stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in the back of your head, like you
just know, like, OK, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know where this came from.
No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when I did the molecule thing
looking under the microscope, that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: brought it home.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, damn, this thing is totally
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does not look like I tried to comb my
head on my plate.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people that like, oh,
they want that glow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just quickly, before I forget,
for the whole panel here, you get none,
[SPEAKER_07]: one or two thumbs up for the quasar,
starting all the way down on the left.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two thumbs up.
OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fucking two thumbs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Double check?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and he's Mr. Negative, so he'll tell
you right away if he doesn't think
[SPEAKER_02]: something's nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It drives me fucking nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, it's nice, but honestly,
one thumb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it takes too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not practical for the average person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sesh device, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be fair, I don't think we got it
going in its best.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we had some tongs, we could get that
core hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you got to get more charcoal on
top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for your average consumer,
not only is it not practical because of
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount, but your average consumer,
I mean, like when we have stuff in store,
[SPEAKER_00]: we only have grams in store because that's
the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, 20 grams is not really practical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if that dispensary were to start
taking off their margin for them,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's still not very practical.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what it's good for?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, how about this?
[SPEAKER_07]: As your sesh device for those rare times
where you're smoking communally with eight
[SPEAKER_07]: other people.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I totally like it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in that scenario, get two thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like an everyday use.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hit it on the head.
[SPEAKER_02]: For what Frenchie does with it,
for Cali hash purposes, 100% a tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a party tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 20 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You literally need, because I'm even
overwhelmed now and my lungs are closing
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need like 20 people to enjoy it
properly, which is what Frenchie does.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes good though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once it gets going nice, it is nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, compared to this guy, you get two
thumbs up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also needs a little more coal than
normally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is the first time we're using
this thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally with the tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be clear, he wouldn't give two
thumbs up to anything in his life.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's pretty much good.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think it's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You definitely need multiple people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't be doing this by yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess you could.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need like 20 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need like a party facing to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Michael, you got to help out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe someone just plugs it once a month.
[SPEAKER_04]: Start sending people in from downstairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can walk down the street with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I guess I could see someone plugging
it once a month or something at their
[SPEAKER_00]: house.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone that just smokes hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time they come home and they
just put a few coals on and get her going
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like an all day Sunday activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can easily stop and start
watching football.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Football Sundays.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right there next to the nachos.
[SPEAKER_02]: If this isn't airtight as well,
they can be, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can safely say I'm stolen now,
guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't even remember who I was talking
to, but it was like doing this and having
[SPEAKER_07]: to work all the cameras and set everything
up.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the people I'm smoking with,
they're like, I'm super high right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, yeah, dude, you're not working
all the cameras.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to think about anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to be high.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was watching you on Monday night.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, how's he doing it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he had to really be on point
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I get super high any time I ever
do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I have like two hands.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's like, I make hash, but with two hands
behind my back.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because he does.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, he has a partner, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, he does the dry and with trim.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's not using flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently, he'll only get his hands on the
trim for R&D.
[SPEAKER_07]: But everyone else was like, and the shit
he makes is still amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the fact that he's making another
just trim, more respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I get some pretty decent trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have people that are taking out the
fan leaves, or you got people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: being a little cheap on you and throwing a
bunch of fan leaves in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I just washed some fan leaves I was
holding onto.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it yielded pretty good, to be honest,
man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like two pounds of fan leaves.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it yielded OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know how that's going to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some food grade.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just working on the practice,
just the craft part.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I can really do at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to do the best I can with what I have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we're building out the lab right
now, if you want to join the team.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I do, honestly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_04]: Monday out, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fuck yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been looking for, I was in Monday.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was at a job fair on Monday.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's set up an appointment and interview.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I told Peter, I just recently quit
my job to chase this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're literally signing the contract
next week to confirm the lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have 1,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plenty of space.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have all the equipment already in
storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to talk more, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's get together next week and talk
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll be open.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll get your email.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're big.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need hash makers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to have a little muscle.
[SPEAKER_04]: To be honest, I lost like three.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like down like 40 pounds right now,
though, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's actually labor, so you might
gain it back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the muscle there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: I put the football back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like the hash making part.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, does this stuff start like
yogurt?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that they have a company and it's
fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: White mustache.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, I'm on the yogurt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep active.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's Michael.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sell him on the yogurt, but not how he
sold us on solvent and small batch hand
[SPEAKER_06]: made yogurt, hamstring gravity,
gravity strained.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Persian yogurt.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's my wife's company.
[SPEAKER_06]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_06]: From the old, old techniques that they
learned back in the deserts of Iran.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Italy brought them out here because
it's so good.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: We want to give you free kitchen space.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to get space on Italy right
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, people are paying to get in there
for them to get.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that that's happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: I need like a 12 pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I love that's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all these food industries,
everyone's going back to the artisanal
[SPEAKER_02]: craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Craft beer is taking a big chunk out of
the Pilsner market.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be.
[SPEAKER_07]: But then you find out that like Anheuser
owns that craft beer.
[SPEAKER_07]: They bought them all like 12 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a free market person.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone wants to capitulate and sell
their brand, you know, retire or maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: start a new brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I was at a small craft fair a year
or two ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I saw the big Pilsner's of the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: The scale of which small things are
working out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Michael, why don't you talk into the...
Give that thing a whirl.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're like two to five million dollar
markets and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just too small for them to throw
their R&D on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they go to the craft fairs and they're
like, we love your product.
[SPEAKER_06]: We see it on the shelves in that,
you know, small geo located area.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's like, instead of having our own
in-house R&D working on a chocolate or
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever, we're just going to buy this
company of this company of this company.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's an interesting model on their
part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing is, though, too,
is, you know, in some sense, if you have
[SPEAKER_00]: good management, you can somewhat throw
money at things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But throwing money at things doesn't
always work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these brands that get taken
over on one hand, I think a lot of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to fail out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the other hand, it's like,
do they really care if they fail out?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to buy another
portfolio of brands.
[SPEAKER_07]: You mean the people who bought it?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the people who started the brand
are like, that sucks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Someone that built it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They know how to build it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You killed my baby.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or is it like the tech media where
companies are buying... Michael,
[SPEAKER_06]: back to the radio mic.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a Yahoo buying a Tumblr and it's
basically like, we're just buying you for
[SPEAKER_06]: the software development talent.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't really care about the product
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's less of that with consumer
product, you know, because to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as they're meeting their bottom
line and they're taking that brand,
[SPEAKER_00]: because to them, brand means more than
quality a lot of the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think it really necessarily
works that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing too with craft is like
a lot of craft people tend to want to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to the sourcing of the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel like some of them,
they find out so-and-so got bought out by
[SPEAKER_00]: so-and-so.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns them off a little bit on that
product.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, really?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: What flavors of the yogurt are also
different types?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the Big Seller... Michael,
back to the mic.
[SPEAKER_07]: My God.
[SPEAKER_06]: Big Seller Sour Cherry, King Mulberry,
a Walnut Honey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then there are seasonal flavors.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the seasonal flavor out right now is
Summer Peach.
[SPEAKER_06]: So peaches harvest over the summer.
[SPEAKER_06]: Quince is good.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's coming out in about a month.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just actually turned a thousand-plus
pounds into preserves.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that will go out in a few weeks.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's savory yogurt, so like a savory
shallot that you can use on top of
[SPEAKER_06]: vegetables and stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a variety pack, but it's all kind
of what was grown and used in that kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: a lot of creative environment.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my question before was something like
this, can you like, does it keep it all?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you take the heat off.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like three days from now I could light
that back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I was saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could totally just sit on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think you can do that with like a
rosin product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But granted, the cool-off period that
you're not smoking when it is cooling off,
[SPEAKER_00]: you will be wasting a little bit because
you're not smoking and some of it has to
[SPEAKER_00]: burn away to cool off.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other than that, you could totally
just chill on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, come back to it when you want to
come back to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would even mix it up a little bit before
you go back at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I guess since you can come back to
it and chill on it, you don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: have to have 20 people.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the colds are still going, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this meant for HIKI use and we're just
using it for flash?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, they're dying down.
[SPEAKER_07]: It works for apple and tobaccos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like all their marketing videos.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for traditional hookah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I didn't realize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it just works great for what we want
it for.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is this a cleaner hookah head than the
average one?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the second generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the normal hookah head is that
clay thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like I see people trying to torch
the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is the second generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do that, Fred.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could just treat it like someone would
try to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm also sure they have they probably
have a design patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I doubt they have a mechanical patent
around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could heat it from below just with
a padded e-nail sort of situation,
[SPEAKER_02]: you plug that in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just get the bottom stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then just it would just be it would
get bigger hits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because right now the problem that's
happening is you're just it's hard to get
[SPEAKER_02]: the heat going through all of the hash
because you're just getting the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the only way the heat gets there
is by sucking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It don't work a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're lazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: This set up is not perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like an e-nail though.
[SPEAKER_04]: E-nails work good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too much work.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, though, actually an e-version of this
would be very smart.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that's what I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm assuming they're into it.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_07]: You are talking to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm I want to design one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you should.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can do your own brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a genius.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all you have to do is use a normal
coil, but do it at the diameter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it'd be hyper portable,
practical, like people like think of
[SPEAKER_07]: people like, OK, like charcoal,
like coal, which like drops on the floor
[SPEAKER_07]: and sets my house on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be honest, what you would want to
do is you'd want to make it so it's one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those more universal hookups.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a it's like a camera type
hookup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I forgot the name, but Pelican
Nails come with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of those big nails come of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do your box and sell that,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you make it more universal and
people that already own that can buy your
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I hate when companies do stuff where
it's like super proprietary.
[SPEAKER_07]: So even, you know, I when I go into
dispensaries, I talk to the bud tenders
[SPEAKER_07]: about like the pods that are popping up
because you have different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the thing about the pods,
though, the pods can only for the most
[SPEAKER_00]: part use something that's very liquidy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the super high quality oils out the
window.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought the whole point of a pod was it
was it was better than a standard.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they, 710 threads or 510 threads?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, that's the standard thread.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the thing about these, these are
actually better than the pods because you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get a thicker liquid in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, but the pods you can't
really customize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the benefit is just to make you buy
their stuff because people are inherently.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say cheap, but frugal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they if someone already gets sold
by a bud tender on a battery and they go
[SPEAKER_00]: to a dispensary and they say, I have this
battery and I need I need a cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be like, oh, here you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go, well, what about these?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're talking about the 710s and the
510s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's like, oh, no, those won't fit
your battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to buy a new battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, how much is a new battery?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all of a sudden they're buying
this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the person's it's all about cornering
your customer and forcing them like in
[SPEAKER_00]: their opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's at least my perspective from the
outside looking in on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think they're thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they want to force the
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they totally do.
[SPEAKER_07]: But but they're selling like an it's not I
thought the whole reason for because of my
[SPEAKER_07]: head, I'm like, who would ever be like,
we'd love for you to control a proprietary
[SPEAKER_07]: pod and for us to be on it versus like,
why would we want that when we can just
[SPEAKER_07]: stay on the open source?
[SPEAKER_00]: So originally, they tried to do a
proprietary thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pax was trying to do it first.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they tried doing exclusives with
companies that didn't work out because all
[SPEAKER_00]: they really had was design patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a Chinese product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other pod companies that
were there also cartridge manufacturers
[SPEAKER_00]: that were making variants of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it came out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It went to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why eventually you saw no real
exclusivity in terms of brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You started seeing people had nothing to
do with Pax at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like what's their name?
[SPEAKER_00]: Stizzy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have their own proprietary.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But so now you have two and then you have
other.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I don't think it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not truly proprietary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's proprietary to the point of most
other companies aren't doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're setting up a situation
where.
[SPEAKER_07]: But like a Stizzy pod won't fit in a Pax.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_07]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're setting up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're setting up a situation where you
already own the battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're you're you're in the
crossroads of do I buy another battery to
[SPEAKER_00]: get something else if I really want that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what they're.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Strategic maneuvering.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like, this is genius.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I thought it was based on the fact
that those pods are better than these.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're saying they're not.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's kind of like, why the hell
would anyone ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, I'm sure I'm sure like I'm
sure somebody could get the manufacturer
[SPEAKER_00]: to customize this a little more to what
you can customize these to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've gone so far in terms of how
they can customize these.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's just send me a number on
Instagram and then I'll call you because
[SPEAKER_00]: if you pay attention to like how the.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's in here is that this is a rock
garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're live res.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you do hit solvent.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Opposite of solvent listens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Products.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, you're not as as.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I use this for when I'm places
that I can't really.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not something I smoke every day
like this is probably three or four weeks
[SPEAKER_02]: old.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people love the hash flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you like like what do you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: About live res.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the taste of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is made with the sauce and the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's actually the cannabis drippings
that liquefied.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, if you do it, if you work it nicely,
you'll end up with like some very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boards with some with world.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we're.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're stoned enough.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I'm super high.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to go eat some food.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to pick Jemma and you do.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a daughter, apparently.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every time I do this, I'm like,
can I go pick Jemma?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the product he's made.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to interview him next week
and sit down with him and talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: interviews and formal work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the right word.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to get high together and get
high together and see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think Peter, for connecting us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that was the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, I wish I had brought more hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can leave you with some, but we
literally put all of it in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: We just don't ever come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like in the back of my head,
I was thinking so.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the things I want to do and what
I did here is we have events here with
[SPEAKER_07]: like music industry people and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we basically smoke them all up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love to be part of those.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it's like just private events with
like like last time me and my friend Jody
[SPEAKER_07]: from Fiddler's Greens were sitting here,
passing Fiddler's Greens.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Love old, you know, joints around the
room.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a bong going around the room and
all these people were like, this stuff's
[SPEAKER_07]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, let me know when the next one is
and we'll keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to come up with a cool name,
the hash sash or the sash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I had a name.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm totally blanking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what they are now,
but I was like, it's the solventless hour
[SPEAKER_07]: with Peter.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I'm the only, every show I'm the only
host.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's the solventless hour with Peter
Surrey.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, oh my God, I'm so high.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's like, and we're back with
the like the flower hour.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's like, meet your host,
like the same dude who like stumbles from
[SPEAKER_07]: the last stage to the next one,
super high.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, oh my God, I have like eight
more shows to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's just Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just my Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a retailer in Woodland Hills.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you're a part owner of that retail
shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: And which one is it?
[SPEAKER_07]: The shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called The Shop.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very imaginative.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're so, so imaginative.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not involved with that brand.
[SPEAKER_07]: So is that near the refinery?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the refinery is our dear friend,
Greg.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you know, Greg.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really dear friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with him.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're actually doing a collab with his,
with his special weed that he's doing
[SPEAKER_02]: right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're building up a really good core
team to fucking take on the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look, to give you an idea of this
market is 1.2% of the general market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pre-rolls are 35% and growing
exponentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at BDS Analytics.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll tell you everything you need to
know about what the market's doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we're very excited to take
Callie Ash to those markets because the
[SPEAKER_07]: whole- Oh, that's very- all right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're adding pre-rolls, which is a super-
all right, got it, got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the whole idea was to go into a low
competitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, other than the passions that I
have for making hash, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the financial economic side for me was
always strategy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there was very low competition.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had one competitor in Nasha because
Frenchie wasn't even in the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I said, fuck, I've always been
doing hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why wouldn't I just- and that's how I
wedged my foot in the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm now in 55 retailers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've done that very easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've just signed with three large
distributors that are completely statewide
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're going to put us in the last
350 that we're not in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and we've done it with very
little resistance because it's only Nasha
[SPEAKER_02]: and they have a very limited distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not many other people out
there doing this level of hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, it's like at that price point
and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was the whole idea was get your
foot in the door that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then off the back of that,
you launch other brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once you have a brand that people
like, they'll buy other brands or other
[SPEAKER_07]: categories, sorry, other categories.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like the tincture would be a product
and it's, it's been branded as full
[SPEAKER_07]: spectrum hash tincture.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's actually a different brand,
but, but that's the only one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The, the Rosin, the premium and the pre
rolls will all be Cali hash products and
[SPEAKER_02]: all our current retailers and the ones
coming will all take it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you know, that was,
that was the, the, the, the, the business
[SPEAKER_02]: strategy behind it, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how I convinced everybody
involved to this point.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you mentioned 710, but who else do you
respect?
[SPEAKER_07]: And it doesn't just have to be hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like who else?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, uh, illegal market, legal market,
alien labs, alien labs, my hat off to
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know them well.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really amazing people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, beard brothers farms has done an
amazing job in the legal space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like you guys doesn't even begin to
cover it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, and they're really advocates to the
roots.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they are true, true, true industry
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been in this game forever in
California and their, their advocacy is
[SPEAKER_02]: what I'm most impressed with.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're, they truly do push the mark and,
and, and, and everybody here, everybody in
[SPEAKER_02]: the industry uses them to get the real
information and, and not only that their
[SPEAKER_02]: product is good as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so then chime in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look, it's hard though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I love cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, when I can get some,
um, Scherbinski's is always, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The legal market's interesting though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonder bread, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I've seen some good genetics from,
uh, they're called King's farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ran across them like a month ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out of the desert flower company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have some really good cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I remember getting some, I have been a
dispenser for a long time, but like I used
[SPEAKER_04]: to go to strain and get like, uh,
and I forget the names, but like hydro
[SPEAKER_04]: boys, they had some stuff, you know,
they concentrate.
[SPEAKER_04]: They had actually the first time I had
like the sauce was from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they have this one cut called a
seated grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You keep talking about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's amazing to get my hands on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, and it's acidic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like juju.
[SPEAKER_04]: The delicious North bomb of on farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do know one of them.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: I brought some down some, you know,
G Preston.
[SPEAKER_07]: You smoke flower?
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: And do you prefer indoor or outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's a lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love outdoor lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: He loves it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, but I mean, I like, I like,
I like indoor, like probiotics,
[SPEAKER_00]: robotic stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still natural stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I know, I also personally know
people that do really good with cocoa too,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I prefer indoor is you can just
control it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're at the women nature and outdoor,
you know, sometimes that leads to an
[SPEAKER_07]: interesting expression, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like, yeah, but here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That interesting expression actually
really is more so than the outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: environment giving it that most outdoor
growers, they're growing by seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them aren't doing it by clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a lot of them are getting slight
variance of average strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like one of the biggest things that
people misconstrued with cannabis is the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference between strain and phenotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think just because something has the
genetics that it's going to taste like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to smell like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to look like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the easiest way for people that don't
understand the difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: phenotype to understand things is you have
a child.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is your child a hundred percent exactly
like you?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, your child's a variant of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your child might be better than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your child might be worse than you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your child might be slightly different
than you, but almost the same as you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's never going to be a hundred
percent you to be you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got to clone you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so that's really a lot of the
same spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a lot of the variance that you're
seeing with outdoor, which is I like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's attractive, but I just overall
prefer indoor cannabis.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you, well, you don't really,
you don't really smoke flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still enjoy like a joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: With friends though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll smoke with him actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys smoking indoor or outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider a real greenhouse indoor
though.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if I'm in NorCal, which I spent like
the first five years of my career in
[SPEAKER_02]: California, I was living in Healdsburg and
I preferred the outdoor, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the fresh, good greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something to be said for the full
spectrum of the sun, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and even the high HPSs and even your best
dual traditional ballast system does not
[SPEAKER_02]: get the full spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some greenhouses, it's like,
there's such a huge variance in greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's like some greenhouse,
you're pretty much outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really a, like a structured
building per se.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like barely that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the PVC pipes with the touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I like, and then there's you
have your greenhouse, a real foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's essentially, it's essentially an
indoor building except for the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: it has a glass or plastic roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I consider that really pretty much
indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I know there's arguments to
that, whatever, that's semantics.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, I prefer
something that's within a controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, something that's just free.
[SPEAKER_07]: I hope you have enough content.
[SPEAKER_07]: I still got to pick my daughter up.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we have to wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: Strong work team.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do it again soon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
