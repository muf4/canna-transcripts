[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, welcome back to Heart Rock
Mountain Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we are in our male garden and we've
only planted one, two, three, four,
[SPEAKER_01]: five, four and a few rows of what has had
13 or 14 rows planted and they're deep
[SPEAKER_01]: rows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, each row has 13 or 14 holes in
there, but it's kind of nice having a
[SPEAKER_01]: small, relaxing male garden this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're kind of tucked away in here and
behind us is a big cattle ranch in the
[SPEAKER_01]: National Forest, so the wind currents take
any stray pollen far away from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where we'll do our final
selection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually I only will flower out no more
than 10 males per variety and that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: something if I'm really trying to narrow
something down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've already selected for structure and
nose and now we get a look at the bud
[SPEAKER_01]: structure and we get these bouquet up and
into our pollen boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I make my final notes on the
cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we have our love laughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that this one has the more sweet
pheno versus the eucalyptus pine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really like the strong nose on this one,
so I'll go ahead and give this one a star
[SPEAKER_01]: and let my future self know later that
this was a sweet pheno.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we upgraded the hanging tags this
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every year you'd always lose a tag in the
male garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the hanging tags is a good way to go
and we drop that in our jar of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Falco number two, brand new one because I
lost mine hiking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can prune away extra leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll end up with a nice little
[SPEAKER_00]: bouquet of male flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you're done there, did you just
kill it off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's our CBD one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't need a lot of pollen from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although I think people always hit me up
in the past to buy pollen and it's just so
[SPEAKER_01]: much work to collect it that it's not
worth it, but might be a good year to do
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then this male is the eucalyptus pheno of
the love laughter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm definitely running low on love
laughter seeds and hope to do a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: generations of work here with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like you're taking a cutting,
a very long cutting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This method, we just kind of developed
this out of necessity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing from keeping less than a dozen
males to 25 males to 75 males to our
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest year, which I believe we had 150
varieties of males.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main farm did not get seeded.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent a lot of nights that year,
up to two or three in the morning,
[SPEAKER_01]: working on processing pollen and spraying
down the garden afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much pollen can you collect from a
bouquet like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple grams,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were to cut it enough to make like
tens of thousands, if not hundreds of
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands of seeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially in the pollen boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a way that you can do this on a
smaller scale to really get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen and a lot of diversity because
we're collecting pollen and we're breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not breeding in indoor under lights
or in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably enough pollen from that
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to very slowly bend the rest of the
male over to the ground and cut it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then I'll come through and spray this
pollen off because if I were to let this
[SPEAKER_01]: male just dry here on the ground and the
wind could come and pick it up and take it
[SPEAKER_01]: off.
[SPEAKER_01]: The key of the game is to get the males
just as they're opening into the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're kind of in a unique environment for
location to do this type of outdoor pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not recommended for everyone to do
it this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The pollen boxes, we're going to go walk
these two love laughter males upstairs and
[SPEAKER_01]: show you the pollen boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someday I would love a little cob barn for
pollen collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go into the boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're doing pollen collection,
you need water and a spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will mist off my arms and hands after
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were to go out into the main farm and
I would definitely prefer to change
[SPEAKER_01]: clothes, but you could just mist your
whole body off to kill the pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to take a look at these pollen
boxes here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My first prototype was a cardboard box,
but after a season of cleaning them in
[SPEAKER_01]: between these use, they were done for and
the wardrobe boxes were pretty expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I did with the wardrobe boxes,
I would pre-slit the sides, tape them back
[SPEAKER_01]: up, had an extra square of cardboard at
the bottom for the plate, but this is much
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a sliding drawer at the bottom
with a plexiglass sheet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're numbered.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one here is 33.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll sit in the jar of water there for
a couple of days a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if I don't have a lot of males
to move through, I'll let them just get
[SPEAKER_01]: completely dry, let them suck up all the
water.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes if you'll notice a male will be
really thirsty and it hasn't dropped its
[SPEAKER_01]: pollen, you might have to refill that jar
of water a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do a light nutrient solution in
your jar of water to give them a little
[SPEAKER_01]: extra.
[SPEAKER_01]: This room is well lit, which is helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe David with Silver Dragon Farms,
he adopted this tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he does it in the dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we have a lid with a hole in the
middle and we stir up some pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll show you later.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a nice looking male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Zoom in on the flowers here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the ideal time to cut a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: Per bud, you see one pollen sack open.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you were concerned about it,
you wouldn't let one open.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would let it get chunky, start to
open, cut it, jar it.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a male like that, you might need to
refill the jar a couple of times for the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrient solution to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will drop pollen in a jar of water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't need a box, you can just put
that jar of water over parchment paper on
[SPEAKER_01]: a counter.
[SPEAKER_01]: In one male, just move them around your
house.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure they're not getting wind.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can collect pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lemonhead F3.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is that Tahoe Kim from Willets that
my buddy made.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really nice one.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least the F1, really hard to collect
pollen from, which is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times the male buds match the
female buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the case with that F1 where it had
nice, chunky, dense buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very sparse pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This F3 now, that's going to get some
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're hitting about 3% terpenes in our
no-till living soil with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: 25 to 30% total cannabinoids, mostly THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, relaxing, indica body high.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it was nice because it wasn't
psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of gonjas are so psychoactive for
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a relaxing body high,
but this one, lemonhead, was really nice
[SPEAKER_01]: and relaxed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually looking forward to smoking
some of the fresh stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you filming?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You get a look at the structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Out of all the lemonhead males we're
keeping, which is maybe 10 of them because
[SPEAKER_01]: I have different lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a beautiful bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why you want to keep more than one
male per variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see them flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see their full expression.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a gorgeous male flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're edible too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very light stimulant pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a beautiful bouquet of lemonhead
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to try?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the newest delicacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, in between males, you just mist
yourself off, mist off your tools.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way you're reducing
cross-pollination, which will happen on a
[SPEAKER_01]: craft farm like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really easy to tell when you get a
purple plant where you shouldn't have one,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's usually just one pollen grain,
either making it in the field or
[SPEAKER_01]: collecting it in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to look for herms in your males.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find, keeping large populations of males
the past couple of years, I find more
[SPEAKER_01]: hermaphrodites in the male garden than you
do in the females.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're sneaky and it's just some hairs on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really one good thing to look out
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can see which ones are having more or
less pest damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always good to take notes on,
but definitely look out for hermaphrodites
[SPEAKER_01]: in your males, almost more than your
females, from my experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you keep that pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it'll have that trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to breed purposefully if
we're intersex.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main reason I strip away the leaves is
you just fit more bouquets, more stems in
[SPEAKER_01]: the jar that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I go to dump these out of the jar,
it's molded and rotted out in the jar by
[SPEAKER_01]: the time, if I let them go long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you'll find that little sneaky
hermaphrodite as you're harvesting the
[SPEAKER_01]: male.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely good to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something that I've just discovered,
keeping large populations of males.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't come across any this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another reason to keep more than
one male per variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes the pollen doesn't collect.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the onset of the hemp aphids,
it's even good to spray your male garden,
[SPEAKER_01]: your male plants, because too many aphids
can ruin the pollen in your collection
[SPEAKER_01]: boxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just soap is good enough preventative to
knock back the aphids, because they will
[SPEAKER_01]: destroy trays of pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do they do in the pollen?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like they're shedding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just cakes it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they're excretion.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see we do have a light wind blowing
this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also see which way the wind's blowing
and kind of do my harvest that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think with the empty boxes we have
upstairs, we're going to be able to clear
[SPEAKER_01]: out the majority of this male garden
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, we'll run these up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put a little pollen box, because we just
want to prevent the wind from hitting
[SPEAKER_01]: these.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even a slight breeze so that when the
pollen drop, it just falls to the bottom
[SPEAKER_01]: of the box.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I take the male flowers out of the
pollen box, I dip them in water,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it's definitely a jidam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubbling up real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just filled this up last night.
[SPEAKER_01]: This area here doesn't get harvested.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a crossover branch, and anything
that's touched.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank God pollen's not in the metric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine having to track and trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't have been in the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really no psychoactive use for
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is basically hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you mean, me and Max have been
smoking these?
[SPEAKER_03]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been smoking these.
[SPEAKER_01]: The males?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just for fun?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it working?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just kidding.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone told me that they've smoked pollen
on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: I already harvested the Lemonhead Skittles
males.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are all just different Lemonhead
females.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was three different seed lots of
Lemonhead F3s.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also important to take your seed lots
down different lines, because it's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of work to take a line down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go different forks, you have more
of a chance that if you made a mistake
[SPEAKER_01]: with one, you didn't make it with the
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when you get several lines way down
the road to your F8 generation,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you can cross those with each other
and easily exchange traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, oh, this one's got the nose and the
smell, but this one has the pest
[SPEAKER_01]: resistance, so you cross them together.
[SPEAKER_01]: That new can transfer those traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Dude Bros Fires.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, so now we have a male bouquet
that's been in our pollen boxes for
[SPEAKER_01]: several days.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, actually, the flowers are
starting to dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have this high-tech device here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a plexiglass lid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're gonna shake this baby up and send
that pollen down to our plexiglass sheet
[SPEAKER_01]: in the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, he's a duster.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll give it a few minutes to settle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, sterilizing your instruments in
between use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're gonna remove this old bouquet
here, take it over to our disposal tub,
[SPEAKER_01]: which, you know, if you're into the
natural farming, you know, this is just
[SPEAKER_01]: your JDOM here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm gonna mist it as I put it in
there, because there's pollen on the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give it a little rinse.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, and I was right, that was a coffee
seedlot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those coffees just dump pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this coffee F6 seedlot B.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're gonna remove our tray very
carefully, always take a big breath in and
[SPEAKER_01]: hold it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is Kate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now before I touch anything, I get out my
jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: My silica packet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't skip on your silica packets.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, make sure you get a good one,
because that's gonna protect your pollen
[SPEAKER_01]: and your harvest and prevent it from
caking if it's not quite dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coffee F6 seedlot B.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, some people would run this
through a sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just use a couple cards to very
carefully remove the plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just because they're easy to clean and dry
in between uses, because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do 10 boxes in a row or 15 boxes in a
row.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just gonna hold very light pressure
here in my hand, and it's just removing
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'll bring the plant material over the
area that I scraped.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, I mean, if you wanted to,
you could run this material through a
[SPEAKER_01]: sieve, but I mean, this is gonna be more
pollen than you're gonna need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you could even take this material,
put it into a bag or a pollen sleeve and
[SPEAKER_01]: put that around a plant and use that dry
material that we're scraping off the table
[SPEAKER_01]: there to make a branch of seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've seen some people do that tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Forest with Sunroots uses that
tech, where they put the bag over the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely a safe way.
[SPEAKER_01]: To make seeds in your flower garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I usually store this pollen,
you know, in a cool, dry, dark room while
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using it for the pollination season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I put it into single-use jars and
into the freezer for long-term use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because pollen's only viable for about 20
minutes after it thaws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if your plant material was totally
dry, you wouldn't need to separate it from
[SPEAKER_01]: your pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, just in case there's any
moisture in here and just for,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, for long-term storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when I do my single-use jars for
the freezer, I do take apart a silica
[SPEAKER_01]: packet and I put silica packets in the
little jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the pollen and in the vacuum seal,
the jars into a vacuum seal bag with more
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture protectors.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, because of the work involved in
pollen collection and preservation,
[SPEAKER_01]: I really want to make sure that you're
going to be able to use that pollen again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of that work is the risk
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because most people are also growing
flowers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's looking pretty clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the money shot here as we get this in
the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a lot of yellow cake, remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, not actual radioactive material,
pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my current one and an old one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're nice, like the thin card on that,
you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I got a very wet rag here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I do the same thing to the pollen
boxes, spray and wipe.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of pollen in this material
left on the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really get it wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes when you even stream it,
it's like pollen will come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's nice to like have a mister and a
little stream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you see that there's still some dust
still kicking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot too, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, trade secrets here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, part of the regenerative
agriculture is community and sharing of
[SPEAKER_01]: information, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know, saving trade secret
tech is part of the problem in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's basically like,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, Jerry Lotus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need a better lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could plug in a light there.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's all good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's fucking gnarly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not up to a...
[SPEAKER_04]: Or a filmmakers union code.
[SPEAKER_04]: This wire should be taped down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, Jerry Lotus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jerry Lotus, Jerry Lotus, Jerry Lotus.
Jerry Lotus, Jerry Lotus, Jerry Lotus,
Jerry Lotus.
