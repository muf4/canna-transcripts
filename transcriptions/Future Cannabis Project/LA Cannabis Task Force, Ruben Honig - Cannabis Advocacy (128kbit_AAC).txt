[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, my name is Ruben Honig.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the executive director of the LA
Cannabis Task Force.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all for coming out tonight and
thank you Jackie for putting this on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to give you a very quick and
passionate speech with less smiles today
[SPEAKER_00]: because we are in a dire situation right
now in the city of Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: The city proposed regulations about two
weeks ago and the fundamental structure of
[SPEAKER_00]: those regulations are based upon a
certificate of compliance for businesses
[SPEAKER_00]: with limited immunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without getting into detail into that,
that is not a business permit,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not a license, and it's really
vilifying the industry and treating us
[SPEAKER_00]: like criminals still.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I ask that everybody on Thursday comes
out to probably the most important
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there have been so many hearings in
the city of LA, but on Thursday there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: planning meeting hearing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's at 10 to 12 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: in room 1010 at City Hall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The task force is going to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're mobilizing all organizations are
going to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're mobilizing everybody to come out to
that meeting and we have to pack that room
[SPEAKER_00]: and tell the city council that we must be
licensed and permitted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will not settle for anything less and
they have to move on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care if they hide behind the city
attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care who drafted what.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now time that we're treated like
legitimate business people and that's all
[SPEAKER_00]: I really want to talk about tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
