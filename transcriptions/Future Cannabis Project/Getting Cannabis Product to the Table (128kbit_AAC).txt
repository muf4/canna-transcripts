[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a field operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about getting product to the table,
and I'm about helping farmers get product
[SPEAKER_00]: to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just absolutely immerse myself in the
science so that I can understand what
[SPEAKER_00]: product do I get to the table,
and how do I get it to the table,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how do I get around problems that are
coming from other industries that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when Abrams and I got to get
together, he came at me academically,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it wasn't aggressive in a negative
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like, I want to disprove or prove
your theory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once he saw that there was a validity
to it, which was awesome for me because it
[SPEAKER_00]: let me know I was on the right track,
because not every time does your theory
[SPEAKER_00]: work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we all have theories that aren't
quite accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then someone tells you, and you're
like, OK, I'll adjust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's called controlling your ego.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you subjugate your ego, you get better
information, you run down the road with
[SPEAKER_00]: the new material, and you do better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was able to say, hey, this is
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I use your material to go play my own
game with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, yeah, I'd love to,
because you guys can do stuff I can't do
[SPEAKER_00]: with diagnostic scatterplotting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the ability to use scientific
tools to measure things in ways I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys are statistical geniuses,
so you'll be able to see relationships in
[SPEAKER_00]: ways I can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we can start to see how varieties
really lay across a spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we can start to give people choices
that are accurate, dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity, or storefronts, whatever we
want to call the modern cannabis store,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to relate to the patient,
the customer that's coming in,
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, look, what are you seeking?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you'd like a range of products that
reflect reality, I can give you a range
[SPEAKER_00]: here in ways that you like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you like flavor spectrums,
I can give you stuff in similar flavonoid
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles, but on a gradient that'll say
similar experience through the mouth,
[SPEAKER_00]: but radical different experience in your
head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that way, what we do is we start to be
able to really work with a knowledge base
[SPEAKER_00]: on customers, which then as producers,
it allows us to be able to produce at a
[SPEAKER_00]: smarter level versus strained du jour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is a constant new thing,
new thing, new thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, you renamed it seven times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still Mendo perp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it's still Mendo perp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't give a shit what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: DNA it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, it's a perp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why would you want to have 17
different perps?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same with a lot of the OGs is
you find the best OGs and that's what you
[SPEAKER_00]: work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get rid of a lot of these
redundant lower quality ones that people
[SPEAKER_00]: are playing with because ultimately the
buyer comes in and they look at it and
[SPEAKER_00]: they go, there's 42 different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I went into a dispensary in
Seattle, my partner owns Dockside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dockside is the largest distributor
dispensary in Seattle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I go in there, they got like 700
varieties, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: The board that's on the wall, it looks
like you're at a racetrack with so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different horses running.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, how would any customer ever
get to understand what they were looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I make it easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me something gassy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me something floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ask the buddenda, what are you into?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they go, oh, easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's gassy that's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's floral that's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been really enjoying this one
recently.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a single sentence, I just knocked
out 697 farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slow velocity and they sit and they get
something called dust in the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But ultimately the people believe there
needs to be variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order for you to compete with these
other dispensaries, you have to have the
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise they say truncated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like for me at my new spot,
I did the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I shrunk it down because I know that the
majority of my market is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: tourists coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to have locals coming through so
we can cover some very high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: products that the locals want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to make sure that there's a
gradient in what's available and in
[SPEAKER_00]: pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not just trying to target and peel
you because I don't agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came from a different background.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a successful family, but I came
out of the hood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all the years you're in it,
you start to realize that not everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: has a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore me beating you to death on
price all the time isn't the way to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a specific group.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a specific group pays premium prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other people pay less prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference is in nuance, not in
overall quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality is quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: The nuances of the rarity, the very
distinctions of what allow the separation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I want these gradients at my new
store, but I want a truncated selection so
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you come in, it only takes you
10 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You walk in, what do you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: We got all this stuff right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what does this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then go great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can buy it, leave, and they can go and
do their thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise you're in there for two hours
and you're shopping and you're exploring
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're wondering and it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two hours of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't agree with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also don't agree with the fact that
you take on 700 farms and you're only
[SPEAKER_00]: moving the product from 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not that, and Dockside's a
fantastic dispensary in all aspects and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's managed well and it's got quality
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to me, it's an example of everything
that's done right in normal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But having to respond to the lack of
market knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we get market knowledge where the
market starts to become educated,
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you allow anybody to educate them
other than the cultivators, we're screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everybody who's trying to educate
them is trying to educate them on fancy
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes and killer packaging and a nifty new
thing.
