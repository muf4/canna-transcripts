[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's give it a go dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it's gonna be my first time using
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's heat it up We'll start low that way
he can do a press and we'll bump the temp
[SPEAKER_02]: up for him I did bring some material it
has I didn't I apologize.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know we got some here You can
press some of ours because I'd like let me
[SPEAKER_05]: do Those are for a cotton mouth and they'd
work very very well they're from C's candy
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know what this is cool I've never
like to sponsor me at any point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen anybody press my wash I've
pressed other people's washes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't I don't prefer that I don't
prefer wash you know pressing So this is
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna be fun because number one I've never
used this machine number one right right
[SPEAKER_02]: and using a new press is like driving
somebody's car else's car It's beyond
[SPEAKER_02]: driving someone else's car so in this
particular situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have feel the same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like okay How does I never even press
on a plate so small what makes it move?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a manual perfect, okay?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I feel it manual.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that It's when it's a hydraulic
press is when I have to dial it in because
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah You you have to learn what it wants
to do and how to control it Where now it's
[SPEAKER_02]: your fingers, so that's great so you want
this plug in all right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's heat her up Yeah, or bring it
back that way slight one or So yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's manageable and then Just top and
bottom so it's basic simple Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: it looks like you're just heating it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got to see how it performs with
the material that I have No, no that
[SPEAKER_02]: should be funny, so in the meantime.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna you have gloves
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet you can even go a little further if
you want well, I gotta break this hash up
[SPEAKER_02]: Now this Hash is not in your ideal
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not in a freezer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has actually already gummed up So more
than likely yes, and and and I'm okay with
[SPEAKER_02]: it Still work exactly good hash and it's
gonna come out good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all in the How well did you wash it
is what it comes down to?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I I can really mess up this wash
if I don't pay attention to it So what
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of a press do you guys use I use a
flux rosin press?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's huge
[SPEAKER_02]: I I mean I have a couple of presses my
preference Okay, my my first press I got
[SPEAKER_02]: was made by CRD ink they're out of the
Ventura and That was like if you go to
[SPEAKER_02]: like the very bottom of this page I got
like one of the first one or two that he
[SPEAKER_02]: made And that thing was workhorse I
pressed a lot of rosin out of that you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: see a lot of my big waterfalls were on
that press and then the real IOG gifted us
[SPEAKER_05]: the Sasquatch V1 that's what I rock I rock
the it's a V2 but it's so old that it
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't have an open back Like the back is
like plated off.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never liked the V1 It sucks like if you
if you blow out a bag you almost have to
[SPEAKER_05]: take it all apart to be able to clean
behind it there was And they're they're
[SPEAKER_05]: super gnarly dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're heavy as hell so and then With
just Not wanting to buy the same presses
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've already got big plates I decided
to go with the rosin technologies,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a tiny little like this is the
puff I'll show you This is the puck,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I do four gram pucks,
so this is a puck maker But I press four
[SPEAKER_02]: grams, you know that allows me to do a
fast that like, you know The more material
[SPEAKER_02]: you're pressing the longer you have to
press it It's just more material to heat
[SPEAKER_02]: it up on this too.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have parchment paper There's some paper
and it came with it look at it matches the
[SPEAKER_06]: company We're gonna press some Mac one by
LA Family Farms Then the 90 you what we
[SPEAKER_02]: just smoked that was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the way, it was really good And it's
cool to smoke somebody else's Mac like
[SPEAKER_05]: they're always very similar But they're
also different because everyone uses a
[SPEAKER_05]: different growers, you know different
techniques to grow so Like I saying this
[SPEAKER_02]: is the 90 you it's gummed up There's a
couple of ways to deal with it no matter
[SPEAKER_02]: what in my opinion it's still gonna press
the same Not all material is the same
[SPEAKER_02]: though just because you know Your material
gums up doesn't mean it's gonna be fired
[SPEAKER_02]: because there could be contaminants in
there, you know, so There's that for you
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to just hold it?
[SPEAKER_05]: You good?
[SPEAKER_05]: I can hold the camera for you if you want
That's
[SPEAKER_03]: that grape stomper
Oh, yeah
[SPEAKER_08]: Not always the funnest Sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: I normally have all this work prepped but
[SPEAKER_05]: Here I'll prep mine might as well right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Is that cool?
[SPEAKER_02]: You really don't mind jump in there
brother?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to see as long as you're okay with
it I'm happy with it The puffco peak
[SPEAKER_05]: Get a quartz banger and something that
Jolly Roger won't like me to talk about is
[SPEAKER_05]: get a Get the puffco rebuild It's called
puff coil repair and Your atomizer will
[SPEAKER_05]: actually burn hotter and better and use
the same amount of Battery life.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same ohms.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just a better wiring.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it actually just conducts heat better
You can get online puff coil repair And
[SPEAKER_05]: it's cheap too, it's like 70 bucks and you
get like 10 of them We don't have a scale
[SPEAKER_00]: do we?
[SPEAKER_02]: Dope you know what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got a way on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the rosin bag?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, what do you need?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got 37.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got 25 25, please Small spine,
okay this Yeah, I'll just do a small press
[SPEAKER_03]: 37 no, I'll do this.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fine because then they have this next
Yeah, yeah, that'll be fine Otherwise I
[SPEAKER_02]: have the screen but it's too small It's
gonna work just oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the fit from you if you got 15s
these right here, dude big cloth Check it
[SPEAKER_02]: out rosin evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, they fold them.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't fold.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I like folding now inside or outside
bags I flip all my bags outside inside
[SPEAKER_05]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's why oh, okay fold Yeah,
so but we're gonna see what I'm gonna do
[SPEAKER_02]: tonight because I'm gonna do the folding
technique using the rosin evolution bags
[SPEAKER_02]: because I thought I don't have my my
typical press.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, right, of course Yeah,
yeah, thanks, bro Thanks for leaving your
[SPEAKER_05]: fingerprints on there Didn't do the rock
bring and drop his elbow in there I Can't
[SPEAKER_05]: help you with that, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: I make hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yep and smoke a lot of weed and drink a
lot of water Do you drink beer?
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never actually drunk Beer in my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really fussy, but I do drink whiskey
like if I want to go get drunk or
[SPEAKER_05]: something But it'll be like whiskey and
coke Like I always like something sweet,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, I'm just not I'll drink socially
Yeah, like if I go to the bar with like a
[SPEAKER_05]: friend or whatever, but I don't even have
I don't even have a booze at my house
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, just fussy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's more like like a preference.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah preference thing It has nothing to do
with like getting drunk or something like
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So fussy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I Just don't think it tastes good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just think they all taste terrible So
I'm just like I'm not gonna go down that
[SPEAKER_05]: road.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's your opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you don't have to like
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but yeah We're gonna do a 10 gram
putt.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think I could probably get like eight in
here Fold it good You have an extra set of
[SPEAKER_02]: gloves I could steal yeah Well,
this is not my typical way of doing things
[SPEAKER_02]: by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are on the fly so if you Yeah,
mine would be like all fluffy and cold and
[SPEAKER_05]: sifted but it's definitely gonna work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're gonna still do it It's just
gonna be different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, don't mind if I do And I'm most likely
gonna end up going to about three minutes
[SPEAKER_02]: on this press coach we should probably you
know what we should do we should turn on
[SPEAKER_05]: the press and A little tip for the newbies
put the plates together.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll heat up faster and even so they're
both get to the same Temp at the same time
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not too tight just together touch
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh We got Celsius to great get the
calculator Google what's it set at In my
[SPEAKER_02]: freezer, okay, I made my own cool bot,
okay I don't know if you know what the
[SPEAKER_02]: cool bot is for hash makers cool bot is
what makes your regular wall AC your Mini
[SPEAKER_02]: splits go below 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's you can take it out 34 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, that little device is like three
four hundred bucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've made mine for like yeah, I made mine
for like 30 bucks however, listen to this
[SPEAKER_02]: folks if he's giving you information like
this you guys better device that that that
[SPEAKER_02]: Controls the on and off of the heating the
the thermostat to trick it into thinking
[SPEAKER_02]: that the room is over 60 degrees and The
device that monitors the temperature of my
[SPEAKER_02]: coil to make sure that the coil doesn't
freeze on me is in Celsius so I hate
[SPEAKER_02]: Celsius only because I don't understand
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing anytime I say I
don't like something is because I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: understand it and it's just being lazy of
not taking the time to learn what Celsius
[SPEAKER_02]: converts to so So no, I just get the cell
phone I just got additional thermostat
[SPEAKER_02]: thermocouple with the little line and I
just tap those and those read Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_02]: right above the Celsius, but now I got two
temperature sensors Ones in Celsius ones
[SPEAKER_02]: is Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_02]: This the Fahrenheit's just for me because
I'm too damn lazy You're just using it as
[SPEAKER_02]: literally like those are that's an extra
ten bucks That it cost me so I can just
[SPEAKER_02]: look at it and know what the you know the
temperature is because I I have other
[SPEAKER_02]: Equipment that is in Celsius and I got a
cheat sheet of all the temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: conversions on the site.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Yeah, so the end of the story learn
Celsius you don't need to spend an extra
[SPEAKER_05]: ten bucks it goes down pretty Quick just
FYI.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was set at 200.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want me to lower it to 180?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, please 180 179 I do that because
it's it's I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not 180 but it But when people say
what do you press that I say 180 so it's
[SPEAKER_02]: weird because it's like too many numbers
to say so it's like 179 or 180 so but I
[SPEAKER_02]: set it at 179 and it's you're gonna see
it's gonna be 180 181 So like like I set
[SPEAKER_05]: mine to 224 and it's usually always says
225 so It's already at 157 it says but I
[SPEAKER_05]: would still let it This is what it's going
up to the 35 I have no idea I think it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like a second thing like a I don't know
what this 35 is I don't have like a Manual
[SPEAKER_05]: for this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've never ran this company I think it has
something to do with this timer Because it
[SPEAKER_05]: says 35 s like seconds is what I believe
moving though, but I didn't hit the timer
[SPEAKER_05]: yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh Yeah, see 34.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, is that a built-in timer?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is that doing it?
[SPEAKER_05]: It felt like it sounded like something
else turned on And this little light came
[SPEAKER_05]: on to do we have an instruction manual by
chance no cheat sheet I think It's just a
[SPEAKER_06]: timer It's just a time Book maybe huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well that did heat up pretty quick that
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it What does the 35 s mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay Ross
[SPEAKER_02]: and evolution I'm a big fan of a lot of
their material I like their bags They're
[SPEAKER_02]: affordable number one number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: They work.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other affordable options out there
that don't work so That's why I like their
[SPEAKER_02]: bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're for I use rosin evolution always I
just switched over literally today.
[SPEAKER_05]: I press my first press with Rosin ink Now
I don't have my one ton arbor press that I
[SPEAKER_02]: would normally close To get a puck so I'm
gonna use my 165 pounds or whatever I can
[SPEAKER_02]: to press this puck Makes me want to do the
old-school shoe hash, you know like step
[SPEAKER_02]: on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember that you guys remember shoe hash
Put it in your shoe and walk around for a
[SPEAKER_02]: while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that should be all gummy People
don't know that back in the day
[SPEAKER_02]: It speeds up the process Minimize your
mistakes When you're working with hash,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's too It's too precious to make
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so I that's how I see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to just waste material You
[SPEAKER_05]: work so hard Yeah, it's very it's very
just self-explanatory It says thank you
[SPEAKER_05]: for purchasing it's about the same amount
of info you get from Rosin or from a
[SPEAKER_05]: harvest, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah I can just set this time for the
amount of time that he wants to press like
[SPEAKER_05]: Set the time 35 We're gonna do three I
have a timer you can do it Right on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Just let's use their gear then right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so when I'm ready to hit it,
I just hit it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you literally just hit timer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, okay So now it's set to 180 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is our little Mac puck that we
just made Okay So it's still gonna go good
[SPEAKER_02]: see that's one like it's still good
material, you know, it's still gonna do
[SPEAKER_02]: its thing All right
[SPEAKER_05]: It's for the top man the bottom plate
Yeah, I don't know why I would do that why
[SPEAKER_05]: why you would need to But it's weird.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's weird though when you do click
the timer button like watch Like something
[SPEAKER_05]: something something's clicking.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if it's just a diode in there
causing this
[SPEAKER_06]: The only thing that I don't like about
this is I don't know how hard I'm pressing
[SPEAKER_05]: but I guess you just kind of finger You're
just saying I am and this is manual is
[SPEAKER_02]: this is how I started with Those gloves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah Let me just finish this puck
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna double bag it with the 37
because I don't want to blow it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you want to put that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got two of them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool Yeah, whenever I use bags I should
have posted something that like like let
[SPEAKER_05]: me know Or I should know this Pete but I
should just post you know before I come
[SPEAKER_05]: here You know, hey, I'll be live on your
web page with future cannabis project
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, you know what I'm saying like at
least maybe get one or two more people
[SPEAKER_05]: looking on your YouTube page because I
just appreciate you having us here and
[SPEAKER_05]: Taking the time to listen to us idiots
talk about hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the thing you get us talking dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's hard to Stop us.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to tell us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you got tell me to shut up some like
I don't have many friends I'll go People
[SPEAKER_05]: that I that I consider family that there's
not they're few and far between especially
[SPEAKER_02]: as you get older and older The
relationships like I don't have much to
[SPEAKER_02]: talk about other than weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really difficult for me to And I
don't tell people what I do so I just you
[SPEAKER_05]: know, it's just oh it's funny having that
conversation with your grandma for the
[SPEAKER_05]: first time, you know You do what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're moving.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right I'm ready to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, you go there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no, I just need the gloves so I can
grab some hash one's fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're wet.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fine Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what I'm doing here.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, but I've been I've been here
[SPEAKER_04]: To glove in the house in the house left
method you can go backwards Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I have I have my you know,
it looks like it takes I I have a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: prep work that goes into our assembly
line, so I'm trying to recreate what is
[SPEAKER_04]: normally flawless already ready already
ready already I want to see the cool shit
[SPEAKER_05]: I definitely do like so much prep before I
go live because I just don't want to hear
[SPEAKER_05]: someone be like Yeah, really cool watching
you dump stuff into a bag idiot.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your work is though, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: This forget that man How many friggin
stickers?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're watching the office for two hours
just putting lids on jars or stickers on
[SPEAKER_05]: lids One man operations I got one helper
and he's like an absolute sweetheart.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank God.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's a he does stand-up paddling Like this
specifically almost a year like
[SPEAKER_05]: specifically, but I've been making hash
for 10 15 years growing for 10 15 years,
[SPEAKER_05]: so Making good high quality hash rosin and
properly with a rosin press and Learning
[SPEAKER_05]: the techniques and figuring this whole
thing out and trying to brand it and and
[SPEAKER_05]: have people like what I do I was just
making either BHO working in labs,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know Making pens growing flower
Because I mean I mean I'm doing the best I
[SPEAKER_05]: can with what I got so but there are
people that are like bothering me for
[SPEAKER_05]: these Massive orders from like up north
that I don't even know who they are I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: like, I can't provide you with like stuff
I first of all don't even have that sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of quantity on hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very I'm very small batch and very
like by myself I'm you know, so but
[SPEAKER_05]: they're just seeing the quality that's
coming out.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like well That's because I am so
small, you know, if I really try to do
[SPEAKER_05]: this on a grand mass scale I believe that
the quality would Hinder a bit,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, because if I feel like I'm not
doing it personally there's there's not
[SPEAKER_05]: too many people are out there that are
gonna be As a no one and up to my
[SPEAKER_05]: specifications They can give it up to some
of the big companies like 710 labs and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff like that that are out there Just
pumping out so much consistent quality
[SPEAKER_05]: hash.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're like, bro good on you guys You must
have a good crew because it's hard to
[SPEAKER_05]: trust a lot of people to be careful with
your product Like take so much time just
[SPEAKER_05]: to grow the weed itself, let alone process
the hash making Like every time I take on
[SPEAKER_02]: a new farmer It's it's it's scary and
literally like I get nervous I get
[SPEAKER_02]: concerned that I'm gonna I'm gonna fuck it
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah That's my biggest fear is having
to explain to them that I fucked up,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know And then a lot of times I used to
think that it was me Sometimes it's them
[SPEAKER_02]: and they provided you with a shit product
and then it's another and then another
[SPEAKER_02]: headache And I'm not the kind of I'm not
I'm not the kind of guy that wants to
[SPEAKER_02]: bring Brad news I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want I want I want to come back and be
like look what the stuff you did I I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to polish what you made, you know,
and and Unfortunately, the my biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: thing is you know, so I'll usually be
like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is gonna be better off like diamonds
or bho processed, you know That's gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: I told them straight out.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, so I was trying to like Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah exactly there hasn't been a farm door
I feel confident That I can do the Do the
[SPEAKER_02]: work at the level that I'm able to do I'm
only able to produce this type of quality
[SPEAKER_02]: because the way they grow Yeah,
it's it's all about the starting material
[SPEAKER_07]: really Why it's like what there's like
fine vintages there's like it's like it's
[SPEAKER_07]: more it's like wine and some some strains
and some years and some Vintages will be
[SPEAKER_07]: better than others and of course have more
absolutely and that's why it's and it's
[SPEAKER_07]: based on the weather that year.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah So wine is very similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well the French you can't have a Very
special old hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I learned from Frenchie.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was My mentor we met at Frenchie's
event I'm just expressing what you did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm just polishing what the the
farmer did I can't make their product look
[SPEAKER_02]: better than what it already was I can just
so all I'm doing is literally just gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: make a puck that'll like it I'll double
bag it and we'll see what we can do.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is nine point Three five,
I believe just over nine three I'm just
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to make the best square.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can you want is a puck or you can I'll
just rock it It's good hash I can tell
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gonna be moldable and work well I
always I always I always press and wash to
[SPEAKER_02]: music Yeah, like I have to like when I
wash I have to have music when I press
[SPEAKER_02]: like I have to have music it's it's it's
part of You don't if you guys can see what
[SPEAKER_02]: I do behind my press when I'm press I
watch a lot of goofy cartoons too I do I
[SPEAKER_02]: dance bro after a press.
[SPEAKER_02]: I fucking do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it's a good When you're by yourself
you get you get excited at least I do I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know that you already move the
temp though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm ready though.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's at one 180 for you
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, I'm gonna have to take a knee in
front
[SPEAKER_02]: of it It's super heavy Or just some slides
over no, there we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need to get a kneel down so I can
eyeball it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh careful check that out
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's our timer now Let me know when you
want to start it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just gonna go up right?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's dropping from three minutes 180
seconds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's what three minutes is I believe
60 times 3 is 180 unless I'm not good with
[SPEAKER_05]: math Ask Google.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh that rosin tech dude get get that dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cheap shameless plug by all means.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't go down Sorry guys The battery is
getting low but oh my god.
[SPEAKER_05]: These gloves are so small for my hands.
[SPEAKER_05]: My fingers are turning them You got fat
fingers So, yeah, this is a slow process
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's not It's three minutes we're
gonna go I Normally would like lights in
[SPEAKER_02]: there so I wouldn't put yeah, I have like
big bright light going in here Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to see what's happening If you take
close up, it's starting it's melting break
[SPEAKER_02]: and sweat break and sweat see that Right
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're breaking sweat Yeah, here you go.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll help you out Little better at least
Oh, yeah, but you can now and we can show
[SPEAKER_02]: them I don't want to get my fingers full
of rosin, but we're flowing and now we're
[SPEAKER_02]: taking so I want to flow I don't want cake
Yeah, it helps time a stable table
[SPEAKER_01]: Holding the table for you, but this thing
yeah, I know I saw that You gotta hold it
[SPEAKER_01]: as I pull I do at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: We get a little flow here We're only at
two minutes
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, all important very important
everything matters it's flown look great
[SPEAKER_05]: color Great color this could get better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good job George dial this in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, thanks, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like I always do another one great
man, but it'll get better and I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: pull for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a new press for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see the flow much I mean it is
flowing but we can maximize our you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can pull the best quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're pulling quality, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We almost did three minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's annoying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah We'll never do that again We're doing
it because that's the way this one is
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, normally when I press it goes off to
the sides and I don't open it until it's
[SPEAKER_02]: cooled off So this right now I would
prefer to put it on Something cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all we got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apologize Because I again turf
preservation is what we're going for It's
[SPEAKER_02]: hot so it's just reeking and it's just
everything's changing right now everything
[SPEAKER_02]: is changing So I want to stop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's that's how I make mine he
Preserves that heat and allows that heat
[SPEAKER_02]: to create vacuum which actually creates
more heat because vacuum and Heat changes
[SPEAKER_02]: when you're under vacuum 90 degrees is
equivalent to like a hundred and
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Google it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: So different techniques create different
textures So just because he went in at 225
[SPEAKER_02]: and he vacuums it he's probably at a
higher temperature for momentarily when
[SPEAKER_02]: he's at 80 he's potentially at a higher
temp, but the Melting effect is not
[SPEAKER_02]: affecting it as much if he had direct 220
degrees versus vacuum that
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, but I don't like to I don't I
prefer long cured.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, like tomorrow It's not gonna smell
the same right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's hot Yeah, yeah, yeah,
that's like I said why do I Yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: I do not I do I'm a coin material I
Secured on the inside if that shell
[SPEAKER_02]: Creates a protective layer and everything
on the inside is just like it's locked And
[SPEAKER_02]: it eats itself up and a jar tech type of
style.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that inner texture It's done properly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm sure it can happen, but it's not
it's like so unlikely yeah, so like for
[SPEAKER_05]: something to happen in that 13 years,
it's very Likely that something can go
[SPEAKER_05]: wrong or it can get smashed or it can get
you know compromised by weather or
[SPEAKER_07]: Whatever texture that's yeah, that's I
personally believe there's a shelf life on
[SPEAKER_05]: this hash for sure like six months has a
shorter shelf life Yeah, when you're
[SPEAKER_02]: heating it up When you use a jar tech
because you've already Accelerated the
[SPEAKER_02]: decarboxylation process you have changed
the THCA the majority of this material
[SPEAKER_02]: right here in this hash is THCA majority
of the cannabinoids that are in this hash
[SPEAKER_02]: are acids That's how it's white as we
start deep the decarboxylation process the
[SPEAKER_02]: natural process of nature As the plant is
already changing those heads as it's
[SPEAKER_02]: finishing just in the percent ratios are
different so once you Cut it that plant
[SPEAKER_02]: dies that's still continuing it It
intensifies the the decarboxylation effect
[SPEAKER_02]: as it's hanging and drying So during that
process you still have a lot of acids and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's why it's important to process fresh
material The older it gets you can freeze
[SPEAKER_02]: it you can put in the refrigerator You're
only going to delay the inevitable it
[SPEAKER_02]: naturally will do that So just if you get
fresh material just process it as fast as
[SPEAKER_02]: you can don't think that your freezer is
gonna save it for a year It's gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: change, you know, it's gonna change.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't I don't believe it's gonna It's
gonna get screwed up in your freezer the
[SPEAKER_05]: longer you keep it in there for sure Like
I know running BHO I've had runs where
[SPEAKER_05]: that it's been a year later and it still
came out good, but I think for this
[SPEAKER_05]: Letting it freeze for that long
something's there's something's happening
[SPEAKER_05]: to the heads Me I'm like almost immediate
I cut it down and it's like Wash within a
[SPEAKER_05]: week of the cut down the longest that's
only if I have a whole bunch of Stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: going on with it We are not in the ideal
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Like to be under makes I like 65 degrees
for my pressing room It allows me to
[SPEAKER_02]: handle the material without it getting too
cold where the material gets brittle and
[SPEAKER_02]: like shatter like and just Shatters and if
it's too warm, you can't manipulate it
[SPEAKER_02]: with your fingers Because we our hands are
98 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though we're wearing gloves in a
65 degree room If I touch this for just
[SPEAKER_02]: five ten seconds, you know seconds matter
it starts to stick so and gum up and now
[SPEAKER_02]: you got hash on your fingers and Wasted
hash that doesn't get accounted for at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end of your processing, you know So
[SPEAKER_05]: No, he's going to 210 Yeah, but I'm not
gonna use that stupid loud Someone said
[SPEAKER_06]: someone says can you guys talk about plate
sizes versus bag sizes when pressing
[SPEAKER_05]: bubble also freeze-drying times Freeze
dryer that well, excuse me the new freeze
[SPEAKER_05]: dryers kind of do it all on itself the
pharmaceutical one is literally set up for
[SPEAKER_05]: almost hash basically and It senses it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that set at though?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what is it automatically set at?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's the hours that it runs like?
[SPEAKER_05]: Mine is different every time it does a
batch run.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's actually testing all this
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then once it Yeah, the harvest,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Yeah, the new pharmaceutical one.
[SPEAKER_05]: It actually says like doing batch test run
So it's doing all these different tests
[SPEAKER_05]: there I think there's like 24 of them and
then it literally kicks on and Gives it
[SPEAKER_05]: like an automatic time based on how much
hash you have in the freezer because I've
[SPEAKER_05]: had it where it kicks on and it's like 36
hour dry time when I had a ton of Hash in
[SPEAKER_06]: there and then I put less hash in there
and it dries a little bit faster And then
[SPEAKER_07]: they also asked about plate sizes Plate
sizes are important Plate sites plate
[SPEAKER_02]: sizes are very important to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, very everything every time your
plate sizes change You have to change your
[SPEAKER_02]: method and you you're you have to create
your own method based on the plate size
[SPEAKER_02]: For example this plate size.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not want to press a 20 gram puck
on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's too small It's too small for 20 gram
puck.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I looked at it my first I was like
10 gram puck boom That's why I brought
[SPEAKER_02]: different pucks Because I didn't know what
this guy was gonna look like.
[SPEAKER_02]: I brought a 4 gram puck I got a 20 gram
puck and I got a 10 gram puck So this
[SPEAKER_06]: would be like Iron Chef where it's like
your secret tool is a rosin press of a
[SPEAKER_06]: specific size.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what Hash makers are craftsmen
Literally, we are craftsmen.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got tool belts We are guys that get our
hands dirty.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to do things with our hands
[SPEAKER_02]: 100% 100% even if I see it out there in
the market I'm like I'm gonna pay you 400
[SPEAKER_02]: bucks for that $25 piece of crap.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, but that's that's how I look at
stuff Sometimes like if I know that I can
[SPEAKER_02]: recreate that and like why would I spend
the money?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then there's sometimes are you just like
you know what just buy it Why because I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't really do that like the rosin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I could do it, but it's not as easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh hell No, yeah technology's press is
badass and There's no way in hell I could
[SPEAKER_02]: duplicate that so you drop the money on
Mine is this size is a two by three.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, go for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a two by three size It's the size of
this bottom right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I I like small presses I prefer I can
see what's happening with my rosin I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: like the ability not to see what's
happening on the sides I don't I mean I
[SPEAKER_02]: like see what we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to like Look at what's
happening and if you I'm only doing that
[SPEAKER_05]: though because I'm not used to this press
I press I don't have to do it because I've
[SPEAKER_05]: done it so many times that like Mine's
huge mine's like 16 inches by like seven
[SPEAKER_05]: or eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's massive Yeah, that's that's a big
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: My largest is as 14 inches long four
inches wide That's the largest one that I
[SPEAKER_02]: have that's the one I used I started on
pressing flour You might want to get close
[SPEAKER_05]: in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks pretty bitching gonna dump,
huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: It should have a higher flow yeah For at
home and like small little press this
[SPEAKER_05]: thing's pretty bitching Yeah, but you're
not gonna be able to do a massive
[SPEAKER_05]: workload.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much, man Yeah, and this
should be bolted to a table and like the
[SPEAKER_05]: table yeah very Is there like the least
ideal conditions possible?
[SPEAKER_05]: You see the whole table completely fall in
half or like This is why stoners can't
[SPEAKER_05]: have nice things That's about good I went
for I only went for like two and a half
[SPEAKER_05]: minutes Because it's such a smaller press
like an amount that that's still really
[SPEAKER_04]: good Sorry How you doing there Tom you
okay, but all right all right just making
[SPEAKER_02]: sure That's why I don't like these double
bags it killed my yield We'll see what
[SPEAKER_02]: happened well, I know what this this
material has potential But the size of
[SPEAKER_02]: your plates affect the amount Of pressure
that you apply the smaller the plate you
[SPEAKER_02]: need less pressure the larger the plate
you need more pressure Quality plates
[SPEAKER_05]: really make a difference too because the
if you're not getting even pressure
[SPEAKER_05]: Throughout the entire plate and the plate
will shift or twist You're not gonna have
[SPEAKER_05]: a good quality press.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, especially if you're trying to do a
lot at once This like buttered up
[SPEAKER_05]: immediately and looks so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to smoke this You only got 40% on
my yield Which is not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is this is a 65 plus Squirter 60 68
should be 60 so that tells me on my next
[SPEAKER_02]: press I got to go a little bit longer
possibly or a little harder I'm a light
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's kind of hard to get a full like
yeah It's kind of hard to really get your
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure into that thing Here this is what
you want to see I got it I got it Either
[SPEAKER_00]: way it's still gonna tip somebody just has
to hold it, but we're getting gummy now
[SPEAKER_02]: This should be a little bit more tacky
because of the heat So it tends to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit easier to handle but that's why
temperatures are so important in my
[SPEAKER_05]: situation I'll give you an exact
percentage of what I got back by weighing
[SPEAKER_05]: this Because I can just weigh the bags Do
the math and then do the math of the 9.3
[SPEAKER_05]: that I put in that was which total yeah,
you weighed the whole thing With the bags
[SPEAKER_05]: in there at nine point and I put these
inside out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah seems in right now No, you just seems
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I'm the only one that doesn't
everyone thinks I'm crazy, but I'd never
[SPEAKER_05]: look at how flat that is It looks perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was a great school.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's let's see what I got back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have two of those?
[SPEAKER_05]: 25s two of those small 25s I can borrow
real quick to get a little screen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah, tear it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's Okay Oh man, you're the best
[SPEAKER_04]: 25ers should be in the bag you need Oh,
yeah, the exact same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just I'll put two on there My bad Tear and
then we'll see how much this weighs So
[SPEAKER_05]: there was 9.3 and now there's two left.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I got like 75 76% I think that's that's
off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more in line with what it should be
doing see and I noticed that From past
[SPEAKER_02]: experiences the bigger the plates the
harder the temps you have to go to achieve
[SPEAKER_02]: the higher percentages So what I attempted
to do was recreate what I normally would
[SPEAKER_02]: do on my smaller press, which is at 180
degrees And my press is maxed out at 3,000
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds and I only use 80% of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even go 76 exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's that's that's that's where it
should be.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's now it's like alright, let's do
that and keep doing it That's you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's that's and this looks really
freaking good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to smoke this right now Like dude,
there's nothing stopping us from doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that, dude Good job, buddy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: You too, dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's nice That was that two minutes like
I press for like four but I'm also doing a
[SPEAKER_05]: little bit bigger of a bag, you know,
whatever but man, what a good Thanks Tom,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's all you bud Yeah And like I always
say I always tend to be safe on my first I
[SPEAKER_02]: just have it in me not to over squish not
to overheat So it's like you people people
[SPEAKER_05]: freak out on me though that with that like
because I turn it up so hot They're like
[SPEAKER_05]: it's gonna burn it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's gonna burn it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just is that brown at all when I used
to press my you know My big plates so
[SPEAKER_02]: that's where I was at I was over 200 220,
you know to get a good good Squeeze out
[SPEAKER_02]: you need to to the bigger plates
Production it's almost about the same the
[SPEAKER_02]: amount of you know, because the squish
time I'm only doing 50 seconds,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know per four grams so if you do 444
it's at 12 grams three minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do 10 grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're roughly three minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's almost about the same time We're
losing using one bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all preference though, you know
people like Nikes or Adidas, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like what do you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is what works you do for the fact
that it looks like butter?
[SPEAKER_05]: So crazy that looks so good, dude Good
job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know you too man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is collaboration right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never had anybody press my material
That's what's cool that I've washed I
[SPEAKER_05]: mean, I can't you know what I mean can't
say I've yeah Nobody's ever came in and
[SPEAKER_02]: pressed your stuff where I've pressed
other people's stuff that they've washed
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm not always Excited about that
opportunity, you know for my first time I
[SPEAKER_05]: actually got asked that they're like hey,
I have a bunch that I have a freeze dryer
[SPEAKER_05]: of everything But I don't have a press
will you press for me?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like you put in all that time and
effort you grow and you have a freeze
[SPEAKER_05]: dryer But you don't have a press.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, yeah, no problem Some people
trip out but the more you do it it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like snowboarding you going down the
biggest hill on the first try Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: it sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: But once you've done it 30 times,
it's like cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah It is your experience level,
you know either doing the diamonds or
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing the blues or the green That's
a great return and this is only that's
[SPEAKER_05]: only that part you got this part there's a
whole nother part over there
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you do you play with
temperatures you play with different
[SPEAKER_02]: things and It'll do different and it'll
look different.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're gonna see his different from this
texture Yeah, mine's a little more
[SPEAKER_05]: buttery, but that's just cuz it went
hotter but This stuff looks insane good
[SPEAKER_05]: Came out amazing I'm so surprised like it
looks like butter, but you can just grab
[SPEAKER_07]: it And it's nice and cold in here too,
yeah, so Definitely got a dab definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: got a dab on your finger that I'll smoke
Speaking of dabs to smoke I'm about to try
[SPEAKER_05]: that man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a fresh-pressed person,
but that's Really good Is that okay George
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, please you well, I do my cure I do my
cure Usually and like he said I believe
[SPEAKER_05]: you get less taste on the fresh press
Especially like directly after pressing
[SPEAKER_05]: But we've all we all do it we all do it y
'all curious, you know, you're wondering
[SPEAKER_05]: okay Cuz we all do it And in all honesty,
I've had some stuff that was like it was
[SPEAKER_05]: like oranges it smelled like oranges It
was amazing and I still have the jar and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's about two months old and now it
smells like salsa like insane Hot spicy
[SPEAKER_05]: tapatio salsa or something you're like
what happened and it's still when you
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke it is Delicious still has that
orange taste.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, no it took it took that two months
like every time I opened it smell like
[SPEAKER_05]: oranges oranges just immediately oranges
and then one day like I probably didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: open it for two weeks or something and I
Opened it and it literally smelled like
[SPEAKER_05]: salsa and I'm like, how did that happen?
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's still amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wish I had brought it with me so you
guys could smell it I feel like all this
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just ate off my fingers is gonna make me
super high It's a lot of acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there's there's partial decarb out
there It's gonna make your teeth much more
[SPEAKER_05]: sticky then it's gonna get you high Yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: Little terpy huh get some of those get
some of those jelly beans in you too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That'll be a perfect little mix,
you know So there is a difference in in
[SPEAKER_05]: what The textures if you flatten that out
it might look a little more like very
[SPEAKER_02]: close like yeah similar texture wise it
not sure I haven't touched it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry mine is actually pretty damn stable.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was surprised Pardon me They're both
exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is that 180.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they're both from you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they're both Yeah, they're exactly
the same pressed at 180 Yeah, and what
[SPEAKER_02]: Bragg's did you use I had 25 so 25 and a
37 Okay, and you use 25 25.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you use 225.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_05]: I did 25 and a 37 and we're used and
you're still worried about you think that
[SPEAKER_05]: You're gonna lose at at the lower
percentage at the it's all about like
[SPEAKER_02]: again like all right We're gonna talk,
you know higher temps Then you can
[SPEAKER_02]: actually push that out through your bags a
lot right because you've got hotter temps.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna get higher flow rate Low rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so lower temps.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a slower flow rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have more hold back time I also
noticed that that when you fold your bags
[SPEAKER_05]: to and weigh you placing them in your
parchment You can create channels and flow
[SPEAKER_05]: and create it to just squeeze out quick
Things to the back really pack them in
[SPEAKER_05]: there too much on each each other.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll tend to blow out I actually give
myself space in between each bag a little
[SPEAKER_05]: bit and I and I noticed it actually
creates those channels for the The hash to
[SPEAKER_05]: ooze through and it helps a little bit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah I believe it's just kind of hard
to press that thing in the first place and
[SPEAKER_02]: then I think what you're doing too Yeah,
you can't like on one of these you use
[SPEAKER_02]: your fingers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all you got You know, and then when
you're going down and then it jerks on you
[SPEAKER_02]: throws off your game for a minute It's
like it's like it's like a double dare
[SPEAKER_05]: when you're you know, or something we're
so having fun out here, you know The
[SPEAKER_05]: difference of the tools that's what it
comes down to Same machine different
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures is pretty much what it came
down to Temperatures, you know and it
[SPEAKER_02]: creates a different Consistency,
you know, I like to create a single
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent product So that's what I'm
trying to eliminate the THC a caking up
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's what tends to occur at a
lower temp At a higher temp you tend to
[SPEAKER_02]: melt it a little better So it tends to
come out a little creamier comes out a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit shinier it all comes down to
Personal preference and what your customer
[SPEAKER_02]: wants to a lot of time That's what it
really comes down to and it's like yeah if
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody wants something to jar check then
you got to change your game you got To go
[SPEAKER_05]: up in temps like I know I've lost
customers that Have bothered me for for
[SPEAKER_05]: full melt and I just don't make full melt
I don't take the time to pull those mini
[SPEAKER_05]: bags and separate everything out and then
you know have to call everything Oh,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not really full spec because I pulled
this the the 70 to 90 out on the first
[SPEAKER_05]: wash I don't even have time for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm giving you like everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even smoke full melt myself If you
want full melt hit up Cameron Guys got the
[SPEAKER_05]: bomb full I
[SPEAKER_05]: am I am More than like three or four days
cured whipped up cold cure Yeah But I like
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, I it looks so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to try it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's it's not gonna hurt to to give it
a go but But we do know that it's gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: definitely have less of a taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's not gonna look like this
tomorrow
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on the conditions that it's kept
in yeah, no it'll get wider This is the
[SPEAKER_02]: the end result.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it'll get wider.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna get wider It would go in the
refrigerator yeah in a fridge in a colder
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah that one will for sure Yeah,
it's gonna end up looking like this Fuck
[SPEAKER_02]: it so that you can see the the how the
color changes This one yeah, maybe three
[SPEAKER_02]: days Now no, no, no, no, this has not been
it now what I carry in my bag,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay No, absolutely not The reason I don't
carry a mini cooler or keep my turps cool
[SPEAKER_02]: in my bag is that I want to see the
degradation Of what's gonna happen to my
[SPEAKER_02]: product when someone doesn't take care of
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know someone's gonna leave it in the car
I know someone's gonna put it in their
[SPEAKER_05]: pocket So it's fun to see when you have
like such a good product that it still
[SPEAKER_05]: stays badass No matter how much you beat
it up and let it left like car out to the
[SPEAKER_02]: air Open Being open is not good.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're about every time you smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just Evaporated turps from here We
lost turps because we keep opening closing
[SPEAKER_02]: closing it now the reason I like This
texture is temple ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, we're talking temple ball early only
it creates a seal, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was trim trim run.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's nothing but trim run, dude It
tastes it tastes great buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes great for trim run, dude That
tastes really good for trim run,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude But like again, I'm a big believer
and it's it's all in the wash it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: well So that's not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes from the genetics comes from the
farmer comes from the practices comes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's there's a Difference of harvesting
flour which everybody does and harvesting
[SPEAKER_02]: trikes and flowers So there's a whole
different mindset of harvesting trikes,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I'm a trike harvester and I love
harvesting flour and guess what trikes are
[SPEAKER_02]: falling off every moment just like Frenchy
cannoli was talking about the analogy he
[SPEAKER_02]: uses the trikes are like Ripe apples on a
tree and all you got to do is shake it and
[SPEAKER_02]: the ripe apples fall That's what's
happening when you're doing a takedown so
[SPEAKER_02]: the way that people Sometimes they're just
like ripping things down.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Fox tailing like you see him
clip and then they're just You're like no,
[SPEAKER_05]: no, no, no, no be very careful with what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have your bag open I have like a five
gallon bucket with my bag This isn't you
[SPEAKER_05]: know turn your trash to cash over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, no, no We're turning we're turning
extremely high quality marijuana into
[SPEAKER_05]: extremely high quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just making it shine We're taking
high quality and this bit shining it
[SPEAKER_02]: because when you see the flower next to
it, you're just like Damn, that's like a
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking Lamborghini parked next to a
Ferrari now because it's like they they
[SPEAKER_02]: they they compliment each other it shows
off the clean the cleanliness the the
[SPEAKER_02]: actual practices of that farmer and then
it's the craftsmanship of the Hash maker
[SPEAKER_02]: that helps guide the farmer and love
trichomes So it's like the farmer already
[SPEAKER_02]: has a love for the flower So now you just
have to tell him now you have to start
[SPEAKER_02]: Loving the trichomes now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a whole different process of
teaching and going through to produce
[SPEAKER_02]: quality product out of trim Not
everybody's trim can do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: No a guarantee.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely not I ran trim that comes out
just like his the Mac usually pumps a very
[SPEAKER_05]: white crystal and it's very good even in
trim and I ran other trim where it's so
[SPEAKER_05]: brown you're just like dude I don't even
want to give it to somebody for edibles.
[SPEAKER_05]: I feel bad even though I know it's Really
high quality hash rosin is extremely
[SPEAKER_05]: clean.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been sifted.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been you know processed, but it's
just so dark It's very unappealing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that's what it comes down to
Aesthetically exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what our market is focused on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody is they want the white rosin
though They want the creamy run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you give the white rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want the creamy run Then you give the
cream and they want the jam then the
[SPEAKER_02]: orange Kids in a candy store.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like no dudes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you want to just tell them What
you get but it's like at the same time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different it's different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a challenge never-ending,
you know love story So I I like that
[SPEAKER_02]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I agree with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, do I do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you know, and that's life There's
certain things that we have to do that We
[SPEAKER_02]: just don't like and we have to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to be an adult.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to pay your bills Do we like it
not really but we do it, you know what I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like that's the same mentality you
have to have when you get criticism I I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't like criticism.
[SPEAKER_02]: It hurts my feelings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be honest, but without it I can't
learn you know, I mean it hurts my
[SPEAKER_02]: feelings when someone says dude This is
not what I want, you know, it only hurts
[SPEAKER_02]: my feelings because I put so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah We're really trying hard especially
when you're like trying to be honest about
[SPEAKER_07]: something Different types of concentrates
and products now, so it's not necessarily
[SPEAKER_07]: a personal thing No, it's not that's what
I'm saying
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my point it's not but the truth of
the reality is it does you know what I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: We all have a heart and we all get our
feelings hurt But do we expose that?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but it's the truth man If you love
what you do and somebody says this is not
[SPEAKER_02]: what I was looking for if you really love
what you do Don't feel like you
[SPEAKER_02]: accomplished the task that you were asked
to do and and it's disappointing to to
[SPEAKER_02]: walk away from that and and all I want to
do after that is make up for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I need to make up for it I failed and
and there is no failure it only if you
[SPEAKER_02]: quit so it's like I'm not done like when
you know the shot, you know kind of thing
[SPEAKER_02]: But sometimes it doesn't work that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes they're just disappointed and
that's it, you know Like I said,
[SPEAKER_05]: I've lost customers just cuz I'm not
making full melt.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like come on Yes, like trust me.
[SPEAKER_05]: I smoke my hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tell me I'm in my opinion I can produce
a beautiful product, but that's not the
[SPEAKER_02]: texture and the consistency that they want
So therefore, you know, it didn't work out
[SPEAKER_02]: or for whatever reason, you know So those
there's a lot of there's a lot of other
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that goes on in a hash maker's life
that we don't really Expose or talk about
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like don't even get into like
personal issues that everybody has to go
[SPEAKER_05]: through every single person You know
everybody's fighting some battle,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know nothing about people have loved
ones They lose things all sorts of crazy
[SPEAKER_05]: shit happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's like you never It sucks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like you said when someone Talks bad about
you, but it's really nice to get all the
[SPEAKER_05]: positive feedback.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes up for it, dude One compliment
makes all the 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah to shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just like fuck yeah, you know,
they believe in me and that's what drives
[SPEAKER_02]: me is is anybody that believes in me like
if they're like, dude Yeah, the people
[SPEAKER_05]: that show me love that don't even know me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just it blows me away I'm like,
there's no reason you guys should like
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'm just out there doing what I love
to I were used to work at a bank for a
[SPEAKER_05]: long time for over 10 years a manager I
said I did the office space life and this
[SPEAKER_05]: is not for me I like I like to create a
product that like I can make people happy
[SPEAKER_06]: with and it's super it's so rewarding so
like you say it's like the amount Oh from
[SPEAKER_02]: the hash It's so funny that's that the
anti-inflammatory and the pain you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: try Yours Yeah, his is easier to work with
off the bat this is the consistency
[SPEAKER_02]: texture Other than the the caking I call
this caking In my opinion, it's very
[SPEAKER_02]: caking it it depending on what you're
trying to do He goes into a jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is an in that's not a problem in
the hell out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I am making a Nice solid temple
ball.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's flat.
[SPEAKER_02]: This stuff is so melty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't stay in a temple ball However,
it's gonna see the theory behind This is
[SPEAKER_02]: based on the temple ball theory I'm a true
traditional has she shin from the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning of temple balls in the
traditional dark hashes So I steal a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of my methods freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I run my freezer for eight hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm done I'll put six pounds of fucking
dry hash in there and it'll be done in
[SPEAKER_02]: eight hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why because I don't always do things the
same way, you know, I I can definitely cut
[SPEAKER_05]: it short I've cut them short sometimes and
they're like everything's dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm like how did it dry that quick and it
rocks it sometimes but I've also ran other
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff where I noticed usually the Crappie
or the heads are the ones that don't dry
[SPEAKER_05]: like like if you saw like I'll save my
food grade, you know what I mean my 180 to
[SPEAKER_05]: 2 to 19 and That stuff won't freeze it but
I won't put that in the material because
[SPEAKER_05]: that's all that material and it's blowing
Around it blows around you'll contaminate
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not in my it's on a separate tray by
itself But it's still in the freeze dryer
[SPEAKER_05]: with everything else and I pull all the
other trays and everything's fine and dry
[SPEAKER_05]: as a bone And then I pull those crappier
and there's like yeah little icebergs of
[SPEAKER_05]: rocks and they're not heads.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah No, it's all stock.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all stocks.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's totally all stock It's just funny
figuring that out along the way and
[SPEAKER_05]: there's no damn book written.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one's telling you nothing I looked at
the harvest, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Called him up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They told me run it for fucking 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: They told me that though, you know,
the whole process Yeah, like 36 hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we did it, you know and and then Lined
with all the you know, I did the scooping
[SPEAKER_02]: technique because that's what I saw
online, you know, I mean the Instagram
[SPEAKER_02]: people were scooping I'm gonna scoop.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm gonna scoop and throw it in
there and We do 36 hours and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's done right and God damn it's a long
time man, and then it's full of all this
[SPEAKER_02]: ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, right It's like take a chunk of Tim.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is turp water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is a fucking turp trap over
here This thing's sucking turps out by the
[SPEAKER_02]: minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is good ice, you know, it's turp
water, man Yeah, we can sell this shit
[SPEAKER_02]: like we were all that water that melts out
the back So gnarly I'm like why in the
[SPEAKER_02]: hell do I want to put my product in the
turp trap when all I'm trying to do is
[SPEAKER_02]: preserve turps so I played with different
methods to minimize the time that It's
[SPEAKER_02]: exposed in that machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, I'm not a scooper because I'm
not making water.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm making hash So I'm trying to dispel my
freeze-dryer with hash because 50% even my
[SPEAKER_02]: amount that I put in there squeezed out
has 55% or 50% my numbers will usually
[SPEAKER_02]: come in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I know how I did on my wash
That's important to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to know did I do my job?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did I did I get distracted and change the
music too long?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, did I do my dance too late?
[SPEAKER_02]: Stupid little things affect what you do in
there So I like to check my work and and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the squeezing out old-school
traditional method chop it all up and I
[SPEAKER_02]: know there's a Particular layer that I
cannot go over because if I don't do my
[SPEAKER_02]: chopping up and people like dude Are you
done yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: They say no because it ain't right So you
got to finish it and then you chop it all
[SPEAKER_02]: up nice and even I know I can get Just
over a pound on every tray of quality
[SPEAKER_02]: dried hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It only has approximately 50% So I'm like
I'm okay with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean, but I don't like
sending it in and not having an idea and I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't like having it in there for 36 hours
or More than eight at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, it's just playing with your
product, you know having the ability to
[SPEAKER_02]: Process the amount of material that we
were privileged enough to process gives us
[SPEAKER_02]: the ability to be more creative gives us
the ability to try new things because as a
[SPEAKER_02]: as a home person who does this and makes
hash they're gonna get five grams,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know what I mean, it's like a
Pressable hash I've never are terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: water soluble.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what they're asking?
[SPEAKER_02]: I Mean there's Lysol there's pine saw All
of those are terpene derived Products so
[SPEAKER_02]: they're mixed with water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they must be water soluble in some
form.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a guess though You know,
we'd have to go to Google.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Don't know exactly what the question is
either But The soluble they are captured
[SPEAKER_06]: in the ice It was like karyophiline
insoluble myrcine insoluble Limonene
[SPEAKER_06]: slightly soluble right which is why
insoluble humaline virtually insoluble
[SPEAKER_06]: linalool Insoluble narrow little slightly
soluble and that's just what they know so
[SPEAKER_05]: far But what are you using it for and what
and what reference is it too and is like
[SPEAKER_05]: is that ice water?
[SPEAKER_02]: The soluble ones Like I said, you can make
some turk water Yeah, I don't know exactly
[SPEAKER_05]: how that works, you know and why it smells
that way but I've never noticed like a
[SPEAKER_05]: major I Came out really good, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the yield that I would have
wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: I probably should have pressed harder and
it still got You killed it though,
[SPEAKER_02]: dude, you got what it should Be getting up
in the you know, high number you got 70
[SPEAKER_02]: something dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the hell of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like 76.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was good Dude, I get 90 back on my GMO.
[SPEAKER_05]: Damn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's insane This is not dirt this is
Cancer, bro these I got enough fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: hash in here to kill cancer But it's
embarrassing because they're almost like
[SPEAKER_02]: stained like I can't fucking make them
clean so I'd rather always have gloves on
[SPEAKER_02]: but It's it's it's part of the process,
you know, I I like you know touching stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: with my hands Yeah, this is this little
ball here More of a different different
[SPEAKER_02]: texture This is a little bit stickier it's
gonna melt that's why when I try to make a
[SPEAKER_05]: temple ball it just slowly What uh,
what bags are you using in your mind Roger
[SPEAKER_05]: technology?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, do you have a Have you seen bolts
bags?
[SPEAKER_05]: They're They're freeze dryer liners.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, they have some they're sick,
dude I have they work so good and he was
[SPEAKER_05]: telling me about him like when we met the
last time and I totally had to try them
[SPEAKER_05]: out and they they Rocked dude,
and it's so nice not having to cut
[SPEAKER_05]: parchment for your for your tray liners
and you just like you pull them out and
[SPEAKER_05]: you just Shake it out.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you using?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a bolt bag, but it's a tray liner.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a tray line That's all they did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I use.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't sell them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had a Because I was using the so
you have those that's what I used but they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know I don't think he has them for
sale yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just had to make them for Because I was
using the yellow ones right and so he's
[SPEAKER_02]: like dude you need to use food grade and
I'm like, all right, bro Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he's like, what are your sizes?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I told him the sizes of my
trays And so he was really nice and he
[SPEAKER_02]: sent me the 15 this quality material
basically This is what I use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it covered my whole tray Yeah,
and he's even sewn up on the corners all
[SPEAKER_02]: nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is One this is the same material that
they make their wash bags out of except
[SPEAKER_05]: this is the 15 you it's just super low you
so The hash isn't seeping through but it
[SPEAKER_05]: tends to dry him.
[SPEAKER_05]: I see I feel like it dries a little
quicker and I like here parchment paper
[SPEAKER_02]: wicks, especially when you just bring it
gets all like, you know, the humidity in
[SPEAKER_02]: your room will mess up your batch like
that like I would check I got there I got
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature gauges all over like at the
doorway on up there over here because
[SPEAKER_02]: there's different temperatures everywhere
So you pull it out and if your humidity is
[SPEAKER_02]: like 60%, you know 50% It was a rainy day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't leave your tray out that long
for a flag now I mean if you want it man,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so there's certain things that
that you you want to Pay attention to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like a lot of people don't want and saw
the list banger got the actual edge banger
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll get this You got about 15 seconds
Should I just go get you
[SPEAKER_04]: Alright Here we go
[SPEAKER_05]: Tastes fantastic.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a new watermelon.
[SPEAKER_05]: I pressed today The
[SPEAKER_02]: one that I found the terpiest was the the
live Wash that I did now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one is about I want to say Oh,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was really really tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, is this one here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you get to smell that one?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's the Tropicana cookies So
that one actually has a different look
[SPEAKER_02]: different texture different everything
about that was my first time washing real
[SPEAKER_02]: flour Fresh frozen like big fat juicy nugs
So I'm learning about that one now,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, oh Yeah, that's that Tropicana
Cookies you can just taste it immediately.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I did a batch It was three pounds of
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay of Tropicana cookies one pound of GMO
and you could almost barely taste the
[SPEAKER_05]: Tropicana cookies because the GMO took
Everything over and it was only one fourth
[SPEAKER_05]: of that strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was strong dude, and it's really
strong exactly I was like, I was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: dude, it's you're not even gonna taste
this GMO Wow, and we were so blown away.
[SPEAKER_05]: They mix their bags Have you heard of
Baker Farms?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's out of San Diego.
[SPEAKER_05]: He's really good grower San Diego and I
think Arizona as well But yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: he's a great grower really cool guy too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Super nice Great businessman and when I
ran his his product like I was so stoked
[SPEAKER_05]: that like you said, you know You're
working with somebody new, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're and you never know what's gonna
happen and then when it comes out good And
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a good product and it smells good.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're just like thank God.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't have to call this guy with bad
news He's a big-ass dude He's always like
[SPEAKER_05]: going to the gym I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey man, I got good news coming to hang
out, you know Yeah, let's do one more why
[SPEAKER_02]: not let's do it at his big temp let's go
for a 20 grammer You want to do a 20
[SPEAKER_05]: grammer at 210?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, or maybe go up.
[SPEAKER_05]: No 210 was actually really good I think
that was a good temp See if you can I
[SPEAKER_05]: would squeeze the plates together right
now just making sure they're nice and hot
[SPEAKER_08]: You You You You
