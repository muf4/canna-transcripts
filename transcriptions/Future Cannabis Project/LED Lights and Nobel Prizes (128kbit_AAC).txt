[SPEAKER_00]: You just mentioned a revolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me about this lighting revolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so the energy that comes to us from
the universe, it's the electromagnetic
[SPEAKER_01]: radiation, electromagnetic waves.
[SPEAKER_01]: The electromagnetic waves are the basic of
all the biological and physics phenomena
[SPEAKER_01]: in the universe, not only in the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the basic of everything we
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's the life, the rain, the food,
the air we breathe, everything comes from
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The LED revolution is that now today we
know to create that energy using a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit of electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we know how to use not many electrons
to produce a lot of photons.
[SPEAKER_01]: When this happens, it changes all the
balance of energy in the universe today.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason this revolution is
affecting everything we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The TV we are watching, the telephone we
are using, the light in the streets,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the houses, and in the automobiles
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: The automobiles today in Europe are
already LED, everything by law,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we reduce considerably the energy
we used in the past to create the light.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happened in the horticultural
market is that in order to feed the
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, we are using only specific
wavelengths, such as the 400 to 450
[SPEAKER_01]: nanometers and the 660 nanometers and the
730 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do not need to use all the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you do the plants specifically
what they need, and you can even calculate
[SPEAKER_01]: the recipe, you can affect to the taste
and the quality of what we are eating
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything comes together when we are
growing cannabis, because in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: you need so much energy that we use the
cannabis today as a guide to the future
[SPEAKER_01]: horticultural crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what we do in our company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to create the maximum quantity of
photons using the minimum of electrons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about kind of outside the 400 to 700
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the sun provides the full
spectrum, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like a lot of lights focus on
the bell curve 400 to 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's our understanding of plants and
their reaction to the full spectrum?
[SPEAKER_00]: So are your lights focused on that bell
curve?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they also exploring past?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand your question.
[SPEAKER_01]: You say, if the sun provides all the
spectrum, why we need only this specific
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum?
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, as I started to say,
the basic of the energy we use is not
[SPEAKER_01]: coming only from the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also coming from the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can see only a small part of the
spectrum, not only the full spectrum,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have also infrared light that
is beyond our capacity to see,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you have also ultraviolet light that
is more than our capacity to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you go to higher frequencies,
I mean less wavelength, the energy those
[SPEAKER_01]: photons carry are much higher and they
affect our skin and they can kill us very
[SPEAKER_01]: easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to x-rays or gamma rays and
forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the spectrum we see is from 400 to
700, as you said.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the plants, they don't need all the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need exactly 450, 660, and 730.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the reason we know how to give them
specific what they use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even some of the spectrums could be
harmful for plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the energy basic
photosynthetic phenomena.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're talking about other
phenomena, the price, the cost of those
[SPEAKER_01]: crops was not economic in the past to use
this kind of light, because it was very
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive to create.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is nothing new in what I told you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is new is the way to create those
wavelengths in a very low cost,
[SPEAKER_01]: because in places like Holland,
they used to use the horticultural light
[SPEAKER_01]: for many, many years using other
technologies like HPS or metal highlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they didn't care because they didn't
care to pay a lot of money for having
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh food in the winter or growing tulips
in the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: But today things are changing because in
the next 20 years, the population of the
[SPEAKER_01]: earth will grow to 10 billion and we need
to increase by 60% the agriculture
[SPEAKER_01]: harvesting in all of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way to do that, the only way
to do that is using those technologies
[SPEAKER_01]: today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are creating the future of feeding
the earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I'm trying to tell you at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not only how to grow cannabis,
it's how to feed the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, the cannabis is a fast train that
we jump on in, but in the future,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the food will change to this kind of
crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're talking to cultivators in
terms of how to dial in the lights during
[SPEAKER_00]: different phases of growth, like rooting,
to teeing, to... You want some grow tips.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what you asked.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: For cloning or rooting, use a full
spectrum light, 5,700 Kelvin, which is not
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive, should be not expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a vegetating stage, you need to use
more blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are growing in an indoor,
you don't need white, you just use a 60%
[SPEAKER_01]: 70% blue, 30% of red.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go to the flowering stage,
you need a lot of power.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need to use far red, 730,
about 5%, use hyper red, 60% and 30%,
[SPEAKER_01]: 35% use blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my tip from today, but they are
changing in the time, in dependence of the
[SPEAKER_01]: type of grow you are doing, the type of
crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: For nurseries, we are providing as I told
you, 5,700 is what the market asked from
[SPEAKER_01]: us today, about 300 micromoles PPFD.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the best results we are having
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one growing in Israel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also in Israel, we grow only medical
cannabis, legally, I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're using 3,000 Kelvin, but depends of
the photobiologic, he is the one who
[SPEAKER_01]: decides which kind exactly of spectrum to
give.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the common use today is 5,700 Kelvin,
which is a lot of blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the clones, 300 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the vegetating stage, usually you need
about 400 micromoles, more blue than
[SPEAKER_01]: white, than red as said before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the flowering, you need a lot of
red and far red.
[SPEAKER_01]: And about 700, 800 micromoles per square
meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're using artificial light,
it doesn't matter if it's a greenhouse or
[SPEAKER_01]: an indoor crop, because in a greenhouse,
you still need the same quantity of light,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you need to use less electricity,
because you're adding the sunlight to your
[SPEAKER_01]: crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you don't need to use white at
all.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the greenhouse, you don't need to use
white.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% is greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, because we are the country of the
sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, we are providing with the biggest
and maybe most sophisticated indoor sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's some of the research that's being
done by the university that you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: wow, that's actually pretty interesting?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: the need for the white.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's new.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, they want more green in the
white than before.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the flowering stage, we are supplying
today, you even can see here, a white with
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of green.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody believed before that using green
light will help.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a small tip that I can tell
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is new research that's proving
that actually you do need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every day, you are getting new data from
new growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, our partner is Osram,
which is the biggest cheap producer for
[SPEAKER_01]: LED lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have 56% of the world's world market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is another input we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all this data is coming to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's what we provide to the growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every day is changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you are learning every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so new.
[SPEAKER_01]: Until now, when you work with the metal
halide or HPS technologies, you used to
[SPEAKER_01]: work with white.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, when you can dominate the
spectrum, you can give exactly a different
[SPEAKER_01]: spectrum according to your results.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different story.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the LED revolution, that you can
give exactly what you need to give.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even improving the quality of the crop
and the yield by different light receipts
[SPEAKER_01]: that you could never gave it before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can program when to give the light
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it photoperiodical treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can control what will be the
intensity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can control the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by doing this, you not only are
accelerating the biological process,
[SPEAKER_01]: you also can improve the different
conditions of the product you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the next, let's say, 10 years,
do you see kind of iterative improvement
[SPEAKER_00]: of LED technology or some new emerging
light technology that would supersede LED?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I am an engineer with some physical
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot see something better than the LED
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the LED is extremely exciting
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only in the five years, you have two Nobel
prizes, Yoshiko Nakamura and Nichia.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two Nobel prizes for more of the same
technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, and I can explain you what was the
reason each one got his Nobel prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the revolution is so big and we are
only in the beginning because the
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency is ascending day by day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Today, there are LEDs that are able to
provide about five micromoles per watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the traditional HPS light will provide
one micromole per watt.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are five times better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is improving day by day using the
same LED technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see yet a better technology than
the LED, but maybe it would be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's nothing currently on the
horizon that you're like that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: promising?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't see.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing I see is that the... Think about
the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farmer is the victim of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We say in Israel that the farmer,
it's a business that depends on God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only on God's mercy.
[SPEAKER_01]: God's mercy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have dry seasons, wet seasons,
change of climate.
[SPEAKER_01]: New years coming from China or other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to compete with everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have also the middleman, the chain
marketing issues that are affecting your
[SPEAKER_01]: life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot program your life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now when you have this technology,
you become suddenly a businessman.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can project exactly what you are
growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, I am a high-tech engineer.
[SPEAKER_01]: All my life was working with high-tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, suddenly, I'm working with the
horticulture.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's extremely exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I never imagined in the past that my
future will be doing, feeding the people
[SPEAKER_01]: with the high-tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what's happening today.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a process that you want to stop,
and it'll change.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you ask me what to suggest to children
to study in university, go and study
[SPEAKER_01]: agronomy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a very good business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it is a business of the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned two Nobel Prize winners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mention someone else who's done research
in LED that you think deserves some love.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, like them, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those two are up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, because remember, the LED technology
also exists about 40 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the revolution came in the past,
in the five, six, seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And each developed the technologies to
create the blue, to produce the blue lead
[SPEAKER_01]: with a very good price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Nakamura developed the phosphor
technology to convert the blue light into
[SPEAKER_01]: white light, into what you call it full
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what years were those, ballpark?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in the 80s, the 90s?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, the 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 2000s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think both Nobel Prize winners in the
last seven years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's newest technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see how it affects it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How it affects everything you touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It affects everything you touch.
It affects everything you touch.
