[SPEAKER_01]: So, Eric, let's put you on the cannabis
business psychiatrist chair.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, tell us, I want to dig into kind of
your path and your journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, do you know anyone else who is as
small as you are from a cultivation square
[SPEAKER_01]: footage standpoint, which is 2,500 square
feet?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, a lot of my friends I work with,
you know, they have much larger
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities, 10,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm a bit of an outlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lauren, do you know any cultivators that
are only at 2,500 square feet?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll bet I might know one or two,
but not that I can think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't jump out at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, explain yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did this happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it by choice?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it by necessity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it tactical?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're playing chess when everyone else is
playing checkers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many businesses are like, oh yeah,
I like being really, really small,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, going bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of, you know, I've been in this
since early 2005.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I've kind of seen the evolution of
this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say probably around 2009,
2010, you started noticing more outside
[SPEAKER_03]: money coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, back in the Bush years,
everybody was scared to get into cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: unless you were okay with the idea of
going to jail for selling cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people that's not okay with
them, you know, it's kind of a few of us
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of nuts that we're okay with at the
time, but it's what we had to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, when the Obama
administration came in, people started to
[SPEAKER_03]: get less fearful of going to prison for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You started seeing more people entering
the space that were hesitant to do it
[SPEAKER_03]: before.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by about 2010 or 11, I just started
noticing more and more money come in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And where I saw that money backing up were
operators that, you know, to me,
[SPEAKER_03]: I had known and they had been around and I
wasn't very confident in their abilities
[SPEAKER_03]: to scale up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, fast forward further to 2014,
you know, I got my small warehouse here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by 2014, the 25,000 square foot
warehouse was not on the low end of
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it was medium to small,
you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, people were just starting
to look at 20,000 square foot warehouse
[SPEAKER_03]: and really going bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, as this is going, even more money is
coming in and these operations are kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: getting very inefficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as we were looking to expand
about 2016, and we started having to
[SPEAKER_03]: compete with the really cheap money out
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we looked at a bunch of spaces,
we spent about a year and we, landlords
[SPEAKER_03]: started charging exorbitant fees for
space.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we look at places with rent like
at $3 a square foot and it was completely
[SPEAKER_03]: unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, for us, we're a bootstrap operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't, you know, we don't have a huge
fund to operate at a loss and as we try to
[SPEAKER_03]: gain market share.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, basically just put my head down and we
were just going to work with what we had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just try to weather the storm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew at some point the bubble would pop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have a large operation that
isn't making money, it's just a lot more
[SPEAKER_03]: to cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, with us, we've kept a small lean
operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, going through this, you know,
we've really had an easy time managing the
[SPEAKER_03]: storm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at some point when this pops,
my idea was some of these companies are
[SPEAKER_03]: not going to make it because they're just
structurally, incapable of surviving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, when that happens, permits are
going to be coming up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The price should drop from $3 a square
foot down to something reasonable,
[SPEAKER_03]: even $1.50, which is still a little
overpriced, but still can work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, that's the plan is just keeping solid
with our small operation, running tight
[SPEAKER_03]: books.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we'll grab the opportunity
when it makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, over the last three,
four years looking at it, it hasn't made
[SPEAKER_03]: sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we looked at expansion would mean
something unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would mean bringing on more
investors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm in this for the long
run.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to have a company 10 years from
now, 20 years from now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're not, you know, we weren't trying
to build something up and just flip it and
[SPEAKER_03]: get out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, like I'm a lifer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric, this is super interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the themes that's raised its
interest is that in the current uncertain
[SPEAKER_02]: times, smaller operations may have an
advantage over the larger ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that smaller operations kind of
defines you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you feel about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, do you think that you might see
real estate prices start to come down and
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe more opportunities, some spaces that
were previously unavailable, become
[SPEAKER_02]: available?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it has to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't envision a scenario.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we all know there are some
larger companies out there that are
[SPEAKER_03]: running pretty serious operating deficits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the laws of percentage is,
you know, it's a larger company.
[SPEAKER_03]: If everybody's operating at the same loss
percentage, the larger company,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's really going to be a bigger number
than a smaller company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I mean, that's one thing where I think
the smaller company does have an
[SPEAKER_03]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, you have to do things well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having a small company that's failing
versus a large company that's failing,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's all failing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's just what's the level of
failure?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've always likened this kind of
to the late 90s dot com boom, where,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, you can't have 10 companies
selling pet food online.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at the same time, it's going to come
down to just a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are going to be inefficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: But weathering the storm, especially if
all 10 of those companies are operating at
[SPEAKER_03]: deficits, operating at the smallest
deficit is going to be the advantage,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at some point, turning that into
round, you're going to be the quickest to
[SPEAKER_03]: actually start operating on profits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point, I think the world's
going to be your oyster.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with most cannabis cultivators I know,
I can't really think of any of them that
[SPEAKER_03]: are really running on profits right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody is, some are very close to
breaking even, and some are far away from
[SPEAKER_03]: breaking even.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't really know of any cultivators
that are just, you know, absolutely
[SPEAKER_03]: destroying it on their books.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there might be one or two that
are kind of barely there, but it's just
[SPEAKER_03]: with the taxes where they are,
it's near impossible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's dig into this a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've talked before, we're friends,
I've interviewed you, and we've talked
[SPEAKER_02]: about your business and you have tight
margins, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you run a really tight mean
operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the last time we talked,
you said like, as long as people are
[SPEAKER_02]: willing to spend, you know, 50 bucks for
an A, you're going to do okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are people still willing to see that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what about the dynamics that are
outside of your control, price points at
[SPEAKER_02]: the dispensary, and all of that stuff
that, you know, could potentially affect
[SPEAKER_02]: you really seriously.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you had to, are you changing a lot of
shops is your product?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what do you, you know, how have you
had to let some people go?
[SPEAKER_02]: How have you survived and maintained with
those thin margins?
[SPEAKER_03]: We actually, we brought one more person
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on ours, we haven't let anybody go.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've hired one more person.
[SPEAKER_01]: How big is the team right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have seven employees.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're up from six to seven, and then
there's three managers, which I consider
[SPEAKER_03]: myself a manager as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do, a lot of the companies will have
four people doing what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm the head of sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: I also handle the compliance, the metric,
the accounting, quality control,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I still do deliveries as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So which is not, as far as I know about
the only owner of a company, that shows up
[SPEAKER_03]: at dispensaries with the deliveries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, Hey, I'm the owner too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but it's great because, you know,
again, I'm also, I also do the marketing
[SPEAKER_03]: and with no marketing budget, you just
have to be creative, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you have to, you know, my,
a lot of my competitors have large have,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, they used to have a large marketing
budgets and I never had a marketing
[SPEAKER_03]: budget.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of a, my, my strategy is
always asymmetrical warfare.
[SPEAKER_03]: If, if you're, you know, if your opponents
are doing one thing and you can't do it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to figure out something that they
can't do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with me, it was just engagement on
the ground level of people at shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can spend $50,000 a month on
marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't do that, but I can go into the
shops and personally make connections and
[SPEAKER_03]: bond with the staff there and get them to
become believers in my product.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and that, that's something you
can't do with the marketing budget,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, unless you just can't,
because your, your team isn't going to go
[SPEAKER_03]: to the same levels that an owner of a
company is going to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so just quickly, you're the one
managing like the Instagram and all that
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you can see by my whopping 1500
followers, I'm a better farmer than a
[SPEAKER_03]: social media guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back to price points, you're a quality
grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, where now do you lay in the,
in the, in the scale of, of price points
[SPEAKER_02]: in the shops and how sensitive are they
to, to that right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: So which, which shelf are you on?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're definitely a top shelf product and
our direct competitors are the premium
[SPEAKER_03]: brands out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who would be some of the other top
shelf brands?
[SPEAKER_03]: Things like Maven, Kings garden.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one other one that I got to
throw THC designs out there, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: cause I love those guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pearl Pharma is another great brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know, so some of those I'm very
good friend, Pearl Pharma, THC designs are
[SPEAKER_03]: very good friends with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We go way back.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're, they're like friend
competitors.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm, I'm happy to see those
customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm happy to see every business in our
space do well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause at the end of the day, I'm a
cannabis community guy and we're all
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I want every business in our
space to do well because we're weed
[SPEAKER_03]: people, you know, and it's better to get
along as weed people without, but,
[SPEAKER_03]: but those are our direct competitors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are those companies, they're also doing a
very great job.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're producing great flour and they're
at price points, similar to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I have noticed in the last two months
is there has been some volatility in the
[SPEAKER_03]: wholesale market price.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have noticed some downward pressure
just generally, you know, I think premium
[SPEAKER_03]: price used to be, you know, about $21 to
25 or 26 wholesale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see it starting to kind of fall to
around 18 to 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's starting to get hard no
matter how good the product is to go much
[SPEAKER_03]: over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over 20, some of them do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're starting to really look at
wholesale pricing and how it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: affect our margin as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, and as far as that,
just getting efficiencies and yield
[SPEAKER_03]: increases to offset any sort of a
wholesale price.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we have to look that way, but you know,
analyzing wholesale prices is definitely
[SPEAKER_03]: just, just from talking to buyers,
we've been looking new shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just brought on a salesperson as well to
start going through the San Diego area.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to start being carried down
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is all the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've actually in the last two months been
looking more at expanding than
[SPEAKER_03]: contracting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of the moment we've been waiting
for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been waiting for the kind of
crash to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is for us in a small company,
I feel like this is going to be our time
[SPEAKER_03]: here to break out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of what we're pushing for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're definitely being more aggressive
right now than we have been.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, as a tiny company, you don't need to
be in a lot of shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how many shops are you in now?
[SPEAKER_03]: We, as of last week, we were in 16.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are now in 18 shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, we're optimistic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to have three or four more by
next week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're going to be getting close to our
cap.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we can probably sustain right now
with our increase about 24 shops total.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're, we're bumping up to that next
level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point, we're going to have to
stop or else we're not going to be able to
sustain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Supply our existing shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and then at that point is when we
start looking to expand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you following kind of the craft
beer model, which is you, you
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrically start with your home turf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're not trying to sell up into
Humboldt and the Bay area and Sacramento
[SPEAKER_01]: as a tiny LA brand, or are you spreading
out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll talk a little bit also about the
legacy nature of your, of your,
[SPEAKER_02]: of your strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, legacy is an important part of
your brand, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is, which is, which is funny when I
thought of the name legacy, it wasn't a
[SPEAKER_03]: term for the old heirloom strains that it
is now, but it just kind of worked out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm, you know, a big history nerd.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in shops since early 2005,
and I started noticing a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: strains from that day were just
disappearing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so pretty much what we run is almost a
history library.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, we run the heirloom strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of our stuff is 10 to 30 years old,
our genetics, you know, we have the master
[SPEAKER_03]: Kush, which nobody really has.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have train wreck, which is another one
that's pretty much disappeared.
[SPEAKER_03]: We run sour diesel, but the real,
the, the Massachusetts skunk cam dog from
[SPEAKER_03]: the nineties, that's what we run.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a Malibu 91 OG from Rick Shiva.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got, you know, we got that from,
you know, old legendary nineties grower
[SPEAKER_03]: that passed away about nine years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anybody around LA in the early 2000s
knew who Rick Shiva was at the early
[SPEAKER_03]: shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we really specialize on the old
classic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Afu Maui Waui is another one we have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, for me, I'm 42.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know a lot of people in their late
thirties and forties remember these old
[SPEAKER_03]: strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, at some point, I mean,
lava cakes are good and the various
[SPEAKER_03]: gelatos and sherbets and it's great,
but sometimes you just want those classic
[SPEAKER_03]: strains that you can find in the big book
of buds or you'd read about, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in high times at Rosenthal was growing
back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the day, you know, I think there's a
lot of appetite for the nostalgia and I
[SPEAKER_03]: just would hate to see it disappear.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since cannabis in genetics is such an
oral history, you know, it's really just
[SPEAKER_03]: relies on kind of storytellers to,
to keep it alive, you know, and we're kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of a storyteller with what we grow,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, sorry, with 2,500 square feet,
you have how many different cultivars?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 12, which is, you know,
not the most efficient thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we don't run all 12 at once.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, some of them we run more
seasonally.
[SPEAKER_03]: We probably have four main strains that we
do the most of, but we'll rotate in other
[SPEAKER_03]: ones here and there again, just because I
just don't want to lose them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at some point we have a larger
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we can focus more on it,
but does the seasonality work from a
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing standpoint where it's kind of
like, Hey, this, this, this strain dropped
[SPEAKER_01]: in this shot or in all the shops and get
it now, cause it won't be around for long.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people come running in because they
know that they won't be able to get it in
[SPEAKER_01]: a month.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really more, you know, and when you
flash my social media with my small number
[SPEAKER_03]: on it, the one thing with that is that
everybody on that are very dedicated
[SPEAKER_03]: legacy fans.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I can be very accessible
with 1600 people.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they message me, I talk to them back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We totally will geek out on genetics all
the time on there, but it's more,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're like, it's really more accessible.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more the rare ones, like the,
like the legacy glue, which is,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, gorilla glue for four,
which can't call it that.
[SPEAKER_03]: People will hit me up, say, when is this
coming out and miss this strain,
[SPEAKER_03]: but gorilla glue is still prevalent enough
that you can't, you can't run it that
[SPEAKER_03]: much.
[SPEAKER_03]: He just has trouble moving cause it's so
flooded.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's more people will hit me up,
say, when is this coming out?
[SPEAKER_03]: When is this coming out for, you know,
and it's more kind of the demand picks up
[SPEAKER_03]: like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course the second, the second I
stopped running something for a bit,
[SPEAKER_03]: then everybody, everybody hits me up for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the nature of the beast.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good problem to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on an annual basis, kind of what's your
capacity for like, how many pounds of
[SPEAKER_01]: flour are you producing per year?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many turns are you doing per year?
[SPEAKER_03]: This year we're on track to do right
around 300 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and then are you, are you
sending kind of biomass out for
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you, is the whole animal being
killed and eaten and used and,
[SPEAKER_01]: or using it all yourself?
[SPEAKER_03]: We use it all ourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: We use all of the animal and funny that
you said that these are our pre-rolls that
[SPEAKER_03]: we are working on.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go in, you know, they go into these
nice little pre-roll boxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are our small nugs and our sugar
leaf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of the advantages of having a small
crew is that my processing team does
[SPEAKER_03]: everything from harvest all the way to
pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: They, you know, they do the packaging,
they do the trimming.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our process, you know, as it comes
down, you have your big families that
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have THC on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those all get trimmed off for the drying
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the trimming happens, the sugar
leaf that comes in gets combined with the
[SPEAKER_03]: small nugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our sugar leaf, when we used to get it
sent out to processing, tested already
[SPEAKER_03]: around 18%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very good, viable material along
with our, our, our small buds,
[SPEAKER_03]: which are test around 22%.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we blend those together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our pre-rolls tend to average about 20%
THC and we use everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not sending any biomass out
because the prices on biomass are pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, and we kind of came to this
about four years ago when the prices on
[SPEAKER_03]: biomass was at probably the lowest it's
been, which was 150 a pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm looking at my really nice indoor
grown with lots of terpenes and a great
[SPEAKER_03]: aroma to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 150 a pound, and I just felt insulted
by it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was thinking, what do I do with
it?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so we started working to create
pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's another thing is to sustain
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aside from our 300 pounds, we generate
about 120 pounds of material that goes
[SPEAKER_03]: into pre-rolls as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you doing any kind of ice water hash
or anything like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't, we don't, you know, we are
strictly a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are allowed to do pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: And flour, we're not allowed to do any
extractions with our permit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would have to contract that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm competing with the biomass
market and they look at a pound of my
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, like a pound of outdoor stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there weren't that regulatory issue,
would you have a washing machine on site?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you could do it tomorrow,
if the regular just wave the magic wand,
[SPEAKER_01]: would you start doing that and maybe do
like hash infused pre-rolls or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to do this back in like 2008 or
nine, which, you know, I used to get into
[SPEAKER_03]: extractions and I used to take my trim and
make hash out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I kind of realized quickly on that
what I love to do is grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I knew other people out there that
love to do extractions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so my passion with extractions doesn't
come anywhere near matching theirs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I felt like they're going to do
something so much better of a job than I
[SPEAKER_03]: can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to compete with somebody in
an area they're passionate about,
[SPEAKER_03]: because what I'm passionate about is
growing flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I felt it's just really good
to stick to what I love to do and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, not do something that I'm not as
into.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the pre-rolls, moving to
pre-rolls instead just made sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really, I think it was a great
decision that we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our pre-rolls are, they're excellent
pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how many are going to be in a pack?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what's the, and then the wholesale on
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I'm happy with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in a pack we do half gram, we do seven
of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm a old schooler, so I like
everything in eighths.
[SPEAKER_03]: So our pre-roll packs are one eighth
joints, seven half gram joints,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they tend to retail around 40 to 45
cents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just quickly getting back to the
question I asked a while ago, which was,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, your strategy for dealing,
you know, if you could pick 20 retailers,
[SPEAKER_01]: my assumption is you kind of want to pick
them where they're close.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go visit them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously not during lockdown,
but you know, you can do FaceTime and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not out in, you know, on what's the
town on the corner of the Arizona,
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevada border?
[SPEAKER_03]: Needles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not like, like needles isn't your
starting point with winning shops over,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Although I am in some shops in the
Monterey area, a good buddy of mine who I
[SPEAKER_03]: go back with, Oliver Summers, who has Chai
Cannabis, he has a shop in San Jose and
[SPEAKER_03]: Castroville.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, two weeks ago I got my
distro van, I left at 430 AM and I made a
[SPEAKER_03]: delivery to Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made a delivery to Castroville,
dropped samples off at a shop in Seaside.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm hoping to do a little circuit
up there as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as far as shop strategy, you know,
and this is another one where I have the
[SPEAKER_03]: advantage of being a small company.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, other companies like THC Design,
where, you know, they produce a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to try to be in almost every
shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for us, since we only have,
for example, right now we have a capacity
[SPEAKER_03]: for 24 shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't really want to pick shops next to
each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to pick shops like with a bit
of radius.
[SPEAKER_03]: One, I'm a personal relationship and a
customer service guy at heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it allows me to have this like a
loyalty relationship with somebody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know that the next shop down the
street isn't going to carry legacy
[SPEAKER_03]: strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: If people want legacy strains,
they have to go to that shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other thing it does for me is it'll
help me avoid slotting fees.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I have an instance where, which
happened to me, where a shop I had been to
[SPEAKER_03]: a long time hired some new buyers that
came in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They tried to beat me down on my price.
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, you're going to drop your price
or we're not going to carry you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I ended up going a block and a half
down the street to the nearest shop that
[SPEAKER_03]: carried them where a friend of mine became
the senior buyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I took my whole catalog over there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't want to basically beat me on
price or charge me a slotting fee.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've probably had a good 30 or 40
loyal customers that went to that shop
[SPEAKER_03]: that just moved a block and half down the
street and went to the new shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to me, having that sort of exclusivity
is what I came up with the only leverage
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to have against slotting fees.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to go to a shop that has
slotting fees because it just won't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Lauren, Eric is a small company and I
assume you're working with lots of kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: mom and pop operations as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you seeing with your client base
in terms of the business and regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: issues they're dealing with as small
companies?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do deal with a lot of small companies
and I think some of the points that Eric
[SPEAKER_00]: made are certainly true for my clients as
well in terms of being able to feel a
[SPEAKER_00]: little more nimble as a small company
versus a larger company that may have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more employees to have to worry about
or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also find that the small farmers are
struggling a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are just a lot of burdens and
requirements both from the state and from
[SPEAKER_00]: the local governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taxes are really a problem that is
brought up often and that lack of ability
[SPEAKER_00]: to get some of this relief right now from
the federal government, that's something
[SPEAKER_00]: that has folks are hurting more so than
other businesses despite all our efforts
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to make this business treated just
like every other business that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: really happening right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just the onerous rules in the
regulations, the fear of really not
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what's gonna happen next in terms
of is this gonna be consolidated,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it not gonna be consolidated,
other changes that keep happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's the cost, the cost is getting
to be, it's a lot for these farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whatever can be done to provide
some both financial relief and just other
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory relief would be in these
businesses' interests.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the issue of dealing with having
to deal with the distributor, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: to do the COA testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of small farmers that just
aren't able to get a distribution license
[SPEAKER_00]: due to the specifics of their property or
financial constraints or anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does put them in a situation where
a lot of times they have, at least it
[SPEAKER_00]: feels like they have less power in the
situation than this big distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: company they're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And something that our office,
what we do is we try to, we do a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: education to the community and to our
clients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've encountered lots of
circumstances where small farmers were
[SPEAKER_00]: being taken advantage of by other folks in
the supply chain, distributors or
[SPEAKER_00]: retailers or what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a situation where we have folks
in this industry that are coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: really the shadows where people have been
growing secretively for many years because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folks were told for many years not to
write things down, don't put it into
[SPEAKER_00]: contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now things have changed, write it down,
keep accurate records, do it out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: open, it's not hiding anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is quite a shift in terms of how
you're operating, how your mindset is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times there are folks that just
weren't necessarily from a traditional
[SPEAKER_00]: business world and maybe they can't afford
to hire folks that specialize in each of
[SPEAKER_00]: these areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they are having to take a lot of that
responsibility on for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is just the learning curve can be
greater for certain businesses than
[SPEAKER_00]: others, smaller businesses, but they're
super resilient too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm really hoping that the small
operators are able to survive and they
[SPEAKER_00]: have to do things like creating a great
brand that folks really appreciate and
[SPEAKER_00]: having that following.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is hard to compete with these massive
operations, but it's not impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think branding is critical, having a
great product is critical, educating the
[SPEAKER_00]: community about your product, about your
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited about the OCAL regulations
that is comparable to organic
[SPEAKER_00]: certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have lots of friends and clients who'd
be interested in getting that on their
[SPEAKER_00]: product once it's available, because at
least let people know we're doing this as
[SPEAKER_00]: organically as possible, even though we
can't actually use that word under the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of these same challenges have
been shared.
[SPEAKER_00]: My law office is a small office too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a small business.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's three attorneys and some support
staff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I feel that we've been pretty good
at being nimble and adjusting to the
[SPEAKER_00]: working from home environment and things
like that, maybe more so than some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger firms are that are doing lots of
layoffs and whatnot right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is just some kind of observations.
[SPEAKER_00]: For all these businesses right now,
they're gonna have to make some
[SPEAKER_00]: adjustments going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just whether it's cannabis or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's important that we work
together as a community to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: assistance to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's in terms of other small
operators, it's in other small operators
[SPEAKER_00]: interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't just become a situation
that's dominated by the big players,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think something that really makes
California's cannabis culture unique is
[SPEAKER_00]: how many different farmers there are and
producers and the history, just like Eric
[SPEAKER_00]: and his legacy strains, there's so many,
I love the name of your company.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so many legacy operators out there
that have made the cannabis culture what
[SPEAKER_00]: it is today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping they're able to survive
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's both pluses and minuses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess plus side being more nimble than a
bigger company, but the negative side is a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of times these smaller mom and pops
don't have access to the same funding that
[SPEAKER_00]: the bigger companies do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that can make it a little more
challenging to pivot in times like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll see, I've got my fingers
crossed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm hoping for the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my takeaway from what you just said is
that I should go into a dispensary and buy
[SPEAKER_01]: weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: From an out of state MSO multi-state
operator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I should go support them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just quickly, two questions for both of
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, accounts payables has come up kind
of operator chatter and are both of you
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing, obviously cash on demand or on
delivery would be nice, but that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: always the case.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you luring across your client base?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeing more kind of delinquent
accounts payables and either farmers or
[SPEAKER_01]: distributors or brands or retailers being
like, well, maybe not the retailers,
[SPEAKER_01]: but where's my money?
[SPEAKER_01]: When am I gonna get paid?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because obviously that puts a crunch on a
business when someone owes you money and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're relying on that cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's for both of you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Eric, just quickly, if you're
doing 300 pounds a year, that's about
[SPEAKER_01]: averaging 25 pounds per your 12 strains,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, obviously some of you grow more,
some of you grow less, but the minimum
[SPEAKER_01]: size for testing is 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're just kind of sucking up the cost
of testing small batches, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's start with the accounts payable
and then we can get onto the batch size.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lauren, what are you seeing with your
clients?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is anybody frustrated that people aren't
paying them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, lots of people are frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of this happening,
just like you said, lots of bills going
[SPEAKER_00]: unpaid and folks getting not what they
thought that they had agreed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's definitely, it is really a
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't just extend to the
businesses, it extends to ancillary
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole system is kind of waiting to get
paid because they're waiting for someone
[SPEAKER_00]: else to pay them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's pretty unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's some structural
changes, obviously they need to happen for
[SPEAKER_00]: that to get fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think that at least for our
clients, it's important that when you are
[SPEAKER_00]: entering into these agreements with your
suppliers or your producers, that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: some terms in the contract that give some
parameters as to when payment has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: made, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And there can be a range but it is
important that you have a system down for
[SPEAKER_00]: when you need to get paid and what happens
if you don't get paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a lot of folks that are
involved in handshake deals and that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty fuzzy in those circumstances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give some examples of good clauses
you would have in that when to expect
[SPEAKER_01]: payment section of the agreement?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's going to depend right on what
type of contract it is, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: between a cultivator and the manufacturer
or if it's between a distributor and a
[SPEAKER_00]: retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And based on the parties, obviously they
can change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if the payment isn't made
immediately, right at the time of
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery, then I would say there needs to
be some kind of metric measured in either
[SPEAKER_00]: days or weeks to when payment has to be
made by.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's not paid by that date,
then there's going to be some penalties
[SPEAKER_00]: that kick in or maybe the contract is
going to get rescinded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to say, there's no one size fits
all approach, but really the key is you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to have something in concrete terms
of a date, whether it's a specific date or
[SPEAKER_00]: a range.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if payment is not made then there has
to be some consequence that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise people are just not going to pay
and they're going to think they're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to able to get away with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the specific licensed categories of
operators, where are you seeing the most
[SPEAKER_01]: uptick in delinquent payments?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it distributors to farmers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it distributors to brands?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it retailers to distributors?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you noticing the uptick the
most?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably cultivators not getting paid by
distributors is what I'm seeing the most.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen it in different
circumstances.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Eric, does anyone owe you money right
now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, nothing that's so outside of the
norm that I'm concerned about getting
[SPEAKER_03]: paid.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is another instance where being a
smaller company is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And funny enough, Lauren as an attorney
will hate this because I am a totally a
[SPEAKER_03]: handshake guy because I've been in this
forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And most of the shops I'm with,
a lot of them I've known the owners for 10
[SPEAKER_03]: plus years because back in the mid 2000s,
I protested in front of half of their
[SPEAKER_03]: shops when they're getting DEA rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have great personal relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just quickly, can you give a shout out to
some of your favorite shops?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to give any shop some love?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My alma mater where I worked for nine
years, LEPCG.
[SPEAKER_03]: And going away from the handshake,
Showgirl Long Beach.
[SPEAKER_03]: Love that shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a great staff.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Sweet Flower shops, where one of my
best friends became a senior buyer there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I love the vibe of their shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let's go with the Malibu 99 high
tides.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a great shop as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go way back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Chai Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: See every one of Herb Delivery as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Goddess Delivers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do a lot of political work with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shout outs to every shop that carries
legacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pretty much with terms, everything these
days is net 30.
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of that is the shops still have
quite a bit of leverage because every day
[SPEAKER_03]: a shop is going to have 10 different
salespeople trying to generate new
[SPEAKER_03]: accounts of the shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so from purchasing manager standpoint,
it's just a cattle call every single day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so being a salesperson doing cold
calls at cannabis shops is just a really
[SPEAKER_03]: brutal occupation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to be able to deal with rejection
after rejection after rejection.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so part of what makes it tough is if
you're net 30, start to come late,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to be very careful how much of a
fuss you put up about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if you start putting up too much
of a fuss about it, a lot of shops are
[SPEAKER_03]: just going to decide to stop carrying your
product and go with somebody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not so much an issue with me,
but I do know it's an issue with a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: other brands that just really need to be
in every shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when that happens as well,
with a lot of these big defaults,
[SPEAKER_03]: I have friends with companies that have
six, six figure bills that were owed by
[SPEAKER_03]: shops that they're trying to figure out if
they're ever going to get it back and
[SPEAKER_03]: throwing in the lack of bankruptcy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that one shop that owes them six
figures or in aggregate, they're owed six
[SPEAKER_01]: figures by a bunch of shops?
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate calling anybody out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I will merely say that it was a large
chain that offered them stock for their
[SPEAKER_03]: consignment debt.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I say a company name and you can blink
if I guess correctly?
Medmen.
[SPEAKER_03]: See what?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just don't lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I talk about the actual
mechanics of getting paid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you get paid directly?
[SPEAKER_02]: From the retailer or it goes through the
distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how exactly does that work?
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes to the distributor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't actually get paid.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I did get paid, I would be on the hook
for paying tax on the excise tax,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is a whole nother thing distributors
have to go through.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, it goes to my distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a single distributor or a
couple of distributors?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a single distributor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm distributed through the same company
that distributes THC Design.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: What company is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: They are 1346 LA LLC.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, that's the company that
distributes THC Design.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go way back.
[SPEAKER_03]: The owners of THC Design are really good
friends of mine.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been doing political work together
for six years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing like Lauren was saying with
small businesses, one of the things we
[SPEAKER_03]: have with small businesses, I know THC
Design seems like a big business,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I mean, they're a mom and pop too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They started from absolutely nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they grew themselves self-funded to
what they are today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're not like outside money.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not a Canadian fund company or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're an independent company.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one of the advantages I think that
a lot of the independent companies have
[SPEAKER_03]: more so is that we're really plugged into
the cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think the cannabis community does
treat their own much differently because
[SPEAKER_03]: we've always kind of been a bit of a
counterculture group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think we kind of stick together
because we all have this counterculture
[SPEAKER_03]: nature to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think when people who don't
necessarily share those same
[SPEAKER_03]: counterculture ideas come into it,
we kind of can spot them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think a lot of the small operators
here, because we love cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we love the scene, and we love the
industry and people who are into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think we kind of just naturally
bond together as kindred spirits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think the way we relate to each
other is much different than relating to
[SPEAKER_03]: people coming in from Wall Street or
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody who wants to get into it,
great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't mean to be disparaging people
coming in from Wall Street or a Canadian
[SPEAKER_03]: fund.
[SPEAKER_03]: But some of them remind me of people that
used to make fun of me and my friends for
[SPEAKER_03]: smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: They used to call us losers, and now
they're running companies in our space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And someone's like, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do you do with an up-and-coming
retail brand like High Times, which
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously is an old school legacy brand,
but is now also a big corporate player?
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have a fuzzy relationship with
those retailers.
No.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, again, I'm a customer service
person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one thing you do in customer service
is you never talk poorly about your
[SPEAKER_03]: customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these shops are my customers.
[SPEAKER_03]: If it's run by High Times,
[SPEAKER_03]: let's say Dick Cheney decides to buy some
cannabis shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or no, let's say John Boehner,
because he invested in the space already.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're a customer, they're going to be
a paying customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really does you no good to disparage
them or talk poorly about them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the larger companies who we may or
may not have alluded to before,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of them have been customers of mine
in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have great people working there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you look at the ground floor,
no matter who owns a company, when you go
[SPEAKER_03]: into a shop and you deal with the blood
tenders, those are the same cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: people that we've always had.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as for myself, I would love
every single cannabis shop, no matter who
[SPEAKER_03]: owns it, to take a look at my brand and
consider carrying it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would hate for somebody to not like my
brand because of some egotistical reason
[SPEAKER_03]: or political reason or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just good to value.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to value your customers no matter
who they are or else you're not going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have a business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You mentioned kind of getting investments.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you haven't taken on any outside
funding beyond either yourself or maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: even just some family or friends?
Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I have a partner who I started with
back in 2014 that we worked at our first
[SPEAKER_03]: space.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I mean, short of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just an independent one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of it was my savings that I
built up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started growing in 2006.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew in a spare bedroom while I worked
in a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I had a buddy who moved to
Colorado from a loft downtown.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took over that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I took over a garage in Sherman
Oak.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at one point I had three residential
cultivations going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at about 2013, I was ready to jump up
to industrial space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wound down those spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: But otherwise, so far, we've taken on no
investing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've just bootstrapped it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting back to the question I had
thrown out there before about 300 pounds a
[SPEAKER_01]: year, 12 cultivars, which breaks down to
about 25 pounds per cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means that you're not, because I
know a lot of people who, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'd love to grow something random in a
small batch and get it out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you're hammered with testing
fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so unless you're growing at least 50
pounds of it, it doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're sending 25 pound or even maybe
15 pound batches out to get tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are you paying for a test?
[SPEAKER_01]: What lab do you use?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my distributor handles all the
testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And since they're such a high volume
distributor, we do get pretty good prices
[SPEAKER_03]: on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But our average batch size, we tend to do
split rooms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we do batches of like 12 pounds
at a time, which is definitely brutal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really cuts into our margins.
[SPEAKER_03]: Occasionally, some of our strains we'll do
full rooms of and then we'll end up with
[SPEAKER_03]: about 20 pounds of it, which is much
nicer.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, lab lab testing eats up a big
chunk of money from us, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: just again, because we do a smaller thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of the reason for that as well is
because I do the sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I'm growing in my whole facility to
two types, that means that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_03]: have to have 40 accounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if I grow five types,
then I can drop that down down
[SPEAKER_03]: considerably, because instead of taking a
half pound a time at my one variety,
[SPEAKER_03]: they'll take a half pound of four
different varieties.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's just less, it's less sales
work for me to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if I really only grew one type and
I grew larger batches, I would probably
[SPEAKER_03]: have to spend that money on one or two
more outside salespeople to reach the
[SPEAKER_03]: extra shops that I could get.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you wholesale any of your of your
product?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, we don't wholesale everything is
everything is packaged in brand and we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't do any wholesaling or white
labeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we had just heard recently from
actually it was Greg, who said that he was
[SPEAKER_02]: actually making more money wholesaling
than putting his product on his own
[SPEAKER_02]: shelves.
[SPEAKER_02]: That that was the strength of the bulk
market for him.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was the lunacy of the of the tax and
all this just to create his own put it in
[SPEAKER_01]: his own brand in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The the the bulk the bulk market is really
has really strong prices right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not really sure why or what it is
about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: But over the last few months, definitely
the bulk prices have really have really
[SPEAKER_03]: been strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this this would be a whole other issue
for somebody else other than me to tell
[SPEAKER_03]: you why.
[SPEAKER_03]: But but it's definitely it's definitely
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: But does that play a role in in your
future plans at all?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you were to expand, I mean,
how do you see that part of if it
[SPEAKER_02]: continues to be a strong market?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's he's a great princess is selling to a
very well known brand, which I'm not going
[SPEAKER_02]: to say really well known.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a consumer, that's just,
you know, for someone like me walking in
[SPEAKER_02]: that shop is kind of telling me I don't
know necessarily what I'm getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but that aside, there's no reason
necessarily believe that the strength of
[SPEAKER_02]: that bulk market is going to necessarily
go away because demand seems to be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm pretty torn on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do think that the most successful
operating model would involve you selling
[SPEAKER_03]: 100 percent of what you're produce under
your own brand, because otherwise,
[SPEAKER_03]: if I'm if I'm selling bulk to somebody,
they're paying bulk for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're doing additional things
on top of that, which is going to increase
[SPEAKER_03]: their cost, you know, and also as more
operators or more facilities come online,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think especially larger ones,
you're going to find that the bulk market
[SPEAKER_03]: is one that's going to be much more
subject to general commodity prices,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like with with everything
looking at this, you have, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: your your crude oil price and even you
have your gasoline price, which is your
[SPEAKER_03]: finished refined product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And both of these markets are impacted by
each other, but they're also both a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit separate.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, your refining capacity is going
to dictate your gas price, just like the
[SPEAKER_03]: bulk price of crude oil is, you know,
they're not necessarily in a vacuum.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so having everything going out and
branded, you can control what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if if 50 percent of your inventory you
have to bulk price, if there's a glut in
[SPEAKER_03]: the market and the bulk price drops to
eleven hundred a pound, all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_03]: all of a sudden, half of what you're
selling, you're you're probably losing
[SPEAKER_03]: money at or you're not making anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: If the prices stay strong, 18 to 2000,
which is where they are now, then then
[SPEAKER_03]: you're doing fine.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, with anything else,
if if there is if there's a space for
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody to come in and occupy,
because, you know, if it's costing
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody a thousand bucks to grow a
pound, but everybody's getting eighteen
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred on it without markup, more people
are going to fill that space and produce
[SPEAKER_03]: those pounds until all of a sudden you
have over capacity and then the prices are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to crash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when they hit eleven,
the inefficient people are going to pack
[SPEAKER_03]: up shop and it's going to be cyclical.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you're selling your product to
consumers, you're kind of immune from all
[SPEAKER_03]: that because you're just getting your
wholesale price per package date.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the place to be, I think,
relying on bulk wholesales as a business
[SPEAKER_03]: model is playing with fire or a hot
potato.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to work out sometimes,
but there's going to be times it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: work and you're going to have to figure
out how to adjust to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think most people relying on bulk
are trying to figure out how to get a
[SPEAKER_03]: larger percentage into retail as fast as
they can, which maybe that's part of why
[SPEAKER_03]: we're seeing some downward pressure on
wholesale prices in packaged goods versus
[SPEAKER_03]: bulk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just going to ask you what your
projections are for kind of, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: end of 2020 spot market pricing per pound
on both the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what are your friends in the
traditional market telling you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is life good right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't have a lot of friends outside in
the traditional market anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your friends are all masochists.
[SPEAKER_01]: They all like the pain of getting into the
regulated market.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I guess the people in the
traditional market are too busy going on
[SPEAKER_03]: exotic vacations around the world,
whereas I'm just eating ramen and bitching
[SPEAKER_03]: about it with my regulated market friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if they're doing that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you think in the regulated market,
the per pound prices, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously you have like top shelf,
mids, whatever, but do you think on
[SPEAKER_01]: average prices are going to go up at the
end of the year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see more farms coming online and
prices going down by the end of the year?
[SPEAKER_03]: The prices are so strong right now on
wholesale.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't see how it could last till the end
of the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, if it does, I'll be mildly
surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess I won't be totally shocked by it,
but I mean, the prices are really,
[SPEAKER_03]: really strong right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like give me ballpark pricing that you're
seeing for pounds of different caliber
[SPEAKER_01]: flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of top shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, my knowledge is indoor,
the greenhouse stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's do indoor, top shelf,
indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the per pound price?
[SPEAKER_03]: I have multiple friends with brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, about $2,000 COD for bulk pounds
right now of good quality stuff,
[SPEAKER_03]: good testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking like 25% plus THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like your top shelf bulk is going for
2000, sometimes 2100 pounds COD.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have even heard of distributors
prepaying for future harvest that haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: even come down yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how hot the market is right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've never heard of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what was it a year ago?
[SPEAKER_01]: That same $2,000 pound was it?
[SPEAKER_03]: 14.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: 14 and growers calling me asking if I knew
buyers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's brokers calling me asking me if I
can track down any pounds out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: This happened about three weeks ago,
a month ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had somebody call me who I used to know,
somebody who I never thought I would hear
[SPEAKER_03]: from again, calling me asking if I could
find them any farms that had any top shelf
[SPEAKER_03]: in flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I was like, what is going
on here?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I still really don't know,
but I just know the market's really hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now on the bulk wholesale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how it can keep up like this,
but.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for both of you and let's start with
you, Lauren, I thought it'd be interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: as we bring people on it, if people can
give an example of a situation where you
[SPEAKER_01]: had to educate either a local or state
regulator politician on some topic or you
[SPEAKER_01]: had a friend or someone who's Lauren,
you're a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you heard of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talk to another lawyer who had to
educate someone on something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me an example of something where you
had to educate or you know someone who had
[SPEAKER_01]: to educate either a local or state
politician regulator on some topic related
[SPEAKER_01]: to cannabis so that they could be sensible
with their policies and regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I've got a recent example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talking about the shelter in place orders
that went down for coronavirus in Sonoma
[SPEAKER_00]: County, where I live and where my office
is located.
[SPEAKER_00]: The county's original shelter in place
order when it was defining what's an
[SPEAKER_00]: essential business and what's not an
essential business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first version of it said that medical
cannabis operators were essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it implied that anyone that didn't
have a medical license wasn't included.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also said that Effectively like
testing labs were not essential unless
[SPEAKER_00]: they were testing cannabis that was
destined for a medical facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I read that and I was like,
there's no way that's not how this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, you know, you're when you're in
the lab is testing products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't always know what facility is
going to be selling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The labs themselves aren't designated as
medical or adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also not, they're not really,
they're not growing the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: producing the plant, anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing something that's a purely,
you know, testing health and safety,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, function.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had no idea why the county had
written their health order that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I reached out to the health
department and I mean, it turned out that
[SPEAKER_00]: the county just had no idea how cannabis
testing labs worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I think they thought that
maybe they were affiliated with a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary or something like that,
or that all the, you know, products came
[SPEAKER_00]: in with a big label that said,
this is going to be for a medical user.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not going to be for a medical
user.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I explained, you know,
that's just not how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would, you know, I was able to get the
county to revise their shelter in place
[SPEAKER_00]: order to make it clear that all cannabis
testing labs in the county are essential
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses and can stay open no matter
what they're testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that all cannabis businesses,
no matter whether they're medical or adult
[SPEAKER_00]: use are essential and can stay open
because not every person that uses
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, a lot of people use cannabis in
what really is a medical way, but don't
[SPEAKER_00]: consider themselves a patient or don't
have a medical card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they shouldn't be excluded from,
you know, the ability to use those
[SPEAKER_00]: services and those businesses that employ
local people shouldn't have to shut down
[SPEAKER_00]: just because the county is, you know,
misconception.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so anyway, I talked with them about
all that and I was able to get them to
[SPEAKER_00]: amend the shelter in place order.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, but it needed education.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was people who were making these rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't really understand how the industry
works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't understand the supply chain and all
the intricacies of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the whole medical versus adult use
designation really has its, has it,
[SPEAKER_00]: it creates some problems like this where
we're creating, you know, two separate
[SPEAKER_00]: categories of buyers and don't get me
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some people that absolutely are
medical patients and they deserve to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I think prioritized above people
that are just trying to get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even the people that are just trying
to get high, if they're doing it because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's calming them down because like for
me, I have bad anxiety, it helps my
[SPEAKER_00]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a medical use.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I might take Xanax for that
instead and I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think we need to rethink,
you know, what we think of as medical use
[SPEAKER_00]: and just, and educate lawmakers about
exactly that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Eric, do you have an example down in
SoCal of having to sit someone down and
[SPEAKER_01]: teach them something?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of that was more,
you know, my nine years behind the counter
[SPEAKER_03]: as a bud tender.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was plenty of education on that and
misconception to kind of speak into what
[SPEAKER_03]: Lauren was talking about as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I 100% agree that people use
cannabis, you know, if not medicinally,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's to improve a quality of life,
which I would consider therapeutic at the
[SPEAKER_03]: very least.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, there's, I think times
where, you know, it's important for people
[SPEAKER_03]: not to judge other people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like with cannabis at the shop,
sometimes people will come in and some
[SPEAKER_03]: people were more obviously disabilitated
than others.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is, you know, going back in the
mid 2000s when it was much more strict on
[SPEAKER_03]: the medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember there was a older lady in
line and, you know, she had like a walker
[SPEAKER_03]: and she had a younger kid in front of her.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, very urban looking with the,
you know, flat rim baseball cap,
[SPEAKER_03]: all of that and telling, there was a big
line telling him that he should let her go
[SPEAKER_03]: in front of her because she was sicker
than he was obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I remember this kid lifted up his
shirt and he was just multiple surgeries
[SPEAKER_03]: and just zippers up and down from
everything he had.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just kind of like, you can't
really judge somebody by looking at them
[SPEAKER_03]: as well, you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is something we would deal with
law enforcement back then who would
[SPEAKER_03]: basically say medical cannabis is a scam.
[SPEAKER_03]: These people are just scamming it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not really sick, you know,
and they would say things like we parked
[SPEAKER_03]: outside of a shop and watch people walk in
and out.
[SPEAKER_03]: None of them looked very sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is in West Hollywood,
you know, and my question is like,
[SPEAKER_03]: how do you know from looking at somebody
if they're an AIDS patient or a cancer
[SPEAKER_03]: patient?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, short of having just done chemo,
you know, so, so I really think with that
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of it is, you know, what,
what are the reasons people really use
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it comes down to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end, it's really therapeutic and
improves the quality of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me, having something chemically
that can help improve your quality of life
[SPEAKER_03]: is a medicinal use, you know, and I do
think a lot of that does get shortchanged.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I, even myself, I,
you know, I talk, I talk a bit about
[SPEAKER_03]: stoner culture and things like that,
because that's there as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I, but I think deep down, we're all
using it to improve our quality of life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I guess that's, that's how I'd
answer it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Lauren, can you talk about something
you guys are working on behind the scenes
[SPEAKER_01]: that maybe is related to, or requires a
legislative change and then, and or
[SPEAKER_01]: something that is, is more regulatory,
like the BCC CDFA or CDPH can change
[SPEAKER_01]: without requiring legislative change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, at the, at the state level,
you know, we have reached out individually
[SPEAKER_00]: to our state lawmakers and asked them to
support tax relief bills, because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something, you know, that's going to
require a legislative fix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I do encourage everyone to keep
putting pressure on your local state
[SPEAKER_00]: senators and representatives to support
cannabis tax relief measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just quickly on that front, I mean,
what's the reception?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I feel like it's about as obvious
as, as, you know, the, the sun rising in
[SPEAKER_01]: the East that taxes are way too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does the state know that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, when you talk, like, who are you
talking to?
[SPEAKER_01]: And are they like, yeah, we know taxes are
way too high and it's crippling.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, so my interactions for the most
part have been kind of with the folks that
[SPEAKER_00]: represent my area, who are people like Jim
Wood and Mike McGuire, folks that are
[SPEAKER_00]: super on our side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're very much aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know they are doing what they can to
lead this effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think overall folks in Sacramento do
realize that tax are too high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we, we can't look at cannabis in
a, in a vacuum though.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to realize that the state is doing
a lot of other things too, that require
[SPEAKER_00]: money and, you know, for which these taxes
are needed, these and other taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so lowering taxes is always a tricky
conversation because that money needs to,
[SPEAKER_00]: that money is being used for stuff and
it's going to have to come from someplace
[SPEAKER_00]: else potentially, if they're not getting
it from this industry anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also think that given the current
state of the health emergency right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like requests for cannabis tax
relief are, you know, coming after things
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know, getting emergency
healthcare and, and, and financial relief
[SPEAKER_00]: to, to businesses that got shut down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think the will is there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that maybe next session,
I think once, I'm not too sure how likely
[SPEAKER_00]: it is that taxes are going to get,
state taxes are going to get reduced
[SPEAKER_00]: during the pandemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't predict the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe that would be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I'm, I'm thinking it might happen kind
of once the emergency has passed us a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, like I said, anything's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a, at the local level,
taxes are also a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't really talked about that yet,
but a lot of different cities and counties
[SPEAKER_00]: are also adding their own taxes on top of
the state taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is where, why the tax issue in
general is so burdensome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's certain local governments
may be more willing to alter that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Sonoma, and I don't know if it's just
count, like what's your, is, are you just
[SPEAKER_01]: Sonoma County or are there local
jurisdictions as well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like Santa Rosa, is that its own?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Santa Rosa has its own cannabis policy and
their own set of taxes that are lower than
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonoma County unincorporated cannabis
taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And both of those relative to other
municipalities, are they reasonable or
[SPEAKER_01]: like is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is Santa Rosa reasonable and Sonoma County
is unreasonable relative to the rest of
[SPEAKER_01]: the city?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say Santa Rosa is more reasonable
than Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sonoma County, their, their cultivation
tax structure in particular is,
[SPEAKER_00]: is complicated and it can get very
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's based on the size of the
grow as well as whether it's indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor mix light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can get to be just, depending on
what you're doing, it can get very
[SPEAKER_00]: burdensome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it is higher than others I've
seen lower than Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some others I've seen, but in terms of
just the industry in Sonoma County right
[SPEAKER_00]: now is really struggling and something
that would really help is, is reforming
[SPEAKER_00]: the local taxes, as well as the local
permit process here in Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is very onerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have put in applications two,
three years ago that haven't gotten to a
[SPEAKER_00]: hearing yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been charged more and more money
for the County to keep reviewing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been bounced around to multiple
reviewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the County has just some problems
with how the program is, is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my understanding is there are some
changes that are going to be made
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully in the future that would move
things around a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal is, is to try to get all of
cultivation permitted through ag weights
[SPEAKER_00]: and measures rather than the permit
resource management department that
[SPEAKER_00]: handles other types of permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is an effort internally and
from groups like Sonoma County Growers
[SPEAKER_00]: Alliance and, and Sonoma kind of this
business Alliance of Sonoma County and
[SPEAKER_00]: some other groups to change how all of
that is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within the city of Santa Rosa,
I'm not too sure if there's been any talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you know, changing their process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty efficient within Santa
Rosa.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've approved a lot more cannabis
businesses and their taxes seem more
[SPEAKER_00]: reasonable.
[SPEAKER_02]: But how big is the backlog of businesses
waiting for permitting in your County?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know an exact number, but there's
a whole lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get, I can get that information and,
and, you know, distribute it to everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: who's interested, but there are a lot of
folks that submitted applications and are
[SPEAKER_00]: waiting to hear back.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least probably at least 50,
if not more than that, potentially even
[SPEAKER_00]: like a hundred applications that have been
filed and haven't really gotten anywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the County is only permitted a
handful of, you know, can issue to handle
[SPEAKER_00]: a handful of conditional use permits for
larger sized outdoor grows in the two or
[SPEAKER_00]: three years since the program has been
active.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few more smaller permits that
have been issued and some permits for
[SPEAKER_00]: things like manufacturing and
distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's the, what's the square footage
of the, when you say larger size,
[SPEAKER_01]: what, how big are we talking?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way it is right now, if you have,
if you're 10,000 square feet or less,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're in an agriculturally zoned
parcel, you can get permitted through the
[SPEAKER_00]: ag department, but everything else,
which is 10,001 square feet up to an acre,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the current cap they have has to
go through PRMD, the permit resource
[SPEAKER_00]: management department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have just tons of bureaucracy and
they're taking forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, their fees are higher,
their application process is more onerous
[SPEAKER_00]: than the folks that have a 10,000 square
foot or less and are in an ag zone and can
[SPEAKER_00]: just do it through the ag department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea is to just bring all
cultivators over to that ag department
[SPEAKER_00]: process if possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, the former ag
commissioner and the current ag
[SPEAKER_00]: commissioner are very much on the industry
side here locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they have been pushing internally
for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll see, we're kind of waiting
right now as the county deals with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, even coronavirus, but I've been
talking to the ag commissioner and he
[SPEAKER_00]: tells me that sometime this fall,
that is going to be discussed,
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of a moving of cultivation over
to the ag department.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll see if the board of supervisors
is with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that really anything that
they can do to help people stay in
[SPEAKER_00]: business, to get more tax revenue,
again, if they were to slightly reduce
[SPEAKER_00]: local taxes and make it less onerous to
get a permit, they would have an increase
[SPEAKER_00]: in tax revenue because there'd be more
businesses that could actually,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, get permitted and survive and
operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's basic economics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is that something that literally the
board of supervisors just has to get
[SPEAKER_01]: together and say, all in favor of reducing
taxes by 50%, say aye, or is it more
[SPEAKER_01]: complicated than that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd have to, you know, I have to go
see at the county's current tax ordinance
[SPEAKER_00]: to what extent they can lower,
you know, taxes, you know, what their
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to do that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: My guess is that, you know, they'd have to
agree on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there has been some hesitation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time reducing the county taxes
was really brought up to the supervisors
[SPEAKER_00]: was before coronavirus.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a little while since that issue
actually got all the way up to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when it comes back to them again,
which should hopefully be soon,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something that the Sonoma County
Growers Alliance is taking on as a main
[SPEAKER_00]: policy objective, you know, for the rest
of the year of reducing the taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets back to them again,
they might be singing a different tune,
[SPEAKER_00]: just realizing how any relief they can
provide is going to help these businesses
[SPEAKER_00]: and the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, and politically speaking,
there has been, you know, the current
[SPEAKER_00]: board of supervisors is pretty supportive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one member of the board who was
very anti-cannabis for the longest time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but seems to be coming around.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a new hemp ordinance that went into
place last month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people can now grow hemp here in Sonoma
County.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something interesting that the
county's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a lot of counties have allowed both.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's yet to be seen how that's
going to work out if that's fixed to the
[SPEAKER_00]: board of supervisors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd say our strong, the industry's
strongest ally is, oh sorry, no worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so which of these, this very diverse
group of people is the most supportive and
[SPEAKER_01]: the least supportive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the most supportive and the woman in
red hair, she was just voted out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she's going to finish her term and
there's going to be another white man
[SPEAKER_00]: replacing the lady with red hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the most outspoken advocate has been
the lady in the tan jacket.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Linda Hopkins.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the most outspoken opponent has been
the guy on the far right, the slightly
[SPEAKER_00]: larger gentleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's David Rabbit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He looks like a closet stoner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I fold in a subject that you might be
dealing with up there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking at an article.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lawsuit seeks to shut down busy bees
organics in wine country.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in Santa Barbara County,
but it's, and so the lawsuit also includes
[SPEAKER_02]: the board of supervisors, I think,
because they're accusing them of breaking
[SPEAKER_02]: certain laws and approving certain
permits.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's ratcheting up and aren't you in
wine country also?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you seeing any of these dynamics in
play?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm up in wine country, slightly
different wine country, more of the Sonoma
[SPEAKER_00]: Napa area.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something that we have seen up here is
concerned by the wine growers that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to, cannabis is going to impact
their, the taste of their grapes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the taste of the wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're worried about that kind of a taint
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're concerned about the cannabis
industry using up all the water that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need, even though wineries use far more
water than most cannabis farms do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been, there was a RICO lawsuit
that was filed against a cannabis operator
[SPEAKER_00]: a year or two ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea was that it was hurting and
it wasn't, it wasn't filed by a winery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just these people in a big house,
but they were claiming that their property
[SPEAKER_00]: value is going down because of the
cannabis farm next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what the current status of
that lawsuit is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the judge originally threw out the
RICO claims and was letting other parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: it go forward, but then I didn't follow
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really know anyone directly who
was involved in that lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is certainly a concern that's
being, that is being raised up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, another concern is fire safety and
making sure that all these roads are fire
[SPEAKER_00]: safe, fire accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a lot of one way kind of dirt
roads going up mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's also fire territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, it can be dangerous to have a
cannabis farm at the end of a one way
[SPEAKER_00]: road.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you need emergency vehicles,
got to come in and out, there's other
[SPEAKER_00]: people on the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's been an issue that opponents
have started to use to oppose cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's looking at the roads to get in and
out, making sure they're all up to fire
[SPEAKER_00]: codes and trying to stall projects based
on something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there is, I think there is
some merit to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the roads need to be safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be able to get vehicles in and
out safely and not get to a problem where
[SPEAKER_00]: the fire truck can't get there because the
road's not wide enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I think that's also now being
used to stop like legitimate projects
[SPEAKER_00]: that, you know, do have everything in
place, but there's, they're just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: stall them.
So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about raids, you know, up in Humboldt
Mendocino out in the mountains of San
[SPEAKER_01]: Bernardino, friends have been talking
about the raids are coming back again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And full force, are you seeing that in
Sonoma or what are you seeing?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's been any raids in
Sonoma County, not that I can think of.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have heard about the ones that you
mentioned up in the Emerald Crangle and
[SPEAKER_00]: down in central coast area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thankfully that hasn't really happened
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's absolutely terrifying when we
have that kind of a harsh law enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: approach to people selling these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I certainly think there are
folks who are bad actors in the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are growing in, you know,
state and national parks, people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: using dangerous chemicals, people who are
just, you know, not following the rules,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's not the folks who are in the
regulated industry for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm hopeful that they don't,
you know, continue resorting to those
[SPEAKER_00]: scary tactics that really, you know,
can leave people with PTSD for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: to come afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and Eric, how about in LA?
[SPEAKER_03]: The raids they have don't come close to
making a dent in anything, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and a lot of it as well is that,
especially with COVID-19 going on,
[SPEAKER_03]: there has been a lot of violent offenders
released from jail who are back into the
[SPEAKER_03]: city here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so property crimes have gone way up,
break-ins have gone way up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something I've, over the last
two months with indoor growers here,
[SPEAKER_03]: break-ins have probably went up a thousand
percent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I know, I know of some companies
that have had attempted break-ins every
[SPEAKER_03]: week, you know, and typically maybe you'll
get an attempted break-in once every three
[SPEAKER_03]: or four months, you know, cause it just
happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, there's, there, you know,
a lot of these are done by criminal gangs
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's very organized, but yeah,
the amount of break-ins over the last
[SPEAKER_03]: month and a half is just levels that I've
never heard of before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's definitely something going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yes, and then police are just very
occupied here with everything else for
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think cannabis is a very low priority,
which is frustrating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know Tom, you hear this from Greg
all the time is that the illegal shops are
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes a block and a half from a
regulated shop, the inspect, the permit
[SPEAKER_03]: people come show up the inspected shop and
they'll say, Hey, a block and a half away
[SPEAKER_03]: is an illegal shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you go check them out?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the inspectors are scared to go there,
you know?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they don't really do anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I think really with,
with enforcement, if there's one thing the
[SPEAKER_03]: last, what are we on 90 years of drug war
has showed us is that enforcement really,
[SPEAKER_03]: really is not the answer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the answer is to incentivize legal
businesses to be competitive with the
[SPEAKER_03]: illegal businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Imagine if everything was flipped and 80%
of the market was legal and only 20% was
[SPEAKER_03]: illegal, we'd be very close to stomping it
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe we could start rebranding that herd
immunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I mean, that, that gets back to the
sensible taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's pretty much the main,
all they need to do is be sensible and you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't, you don't really have a moonshine
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really have a, you know,
an illicit, you know, serial or CPG
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, maybe you have knockoffs.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the, on the, you know, streets of
Chinatown and New York, but it's tough to
[SPEAKER_03]: be, you know, I remember when they did the
first budget when Jerry Brown was
[SPEAKER_03]: governor, and this is part of it,
you know, we, we talk about what we
[SPEAKER_03]: understand is economics because we've all
owned businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, you know, if you lower,
if you lower the taxes, you generate more
[SPEAKER_03]: economic activity, which often will
actually increase the revenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I remember when the first tax
report came in and it was one third of
[SPEAKER_03]: projections, you know, when Jerry Brown
was governor, they, you know, they talked
[SPEAKER_03]: about the first tax cut.
[SPEAKER_03]: They projected 120 million coming in or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it ended up being like 30 million that
came in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first hit from his quote basically
was like, you know, well, if we hit one
[SPEAKER_03]: third of our tax revenue, we're not going
to cut taxes because then we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get even less money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they, you know, a lot of people,
they just don't even look at that other
[SPEAKER_03]: side that you know, if you tax it less,
you're going to have more businesses
[SPEAKER_03]: coming in, which will raise it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that they're oblivious to that side of
the argument.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know how to, how to broach
that gap so that they understand that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that that's actually a real
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that gets back to me kind of,
it seems so obvious, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I bring up Walmart, Costco,
and Amazon, they do high volume,
[SPEAKER_01]: low margin, and they, they have,
they're very profitable, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Versus Lamborghini, which sells,
you know, a limited number of cars per
[SPEAKER_01]: year at a very high margin, but not a lot
of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's our, that's our, that's our
California tax structure where the
[SPEAKER_01]: Lamborghini tax structure, but nobody's
making lots of money because you also
[SPEAKER_01]: don't get to deduct anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but so just quickly, when,
when you get paid, so your distributor
[SPEAKER_01]: collects money from the retail shops and
then do they literally like, is everything
[SPEAKER_01]: in cash or talk about like, are they
walking in with a big duffel bag of,
[SPEAKER_01]: of cash or, or do you get checks for
anything or?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's a very small duffel bag of cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, but, but it is, it is all cash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's no checks or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, yeah, it's, it's, it's cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I, I could get checks if I wanted
to.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then you run into the whole banking
thing and you know, but cash is just the
[SPEAKER_03]: easiest way to avoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you currently have a bank without
naming names?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many, how many banks have you gone
through?
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I, you know, the, the thing with banks is
an if banks know you're operating a
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis business, they won't allow you to
use their bank.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as far as I know, I'm not sure if
you're allowed to tell a bank your banking
[SPEAKER_03]: account is for something other than a
cannabis business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, you know, I, I'm not sure about the
legalities of any of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not to say I do or don't do any
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, but, but, but then the Facebook
machine, I'm just gonna, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've been in this industry,
I've been in this industry a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, uh, self-incriminate and
self-incrimination is not the best thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: which I'm sure Lauren will agree with me
that self-incrimination is never again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't, don't incriminate yourself at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any, any, I think we can probably wrap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just wanted to see if, uh,
Lauren or, uh, or Eric, if you guys have
[SPEAKER_01]: any last words, uh, things that are top of
mind for you in the, the joyful California
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as from myself, you know,
I would just like to point out,
[SPEAKER_03]: we didn't really get into it, but there
was that really bad fire that happened on
[SPEAKER_03]: Saturday.
[SPEAKER_03]: In downtown LA on a head shop row where
they were warehousing, most likely tens of
[SPEAKER_03]: thousands of cans of butane that
ultimately were most likely intended for
[SPEAKER_03]: people to illegally make hash oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think, uh, one, most of the initial
reports blamed it on making hash oil,
[SPEAKER_03]: which turned out to not be the case.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, our industry gets blamed for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, and secondly, it's another example of
why we need to continue to work harder to,
[SPEAKER_03]: to make our industry a hundred percent
legal above board and away from the
[SPEAKER_03]: illicit industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So things like this don't happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the first responders and LAFD
firefighters were hurt very, very badly in
[SPEAKER_03]: that fire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, one of the injuries I believe is,
is going to be one that, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: will be life-changing for one of these
firefighters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, this, this happened because
of the, the illegal industry, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, and it's, it's just, you know,
it's, and, and, and at the same time,
[SPEAKER_03]: we kind of get blamed for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just shows that there's more work
for us to be done and we have to continue
[SPEAKER_03]: to work to make it a hundred percent legal
industry in a zero percent illegal
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't have these things happen and
God bless our firefighters for going into
[SPEAKER_03]: these situations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it really just illustrates the bravery
of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of our first responders, you know,
let's throw LAPD in there for,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they, they do a lot of,
a lot of tough work as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all of our first responders all over
the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so really just want to give a shout
out to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, uh, yeah, but that's, I guess that
that's where I'll ended on something kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure more will come out to this
and it'll become a topic for another time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lauren.
[SPEAKER_00]: Top of my mind right now is getting
cannabis businesses, the, the relief and
[SPEAKER_00]: the assistance they need.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so, you know, that could look like
extending the deferral relief that the
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing agencies just offered,
you know, if we can get that extended past
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 days, that would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, if we can get at the federal level,
there's efforts now to get, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: first of all, to treat cannabis like other
businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're eligible for all the SBA loans
and other federal leaf, um, but also now
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis affix for cannabis banking
has been added to the latest coronavirus
[SPEAKER_00]: relief bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's called the heroes act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and as, as written, um, that would,
you know, open up banking access really
[SPEAKER_00]: for cannabis companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would, um, that would help a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I have a lot of clients that are
struggling because they don't have a good
[SPEAKER_00]: access to banking or their accounts to
keep getting shut down or, and it limits
[SPEAKER_00]: your ability to get, um, to get funding
really as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that is, uh, we'll see if it
passes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not super optimistic about it,
but I think what it shows is that at the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal label level, um, I actually think
that coronavirus has, uh, increased the
[SPEAKER_00]: chances of cannabis getting federally
legal sooner, just because so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different States have deemed these
businesses to be essential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so many different now federal,
uh, lawmakers are signing on to,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, things that would add, you know,
provide cannabis, uh, relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I think that there is a tide that's,
you know, turning there federally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm optimistic about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think folks should get involved and
advocate to all your representatives,
[SPEAKER_00]: local, state, and federal, um,
cause, uh, you know, legalization would
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly help a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we could do cross border
transactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could, you know, participate in the
global cannabis market that is out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and so that's really the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also just, um, you know, making sure
that everyone stays safe right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a scary and confusing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay sane, um, and, uh, helping each other
out and we'll, we can get through this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, um, no one can do it alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gotta be there for each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that, we will end the conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just conclude with the slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, we are stopping the live
stream.
Thank you.
