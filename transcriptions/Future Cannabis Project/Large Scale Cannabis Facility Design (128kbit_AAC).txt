[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here today because what keeps me in
this industry is that no parent should
[SPEAKER_00]: have to worry about administering medicine
to their sick child or get in a car and
[SPEAKER_00]: have a fear of going from their legal
growth to the legal dispensary,
[SPEAKER_00]: but getting arrested along the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The laws here have to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: California, I worked here for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got out about four years ago and became
a consultant kind of nationwide and in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really fell in love with building
facilities, so I've kind of done it all,
[SPEAKER_00]: ran dispensaries, cultivated for 10 years,
but I really love the way a building is
[SPEAKER_00]: put together and what that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I'm here to talk to you
guys about tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all starts from the same place,
and that's the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how it's grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have an obligation as caregivers,
as brand ambassadors, what have you,
[SPEAKER_00]: to deliver medical grade cannabis to the
community at large.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that's a moral obligation,
it's an ethical obligation, and pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: soon it's going to be a legal obligation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all have to get on page with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea that a lot of growers are one
harvest away from losing everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this means that they have to push bad
product onto the market a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big problem in this state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a problem in other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm here today to talk about cleaning
up your grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when a flower doesn't bloom,
you fix the environment in which it grows,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what I focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is benefits of indoor ag working with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I started scaling up into
facilities that were 5,000, 50,000,
[SPEAKER_00]: 100,000 square feet or more, I found large
scale ag and I thought, where have you
[SPEAKER_00]: been?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where is a large scale ag?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the hydro industry did something pretty
tricky where they renamed all these things
[SPEAKER_00]: that already existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Benches became tables, stands,
trays.
[SPEAKER_00]: They changed the vernacular so you
wouldn't know what to look for on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're paying three times the price for an
inferior product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you scale up to a larger facility,
you should never shop at a hydro store
[SPEAKER_00]: again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope there's no hydro store owners here,
are there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just kidding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works for garages.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, much of large scale ag's
industrial equipment is beneficial to
[SPEAKER_00]: streamlining the production procedures of
cannabis, the consistency quality
[SPEAKER_00]: assurance methods used in large scale ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hire plant scientists all the time and I
teach them cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that you have to be a 10 year
veteran grower to get this is just not
[SPEAKER_00]: true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps, but it's the same methodologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same nutrient base.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a plant that functions a million
different ways and we have thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: different strains, but that's where we're
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why automation is important to indoor
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't install automation in our
facilities so that your grower can become
[SPEAKER_00]: lazier and just kick back and watch the
plants grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he can do his job and actually look for
problems before they become problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're spending your time hand
watering or checking timers or doing any
[SPEAKER_00]: of these things that can be done through
streamlined automation that have existed
[SPEAKER_00]: in large scale ag for 50 years,
you need to check your program.
[SPEAKER_00]: Automation is scary at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was terrified by it, but it's really
served me in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from everything from seed to sale
software to become compliant to machines
[SPEAKER_00]: that fill pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once you scale past a certain size,
you have to automate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the importance of R&D, and you can't
really see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tracy, who was just up here a few minutes
ago, I worked with her a little bit and
[SPEAKER_00]: mainly she's one of my really good friends
and favorite people on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her daughter suffers from an optic pathway
glioma tumor.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's supposed to be blind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis pretty much saved her vision.
[SPEAKER_00]: It saved her health overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: This kid you would not know is sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you meet her, she's the happiest,
most joyful three year old you've ever met
[SPEAKER_00]: in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: First time I met her, she jumped in my lap
and said, I love you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a big part of it has to do with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's undeniable at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I think of an eight month old or a
90 year old or someone with a severely
[SPEAKER_00]: compromised immune system, we have that
moral obligation again to give them the
[SPEAKER_00]: best quality medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the studies that they're doing in
Israel is basically they're studying,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're stripping apart the plant and
studying the individual cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_00]: the ones that they find most useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they have 11 of them mapped out
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're inputting them into rats.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're showing is that the way
the strain profiles are manipulated
[SPEAKER_00]: through this testing, it can alleviate
breast cancer by 100%, but one won't touch
[SPEAKER_00]: pancreatic cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I believe within the next five years or
so, we will have kind of a map of what
[SPEAKER_00]: strains work best for what illnesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're currently working on that now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking to publish research that I don't
even know if I'm allowed to talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they do these 96 well play accounts
where they take 96 little trays and
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll put the same tumor with the same
genetic mutations in each tray.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they'll try different strains of
cannabis, different profiles of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids against these different
genetic mutations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some will touch it by 100%,
some 30%, some 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to know what that 100% is and
how we can replicate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time without fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with regulation comes responsibility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comes responsibility to legality,
to our patients most of all.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's patients first.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my number one mission is to make
sure patients get the best medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we designed clean rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took some server processor HVAC guys
from Silicon Valley and I employed them
[SPEAKER_00]: and said, what can we do with cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we realized that there's a big
disconnect between cultivators,
[SPEAKER_00]: construction companies, engineers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We came out on the market and Colorado
legalized and said, okay, you can go to
[SPEAKER_00]: 100,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what did they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: They grabbed the guy from his garage that
grew the best stuff that they knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they grabbed the construction company
in town and they tried to put the two
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't scale that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like trying to turn a liquor store
into a Costco.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like trying to buy a hydro store
instead of a large scale app.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reasons we do clean room designs is
to mitigate pests and pathogens from even
[SPEAKER_00]: entering the facility so they don't become
a problem later.
[SPEAKER_00]: To cultivate medical grade cannabis,
of course, to comply with state and
[SPEAKER_00]: post-legislation guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accurate scientific studies and R&D based
on the best material possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you saw Sanjay Gupta's
Weed 3 or what they're studying out there
[SPEAKER_00]: in the university.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mississippi, but it's absolute trash.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you study trash, you're gonna get trash
results.
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we study the best stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: What if we study the most consistent
stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we get then?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm interested in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Negative pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like 90% of the facilities that I walk
into have sewer gas because we have these
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon filters that were designed for
garages so that your neighbor wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: smell your stash growing in your garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have them sucking constantly at
like 1,400 CFMs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you first put together a building,
you can do some diagnostics on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is how we put together our
buildings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do lower door tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be on a retrofit, not a ground
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it measures the overall building's air
leakage, quantifies heating and cooling
[SPEAKER_00]: costs, and it tests how sealed the
building's envelope is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It exposes all major points of air
leakage.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of reasons for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk about the hazards of reverse
negative pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It invites pests and pathogens into the
cultivation facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have air sucking in,
you have that reverse negative pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: going on, there's a lot of problems that
come with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So air will always travel the path of
least resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gonna pull from all the most
undesirable places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your basement, your attic, every crack,
every crevice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always the most undesirable
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the most efficient or cost
effective way to control an environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when you're trying to save
money and price per pound is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the last is it can pull sewer gases
into the room through dried out P-traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those air filters will always dry out
the P-traps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unless you have a trap primer or you've
thought about that before, 90% of the
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities I walk into, I walk up to the
floor drain, and I can always feel that
[SPEAKER_00]: air hit my hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know those people are breathing
sewer gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very bad problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this came from cultivating in your
garage and you just throw every hose into
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever drain you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, unless there's an air gap in that
hose, it's gonna grow bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this comes from condensate lines of
air conditioners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry to get so technical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the condensate lines from air
conditioners, if there's no air gap,
[SPEAKER_00]: it'll actually grow mold and bacteria
straight into your head unit and
[SPEAKER_00]: distribute it throughout your room,
facility, what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biological contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is caused from dirty HVAC systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Legionella.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Legionnaire's disease was caused,
came from Legionella.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a water borer bacterium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's detected in cooling tower water,
but it can also grow through that
[SPEAKER_00]: condensate line as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cladosporium is a common of outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is also when you get that mold smell
in your air conditioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cladosporium.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another one I'll just flip
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Endotoxin cell wall component of
gram-negative bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a really bad one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Known for respiratory problems and all
kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So controlling HVAC biocontamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Upgraded filtration efficiency of overall
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maintain proper filter changes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proper maintenance and cleaning of cooling
coils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drainage fan should be added to all of
your SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Design the system with the Airstream so it
doesn't come in contact with that internal
[SPEAKER_00]: porous system in the HVAC, in your head
units, because that actually breeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: some people don't know this, but your best
form of integrated pest management is a
[SPEAKER_00]: good environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will treat, oh I'm putting
fluoramide and all this stuff and they
[SPEAKER_00]: keep coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're breeding in your HVAC system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine times out of 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So reduced surface area and all
particulate matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particulate matter, the best way to
describe it is anytime there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: particulate matter, pests and pathogens
have something to cling to.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all this crazy duct work up here that's
totally excessive and unnecessary,
[SPEAKER_00]: should be recessed and these registers
should point down and be blocked out with
[SPEAKER_00]: drywall.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a bunch of this duct work
running through your system, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have to get up there and clean it every
few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of it, and it just creates more
surface area more properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove all exposed wood from the
cultivation facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wood is not your friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to replace everything with metal
or unistret.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should never use wood in a cultivation
facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breeds mold, breeds bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: It breeds pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use anti-microbial paint too if
you already have it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also wine barrel paint that works
really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a system that my company kind
of invented to streamline processes
[SPEAKER_00]: because back when we were using the HPS
lights, they have to be like a foot and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half to three feet away from the top of
the canopy at all time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we thought it takes way too long to
move these lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we invented this system where with the
touch of a button, you can move the lights
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have these rows up to like 60,
80 feet or 60 lights or 80 lights in
[SPEAKER_00]: length.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make them as long as possible and
you can move the whole row, streamline,
[SPEAKER_00]: very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have employees standing on
ladders trying to move things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just works really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's part of automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irrigation is a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a facility enrichment.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the top feed doser system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was basically all locked in place so we
had to add these octa-bubblers on each
[SPEAKER_00]: line so that it blew oxygen through the
line so it's less likely to clog.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a lot of options when it comes to
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically depends what size your
facility is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cons are it's difficult to clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're focusing on human error and I'm not
a fan of leaving it up to human error.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd much rather blame the machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we built these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so these are doser systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of when you step up and you
don't want big bulky reservoirs in the
[SPEAKER_00]: room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want line fed irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't use a large scale ag forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've kind of integrated them into
cannabis and they have some cool fail
[SPEAKER_00]: safes and user alerts that tell you any
time your set points are off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fertigation, this would be like your prevo
or argus big voice system when you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: feed six to four different nutrient
regimens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a perpetual harvest or
you're on an assembly line type circuit,
[SPEAKER_00]: you would have to have one of these
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cons are the upfront cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they are scalable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do come in smaller models and you can
scale up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, this is the biggest facility that
we've designed to date.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in Nova Scotia and they're held up
in licensing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're like 80% built out right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it basically functions like a
clean room facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it's a clearer picture,
but you enter on the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these are different hallways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cultivation team has their own hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Processing team has their own hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ancillary management has their own
hallway.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no cross contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody has to shower before they go
into the facility, put on a pocketless
[SPEAKER_00]: gown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And walk into the facility because Canada,
when we first designed this, they proposed
[SPEAKER_00]: no pesticides, organic or non-organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to design it in this fashion so
that we would never have a problem because
[SPEAKER_00]: we couldn't use pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also have third party auditors
propose that would come to your facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: pick the sample they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that doesn't pass testing, there's an
onsite incinerator where everything goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the standards we built to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like using pesticides,
so I designed so I don't have to use them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had one facility that functioned for
seven years without a single introduction
[SPEAKER_00]: of pester pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know it can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a lot more work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know that what you're buying
doesn't have pathogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Colorado, you still don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any state that can pick their own sample
out of a batch and go, OK, this looks
[SPEAKER_00]: good, and send that in for testing,
you're really not going to know,
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of my fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I get up and speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I do push for the third party
auditors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of compliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to know that anything that is
grown and given to Tracy's daughter or my
[SPEAKER_00]: grandmother who's stage four is going to
be helping them and not hurting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when I started 14 years ago,
none of this was happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the last four years or so,
I feel like we're moving at lightning
[SPEAKER_00]: speed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my hope is that sooner than later,
it will be implemented.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I have anything to do about it on
my soapbox, then hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_04]: You work with a lot of businesses that are
scaling up.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the biggest challenge for the
company owner?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's multiple challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with everybody, every individual
client, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be scalability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the team already in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be a failing facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't think there's one universal
answer for that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are multiple challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the biggest one we face is budget.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we come from this kind of garage
mentality and you try to convince somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: to scale up and that they need to
basically create a food processing center,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't register.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my god, I built this for 20 grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is that Nova Scotia facility cost,
generally?
[SPEAKER_00]: $34 million to date and probably going to
be more than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they've been held up for- Then what's
the payback?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the investment?
[SPEAKER_04]: How many years is it going to take to
take?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that it pays back faster
than any other business I've seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Canada's case, they've been held
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these guys took a risk, a big risk,
and they put a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sent everybody build out letters,
said, go ahead, build out your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a year into the building process,
they said, stop everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not legalizing and everybody's been
sitting in line ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had to drop hammers a year and a
half ago now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you need pharma to fund this stuff or
do you need farmers to fund this stuff?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you need pharma to come in and start
funding these big facilities?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're well-funded, but they are not-
They said, go ahead, start the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they pulled everything back and now
they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just held up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will get passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a too big to fail scenario,
but yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a technical question.
[SPEAKER_03]: In your clean rooms, have you ever brought
a technology called AeroSide into the
[SPEAKER_03]: clean rooms?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a technology developed by NASA
supposedly for- Do you work for AeroSide?
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do the same thing you do, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was curious about the technology.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard good things about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was supposedly developed by NASA for
space station.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's supposed to destroy ethanol and make
water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Supposedly, it's good for killing
pathogens and fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot of new products out
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not familiar with that company.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of- The NASA-born technology
is typically five-cell, and it all comes
[SPEAKER_00]: from the same house.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's negatively charged ions that bond to
positively charged ions that are 100 times
[SPEAKER_00]: heavier than gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll grab anything in the air that's an
airborne particulate like a powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: and it'll drag it to the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't eliminate it, but it's like a
magnet that goes around and magnetizes the
[SPEAKER_00]: airborne particulates and drags it to the
ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the same technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do use it, and it's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
I
[SPEAKER_02]: was wondering about your- You said a lot
of cleaning with the air conditioning.
[SPEAKER_02]: During this season, how do you fluctuate
the air?
[SPEAKER_02]: When it gets hotter, what is the best time
that you have, and when do you run your
[SPEAKER_02]: lights?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you run your light, obviously at night,
and it's cooler, the air you're pulling
[SPEAKER_02]: in, how much air conditioning you would
need?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it an outdoor system?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you think the temp- With bugs and
mold, it also has a lot to do with
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It all depends.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're designing a facility in Nova
Scotia or our new one in Hawaii,
[SPEAKER_00]: it all depends on that environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be the same environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we do our environmental calculations,
we take everything into account.
[SPEAKER_00]: We take in your longitude, your latitude,
your record highs, your record lows,
[SPEAKER_00]: the insulated value of your windows,
the depth of your slab without getting too
[SPEAKER_00]: technical and boring everyone in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's too many parameters for one single
answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that every building is
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: To keep the best way to keep fuel
efficiency so you're not having to run
[SPEAKER_02]: your air all the time, and keep your
temperature sustained at the right
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should all be shorter.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a program called Write Soft.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like CAD for HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can plug in all those values into it,
and it'll spit out those numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: your R values and everything involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you normally run your light at night,
or do it around the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you have to be on a flip because
you're on some kind of power grid
[SPEAKER_00]: situation where you don't have enough
power, so you have to run 112,
[SPEAKER_00]: and 12, and another 12, and 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no real way to know how to keep
your temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, indoors you create your own
seasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're pulling air from outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your air changes per hour?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so pull from outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's hot outside, you're pulling hot
air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so you would have to engineer your
entire building, and that's why I hire
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner room experts from Silicon Valley
to engineer each building individually and
[SPEAKER_00]: put the parameters and set points based on
their environment, based on their
[SPEAKER_00]: structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was also wondering if there's any
interning possibilities for these
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Interning possibilities for these
facilities?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are looking into that, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm currently leaving Hawaii for three
months, so after that time, possibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we got time for one more,
which is going to be right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, my name is, hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to know how your industry,
the healthy edible industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: It all starts with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, how could your industry, healthy as,
okay, I'll change it to personal.
[SPEAKER_01]: How could you help me?
[SPEAKER_00]: By producing clean, consistent product
year-round.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would I get what you do to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I am just starting to work in
California again after the four-year
[SPEAKER_00]: stint.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they passed the new legislation,
I actually came back from an eight-month
[SPEAKER_00]: stint in Chicago.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working on some manufacturing
facilities here out in the desert,
[SPEAKER_00]: based on other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's probably, theoretically,
California for me, for our company,
[SPEAKER_00]: is like a year out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other question is, so what you're
saying is paraphrased what you were
[SPEAKER_01]: referring to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you saying that there's no such thing,
I know I'm stretching, I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you saying that there's no such thing
as organic,
[SPEAKER_01]: a lack, a total lack of pesticides,
that every row there's some until
[SPEAKER_01]: something like this is the norm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and no.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some responsible cultivators out
there that I have to give credit to that
[SPEAKER_00]: do everything the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: My brother's an organic farmer in
Mendocino County, and he will cut down and
[SPEAKER_00]: throw away everything before he puts a
pesticide on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are those people, and I have to
commend that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, we're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, guys.
Thank you all.
Thank you, everyone.
Thank you all.
Thank you.
