What
[SPEAKER_00]: are your thoughts on Los Angeles County?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on Los Angeles
County?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on Los Angeles
County?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on Los Angeles
County?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on Los Angeles
County?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your thoughts on Los Angeles
County?
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically the path to legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, and it's interesting to mention
that because that was really the ultimate
[SPEAKER_00]: goal the supervisors had stated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that their goal behind this is
to maximize the transition of an illicit
[SPEAKER_00]: market into a regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they're stating that, the policies
don't seem to really support what their
[SPEAKER_00]: goal is on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're looking at it now, and so a
year ago they wanted to spend that money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fast forwarding a little bit, we certainly
did a good job to fight back against them
[SPEAKER_00]: spending that $25 million.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did not have the funds to come
after the operators because we just showed
[SPEAKER_00]: that it did not seem to make sense for
them to do such a strict enforcement on
[SPEAKER_00]: them prior to having real regulations in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you see last week, February now 2018,
a year later, that the discussion has
[SPEAKER_00]: evolved with them over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been able to host expungement
clinics and so on and so forth that now
[SPEAKER_00]: the county has actually put in a motion
saying that they are directing several
[SPEAKER_00]: different various departments from the DA
to sheriff's to you name it, to start
[SPEAKER_00]: coming together to actually have a unified
system that could potentially just
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically send out people who have
previous cannabis convictions and
[SPEAKER_00]: expungements.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would just get a letter in the mail
saying your record no longer exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's incredible in contrast to think
that literally almost a year ago to date
[SPEAKER_00]: they went from let's spend $25 million to
go after them to now it's hey let's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually help them out and get rid of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So LA County, the overall discussion has
evolved and they understand the importance
[SPEAKER_00]: behind that better than they certainly did
a year ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't though necessarily mean that
they understand everything that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's still plenty of room to
figure out what there is on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that was achieved last
year is that the Board of Supervisors
[SPEAKER_00]: through the Office of Cannabis Management
had set up a what they call an advisory
[SPEAKER_00]: working group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the advisory working group was made up
of 17 individuals with various backgrounds
[SPEAKER_00]: from doctors on the academic to you know
literal medical doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those who were pro cannabis and those were
against cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the intent of it was to have this
group come together and write a set of
[SPEAKER_00]: recommendations that the Board of
Supervisors would be basing their
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations for cannabis in the county.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very interesting process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took several months with us meeting
weekly on that different topics every time
[SPEAKER_00]: that we met.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know to mention on that you know I was
part of that process there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If for a recommendation to be made it had
to have reached consensus amongst all the
[SPEAKER_00]: members within a committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that meant that those that were either
for or against it had to find language
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be comfortable for both sides
that would ultimately promote a
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible policy within the realm of
regulations here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was interesting to see this whole
process coming forward on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially what was two sides did come
together to come up and make these lists
[SPEAKER_00]: of regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And coincidentally we had 64 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say coincidentally because you know
all this passed with Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it certainly wasn't you know our
intent to do that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this list you know it turned out to be
a 300 page report that was meant to guide
[SPEAKER_00]: the supervisors on saying OK these are the
next steps we take.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we've done this this is how we
want to roll out regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since that time the Board of Supervisors
have now had you know that report was
[SPEAKER_00]: published in October of 2017 and they've
had now several months to look at it study
[SPEAKER_00]: it and consider it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just recently have now proposed
their first draft of regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's concerning to us in general
because their their set of regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: have come out and they literally have 12
regulate 12 recommendations is what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're looking at right now versus the 64
that we made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the discussions that we have in there
we're discovering more and more while the
[SPEAKER_00]: topic is certainly very multilayered and
complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're learning that they have not taken
perhaps the sincerest effort needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: study everything that we put out there and
as well as other materials on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for instance there is a report that
comes in from the Office of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: Management that states that the current
market right now of the existing operators
[SPEAKER_00]: is at a level of about 77 or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: So within the unincorporated areas you
have about 77 of these existing retail
[SPEAKER_00]: operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't specify what they have for
delivery and they say that in general they
[SPEAKER_00]: can't really determine how many they have
for all the other types of from
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation manufacturing and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they have this number out there and it
contrasts directly and they do point this
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the report it contrasts directly
the recommendation that they've put out
[SPEAKER_00]: there saying that they only want to allow
20 retail licenses for the entire county.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that to us is a immediate red flag
because it sets up potentially one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: largest illicit markets in the largest
county in the nation in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's setting up people to
essentially be recriminalized on something
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're trying to give them a pathway
out of you know what was in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: stigma for all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's an odd contrast again because
here we are last week the board passing
[SPEAKER_00]: the expungement directive to get that
automated and it seems to fit in line with
[SPEAKER_00]: the spirit of Prop 64 was and yet at the
same time the policies are now just
[SPEAKER_00]: showing this like okay we want to get this
taken care of at the same time the policy
[SPEAKER_00]: will just lead them right back to being
recriminalized again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just sticking on in this case retail
you're saying from their deduction they
[SPEAKER_01]: believe they're about 77 operators but
they want to have 20 which implies that
[SPEAKER_01]: they want to shut down 57 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well yeah and and you know it's it's an
interesting thing it's a discussion we
[SPEAKER_00]: have so one of the recommendations we made
is that they need to provide for a pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: for the existing operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the intent is to try to get rid of the
illicit market and encourage responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: operators to come into a regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time there is a on the
supervisors level there is a two paths of
[SPEAKER_00]: this discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is what do we do about existing
operators and the other one is how large
[SPEAKER_00]: should the market be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not necessarily the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to showcase them saying
that your own report states that the
[SPEAKER_00]: market is at least 77 operators big and
that's strictly on the medical side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know so we don't know what the adult
you side could certainly grow that on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and where that's illicit market
certainly comes in from that stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: because like you mentioned on that that's
if you're going to just look at those and
[SPEAKER_00]: they could transition let's say no one
else applies on that that's immediately 50
[SPEAKER_00]: somewhat operators that you know become
illicit or have to stay illicit.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like something magical that
they're just going to say we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out another way to feed our
families.
[SPEAKER_01]: So would a reasonable path there be to say
as long as each of these operators meets
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever the criteria is for receiving a
permit for retail that if they go through
[SPEAKER_01]: that process each of them could make the
transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is partly on that end.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it comes down to is now timing issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the board had originally intended to
address this on December 19th of 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here we are now pushing almost into
March and likely be March before they see
[SPEAKER_00]: this issue for the first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Could be longer than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what was originally intended that they
would start accepting license applications
[SPEAKER_00]: in June of 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it will probably be towards
the later end of 2018 maybe even early
[SPEAKER_00]: 2019 that application start.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we do in the meantime of nearly
a year where you still have an illicit
[SPEAKER_00]: market with operators are there that are
waiting to transition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would do it yesterday gladly if the
system was set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I assume you've talked to a lot of
these operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's going through their heads
because I think some have even just shut
[SPEAKER_01]: down because they have they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it's very hard for them to
understand what is the best way to go
[SPEAKER_00]: forward on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the letter of law they it's been
confusing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So prior to 2018 you could have operators
were technically states compliant under
[SPEAKER_00]: Prop 215 laws but locally they were not
compliant because the county had just
[SPEAKER_00]: banned it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now after the passing with 2018 and now a
legal cannabis market it becomes more
[SPEAKER_00]: murky as to what that gray area is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes we still have this collective model
that is recognized by a state for the year
[SPEAKER_00]: but really still defaults by local law as
to that's something they can operate on or
[SPEAKER_00]: not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with these operators here their their
intent and their desires obviously to come
[SPEAKER_00]: into this regulated market but with no
pathway there existing for them the only
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity they have or thought that they
have is either to shut down which is not
[SPEAKER_00]: an easy thing to do when you have families
to feed and not just theirs but employees
[SPEAKER_00]: and so on or or to continue operating with
the threat of potentially getting enforced
[SPEAKER_00]: against.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen that their intent is to
regulate and they want to have a regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: markets where we have concerns is how
quickly they do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advantage of them taking a little
slower approach on this is that they get
[SPEAKER_00]: to learn from the mistakes of other
jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So City of L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: for instance has certain things that they
had perhaps opportunities to do better on.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the county will hopefully
not repeat those same mistakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean that they won't invent
and create their own mistakes as well too
[SPEAKER_00]: in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the timing is what the issue is coming
down to on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we have our discussions with the
board on that we know with their staff
[SPEAKER_00]: it's concerning to us to where we bring up
saying hey here's this limit of 20 that's
[SPEAKER_00]: being recommended and we're talking about
the 77 the 77 that's in their own report
[SPEAKER_00]: that came from the county doing this and
their response was to saying where did you
[SPEAKER_00]: get this number 77.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know when they're not having the
time needed I guess or whatever they're
[SPEAKER_00]: not dedicating that to to actually read
their own reports and study them to
[SPEAKER_00]: contrast and see what is the right policy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very much a concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: However you know we we appreciate that
they want to do the slow rollout because
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to be responsible and thoughtful
on how they do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The slow rollout cannot be done in such a
way that it just hurts people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: process as well too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that they want to do it slower
so they can kind of protect and have
[SPEAKER_00]: public safety and health involved in all
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it just hurts other people that
have been doing something forever feeding
[SPEAKER_00]: their families and they have no other way
to go that's not going to work either.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know the other aspect to all this
stuff that's concerning is let's say that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were just going to start with a 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would be okay with that because they
want to do a rollout on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd be okay with that if there was a
reasonable time rate for the rollout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their recommended time rate right now is
three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially they're saying we would
give only 20 licenses for a population
[SPEAKER_00]: that is equal to the fourth largest city
in the state and that those 20 licenses
[SPEAKER_00]: would only be there for the next three
years and at that point we'll reevaluate
[SPEAKER_00]: and see where it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning they would they would issue the 20
licenses quickly but then they put a
[SPEAKER_01]: moratorium on additional licenses for at
least three years.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's disingenuine because the zoning
that they're currently proposing on that
[SPEAKER_00]: many of the larger swathes of land that
they want absolutely have no
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure in them at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no sewage, no power,
no anything to go with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time you get permitting anything on
that it could likely take up to three
[SPEAKER_00]: years for an operator to actually be up
and running.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the money, all the funds that goes
in there that does nothing to go back to
[SPEAKER_00]: their primary goal of transitioning this
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing going to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are going to have to elicit,
you know run and elicit out of the market
[SPEAKER_00]: for that to survive in one shape or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: you you
