[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about that purple panty
dropper.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is it in everything?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the story behind that strain,
which sometimes it's not great for me to
[SPEAKER_02]: mention it because it's not super
politically correct, but the purple panty
[SPEAKER_02]: dropper was something that came from some
sort of hill seeds, I kind of call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's some friends, some old-time growers
in Humboldt, and actually southern Oregon
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I crossed it with purple haze and
Matanuska mist, and eventually it just
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of worked its way into our breeding
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, a good breeder should have
kind of like a stud that they really do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's what it is for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your male.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was for, you know, back in the early
2000s.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, up to 2010, we used a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reason that we named it that isn't
because we, you know, like to... Anyway,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not a PC name, but the purple panty
dropper got named when there was a party
[SPEAKER_02]: at the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I woke up in the morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even partake in the party.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I woke up in the morning and walked up
to the garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, there's this pair of
purple panties like right there at the top
[SPEAKER_02]: of the trail in this little circle of open
clearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, there's, you know,
plenty of purple budding plants all around
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I went down to the party, which was
still happening, and said, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a good name for a strain now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But formerly it was known as purple
passion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I guess it's always kind of inspired
passionate behavior, whether it was panty
[SPEAKER_02]: dropping or just being happy.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you've crossed that into a lot of
varieties over the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, the interesting thing
about like, when you're really full
[SPEAKER_02]: disclosure about how you breed a strain,
I mean, if you... Whether something is
[SPEAKER_02]: still relevant is another question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, well, tell everybody what we have
used to make the variety, but it may not
[SPEAKER_02]: be necessarily very relevant anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if it was originally made with purple
panty dropper or, you know, blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: muffin, but then it's had, you know,
lots of back crossing happen like any true
[SPEAKER_02]: good breeder should be doing to provide
like a consistent uniform seed line,
[SPEAKER_02]: then it won't really, you know,
display a lot of characteristics of some
[SPEAKER_02]: of those early crosses that you used to
create it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: While, you know, it's still, you know,
full disclosure to mention it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's standard practice too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in cannabis industry, you see a lot of
folks who are like, this is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: blah, blah, blah times green crack times,
you know, OG or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that doesn't necessarily mean that
you're just going to pick up a bud and
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke it and be like, I taste green crack.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, a hint of OG,
it might be something completely new if
[SPEAKER_02]: you've spent some time working with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when we're talking about hybrids
of hybrids of hybrids, you see these
[SPEAKER_01]: recessive genetics come out and you're
like, what was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was some obscure trait in one of
the great grandparents or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why, you know, we like to
reference the genetic variation that's,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, sort of the hetero homozygosity
that you can find out through genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis using like phyllis bioscience or
a number of the different genetic research
[SPEAKER_02]: services that are available now to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can actually like go ahead and
submit a seed line and they'll tell you
[SPEAKER_02]: exactly how diverse or uniform the
offspring will be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So and a lot of our stuff, you know,
we're pretty proud that it's really,
[SPEAKER_02]: really far into the uniform on the uniform
end of the spectrum rather than the
[SPEAKER_02]: diverse.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that said, you know, like,
gosh, six, seven, eight, nine,
[SPEAKER_02]: ten, twenty years ago, we had a lot of
diversity in our varietals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since we've been around and humble for
a long, long time, you know, sometimes I
[SPEAKER_02]: get some shit about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: People will be like, oh, you know,
you use the same, you know, purple panty
[SPEAKER_02]: dropper or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just like, hey, you know,
try us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give us a try again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Five years, ten years after you,
you know, had diversity in your in your
[SPEAKER_02]: garden and in any seed, these,
you know, there's really at this point in
[SPEAKER_02]: time, there's really not any such thing as
like a true breeding cannabis seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you compare it to like a major
agricultural crop like corn that's been
[SPEAKER_02]: focused on for, you know, 100 plus years
by breeders like with a scientific method
[SPEAKER_02]: and and breeding strategy, the traditional
breeding practices and and now,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, genetic markers, marker assisted
breeding and and you can really have like
[SPEAKER_02]: a row of corn or an acre or 10 acres of
corn that are almost as completely
[SPEAKER_02]: identical plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, even genetically, they're,
you know, not much drift in the
[SPEAKER_02]: population, whereas with cannabis,
we just haven't really gotten there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that we've been
really working on over the last five or
[SPEAKER_02]: six years internally is making bread lines
and then doing, you know, real F1 hybrids
[SPEAKER_02]: rather than, you know, what everybody
refers to as as an F1 or an F2 or F3.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not actually, you know,
in conventional agriculture, that wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: be even something that anybody would even
share with the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's still in the realm of
pollen chucking at that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we are on camera.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on a microphone up and stuff,
I don't have anything against breeders
[SPEAKER_02]: that do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I started out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, if you're
misrepresenting it in some way,
[SPEAKER_02]: then maybe that's not such a good thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does can give seed growing,
you know, kind of a bad name a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've I've gotten some of the most
phenomenal product ever out of completely
[SPEAKER_01]: random crosses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, friends of her friend,
a friend have done not any kind of bash
[SPEAKER_01]: against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just touches on a word that you use
that came up earlier when I was talking
[SPEAKER_01]: with Beth about stability and what
stability means.
[SPEAKER_01]: And stability has until recently,
at least in my world, referred to the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability for one seed to be similar to
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have a line.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially when we're growing these
big plants that are part of this one can
[SPEAKER_01]: be matched up with this other in the
finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that's that's a big thing that we
that's the goal is like we started saying,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we guarantee you can walk down
the row.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, this is subjective because
it's up to everybody's opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But cut and throw it into the same bin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that said, one of the
hardest things that I've noticed to nail
[SPEAKER_02]: down is the level of anthocyanin purple in
in each plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is kind of been sort of at least
one of our golden grails is trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: breed a strain that is like purple every
single time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the same degree of purple every
single time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like our blueberry muffin strain,
that one just, you know, it continues to
[SPEAKER_02]: elude us like getting the purple super
consistent.
[SPEAKER_02]: The smell, on the other hand, like every
single time is blueberry muffin smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's that's what I've seen in growing is
that it's just it's a it's a color
[SPEAKER_01]: difference when it comes down to the end
and how the color comes in, whether it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes in very much at the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or whether it almost starts off the
process as purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to be the case whenever
you have purple cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have potentially like the
top of the plant or the south side might
[SPEAKER_02]: get purple quicker and the north side not
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're going to have a variable
degree of of the purple pigment no matter
[SPEAKER_02]: what.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just something to keep.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to keep working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but it is it's like that's the crux of
seeds and clones and breeding and that
[SPEAKER_02]: whole thing is, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then what you said, like distinct what
we call distinct population crosses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So purposefully being like, well,
I'm going to take something that is way
[SPEAKER_02]: over here from, you know, Colombia,
Jamaican land race and cross it with
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's much more common and and,
you know, sort of westernized or American
[SPEAKER_02]: or whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's going to produce a vast array
of diversity in the progeny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the likelihood of finding
something amazing is actually increased
[SPEAKER_02]: when you have that kind of a, you know,
spread of diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And but on the other hand, the likelihood
of having something that's kind of like
[SPEAKER_02]: want want want is also increased.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the more diversity, the higher your
chances are of finding something really
[SPEAKER_02]: cool and the higher the chances are of
having, you know, a few entire plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: you grow that are just like, oh,
man, this is going to be like the hardest
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff to sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's not like what any commercial
grower wants to be doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why we did that giant phenotype
or phenotype mega hunt project this last
[SPEAKER_02]: summer, where we like looked through
10,000 cannabis plants at, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 different licensed facilities
throughout the state and tracked it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have our own gas liquid
chromatograph so we can test it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we got our data spreadsheet
that we enter all the info.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was a lot of goddamn work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, man, I still like that's why I'm
late kind of getting here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we're doing that right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my family is watching after all the
babies and helping keep them happy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've narrowed them down
significantly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it went from 10,000 three months ago,
you know, over the course of the summer,
[SPEAKER_02]: 10,000 cuttings off 10,000 unique plants
quickly, you know, narrowed it down after
[SPEAKER_02]: depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we essentially want to get it
down to the best one percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then from there, you know,
really now we're like the best point five
[SPEAKER_02]: percent, which, you know, so we really
want to end up with 50 keepers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I think as far as the
stability of the seed stock goes,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's there's kind of two different
schools of thought is what are you doing
[SPEAKER_01]: with the seeds?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you growing them in the nature that
like you're talking when you talk about
[SPEAKER_01]: stability in these rows, you're talking
about seed plants, outdoor big picture,
[SPEAKER_01]: planting the plant to be the plant that it
is versus other people are saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, I'm taking this seed stock and I'm
doing a pheno hunt with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm finding the keeper, maybe the two
keepers, but typically just the best of
[SPEAKER_01]: the best in their eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that, how great is stability really
versus having the potential to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: one that's that's so fabulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have two programs essentially in the
way we breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is looking for diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the quickest and easiest
program.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just take something that's really
different and random.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to mash it up and you mash it
up and you produce seeds and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: plant them and hunt through them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the really simple one.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never like sell those seeds,
for example, there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we give them and share them
openly with people that want to
[SPEAKER_02]: participate in that process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the hard work is stabilizing
something that you've already sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: identified as being unique and special and
then creating a long, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: true breeding line, which we're still a
little ways from getting to true breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think, you know, we're there with
some of our lines to where you can walk
[SPEAKER_02]: down the road and, you know, harvest into
the same tote from plant to plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another thing we were talking about
earlier about just this perfect kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: segue into this first stability is the use
of the word stability is that we've always
[SPEAKER_01]: used and when I say we I just mean my my
smaller community within within this
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger community is that we use it in
reference to what you're talking about,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is that this one looks like the
other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in recent times with the kind of with
all of the feminized stock going on,
[SPEAKER_01]: with all of that, that we've started to
see the word stability refer to its
[SPEAKER_01]: propensity to hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I noticed that as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always assume that it would just refer
to like the uniform nature of the rise.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's how we've always kind of
referenced it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I do I'll get people being like,
oh, yeah, so it doesn't ever
[SPEAKER_02]: hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, shit, if it if anything has
a propensity to hermaphrodite,
[SPEAKER_02]: we get it out the door as quickly as
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not in the school that that's
that's the good stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the pollen source for the know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw that post.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you see that recent post?
[SPEAKER_02]: I won't mention who it was, but one of the
you know, one of the cannabis's pioneers,
[SPEAKER_02]: a really great person, just a little bit
maybe missing, misinformed about that was
[SPEAKER_02]: said, you know, oh, if you have a plant
that starts to hermaphrodite on you,
[SPEAKER_02]: don't throw it away because you can make
feminized seeds with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was just like, no, because and that
was like a post.
[SPEAKER_02]: It went all over the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were like, oh, so, you know,
I can keep my hermaphrodite plants and use
[SPEAKER_02]: any pollen that they produce to just make
seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically, cannabis is a diecious
plant, which means that it has male and
[SPEAKER_02]: female parts on separate plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not on the same plant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like an example of a money plant would be
corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got the tassels that produce a
pollen that falls down onto the silk,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a pistol of a flower,
which then produces seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a monaceous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis is a diecious.
[SPEAKER_02]: But many diecious plants like cannabis
have the capability as an evolutionary,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, like last ditch effort to
produce the opposite sex organ.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it has noticed, it's like, you know,
if there are stresses or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: all different kind of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them have a propensity to do
that, which are hermaphroditic varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of them just can get stressed out
enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or of course, there's making sex reversal
of a plant, which essentially involves
[SPEAKER_02]: introducing an ethylene inhibitor that
actually keeps the plant's natural hormone
[SPEAKER_02]: from allowing it to produce female parts,
for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, it produces default,
which is male.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every plant has the DNA that it takes
to be a male or a female.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a switch that essentially is
assigned at conception that would make the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant turn one sex or the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if the switch is on and an
ethylene inhibitor is introduced,
[SPEAKER_02]: then it'll just go to default,
which would be male.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's where you get the creation.
[SPEAKER_02]: The proper creation of feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's people that want to do that
with like one specific strain that has a
[SPEAKER_02]: propensity to hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I would say that that's
something that should be frowned upon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of folks that are doing
it, you know, properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think the biggest thing is that we
should avoid, there is the possibility
[SPEAKER_02]: that if enough like, you know,
misguided breeding happens that cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: could start to evolve into more of a
monaceous, which would be real shitty
[SPEAKER_02]: because we'd never have a sense of me
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it is important that people
understand this and don't like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, go, you know, breeding with just
any hermy pollen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, and give I'll give the
guy a break who did that big post.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, he's got I don't even know a
million followers or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was just like, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a bunch of other folks hopped on there
and they were like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, we don't want people to think that
it's a great idea to just take a
[SPEAKER_02]: hermaphrodite plant and and breed with
that because the seeds will be mostly
[SPEAKER_02]: female or all female.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and as far as the hermaphrodites go,
I don't know how much you've worked with
[SPEAKER_01]: plants that show hermaphroditic
tendencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what what we see is kind of two
distinct paths that go down.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is when it shows it early on in the
beginning of flowering, coming off an
[SPEAKER_01]: apical calyx versus later on showing it
through the flower and expression of that
[SPEAKER_02]: that same, you know, like you're saying,
like the banana that comes out at the end,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I'm talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I totally agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a very interesting subject to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been talking with a lot of people
about it and just in the last couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I do believe that there are two types
of hermaphrodites in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: One is a little bit more genetically
inherent and the other one may just be
[SPEAKER_02]: related to environmental stressors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like what you refer to, where you've
got, you know, full on male and female
[SPEAKER_02]: parts coming out early on in the stage and
flowering stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's obviously, I would say,
you know, more of a genetic inherent
[SPEAKER_02]: hermaphrodite.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you have plants that will
produce a little banana, I call it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's essentially it's an anther that comes
out of the plant at the end of flowering.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more because, you know,
this female cannabis plant is like,
[SPEAKER_02]: ah, you know, sure, there's no good dick
around, you know, like, I'm going to make
[SPEAKER_02]: my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, you know, some of the
questions we kind of have as we go through
[SPEAKER_01]: these various these various stocks that we
that we work with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we have some varieties that it
doesn't matter the extreme temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity differences we have and the
differences in nutrients and even more
[SPEAKER_01]: extreme stresses like in light depth,
having some of the issues that we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have these these cultivars that they
don't really express this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in working, and I hate to say it,
but I've seen it go way up as I've started
[SPEAKER_01]: to work more with feminized stock.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not going to sit here and make any
statement that I could see that that's 100
[SPEAKER_01]: percent what's causing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But interestingly enough, I did a phenol
hunt last year in two separate spaces,
[SPEAKER_01]: one indoor, one in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw more stress initially in the
greenhouse, more variables and a higher
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of them show hermaphroditic
tendencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got rid of all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went back to our mom stock that we'd
taken cuttings off of and brought forward
[SPEAKER_01]: ones that didn't show anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we go forward, now we're not seeing any
apical calyxes throwing hermaphroditic
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers because we got rid of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're seeing some of the other
varieties now that express at the very end
[SPEAKER_01]: of flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're throwing this out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, to me, like the ones that
throw out the bananas at the end,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a little less concerning overall for
like the whole species.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, like obviously it's not
something that's desirable at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I don't think that trimmers
don't like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But here's an interesting thing that I
noticed this year is we did a ton of land
[SPEAKER_02]: race breeding and crossing, just growing
pure land races or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended up going to Jamaica last year,
Ethiopia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, of course, we had that Willy G
seed that Willy had brought back from
[SPEAKER_02]: Lebanon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a few more, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyway, these ones that had,
when people say land race, different kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of definitions of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm talking like land race-like.
[SPEAKER_02]: An inbred line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so inbred.
[SPEAKER_02]: And selected by nature, not even as much
by breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like wild populations or populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: See you, Beth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Populations that essentially just,
the selection is natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, it's an isolated population.
[SPEAKER_02]: The selection is less based on somebody
doing phenome hunting, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: and more just like what grows best in
Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, what works in a giant field in
Lebanon that we can get the most hash with
[SPEAKER_02]: the littlest least effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of like, I mean,
eventually, who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cannabis hopefully just is
treated like, you know, any other crop,
[SPEAKER_02]: tomato or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can grow as much of it as we want
someday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, maybe as a breeder,
I'll be like, yeah, what is something that
[SPEAKER_02]: we can throw in a giant field and forget
about it and come back, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: six months later?
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether there are seeds or not,
we don't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to make.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biomass and hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we're going to get all the
different uses from it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So land race can mean different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these, I would say, are the most
purist form.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both isolated and they're selected
by nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so bringing those back, that actually
we I noticed like those have a higher
[SPEAKER_02]: propensity to throw those little nanners
at the end of the season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, none of them were full on,
you know, displaying both sexes like
[SPEAKER_02]: you're talking about, where you have more
of like this monetius type.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they were definitely like commonly
showing bananas.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you look for in a seed company?
[SPEAKER_01]: Passion, love, love, love for the planet
is what I look for in in anyone that I
[SPEAKER_01]: work with in this community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we all got families to feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all want to have a decently comfortable
life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'm not going to play some
game of being 100 percent altruistic all
[SPEAKER_01]: the time, but that money doesn't in a way,
in my opinion, shouldn't come first all
[SPEAKER_01]: the damn time and how kind of short
sighted it is when people are constantly
[SPEAKER_01]: putting that that dollar first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just I like to see that the people
generally enjoy the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love hearing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wholeheartedly agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I always tell folks like,
well, you know, we get a ton of people
[SPEAKER_02]: that are like, oh, we'd love to work with
you or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't ever say like, oh,
they don't have enough Instagram followers
[SPEAKER_02]: for me to bother working with them or some
dumb bullshit like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to meet people and decide like how,
you know, smart and passionate is this
[SPEAKER_02]: person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the only thing I care about.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like if if you're smart and
passionate about cannabis and wanting to,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, work in this space and and
improve things and and share the medicine
[SPEAKER_02]: and and the fucking love for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you're have a half a brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, if you're an intelligent person,
you're clearly an intelligent person.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's work together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's I've seen people that,
you know, started with nothing and and one
[SPEAKER_02]: year later, they're like one of our
biggest collaborative partners because
[SPEAKER_02]: they just, you know, are they're smart and
they know what's a good know a good idea
[SPEAKER_02]: when they see one or have one or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: You.
You.
You.
