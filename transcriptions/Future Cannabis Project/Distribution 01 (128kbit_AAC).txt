[SPEAKER_02]: Hey, you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to go ahead and get started.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Heather Burke.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an attorney here in Nevada City.
[SPEAKER_02]: I represent primarily farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I sort of begged Jonathan Baldwin of
Forever Flowering if I could moderate this
[SPEAKER_02]: panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason being is that I feel like
the distribution component is absolutely
[SPEAKER_02]: just fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some really great things that
DSRO can do for farmers and do for the
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just excited to help build that
conversation today with this esteemed
[SPEAKER_02]: panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm very happy to have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to start and just ask if you
could each introduce yourself and just
[SPEAKER_02]: tell me maybe in two to five minutes who
you are, who your companies are,
[SPEAKER_02]: what is unique about you, and just kind of
an introduction to where you guys are at
[SPEAKER_02]: in the distribution services and how
you're interacting with those and with
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers and manufacturers in the supply
chain right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why don't we start with Danielle on the
end right here from Thrive Society in
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevada City.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom, boom.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name's Danielle, and I'm one of the
founders of Thrive Society.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're based here out in Nevada City.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we launched our operations mid-January
with distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a wild few months being out
there in the different landscape of the
[SPEAKER_03]: supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that to sum up our mission for
Thrive Society is we're here for the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry pioneer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're a sector in the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all come from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all have multiple decades under our
belts, everything from cultivation,
[SPEAKER_03]: nursery, manufacturing, and distribution,
and really love the plant, love the way
[SPEAKER_03]: that this plant is touching and bridging
industries all over the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing in all types of talent and
innovations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a really exciting time to be able
to step forward and be proud of what I do
[SPEAKER_03]: and be able to participate in the
transition globally one day here shortly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're a mission-driven company,
very much based on sustainability and
[SPEAKER_03]: really recycled packaging, working with
industry pioneers that I mentioned,
[SPEAKER_03]: and very sustainable growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of you guys fit in this space
who've been doing it for a long time and
[SPEAKER_03]: really taking care of the land while
you're doing that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really try to partner with farmers
who are eco-conscious, manufacturers who
[SPEAKER_03]: are also along the same mission and
vision, and work with industry pioneers
[SPEAKER_03]: across the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, we've been focusing on bulk
commodity procurement and distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's bulk trim, bee buds,
flour, and different oils, and
[SPEAKER_03]: distributing those to other members of the
supply chain for their products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been all over the state procuring
flour and doing a lot of testing,
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of R&D tests and micro-extraction
tests, really seeing which counties are
[SPEAKER_03]: coming back consistently clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been very eye-opening out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over the next couple of weeks,
over the next couple of quarters,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll be rolling out our first brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's exciting, really targeting the
medical space, wanting to stick to
[SPEAKER_03]: full-spectrum oils and really ailments for
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, syringes for patients and gel caps
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really excited to get into the package
and branded space and distribution and
[SPEAKER_03]: access and activate all of our retail
accounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also have a bulk extraction
manufacturing facility over in Santa Rosa.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are working with a lot of farmers
with integrated partnerships, as we call
[SPEAKER_03]: them, so you can grow for a purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can talk about that a little bit
later.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's a lot of ways that we want to
support all the farmers out there and all
[SPEAKER_03]: the people who have paved the way to where
we can step out into the light and
[SPEAKER_03]: continue to do what we love.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I'm Matthew.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with Madrone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're based out of Mendocino, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a distributor that's focused on
bringing AAA cannabis directly to
[SPEAKER_01]: retailers and helping themselves out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really helping and supporting our
farmers by getting the best price they
[SPEAKER_01]: can, while at the same time representing
the ecosystem of what is Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in 60 clubs, really more focused and
less than bulk, even though we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: doing more bulk, and now more focused on
creating products and working with
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers and creating co-branded
products and getting the name out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our end goal is highlighting the high
grade from our farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're based out of Fort Bragg.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our main office is in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we really focus on doing everything we
can to represent the farmer at the retail
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we find that a lot of this
game is, is actually walking in stores,
[SPEAKER_01]: developing relationships with retailers,
and then delivering consistently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's something we're focused on
because we know that if we can help
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers tie in the supply chain,
they're going to only worry about farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Patrick King, Soil King,
and I am sun-grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hands down, loving all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out of Cloverdale, California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in distribution, type six
manufacturing, nursery, obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery, transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My wife has a dispensary we just opened
called Red Door Remedies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do a lot of different varieties of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we're doing co-packing and
different things and working as a service.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our manufacturing type six, we do fields
extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do the ice water hash in house for
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do just a bunch of different service
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do pre-rolls, and we do a lot of
pre-roll brands, a lot of service,
[SPEAKER_00]: white labeling for other people as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: White labeling's tricky because you got to
use my employees license to license stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we found through the great attorneys
in my life, one of them sitting right over
[SPEAKER_00]: there for a number of years, Omar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've figured out workarounds in this
industry that is able to adapt because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're chameleons, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to check and dodge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I base all my principles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also a soil king at the Soil King
Garden Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in the picks and shovel this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sell the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sell my genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do free consulting through Organic King
Consulting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I help the farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I produce clean medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I help them through the harvesting,
curing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to pay the best living wage I
possibly can to support us as a team,
[SPEAKER_00]: bring it back through distribution,
through manufacturing, and head out to
[SPEAKER_00]: market across California.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds really easy, but that's a
whole complicated nightmare right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing, no doubt about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get on with the next question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, as an attorney that represents a ton
of farmers, I've asked some local
[SPEAKER_02]: distributors to tell us what services that
they could provide to the farmers,
[SPEAKER_02]: what services they're hoping to be able to
provide in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm wondering if you guys can go
through some of the services that came up
[SPEAKER_02]: in this list of the different services
that distributors could provide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like 40 different things that
distros can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have this stuff that's regulatorily
mandated, quality assurance, quarantine
[SPEAKER_02]: during testing arrangement, testing
arrangement, transportation required to be
[SPEAKER_02]: done by a distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can each of you guys tell us what are the
services that you're currently providing
[SPEAKER_02]: right now to farms and manufacturers?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what are the services that you guys
are hoping to expand into in the future,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether that's the stuff that's mandated
by regulation or just some of the other
[SPEAKER_02]: cool stuff that distributors can provide
to the service?
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys don't mind going back
through, each of you tell me what you do
[SPEAKER_02]: on that list.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I had service, I would read the
list, but I have no service.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you do in terms of what your
services are and what you hope to do in
[SPEAKER_02]: the future as you expand and grow and
build in this market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now, we just launched in January.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've been really focused on
procurement.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of our founders have a cultivation
background.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we also have sight on what's
happening out in the retail market space
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the procurement process,
it's not necessarily about just going to a
[SPEAKER_03]: farm and procuring wheat or buying
something anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a whole protocol associated with
that called quality control.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sorting, grading, processing,
IPM, integrated pest management,
[SPEAKER_03]: micro-extractions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a whole education process
associated with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've really focused on the
procurements.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a lot of sales that we do for
other distributors and brands in the rest
[SPEAKER_03]: of the state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And given our background and location and
our connections, of course, and
[SPEAKER_03]: relationships in the farming space,
that's where we've started right now and
[SPEAKER_03]: have had a lot of traction around that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I notice out there is the farmers are
really seeking that support.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's scary hearing that there's huge farms
happening in SoCal and big commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: grows, and everything's automated and big
ad coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So being a support for small pioneers,
as we call them, or small growers and
[SPEAKER_03]: industry pioneers, and really being able
to help them grow for a purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now, we're rolling out an
integrated partnership structure for
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers out there who want to grow for a
purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to streamline not only our
sales, but also our vendor sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I mean by this is we have a lot of
brands that we work with, and they need a
[SPEAKER_03]: consistent supply of a certain genetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or there's extractors out there that need
a consistent supply of a certain phenotype
[SPEAKER_03]: or cannabinoid ratio within their
extraction process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some farmers like to grow for tops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some farmers just want to grow bucked on
trim, straight for extraction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So being able to be a nexus in the supply
chain right now and really help not only
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers, but processing clients and
manufacturers and brands network and
[SPEAKER_03]: integrate their systems together to where
the farmers are growing for a purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of the people on the other
side of the supply chain have that
[SPEAKER_03]: consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the main complaint out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whenever we have 40 pound batches,
50 pound batches of the same strain,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's really challenging in the market for
a brand to take that on if they don't know
[SPEAKER_03]: that they have another batch coming
through regularly throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a big part of our focus right now is
streamlining these efforts and having
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers grow for a purpose and connect
them with where they fit in the supply
[SPEAKER_03]: chain and where they want to focus their
energy within cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what we're focused on right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then over the next year, we really
want to focus on our own in-house brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a few different ones that we
want to roll out.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of them is called Lifted Legacy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is very much focused on the
legacy culture, bringing back some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: old strains that we all used to grow back
in the 90s and on back and really doing
[SPEAKER_03]: what we do best and having that consistent
access for the retail market, for the
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer market, and launching brands to
support that legacy culture as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm looking forward to the branding
part and the creative part.
[SPEAKER_03]: But right now, I think it's really
important, given that the supply chain and
[SPEAKER_03]: the new white market is so new.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's extremely chaotic.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are just figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you guys all know, there's a big lag
time with the CDFA on cultivation
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really causing some issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's also making the market prices go
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that everybody could really
use support within the pioneer industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we stick together and really
streamline our efforts and our intentions
[SPEAKER_03]: for the year, we can really sustain this
way of life that we love so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for us, it really started with three
years ago, we saw testing being necessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we started pushing for phase two
testing and phase three testing with our
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Way before, so we could catch any
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it became compliance and then helping
them with licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's evolved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone knows that the issue is
happening right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, because these are partners that
we've worked with for five years,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's now getting them ready for track and
trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are all things that just
fundamentally need to be done for them to
[SPEAKER_01]: flow and for them to be able to have the
velocity we want them to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll focus as Madrone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my focus is when I started with
Madrone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before I started with Madrone,
I was working for a corporate cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: company who just didn't understand the
value of farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason I joined Madrone and helped
build what we're building is because at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the day, I feel like grading is
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like when you work with a farmer,
and you can pick up the whole product and
[SPEAKER_01]: get them to maximize the amount for every
piece of it, that's when you've helped the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer continue what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's been our focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our focus is grading and then velocity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw that with the part that everyone
knew, just the AAA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're working with more and more
partners to grade and then piece out to
[SPEAKER_01]: where it needs to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as you say, this is an ecosystem
and people specialize in certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's not enough people focused on
getting the farmers to maximize the amount
[SPEAKER_01]: for the crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's something that we've
been building and focusing on since the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we partnered with distribution up in
Mendocino, really, I mean, and we took it
[SPEAKER_01]: over and who just really, they just were
doing nothing with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw it as a need and a way to grow
and to build.
Thank you.
