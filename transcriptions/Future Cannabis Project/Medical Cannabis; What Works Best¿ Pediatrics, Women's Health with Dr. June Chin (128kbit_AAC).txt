[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, this is Jason Wilson with
the curious about cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for tuning in once again
Today, I'm really really stoked to have
[SPEAKER_00]: the guests that I have on today I have dr.
Janella Chen someone that we just recently
[SPEAKER_00]: became friends We have a lot in common and
I'm really excited about our conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Chen for being willing to come on the
podcast Thanks for having me Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm looking forward to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so for Those that aren't already
familiar with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you mind starting us off by just
explaining a little bit about your
[SPEAKER_00]: Background and how that led into working
with cannabis in medicine and then we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of spin off from there All
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well about a thousand years ago I was a I
was a patient actually before I even
[SPEAKER_01]: became a physician a medical doctor I was
diagnosed with ankylosis Spondylitis when
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a teenager and It's a fancy big
fancy name.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also called as for short and
basically what it is is an autoimmune
[SPEAKER_01]: Disease of the spine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an inflammatory disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no cure There's really you know,
no no treatment that is long-term It's
[SPEAKER_01]: really just maintenance and palliative
care and what ends up happening is your
[SPEAKER_01]: vertebrae So the bones in your spine start
to fuse together.
[SPEAKER_01]: They literally crazy glued together And
you lose mobility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so you might you might see people on
the street where they look like they have
[SPEAKER_01]: a big Rod in their back and they're sort
of turning You know with their whole body.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have much range of motion,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And usually those are patients with AS And
I went through conventional treatment as a
[SPEAKER_01]: teenager and as a kid I had a lot of pain,
but I did you know normal prescription
[SPEAKER_01]: medications I went to physical therapy for
many many years did acupuncture Epidurals
[SPEAKER_01]: I did a lot of injections and trigger
point injections, but nothing gave me
[SPEAKER_01]: long-lasting relief So I wore a back brace
while I was in medical school and this was
[SPEAKER_01]: in San Francisco I went to school shortly
after they legalized cannabis in San
[SPEAKER_01]: Francisco in California and I would wear
this back brace all the time while I was
[SPEAKER_01]: doing rounds and One of my attendings
pulled me aside and said, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you wearing this brace?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're having a Hard time standing,
you know assisting in the OR, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: delivering babies I see that you're sort
of standing on the side trying to sit down
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're in a lot of pain I told them I
had AS and that I was really disheartened
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really sad because here I was
training to be a doctor, you know I had at
[SPEAKER_01]: my disposal, you know hundreds of
specialists I was in this great University
[SPEAKER_01]: and no one could really offer me any
relief, you know was sort of the same
[SPEAKER_01]: revolving door, you know Here's another
prescription Have you tried an epidural?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tried steroids?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, you know, and there's a lot of meds
that I couldn't take You know when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: working in the hospital or you're studying
you can't be sedated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't be altered in any way so
Surprisingly, he pulled me aside and this
[SPEAKER_01]: was an HIV and AIDS doctor and he handed
me this bottle Okay, and he said,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, don't tell anyone I'm giving you
this don't freak out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is marijuana This is marijuana
that's in a tincture bottle And it helps
[SPEAKER_01]: my HIV and AIDS patients with pain He
didn't call it CBD oil or anything fancy
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: He just said it's marijuana, you know
steeped in alcohol Take it before you go
[SPEAKER_01]: to bed at night, but it really helps my
HIV and AIDS patients and I Completely
[SPEAKER_01]: freaked out, you know, I grew up in the
Bronx and I grew up in a very traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: Chinese household So there was a stigma
surrounding cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a pre-med I had my eye on the prize.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't really experiment With cannabis a
lot but I knew and he said it too.
[SPEAKER_01]: He said, you know You're you're gonna work
80 to 100 hours a week and you have a long
[SPEAKER_01]: way to go And you really are not gonna
make it, you know with just this back
[SPEAKER_01]: brace so I sat with it on my dresser for
weeks on end and I stare at it and I I
[SPEAKER_01]: finally took it I took it over the weekend
when I wasn't on call and To my surprise
[SPEAKER_01]: it did make me feel a little funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: It reminded me of when I first had a glass
of wine You know a little I got a little
[SPEAKER_01]: flushed but nothing crazy But you know by
the time the weekend was over by Monday
[SPEAKER_01]: morning I knew something was working
because I was able to stand and do the
[SPEAKER_01]: dishes without the back brace I was able
to do some some light household chores
[SPEAKER_01]: without you know pain And I went up to him
that next week and I said what is in this?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said what is this and and how come more
patients don't know about it and he
[SPEAKER_01]: started explaining You know cannabis to me
and and you know what it is what it isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he basically took me aside and
he says, you know, there's this general
[SPEAKER_01]: club that meets there's other MDs You
know, if you want to start learning about
[SPEAKER_01]: this plant, you know, let's by all means
let's let's start looking at these
[SPEAKER_01]: different cases and I made it a point for
my career to learn everything I could
[SPEAKER_01]: about this plant medicine, you know,
and this was you know in the 2000s so,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know a lot has changed since then but
Patients found me I didn't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: advertise I entered into my holistic
family practice and word spread fast
[SPEAKER_01]: because patients could appreciate the fact
that they could Tell me about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: usage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about their other medication usage
without feeling like The doctor was going
[SPEAKER_01]: to dismiss them from their practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, and that's you know,
one of the huge challenges that it seems
[SPEAKER_00]: like you know We face right now with
cannabis is getting people to one To get
[SPEAKER_00]: the doctors and nurses educated to know
how to respond when someone comes to them
[SPEAKER_00]: saying, you know I want to try cannabis or
I am using it, you know, but then also on
[SPEAKER_00]: the patient side to have that sense of
safety With with the physician to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to just honestly share what they're
experiencing what they're experimenting
[SPEAKER_00]: with and everything Because I think and
tell me if you agree, but there's a weird
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamic that's happened in our health care
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems primarily based on my own
experience that The patient and the doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: don't always feel like they're on the
journey together And so the patient even
[SPEAKER_00]: though they may have you know,
their primary care physician or their
[SPEAKER_00]: specialist that they see regularly They
don't always feel like I don't know They
[SPEAKER_00]: feel very alone in their pursuit of
wellness and trying to to get better and
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's almost like this like the cannabis
piece is sort of raising a bigger issue in
[SPEAKER_00]: health care broadly that stems from How
stressed a lot of doctors are how limited
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of time they have to spend with
patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know all these these other pieces as
well that I think we need to like really
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously look at if we want to improve
our health care system and have people
[SPEAKER_00]: feel that sense of trust again with their
physicians And I know that I went through
[SPEAKER_00]: a very similar experience So I have like
multiple spinal cord injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've been through I've worn the
back braces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've Been on steroids, you know,
I've you know, I've been on all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things I totally understand and one thing
that before you and I had ever talked I
[SPEAKER_00]: felt this like connection with you because
I saw on a I think it was a different
[SPEAKER_00]: interview or something you talking about
your personal background and I was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh my gosh I've been through at least a
piece of that and the same way I
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered cannabis as a patient Before I
ever got involved in like testing labs and
[SPEAKER_00]: research and all that sort of stuff and it
was through a very similar Sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like literally Stuck to the couch
couldn't move had these like back spasms
[SPEAKER_00]: and extreme pain felt like someone was
like driving a knife in my spine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know just crazy so I can I can very
much relate to You know at least to some
[SPEAKER_00]: extent of what you went through because
it's traumatic going through that process
[SPEAKER_00]: of like How do I find relief with a
chronic condition like this, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Without being just knocked out all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really hard Absolutely and it takes a
huge toll on your nervous system You know
[SPEAKER_01]: your you feel like this can't be my
legacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot live like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah And and we're young.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, we're young and we're you
know When you think of someone with
[SPEAKER_01]: chronic pain you think of grandma,
you know, that's in their 80s or 90s But
[SPEAKER_01]: chronic pain, you know hits even
teenagers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see with overuse injuries through sports
through a lot of genetic disorders as
[SPEAKER_01]: well, so Being a chronic pain survivor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really know what it's like when you tell
the doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've tried everything and it doesn't work
You know, you almost don't want to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: the physician because you know the the
things that they're gonna offer you,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's either surgery Prescription
medications or PT.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, I've heard the story multiple
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you want to do another MRI?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay What's gonna change, you know,
my pain is my pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but I mean really I think this whole
medical cannabis movement is a wake-up
[SPEAKER_01]: call to our health care system You know
patients are turning away from mainstream
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, you know, they're heading to
forums to listening to podcasts like yours
[SPEAKER_01]: on places like Wendy's shop Artemis CBD
shop because they're giving them what they
[SPEAKER_01]: need, you know, they're you know you as an
advocate They're listening to these
[SPEAKER_01]: podcasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're connecting better and they're
looking for Americans More natural
[SPEAKER_01]: approach to health and healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly and So coming back around so
you were you're in medical school you
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered cannabis and were able to Start
to function better Where did your path
[SPEAKER_00]: lead after that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of how did the rest of your?
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical schooling go and then where what
did you specialize in?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I specialized in integrative care.
[SPEAKER_01]: So What I knew was I understood that you
know Cannabis was part of a holistic
[SPEAKER_01]: movement and that it wasn't going to be
the end-all be-all, you know, even for
[SPEAKER_01]: myself, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I knew that when I integrated cannabis I
then I could get up off the couch Then I
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe I could give a breather and take my
back brace off for a couple of hours But I
[SPEAKER_01]: needed to utilize those hours and
exercise, you know do some Foam roller
[SPEAKER_01]: exercises, maybe take a trip to the
acupuncturist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm an osteopathic physician So I also use
my hands to help heal patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do manipulation, you know I work on the
fascia and the tendons and the ligaments
[SPEAKER_01]: so Hands-on approach for patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so cannabis Breaks that storm,
you know, it sort of parts the clouds a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit and then it allows you to do
other things You know for me, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: losing weight was a big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had to lose a lot of weight I gained a
lot of weight in medical school,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the freshman 15 became the
freshman 50 You know because when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: in pain you eat for comfort And and you
know that ice cream that hot chocolate
[SPEAKER_01]: just feels so good Right when you're
sitting on the couch, but you know an
[SPEAKER_01]: anti-inflammatory diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: I talked to my patients about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Have a background in nutrition.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a really really big thing So I
incorporate all these different modalities
[SPEAKER_01]: with my patients and I'm realistic,
you know might not all happen at once But
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe it's a start With cannabis medicine
and it's a 10-minute walk, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: getting those lymphatics moving or maybe
it is a massage You know something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that So I try to work around the patients
and that's how we created our integrative
[SPEAKER_00]: health centers in in California And can
you briefly describe to anyone listening?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's maybe not familiar with like
osteopathic medicine versus allopathic
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and all these sort of things Can
you describe sort of what that means to be
[SPEAKER_00]: an osteopathic doctor?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know versus other other types of
physicians that sort of thing Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's two types of physicians in the
US There's MDs and there's DOs and these
[SPEAKER_01]: are medical doctors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stands for medical doctor DO stands for
doctor of osteopathy Now we have the exact
[SPEAKER_01]: same licensure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we work in the same hospitals the same
privileges I can write all prescriptions
[SPEAKER_01]: admit you to the hospital MRIs insurance
companies cover us, etc, etc the main
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between Doctors of osteopathy
is that we take an extra year Sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: two years of anatomy and physiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a much more deeper
understanding of musculoskeletal system
[SPEAKER_01]: and some of us very few of us but some of
us go into what's called osteopathic
[SPEAKER_01]: manipulative medicine and that's what I
specialize in and We use our hands to help
[SPEAKER_01]: heal patients now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's becoming much more rare and rare as
Pharmaceuticals became the main,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know mainstream So most of most DOs
are just like regular physicians and don't
[SPEAKER_01]: do any hands-on medicine But there's about
3% of DOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a few of us left that Still
still practice osteopathic medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it's tradition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and What specifically kind of drew
you into that route versus the MD route?
[SPEAKER_01]: My pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, my pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I originally started as a physical
therapy major I knew you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I did PT as a teenager and I saw okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this is helpful Yeah, you know,
maybe I can become a physical therapist or
[SPEAKER_01]: a chiropractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was very interested in anatomy and
physiology So I was a PT at Cornell
[SPEAKER_01]: actually and I was gonna get my master's
in PT As an after I graduated as undergrad
[SPEAKER_01]: and I met a DO actually while I was there
And he adjusted me.
[SPEAKER_01]: He gave me my first adjustment,
you know, I was again in pain in college
[SPEAKER_01]: already So I was looking for alternative
relief and I and I said what are you
[SPEAKER_01]: doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not a chiropractor and he says no
I'm a DO and I said, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's a DO and He explained to me about
osteopathy and he says, you know You're a
[SPEAKER_01]: physician so you can have all the
privileges as a physician except you learn
[SPEAKER_01]: how to Manipulate and you learn more about
anatomy and physiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I said sign me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I changed my major I became pre-med and
And the rest is history Wow, that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: cool and how would you describe your?
[SPEAKER_00]: Experience working with a patient that was
trying to work with cannabis for the first
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that like?
[SPEAKER_01]: So for me it was important having my own
experience because I could relate to to
[SPEAKER_01]: patients that were naive You know,
I was very very cannabis naive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god my my Mother said I would get
schizophrenia right if I ever tried
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so so I came from this really big
fear factor But for me it was number one
[SPEAKER_01]: was education, you know, what what does
cannabis mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's break it down to plant medicine
plant sciences, you know, what does it
[SPEAKER_01]: mean to even try alternative medicine?
[SPEAKER_01]: Dr. Andrew Weill is one of my mentors so I
really you know looked at at that realm as
[SPEAKER_01]: education first Acupuncture is a really
big part of my practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a researcher at Columbia University
Women's Health Center and we research
[SPEAKER_01]: acupuncture and you'd have been fibroids
So for me when you think outside the box
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're seeing an MD the biggest thing
is expectations for the patient and
[SPEAKER_01]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, and what were?
[SPEAKER_00]: People coming to you to treat what we're
seeing Some of the the common things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you were seeing that people were turning
the cannabis for I imagine pain is one of
[SPEAKER_01]: them Pain is one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also I saw a lot of children actually
I treated mostly children in California
[SPEAKER_01]: for the first I would say five to seven
years Children and these were you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: these are patients that have tried
everything Yeah, you know like you and me
[SPEAKER_01]: they've gone through the whole You know
ten different MDs ten specialists and flew
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the country to different,
you know centers, you know from Maryland
[SPEAKER_01]: To Texas to and and they've seen all the
specialists and I was their last hope You
[SPEAKER_01]: know and they heard that cannabis could
work These were children with epilepsy
[SPEAKER_01]: children with cancer mitochondrial
disorders genetic disorders They came in
[SPEAKER_01]: wheelchairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were non ambulatory, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't walking.
[SPEAKER_01]: They weren't talking.
[SPEAKER_01]: These were special needs kids And then it
expanded to adults that were in chronic
[SPEAKER_01]: pain, you know adults with MS adults
living with fibromyalgia autoimmune
[SPEAKER_01]: diseases ALS Parkinson's where there
really is no There really is no answer for
[SPEAKER_01]: chronic diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: No chronic pain diseases Yeah,
and of some of the let's focus on the
[SPEAKER_00]: children for just a second because I think
that's really important to talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: What were some of the successes and
failures that you experienced working with
[SPEAKER_00]: kids in some of these conditions?
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest thing with children is and it
was important part of our practice is to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that there was a team approach
and still is so I I Really want to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that the child's neurologist the
pediatrician The psychiatrist is on board
[SPEAKER_01]: when they're working with an integrated
physician such as myself So the having
[SPEAKER_01]: that conversation about cannabis Having
that conversation with both parents
[SPEAKER_01]: caregivers guardians in the room and the
specialists so that they know that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: all a team here and we're not You know
trying to say get off all your medication,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, that's not the point when they
come see someone like me It's really an
[SPEAKER_01]: integrative.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best of both worlds So that is
the number one thing and then working
[SPEAKER_01]: closely with parents because sometimes the
spouses are at odds, you know mom might
[SPEAKER_01]: say I'm full-on supporting CBD and
cannabis and Dad or their partner will say
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not what I want for my child.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so again communication education,
you know expectations is key and When you
[SPEAKER_00]: ran into those sort of conflicts where you
might have parents that disagree with one
[SPEAKER_00]: another or or maybe even Other physicians
involved in the child's care What were
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the key sort of like pieces of
education that would help sort of calm
[SPEAKER_00]: those those fears a bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: The for my colleagues so far Other MDs the
biggest thing is sending them,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know research articles, you know
talking to them about patient cases and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes I will go and do grand rounds,
you know do a noon conference a journal a
[SPEAKER_01]: journal club and Talk to colleagues on
their level, you know, what is what's
[SPEAKER_01]: happening on the receptor level?
[SPEAKER_01]: Things like that and and you know,
sometimes they go from you know Sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: folding their arms and and their eyebrows
are just followed and they're really angry
[SPEAKER_01]: to like they relax their faces A little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not voodoo medicine, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually some science behind it
And and also to reassure them that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: working with the parents so they're not
off Getting something off, you know from
[SPEAKER_01]: who knows where you know, there is some
monitoring there's charting So I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: charting everything and and documenting
everything my the parents that I work with
[SPEAKER_01]: are keeping journals So we're no we know
how it affects IEP or how it affects,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what is the child's teacher
saying or the speech therapist or OT or
[SPEAKER_01]: PT?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we document everything and we monitor
them very closely.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of follow-ups in the
beginning Because I want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: the parents are feeling supported that
they're doing it right You know titration
[SPEAKER_01]: of dosing making sure there's feedback
from all the ancillary health
[SPEAKER_00]: practitioners as well Yeah, and what were
the main modes of administration?
[SPEAKER_00]: That most of these kids would use were
they using like tinctures or raw oil
[SPEAKER_01]: capsules in the beginning it was just
tinctures, you know the beginning the
[SPEAKER_01]: parents were and You know, we're talking
more than ten years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're making their own They're growing
their own a few plants of their own So in
[SPEAKER_01]: California parents were allowed to grow
their own cannabis that was part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical cannabis Legalization and they
would steep their own sometimes smoothies
[SPEAKER_01]: They make teas out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they would put it in ice cubes
and you know, just put it in their juice
[SPEAKER_01]: and the kids juice so parents got creative
and Parents are very resourceful.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a dad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a mom So we would do anything for our
children and the the forums and the
[SPEAKER_01]: support the community was just astounding
Parents found that each other and shared
[SPEAKER_01]: stories and talked about anecdotally what
worked and what didn't work Shared,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know sort of this like trusted
integrative practitioner list things like
[SPEAKER_01]: that And we all put our heads together and
figured out and tried to learn from each
[SPEAKER_01]: other parent You know parents patients
teach me just as much as I teach them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and Going into what you just said of
like trying to discover what works what
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't work and obviously that's a Loaded
question because it depends on the
[SPEAKER_00]: condition and the person and the dose and
you know all these different things but
[SPEAKER_00]: What were some of those lessons that you
learned?
[SPEAKER_00]: Working with all these patients about what
typically worked better than others What
[SPEAKER_00]: forms tended to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Better than others, you know that sort of
thing So for the biggest thing for
[SPEAKER_01]: children, it's getting them to take it
Yeah, right the taste, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and and when I when I'm treating special
needs kids They're very sensitive to taste
[SPEAKER_01]: You know if a lot of these children are on
the same diet because if you veer from
[SPEAKER_01]: texture or taste they just won't eat It so
that was the biggest tricky thing That's
[SPEAKER_01]: why moms will make you know The ice cubes
or they juiced it or they steeped it in
[SPEAKER_01]: tea or they you know Really creative and
put it in honey or something like that ice
[SPEAKER_01]: cream even, you know, whatever they could
So ingestion just getting them in to the
[SPEAKER_01]: child was big thing And then also timing
so some children did better taking it
[SPEAKER_01]: before school Some children did better
after school, you know before therapy Even
[SPEAKER_01]: so we really looked at timing of the
medicine for seizure children,
[SPEAKER_01]: of course Rubbing it sublingually,
you know in their gums.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was very helpful or a lot of the
moms made a suppositories and this was you
[SPEAKER_01]: know in the very beginning making
suppositories and seeing if it would work
[SPEAKER_01]: and that was well documented as well,
so Parents got creative because when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're when you see your child seizing and
this is the only thing that works And
[SPEAKER_01]: they've tried the conventional anti
epileptic medicines They they tell ten
[SPEAKER_01]: more families and then ten more families
come in right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and the cannabis that they were
using were these THC varieties CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties Mixture, you know along the
spectrum, you know, what were they working
[SPEAKER_00]: with?
[SPEAKER_01]: There were mixtures there were mixtures
along the spectrum, you know the very
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning we weren't calling it CBD or THC
There's just so many different chemicals
[SPEAKER_01]: Variants, you know, I helped connect them
with different growers different
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivators and we knew, you know This
cultivator was able to grow something that
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't make the kid very sleepy,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously it was lower in THC,
but that's how we documented in the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning and as technology changed as you
know More and more things information was
[SPEAKER_01]: made widely available I mean I use both to
CBD and THC for children It really just
[SPEAKER_01]: depends on what the goals are what the
disease with the symptom of not symptom of
[SPEAKER_01]: pathology is and also Working with how
functional the child is as well Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you mentioned titration I think that's
something when I was when I was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: with Wendy that was something we got into
because from her experience running a
[SPEAKER_00]: store she noticed that a lot of people are
not exposed to that process of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: find kind of the minimum effective dose
and to know, you know what you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with so can you describe a little bit
about you know, for instance right now
[SPEAKER_00]: with CBD being so popular if people are
running out trying to You know find a
[SPEAKER_00]: product and trying to find a dose what is
that?
[SPEAKER_00]: titration look look like and how low do
you start and kind of How much time do you
[SPEAKER_00]: wait to pass before you up the dose that
sort of thing I just described a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit with that process looks like So very
different between children and adults
[SPEAKER_01]: actually with the pediatric community The
parents were very familiar with titration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know as you know, even with your
baby Tylenol everything comes in a liquid
[SPEAKER_01]: and Even with anti-seizure medications
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything comes in a liquid and they knew
how to titrate Yeah, they knew they know
[SPEAKER_01]: they know how to titrate they know how to
and as a parent If you look at your child
[SPEAKER_01]: and they have this glaze over their eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already know they're sick,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't take much The you know parents
are very intuitive for adults It's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit trickier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I think we have higher
pain tolerance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We sort of kind of just power through
things So it all we want instant
[SPEAKER_01]: gratification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we want that CBD to work now,
you know yesterday How come it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: working, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No exactly It's easy for adults to to like
I don't know really confound variables and
[SPEAKER_00]: things to know when they're they're
sharing what they're what they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: and what were the Given that children and
adults are so different just in like
[SPEAKER_00]: surface area metabolism and that sort of
thing I know that in the early days you
[SPEAKER_00]: probably didn't have access to really
sophisticated dosaging data because there
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't even I mean I'm trying to think of
when testing labs really started to come
[SPEAKER_00]: along I mean steep hill was one of the
early ones in California But that still
[SPEAKER_00]: was not that long ago But based on your
experience now, what are some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: dosage differences between children and
adults?
[SPEAKER_01]: So with children It's I'm just thinking of
kids that my autism patients for example
[SPEAKER_01]: or kids that are self have self-interest
behaviors that accumulation of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids can really take a toll on
them so Parents might notice that things
[SPEAKER_01]: are working really well for the first,
you know, two to three weeks there's this
[SPEAKER_01]: what I call the honeymoon stage and the
child is Really, you know, you know even
[SPEAKER_01]: keeled grounded really feels comfortable
in their own skin and then all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: it starts to turn at the 30-day mark maybe
and you they notice that the child is just
[SPEAKER_01]: more hyper, you know the the motor tics
sort of amp up or they They just feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: they're a little bit more more like hand
biting even or the repetitive echolalia
[SPEAKER_01]: where they're saying things over and over
again that might uptick as well and I find
[SPEAKER_01]: that to be the case as the cannabinoids
build up in their system so less is more
[SPEAKER_01]: and And I actually find it a little bit
harder now than it than I was than it was
[SPEAKER_01]: when I was practicing in California
because Information is so readily
[SPEAKER_01]: available and there's just you know,
there's 8,000 products available So
[SPEAKER_01]: parents are trying all these different
products adding this adding that how come
[SPEAKER_01]: that didn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I read on Facebook that This brand works.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried this brand and I added,
you know 0.5 milliliters another five
[SPEAKER_01]: drops another ten drops and so it does get
muddy but really staying the course and
[SPEAKER_01]: and I mean I sometimes I have to hand hold
a lot of a lot of these parents and just
[SPEAKER_01]: say No, you want to stay with 0.2
milliliters of this brand for 30 days,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, just hang in there I know I know
you're not getting the results that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting but we're doing it slowly,
you know then talk about sleep hygiene You
[SPEAKER_01]: know talking to the physical therapist or
the speech therapist, you know sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: tweaking things that way With adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the same thing, you know being
patient knowing that to decrease
[SPEAKER_01]: inflammation in the body takes time and
And I actually really encourage the
[SPEAKER_01]: adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say we're talking about you know
chronic pain for instance or even insomnia
[SPEAKER_01]: to to add in exercise Meditation,
you know sleep hygiene Getting off the
[SPEAKER_01]: computer and electronics, you know,
two or three hours before bed So it really
[SPEAKER_01]: takes I would say a lot of other
Approaches not just the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah exactly and when Patients are going
through that process and trying to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: figure find the I guess sort of like the
plateau of therapeutic response How long
[SPEAKER_00]: do you prefer them to wait before you
know, you would make a judgment about what
[SPEAKER_00]: that Cannabinoid therapy is actually doing
a month a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm I know everyone frowns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's I don't want to wait a
month Yeah, I mean, but that's you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's really common with you know a lot
of other drugs, you know when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with a physician and trying to
find you know dosaging a lot of times you
[SPEAKER_00]: might only see a doctor once a month or so
and that's usually you know, kind of how
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes so it's it's not that surprising
but I could I can understand that that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not necessarily the message a lot of
people want to hear Because they do want
[SPEAKER_00]: to see those results and you know another
thing you you just touched on is sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: this like biphasic response that
cannabinoids have that At certain dosages
[SPEAKER_00]: they do one thing but then as they build
or as you increase dose or whatever you
[SPEAKER_00]: all of a sudden get to this other side of
this, you know curve this dose response
[SPEAKER_00]: curve and You may be having less effect or
a negative effect Yeah Yeah, and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: that's critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad you highlighted that because
that's something that I think needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about more in the context of using
cannabis as medicine and I think that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: largely a reflection of sort of this it's
not just the United States but this kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of mentality that we have of like,
you know more is better and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if if a little bit was helping then take
more and take more and You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a sense of tolerance but that
biphasic response is something I think
[SPEAKER_00]: That we don't necessarily have a large
appreciation for and some people when they
[SPEAKER_00]: might be on that other side of the curve
They might think they've just built
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then they add more and more
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly And I mean and we when we
look at medicine, you know, we do that at
[SPEAKER_01]: the doctor's office when you're being
prescribed blood pressure medication or
[SPEAKER_01]: Diabetes medication you come back and you
retest, you know, maybe your sugars aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: quite controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll adjust It or your blood pressure
even antidepressants anti-anxiety
[SPEAKER_01]: medications, you know Doctors will tell
you it takes six to eight weeks to you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, see if there's a there's going to be
a therapeutic response And if it doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: work, they're gonna have to switch to
another medication So so it's same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: with pharmaceutical medications and and I
know you had have Kevin Spelman before and
[SPEAKER_01]: I adore him But we're looking at this
plant that's affecting so many receptors
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's why everyone Is so different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, right exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and as much as we understand now,
it's still only you know, this fraction of
[SPEAKER_00]: a piece of a puzzle That we're trying to
piece together, you know one thing I
[SPEAKER_00]: really enjoy talking to Kevin about in
that in that interview is you know about
[SPEAKER_00]: the endocannabinoid system and just how
Complicated it is and that you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we kind of have maybe some general
understanding of some of the things that's
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and the other receptor systems it's
connected to And all the sort of thing but
[SPEAKER_00]: we're still a long way and this came out
in my interview with Ethan Rousseau as
[SPEAKER_00]: well that we don't have good ways of
measuring this system, you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: definition of the system is like rapidly
expanding as we learn more and so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really tricky and sometimes I think
there's a perception Especially within the
[SPEAKER_00]: canvas industry in general that you know
We know so much and so we should be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to use that information to really target
Treatments and you know make super
[SPEAKER_00]: informed decisions And we can definitely
make better informed decisions than we
[SPEAKER_00]: ever could But it's just yes, it's not
quite there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of it is still trial and error
moving slowly trying to control as many
[SPEAKER_00]: variables as you can and and proceed with
caution and Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I I see a lot of women in my practice
now and we we have to realize and this
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't get discussed as often as I would
like is that estrogen makes women a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more sensitive to Cannabis, you know and
mostly THC so our hormones interact with
[SPEAKER_01]: THC quite a quite bit and our cycle can
influence how how we feel and this was
[SPEAKER_01]: documented through researchers at
Washington State University They found
[SPEAKER_01]: that women experience most effects of THC
when their estrogen is peaked,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right when it peaked and beginning to fall
So this happens at like about the day or
[SPEAKER_01]: two before you ovulate so day 12 to day 14
or so and this this interaction makes Us
[SPEAKER_01]: more sensitive to the compound in general,
but it also actually gives us more pain
[SPEAKER_01]: relieving effects, right compared to to
males But also we actually can develop
[SPEAKER_01]: more tolerance to the THC compared to men
So for women I actually when they come
[SPEAKER_01]: into my office, I will look at their cycle
or non cycle, you know So I'll look at
[SPEAKER_01]: their estrogen progesterone levels LSH
levels FSH levels and I will actually
[SPEAKER_01]: create a game plan and I will dose them
based on their cycle So they take a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more or a little less depending on
where they're at And it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know where we're not
represented in studies You know as a you
[SPEAKER_01]: know as an ethnicity different minorities
or even as a female which is unfortunate
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do take that into account when I see
female patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really great to hear that was
exactly what where I was gonna go next is
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this like very little discussed
issue in biomedical research in general
[SPEAKER_00]: That a lot of the way that we've come to
think about pharmacology and physiology is
[SPEAKER_00]: based on research in men and It doesn't
translate You know, I mean some does but
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, obviously there there are big
differences and these hormonal differences
[SPEAKER_00]: drive all sorts of nuanced differences in
pharmacokinetics and things that Really
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be talked about more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's so many issues with
biomedical research Right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the under representation between ethnic
groups and and sexes and that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing But then also we have a
reproducibility problem too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a lot of biomedical research
that's been done that we're having trouble
[SPEAKER_00]: reproducing and It's it's a great time to
have a lot of humility.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when it comes to to medicine
Absolutely, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so glad you said that I mean when you
when we get sick you You're gonna take the
[SPEAKER_01]: same Z pack as I am right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right Yeah, you know, so why aren't
we dose differently based on our weight
[SPEAKER_01]: our ethnicity based on our metabolism,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly and Are there I mean you
just you just hit several of the big Ways
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis can affect women differently
than men or really just depending on a
[SPEAKER_00]: person's hormonal levels regardless of how
they identify Are there any other big
[SPEAKER_00]: differences that you've noticed?
[SPEAKER_00]: In how people react to cannabis
differently that you think people should
[SPEAKER_01]: be aware about Actually ethnicity is a big
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed in my clinical data that
different ethnic groups You know depending
[SPEAKER_01]: on genetic makeup and where their
ancestors are from will react differently
[SPEAKER_01]: to Cannabinoid medicine so the Hispanic
population Asian population seem much more
[SPEAKER_01]: sensitive to cannabinoids and so I mean,
it's interesting because I'm looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: the data that I have and I I would
definitely want to utilize this set and
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out you know where Or maybe maybe
we can brainstorm offline.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but but really think about how this
plant is working from you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: demographic point of view yeah,
I that's something that I have I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know if I've heard anyone really bring
much attention to that at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's super super fascinating and
something that Yeah, we really need to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at and once again This is one of
those things where cannabis sort of leads
[SPEAKER_00]: into these discussions about medicine
broadly But you know, this is research
[SPEAKER_00]: that needs to happen across the board
analyses of you know large data sets that
[SPEAKER_00]: clinicians have and try to understand how
different people are reacting to things
[SPEAKER_00]: differently and how we can drive medicine
towards a much more individualized
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted approach rather than How we've
been operating since you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the 50s where we basically
take averages of medical research and we
[SPEAKER_00]: apply therapies according to Sort of an
average sample population that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even exist in the world You know,
you're always dealing with people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing unique things to the to the table
So that's yeah, that's excellent to hear
[SPEAKER_00]: When someone comes to you and they want to
engage cannabis what are some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you Green for that could be
problematic like other like certain
[SPEAKER_00]: medical conditions They may have that
wouldn't react favorably to cannabis or
[SPEAKER_00]: other medications, you know
contraindications.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're worried about that sort of thing
Yeah, so medications is a big thing
[SPEAKER_01]: because most of the patients that come to
me are on a lot of meds right because
[SPEAKER_01]: you've already tried all these different
things and All your specialists have tried
[SPEAKER_01]: to throw the kitchen sink at you,
you know, so they they might be on
[SPEAKER_01]: antidepressants for chronic pain,
you know such as a cymbalta for example is
[SPEAKER_01]: something I see a lot and You know
patients are trying to get off of a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: these medications so I don't recommend
just going cold turkey and getting off of
[SPEAKER_01]: these medications because your your body's
biochemistry has changed your brain
[SPEAKER_01]: biochemistry has changed so if you've been
on benzos antidepressants, if you've been
[SPEAKER_01]: on these pain medications, you know for
Your condition for a very long time,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know just haphazardly adding
Cannabinoid medicine or even other
[SPEAKER_01]: nutraceuticals right other other
supplements can be a really dangerous
[SPEAKER_01]: thing so I make sure that I look at the
medication list cross reference it and
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes patients have to really wait and
I start to wean patients off with their
[SPEAKER_01]: specialist So I don't I don't take
patients off medication on my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make sure to work with their MD as well
and help them wean off the medication And
[SPEAKER_01]: then we fold in the cannabis medicine or
some of the other integrative therapies
[SPEAKER_01]: very very carefully taking to account the
withdrawals both physical and emotional
[SPEAKER_01]: withdrawal And sometimes we have to
compound the medications.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for instance I'm trying to think of one
that's actually really ambient is one
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see, we have to sometimes compound
the medication so they're taking it I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: you can only break the tablet so much
right before I just like just a powder
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes we'll compound into a liquid
form and help them wean off the conipin
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm just thinking of conipin
can take patients one to two years to get
[SPEAKER_01]: off of So we'll create it into a liquid
formula With a compounding pharmacy and
[SPEAKER_01]: just drip by drip drip by drip and getting
them off little by little as we fold in
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and have you encountered any
examples?
[SPEAKER_00]: of Adverse reactions between Cannabis and
someone's pharmaceuticals, maybe even
[SPEAKER_00]: before they came to see you because they
maybe didn't have that Advice at the time
[SPEAKER_00]: when they started trying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so so cannabinoids can work on,
you know, your serotonin levels and if
[SPEAKER_01]: they're on other Medications that also
affect that patients will feel much more
[SPEAKER_01]: anxious patients might have increased
panic attacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might feel more restless And just
feel uneasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They always say I feel like I'm crawling
out of my skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I did something wrong I took too much,
you know, or they're not spacing it apart
[SPEAKER_01]: with their other medications or
supplements You know, sometimes patients
[SPEAKER_01]: are on four or five different supplements
as well that they think oh, it's natural
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll just take everything at once And
that's not a good idea either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so we really try and break it down for
patients So it's much more manageable and
[SPEAKER_01]: cost-effective because that's a big thing
as well as you know that CBD and cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: is very expensive nutraceuticals are
expensive then they have their
[SPEAKER_01]: Prescription medications on top of that
and then they want to do all these other
[SPEAKER_01]: therapies as well So we look at everything
from a practical perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely And what was your in
changing gears a little bit here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what was your experience like going
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: California's medical cannabis system to
New York's medical cannabis system when
[SPEAKER_00]: you moved what were the difference and
what was that transition like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there's definitely pros and cons in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a free-for-all.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a dispensary on every corner
More dispensaries in Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know you can imagine so It was
very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a few of my favorite dispensaries my
preferred dispensaries where the staff was
[SPEAKER_01]: You know wonderful and they supported My
patients throughout the process,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in the beginning I would actually talk
to these dispensaries and say okay my
[SPEAKER_01]: patients gonna Come in give you a heads
up, you know without disclosing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I kept full, you know HIPAA HIPAA
rules, but you know giving them a heads up
[SPEAKER_01]: that my patients coming and this is what
we would like to try or not try and some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the really good dispensaries were very
respectful of That and worked as a team
[SPEAKER_01]: some of them weren't and was just trying
to push product and just move things off
[SPEAKER_01]: the shelf In New York, it's very different
in New York.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every dispensary has a pharmacist Oh
interesting every dispensary has a
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacist and everything you pick up is
Logged into the prescription monitoring
[SPEAKER_01]: program and this is the same prescription
monitoring program is if you saw your
[SPEAKER_01]: family practitioner and they prescribed
medication for you like Ambien or Some
[SPEAKER_01]: pain meds they would log it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you go to CVS or Walgreens to pick
it up CVS and Walgreens login and sees
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have cannabis as well that you
picked it up From the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all looking at the same database
So that they know that you didn't pick up
[SPEAKER_01]: too much and the pharmacist at the
dispensaries here in New York We'll say
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on blood thinners.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're on, you know Oxycontin and then you
just picked up cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some there's some polypharmacy
going on here There might be some issues
[SPEAKER_01]: and they'll pick up the phone and they'll
call me So there is some accountability
[SPEAKER_01]: and cross-reference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is a very robust medical system in
that sense But it's very cross cost
[SPEAKER_01]: prohibitive here in New York It's about I
would say two to three times the price is
[SPEAKER_00]: California easily Yeah, and that's such a
shame when you have, you know some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these patients being Children that are
already on you know, sometimes really
[SPEAKER_00]: expensive medications or like the elderly
and the poor, you know that Are already
[SPEAKER_00]: struggling to pay for for health care And
then to have something like this that
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretically could be really cheap But
you know making that less successful
[SPEAKER_00]: that's Disappointing but it is exciting to
hear about a medical system that where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're treating Cannabis just like any
other medicine or drug, you know and that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's that shared Information and that
you can catch things like that that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's it's a more precautionary
approach, I guess And that's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: Exciting to see I'm I'm not familiar with
New York's cannabis laws in general So
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the conditions that New York?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will approve somebody for for medical
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so there's epilepsy There's PTSD
chronic pain, which is a you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: big umbrella term and that chronic pain
could you know incorporate many different
[SPEAKER_01]: disease states ALS Parkinson's Irritable
bowel disease, you know, which is Crohn's
[SPEAKER_01]: colitis, etc Also substance abuse added
substance abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So patients that are trying to wean off
opiates are qualified as well There's a
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a good amount autism is not on
there No But you know patients with
[SPEAKER_01]: chronic pain that could be migraine that
could be pelvic pain that could be you
[SPEAKER_01]: know arthritis and Like for example the
cost we're going back to cost I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: patient who is seven and he has seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had about a hundred seizures easily a
day And he is controlled now with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: the seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe he has a handful a month now,
but they spend about three grand a month
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they spend about three grand a month
on the on the cannabis Wow, yeah and
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your experience been?
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding the In getting more until like
the more modern work that you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: where you've actually got this data,
but So there's this debate around,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know isolated cannabinoids versus
quote-unquote broad spectrum versus full
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrum Which these terms aren't even
really defined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on who you talk to they mean
different things, but have you had any
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you noticed anything any trends
between different types of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: products and their efficacy and Sort of
the dosaging and stuff and the reason I
[SPEAKER_00]: ask is because I've had some other
clinicians tell me that from their
[SPEAKER_00]: experience they feel that they're able to
use lower dosages and get Fewer negative
[SPEAKER_00]: side effects with cannabis products that
have a broader phytochemical diversity in
[SPEAKER_00]: them versus those that are very you know,
either isolated or like you have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know distillates and stuff that have
you know, a very narrow range of Chemistry
[SPEAKER_00]: in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so for me Of course full spectrum
Seems to get a little more mileage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I find that the efficacy of full spectrum
is a lot It goes a longer way for patients
[SPEAKER_01]: and they spend actually less money because
they need less Over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think with isolates patients tend to
need a little bit more And you know that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going back to that single model Molecule,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So so you're pulling, you know You're
pulling this out of the plant the full
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and taking it out of context,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may not get all the benefits But I
can see why isolates are used in,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know food and beverage Things like
that for taste or if it's harder to
[SPEAKER_01]: standardize a full spectrum plant,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know the same chemo bar in Florida
will look different than that seed in New
[SPEAKER_01]: York or California, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just not going to get the same
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can see why Certain industry
professionals are more comfortable with
[SPEAKER_01]: isolates, but I think full spectrum Full
spectrum is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, well you're another one to the
list pretty much every clinician I've
[SPEAKER_00]: talked to has has shared the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm yet to find anybody that Has had a
more positive experience with isolated
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids than full spectrum Well,
I think we can all agree that we just need
[SPEAKER_01]: more research, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this research really needs to focus on
the fundamental understanding of what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on with the whole plan Yeah,
right and not just selecting out these
[SPEAKER_01]: individual molecules like CBG CBN,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like like we know what we're
doing because really we don't so and the
[SPEAKER_01]: and the thing is we're still looking at
this field from a disease to Target kill
[SPEAKER_01]: model exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing allopathic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still looking at this from this
allopathic Reductive approach which is
[SPEAKER_01]: separating, you know disease in two parts,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still separating it We feel good
about separating things by element and
[SPEAKER_01]: element and component when we see the
doctor you're going to your
[SPEAKER_01]: endocrinologist and then your nephral,
you know nephrologist and your neurologist
[SPEAKER_01]: and all these doctors are not talking to
each other because they're operating in
[SPEAKER_01]: separate silos, so it's it's the same
thing with Cannabinoid medicine and it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: disservice, you know, really there's this
whole universe of regenerative medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: nutritional medicine Preventative
integrative medicine and we're not talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, absolutely and and this sort of
segues into a Really broad topic that I
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of wanted to talk to you about it's
just you like these Plant-based or even
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal based medicines in general in your
mind you sort of stepping back and looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at health care as a whole How do you
conceptualize medicinal plants and those
[SPEAKER_00]: sort of things and maybe even?
[SPEAKER_00]: To an extent to certain like dietary
supplements and stuff that are you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: basically medicinal some of them medicinal
plants that are just kind of ground up and
[SPEAKER_00]: capsulized but How does that fit in your
mind of the whole you know picture of
[SPEAKER_00]: health care broadly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's it goes back to what Kevin
Spellman talked about the systems biology
[SPEAKER_01]: approach, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really again a wake-up care to our
our health care System when we look at
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence-based medicine, you know,
it really over emphasizes randomized
[SPEAKER_01]: double-blind clinical control trials It's
look as as it as it's like the final
[SPEAKER_01]: arbiter of clinical decision-making,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you look at Americans,
I mean more than 40% of us belong to again
[SPEAKER_01]: a racial or ethnic minority So what are
these differences in genomes?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how do we take a closer look at
these these patients and how are they
[SPEAKER_01]: participating in these clinical trials?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually something that's really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to bring up the NIH actually has
something I'll send you the link.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called all of us research program
Okay, and it talks about precision
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine and I think this is the future of
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's looking at all of us to participate
into this database if you will and you
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's basically contributing your
blood tests your urine saliva tests DNA
[SPEAKER_01]: tests and they're looking at this database
To start looking at how do we get more
[SPEAKER_01]: precise medicine, you know going back to
that Z pack?
[SPEAKER_01]: Analogy, you know why when you get
bronchitis or you get a cold that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the flu Why are you gonna take the same Z
pack as I'm gonna take you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it might not work Well, and I think this
is where plant medicine can really take
[SPEAKER_01]: hold as well Because precision medicine
can take into account plant-based medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: and holistic healing Yeah, absolutely and
something I'd love Like to see from you
[SPEAKER_00]: know sort of maybe it that it would come
from the FDA but some sort of better way
[SPEAKER_00]: of Studying in a sophisticated clinical
way how medicinal plants can be utilized
[SPEAKER_00]: in you know any Particular sort of like
treatment modality, you know in other
[SPEAKER_00]: countries in some countries They have you
know a specific sort of pathway that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can get Natural products approved as
medicines and it's it's a lot harder in
[SPEAKER_00]: the United States I don't know that I
would say it's impossible but it is very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult and it costs a lot of money and
a lot of time and because of that it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: worth it for a lot of companies to try to
you know, create some basic standardized
[SPEAKER_00]: botanical extract and try to get that
approved as a medicine when They could go
[SPEAKER_00]: further and get some isolated compounds
create a very unique formulation that has
[SPEAKER_00]: a much stronger Patent on it, you know
that then they can kind of run with for
[SPEAKER_00]: ten years or whatever Once they get
exactly exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just there's not enough studies on
on plant pharmacogenetics Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we just we need to look at you
know, really genomics more too I mean for
[SPEAKER_01]: one big thing that I see, you know in my
clinic is that African Americans and
[SPEAKER_01]: Puerto Ricans for example, they don't
respond well to common asthma asthma
[SPEAKER_01]: controller medications as well as as other
other ethnic Groups, so this might you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, this is something we might think
about when we talk about plant
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacogenetics You know, maybe there's
something in the genome That you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we we need to take a dig her out so we
don't over prescribe exactly Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so that that is the that's the future of
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's looking at these different.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean we we don't know anything We're
acting like we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's that, you know that classic
idea that I try to bring up time and time
[SPEAKER_00]: again, but You know the more you learn and
the more you study ideally what happens is
[SPEAKER_00]: you start to learn how much you don't know
and You know and in it and that's to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what wisdom is is like recognizing,
you know your own Sort of boundaries and
[SPEAKER_00]: and recognizing that there is you know,
Kevin put it well this dark information
[SPEAKER_00]: dark data dark pharmacology We just don't
understand and and looking at studies,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know In vitro or even you know rodent
in vivo models.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just they don't give us the full
picture and something so an interview I
[SPEAKER_00]: released recently with Jason Miller is a
traditional Chinese medicine practitioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was talking about the difference
between efficacy and effectiveness
[SPEAKER_00]: research and You know that going to
something you said just a little bit ago
[SPEAKER_00]: that most research is targeted on Disease
what drug is going to influence a disease?
[SPEAKER_00]: in a particular way not what Treatment
modalities as a whole might lead to a
[SPEAKER_00]: better outcome for a person Because yeah,
you might knock out that disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what's going to be the consequence for
that person's well-being?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know then and you know long into the
future and everything and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: something I really resonated with when he
said that is absolutely like our just our
[SPEAKER_00]: focus has been we've had such an extreme
tunnel vision on disease and not overall
[SPEAKER_00]: patient care and wellness in its totality
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no talk about prevention.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what about the terrain that's
breeding the disease?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, why is it that certain,
you know, there's certain people that will
[SPEAKER_01]: be more prone to cancer than others,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need to look at medicine from this
preventative Perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and we don't we don't talk about
that in in health care because there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: time You know, my colleagues are seeing 30
patients a day it's a factory,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe you have five minutes with
your doctor and You can't get all your
[SPEAKER_01]: questions in and you're gonna have to wait
until the next visit which is gonna be two
[SPEAKER_00]: months from now Well, yeah and I know just
from my own Experience that I'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: questions thought of that I want to ask my
doctor when I go in and then in the moment
[SPEAKER_00]: When they say so do you have any other
questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, uh, I I guess not I don't
remember, you know, and then you get home
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're like dang I wish I would have
asked this and that and you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's such a common experience I think
for so many people and you know when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in the room and you know Maybe the
physicians sharing some new information
[SPEAKER_00]: with you And so you're processing that and
trying to remember, you know, it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hard when you've only yeah I got like
ten minutes maybe a FaceTime and and then
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's yeah, it's really really hard
Going back to Thinking about your
[SPEAKER_00]: interactions with patients when they're
coming in and kind of getting on their
[SPEAKER_00]: purse their perspective What are some of
the most common questions that you receive
[SPEAKER_00]: from patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: about cannabis and and this leads into
another question I have about sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: common misconceptions What will start just
with sort of the common questions you
[SPEAKER_00]: receive about cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest thing is most patients wanting
to come in is wanting to use them You know
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the day and at night as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be able to use something
without being impaired, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the biggest thing,
you know, everyone is working everyone's
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they might not have a
nine-to-five, but they're doing stuff at
[SPEAKER_01]: home They're you know, they're taking care
of their own parents or their children or
[SPEAKER_01]: friends So it's impairment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing they come in they say,
okay I need something for X Y & Z,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I don't want to be impaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and have you identified Sort of some
ideal CBD THC ratios that help people
[SPEAKER_01]: avoid feeling impaired most of patients
that take CBD or a per CBD dominant
[SPEAKER_01]: Formula are not impaired, but there are
patients that do take CBD that feel
[SPEAKER_01]: impaired And that's usually the same
patients that are sensitive to you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: Advil for example interesting And so I'll
you know, just have them switch and have
[SPEAKER_01]: them take it, you know during the evening
But microdosing is the biggest thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you are taking cannabinoid
medicine, maybe the first couple of weeks
[SPEAKER_01]: you feel Different you might feel a little
bit groggier, but over time your body gets
[SPEAKER_01]: used to it And you feel less of those side
effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah exactly and So leading into the next
question What are some of the most common
[SPEAKER_00]: misconceptions that sometimes you have to
confront when either either from patients
[SPEAKER_00]: that come in and sort of have a Rough
understanding and maybe it's not quite
[SPEAKER_00]: aligned with reality or from your
colleagues potentially that have
[SPEAKER_00]: misconceptions about Cannabis and it's in
its role in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of those that you read into?
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of I think with all the hype and You
know, this is really unprecedented.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's nothing in the world that's taken,
you know, both recreationally and
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinally So I think a lot of patients
come in thinking this is going to be it
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be the end-all be-all and
they have really high expectations of it
[SPEAKER_01]: working because of everything they've read
online and you know My neighbor took it
[SPEAKER_01]: and she's free of cancer Now or it,
you know, it stops the Parkinson tremors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it must be able to stop my fibromyalgia
pain, too So It doesn't work for
[SPEAKER_01]: everything and everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that silver bullet You really
have to do other things in combination
[SPEAKER_01]: with the cannabinoid medicine Yeah,
yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And would you say that's maybe?
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of one of the big things that you
wish everyone knew about cannabis before
[SPEAKER_00]: engaging it is that it's not a silver
bullet Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely and you might not find one
product will work, you know forever So I
[SPEAKER_01]: usually have patients like pick,
you know two to three different favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis products that work or close to
working and they switch off You know every
[SPEAKER_01]: quarter because our body gets sensitized
to it, you know, and I always compare this
[SPEAKER_01]: to allergy medication You might find that
Zyrtec works for one season and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: got to switch over to Claritin And same
thing with your you know, echinacea or
[SPEAKER_01]: vitamin C or your magnesium You need to
take you know, take a break and switch off
[SPEAKER_01]: The good thing about you know,
our endocannabinoid system is that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: exercise and increase our anandamide
levels We can get acupuncture massage and
[SPEAKER_01]: our anandamide levels will increase So
there are different things that we can do
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabinoid medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely and What is something
throughout your experience with patients
[SPEAKER_00]: that has surprised you either an outcome
Or however, you want to think about that
[SPEAKER_00]: question, but you know, you've been doing
this a while now Do you have any examples
[SPEAKER_00]: of some things that went differently than
you expected or?
[SPEAKER_00]: That an outcome came about that,
you know, you really learned a lot from
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of surprised you What's what's
really surprising and really refreshing is
[SPEAKER_01]: That patients that might not have been
into holistic or integrative medicine when
[SPEAKER_01]: they try cannabis and it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah It's really empowering for them,
you know for the first time they feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: I can take control of my health like I can
have this conversation where It does a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit and then I can do other things
and it really opens their mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think it for integrative medicine
and plant medicine and these are you know
[SPEAKER_01]: patients that have been on you know Maybe
10 medications their whole life and and
[SPEAKER_01]: keep going back to the doctor and says,
okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I will take this new med Oh,
you want another medication?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and they're very compliant and
obedient But when they've had enough and
[SPEAKER_01]: they've tried cannabis and it works and
they start to get off the other
[SPEAKER_01]: medications They find that very empowering
they find that like oh my god,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I don't I don't have to rely on
pharmaceuticals, you know having that
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation about nutrition and exercise
Is very empowering because they don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: to rely on going to the MD and writing
that next script Yeah, yeah, and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that's something that Has been really
exciting for me too on the sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: educator side is seeing you know when I
teach somebody about the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and the chemistry how it affects the body
all these sort of things and and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: can use that as a stepping stone to say oh
and then there's these other plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: have these similar compounds and act
similarly and you know, then it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: whoa I didn't realize you know that
echinacea has these Alkalamides that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know interact the endocannabinoid system
and turkey tail mushrooms the you know
[SPEAKER_00]: polysaccharo peptide is interactive and
flavonoids in general a lot of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: you know tugging on that ECS and You know
that beta karyophylline which is in so
[SPEAKER_00]: many plant oils, you know black pepper is
the most common One that gets talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: but like oh that's you know now sort of
being thought of as a cannabinoid,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it just opens this doorway into
appreciating food and medicinal plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: a Totally different way that for whatever
reason they just weren't able to you know
[SPEAKER_00]: There was sort of this invisible wall that
they couldn't get past to kind of see how
[SPEAKER_00]: very real all of all of those,
you know dynamics are And that's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that gives me a lot of
fulfillment as an educator is like yes
[SPEAKER_00]: like you're going beyond cannabis now and
that's I've mentioned before that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know this podcast and the work that I
do it's really a Trojan horse to you know
[SPEAKER_00]: talk about these other areas of health and
wellness and and I also Followed that up
[SPEAKER_00]: by saying I'm not the best example of
someone taking care of their health I do
[SPEAKER_00]: what I can but there's plenty I'm
deficient on so I have the educator
[SPEAKER_00]: syndrome of like do as I say not as I do,
please, but I'm running low on time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gotta go grab some fast food Believe me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was at Shake Shack with my kids the
other day and I saw a patient I know right
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all human there's only so much we
can do but but it's And you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right and it is it's exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's exciting to see when people can
connect those dots and start to see You
[SPEAKER_00]: know coming all the way back around to
like this integrative medicine approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: see their movement and their diet and
Supplements, you know the tea they drink
[SPEAKER_00]: all of these things as being part of
health care and It's something I've
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned before in another interview,
but You know we at least it seems like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's changing now and we talked about this
earlier that a lot of times we grow up
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking that You know you eat food stay
alive You take supplements if you have a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional deficiency of some sort and
you take drugs to get better from illness
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's such a weird broken model
That's it's gonna take time culturally for
[SPEAKER_00]: us to kind of you know get past that but I
know as a kid that's what I Sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed, you know from what I was taught
and exposed to And then I got older and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like dang.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is all totally wrong Right
Well, what the great thing is that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have platforms like this to educate and to
reach So so many so many people and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's wonderful practitioners ancillary
practitioners.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean you have Jana champagne
Epigenetics, you know nurse practitioners
[SPEAKER_01]: nurses health coaches chiropractors
naturopaths Ayurvedic medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know plant, you know plant
specialists, you know, look at Kelvin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh He knows a lot more than your
normal MD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so you don't always have to go to
your MD all the time I mean, there's all
[SPEAKER_01]: these great resources that are at your
fingertips, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah exactly and I guess so to get into
another question I wanted to ask you is on
[SPEAKER_00]: those that topic of resources What are
some of your preferred learning resources
[SPEAKER_00]: regarding?
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my goodness Well, I have I'm this
resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my gosh You make me blush There's
there's some really great resources out
[SPEAKER_01]: there it's The also the thing is there's
also misinformation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of a lot of cut and paste You
know, we're sort of echoing the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing, but there's there's some really
great resources I I'll send you a link and
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe you can put it In your show notes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that'd be great That's something I
always try to tease out of my guests to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to understand what you found Most
valuable and try to connect people to
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be great And now taking a step back
And looking at sort of cannabis science
[SPEAKER_00]: and canvas research as a whole What sort
of interests you the most and what do you
[SPEAKER_00]: hope to see from the future of cannabis
research?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh My goodness A lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that is a huge question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean for I mean the thing about I Think
about research especially for plant
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine is that it not everything is
gonna fit into a box and I just had this
[SPEAKER_01]: conversation with Kevin a couple of weeks
ago and We're trying I mean the thing
[SPEAKER_01]: about I mean, that's the thing about
research is that research has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: double-blind, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Research has to be random controlled and
then what are you gonna make of a plant
[SPEAKER_01]: that has different?
[SPEAKER_01]: Compounds that you can't standardize So
it's almost like Mother Nature's laughing
[SPEAKER_01]: at us, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean I and then you look at the
different receptors there's I there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: really great receptor map that I use in my
presentations of the ECS and how different
[SPEAKER_01]: different phyto cannabinoids affect and
there's just it's just scattered
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere I mean you can't it's it's like
we're we're a blip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, there's there's no Way to wrap your
head around it and that goes back to dark
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmacology I mean look think about plant
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's no way to wrap your head
around this research and that's why I
[SPEAKER_01]: talked about that NIH platform because we
if we can contribute the different
[SPEAKER_01]: information the genomics You know our
blood our urine our DNA we can really look
[SPEAKER_01]: at precision medicine Individualized
medicine and that's not what we have right
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah Yeah, and it makes me wonder,
you know if we're in this situation Where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're sort of like a bacteria trying to
understand a human, you know, like there's
[SPEAKER_00]: this Barrier to understanding that you can
just like really never get across and it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes me wonder if and I mean I know to an
extent this is true that you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the role of AI and machine learning is
gonna become really invaluable to help us
[SPEAKER_00]: Try to extend that sort of boundary that
we have to work with because you're right
[SPEAKER_00]: Like there's so much data so much
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no one human brain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be able to Synthesize all of
that and digest it and and then work with
[SPEAKER_00]: it It's I think it's gonna take some help
from something beyond what what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: capable of and maybe that's a good role
for AI and healthcare is like this NIH,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know data gathering Initiative to get
all this data together in one place where
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be, you know manipulated and
analyzed and everything and then maybe we
[SPEAKER_00]: sick the AI bots on it and then try to
figure out what wisdom they can pull out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it and and teach us because Otherwise,
I mean, can you imagine how much time it
[SPEAKER_00]: just time alone?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not much, you know, I don't know if you're
like me like any study I read you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to read it multiple times and
try to like Understand the pieces you
[SPEAKER_00]: missed and how things fit together and you
know So just the time alone is an
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible feat for you know, anyone to
overcome exactly And I mean and the
[SPEAKER_01]: important thing also to know as we scale
up AI is that you know We can't simply
[SPEAKER_01]: base it on data either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So there there's a there's a sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and how do we use AI successfully?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so we're not you know,
so that we're not looking at false
[SPEAKER_01]: correlations Yes, but we're really trying
to understand what's happening behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think I think there's I think that's
the future Yeah, yeah, I know that's such
[SPEAKER_00]: a good point to bring up there There are
things to our human experience that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna be able to quantify That an AI
is gonna be able to pick from so finding
[SPEAKER_00]: that blend and maybe that's when we just
upload our consciousnesses into So we can
[SPEAKER_00]: make the ultimate doctors But yeah,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's a balance there for sure
and there are things to our experience and
[SPEAKER_00]: Wisdom and things that you know AI is not
gonna be able to overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, absolutely Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't want to keep you too much
Longer you've already been very gracious
[SPEAKER_00]: with your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been going for almost an hour and 15
minutes now But I wanted to ask you if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's You know in the last several
minutes that we have here Is there
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that we haven't talked about that
you'd like to get into and if so,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's do it and if not Then I'll just kind
of hand the platform over to you to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about anything regarding how people can
learn more about your work and Contact you
[SPEAKER_00]: or anything else you want to share in your
thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you
[SPEAKER_01]: We covered a lot of really great pertinent
information I Definitely would love to get
[SPEAKER_01]: back on maybe in a few months and see if
things have changed and we can chat again
[SPEAKER_01]: But patients can find me get dr. June chin
calm dr. June chin calm Perfect Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, once again, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I definitely would love to
recommend We connect with you and at some
[SPEAKER_00]: point I'm gonna make my way out to New
York and then we'll have to We're
[SPEAKER_00]: determined it's just a matter of time so
Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
