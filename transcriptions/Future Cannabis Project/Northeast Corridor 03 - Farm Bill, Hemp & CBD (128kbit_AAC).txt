[SPEAKER_00]: Let's jump into CBD, because we've really
mostly talked about THC virgin cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD obviously is the breakout star of
2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: I expect it's going to be even more so in
2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure everyone in this room has their
own CBD product that they're selling right
[SPEAKER_00]: now and infusing in their kitchen with a
Lexo machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little torn on this because on the
one hand, I think there are some amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD products out there, but on the other
hand, I think that the FDA is maybe not
[SPEAKER_00]: such a bad idea to have some oversight in
this because we saw that with vitamins
[SPEAKER_00]: that we were taking vitamins and we had no
idea what was in these vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: They stepped in and went, that's going to
stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to make sure that if you get a
vitamin C, it's a vitamin C.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did that test in 2017 over a bunch of
CBD products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Half of them, not half of them,
a third of them didn't even have CBD in
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Several of them had less CBD than they
claimed to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you even had companies like
Charlotte's Web, the Stanley Brothers at
[SPEAKER_00]: that time, claiming that their CBD was
going to cure cancer and everything under
[SPEAKER_00]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got in trouble for that and they had
to take all that language down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you guys see CBD going at this
point?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: The market's huge for CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing big.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, with the hemp farm bill passing,
yeah, for sure, but I think there's a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of misperception out there in terms of
really what this all means because at the
[SPEAKER_04]: end of the day, the FDA has to approve
these products and they have to attest to
[SPEAKER_04]: the labeling and the packaging and all
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's still a lot of unknown, Jed,
how this is all going to play out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where we see it is really on the hemp
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been tracking hemp licenses and
trying to get our arms around that market
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's been challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: What we've learned is that the way a lot
of these industrial programs have come
[SPEAKER_02]: about is it's really about farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we've reached out to a lot of these
people, it's so-and-so's farm in upstate
[SPEAKER_02]: New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very much agricultural, so there's
less information about them, but different
[SPEAKER_02]: states regulate differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado and Oregon have many,
many licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their test programs are really fully
commercial now where people can do all
[SPEAKER_02]: sorts of stuff with the hemp, including
making CBD products.
[SPEAKER_02]: In other places, it's much more
agricultural commodity pricing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to decorticate stocks,
a word that I never knew until last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sort of rip them apart and make things
with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see it more as an industrial
agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're curious to see what the regulations
are in terms of licensing for retail,
[SPEAKER_02]: if it ever comes to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had heard that with the government
shutdown, that was a big issue for the
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently, if you apply for a license,
you have to have an FBI background check
[SPEAKER_00]: or something of that sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to have some kind of background
check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, because the government
shutdown, they can't get those background
[SPEAKER_00]: checks, so they can't get their approval
to start their farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interestingly, Kentucky has quite a robust
hemp program, so I wonder if that'll push
[SPEAKER_03]: Mitch McConnell.
Mitch McConnell?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, Mitch McConnell supported the
farm bill and pushed it through because
[SPEAKER_00]: the Kentucky farmers, they were losing
their tobacco fields because people
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't smoking as many cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their saving grace was to switch over to
hemp, which actually was their original
[SPEAKER_00]: crop before tobacco.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the other thing we may start to
see in the coming years is FDA enforcement
[SPEAKER_01]: against the bad actors of CBD because
technically, the FDA has regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: approval over CBD now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Folks online who are selling CBD products,
especially tainted CBD products,
[SPEAKER_01]: products making false claims about health
benefits, that's low-hanging fruit for the
[SPEAKER_01]: FDA to go after them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an enforcement mechanism for making
those false health claims for selling
[SPEAKER_01]: products that haven't been approved by the
FDA going through the clinical trials
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: The CBD market seems to be outpacing
cannabis tremendously, but because the FDA
[SPEAKER_01]: has approved CBD as a regulated product,
I would expect to see enforcement from
[SPEAKER_01]: them against some of these online actors.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they were getting paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they were getting paid and open for
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think that there's already so
many CBD products, it's going to be really
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult for the FDA to get their arms
around this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, sure, they can go after the big
players, like you said, like the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that are online that are established.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most egregious actors, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even here in the New York area,
there are numerous CBD companies that,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I said, people just cooking up some
lotion in their kitchen and now it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but you can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Literally, all you have to do is go get
some coconut oil, some CBD, do it in an
[SPEAKER_00]: infuser, get a nice package, put a label
on it, and you're in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's what happened in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD products were in Whole Foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD products were in the grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone was just like, oh,
this is legal because everyone is doing
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then public health came out and said,
none of y'all are illegal and we're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to start enforcing against you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to do an education campaign
first.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you don't get in line with it,
we're going to enforce.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of those things that just because
everybody's doing it doesn't mean it's
[SPEAKER_01]: legal and the government doesn't have
teeth to go after it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The FDA has regulatory authority to go
after CBD and most states have regulatory
authority.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you guys think that the hemp market's
going to be bigger than the cannabis THC
[SPEAKER_00]: market?
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why and how so?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, if you think about hemp,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So hemp in and of itself, there's
industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: So soap, rope, whatever you derive from
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Concrete, anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything's hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the farm bill, there's the pathway
for big health and wellness products,
[SPEAKER_01]: the supplement industry, to get into the
hemp market.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no federal prohibition that's
keeping the rest of the bigs away like
[SPEAKER_01]: there are in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hemp, CBD products being sold at the
grocery store, it's much more approachable
[SPEAKER_01]: for regular folks who have never touched a
cannabis product before.
[SPEAKER_01]: These hemp products don't have the same
stigma as cannabis and they're just going
[SPEAKER_01]: to outpace it just by availability,
number of outlets where you can purchase
[SPEAKER_01]: it, and you don't have these crazy
cannabis taxes attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hemp oil is very high in protein.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're vegan or vegetarian and you
need high protein in your diet,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people are now turning to hemp
oil in their cooking or hemp oil that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're adding to their meals to get the
protein that they need that normally they
[SPEAKER_00]: would have gotten maybe from, you know,
beans or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's definitely become very popular as
a very, very high protein type of product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, one other thing, too, is like,
how do you define the CBD market?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you put CBD in Coca-Cola,
is all of Coca-Cola products now
[SPEAKER_04]: considered a CBD product?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you double counting?
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think, you know, there's a lot of
uncertainty really how this is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny you bring up Coca-Cola because
someone had told me that Coca-Cola had
[SPEAKER_00]: stockpiled all the CBD down in South
America.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were like, but you'll never get
anyone to confirm this story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought it was an amazing story.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's been widely speculated that
they're going to enter into, and all the
[SPEAKER_04]: soft drink companies, Gator, everybody's
going to have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And big makeup companies, too,
here are doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of folks seem to be stockpiling CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: And don't forget our four-legged friends,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, pet products.
And we'll see you next time.
