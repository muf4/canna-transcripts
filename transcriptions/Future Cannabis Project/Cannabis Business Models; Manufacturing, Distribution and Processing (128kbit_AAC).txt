[SPEAKER_03]: Tim Blake has several cannabis businesses
he's working on, and he's going to talk to
[SPEAKER_03]: us about manufacturing today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Amanda will talk about flow,
cona, and distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the Emerald Cup, we will have our
license this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel sorry for high times in some ways,
but as far as us, we're working with the
[SPEAKER_00]: state and we're working with Main Street
Strategies, and we're proactive,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're way in front, and they really
love what the Cup has done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will have a license and be doing
very well at the Cup this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as far as manufacturing, you know,
you talk about the Cup when it first
[SPEAKER_00]: started.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was flowers, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Later on, we finally did the concentrates,
cold water and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the years now, you've seen that
evolve to where the flowers are really a
[SPEAKER_00]: small part of the Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have like, you know, 20 other contests
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you're looking at is the
flowers becoming a smaller, smaller part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the whole industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, eventually it will be probably
less than 10%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at people coming out with the
cartridges, and now they're getting so
[SPEAKER_00]: good, all of a sudden you get the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They burn right, or they vaporize right,
and they work all the way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are getting very accustomed to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you're seeing with
manufacturing is everything's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you talk about, it's oil fields
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not even flower fields anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're called oil fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a new term that's coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you've got is you've got
different forms of extraction coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, back in the day, we were doing
cold water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were only solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wouldn't do anything at the Cup with
hydrocarbons because of the legal issues
[SPEAKER_00]: and people blowing themselves up and then
using, you know, mystery gas in the cans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's changed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you've got systems that are like a
million dollars coming out that will go to
[SPEAKER_00]: your field and process like 2,500 pounds
in a day and just bring that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're like million dollar
hydrocarbon machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the state going legal with that,
you've got these different forms of
[SPEAKER_00]: extraction coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got the traditional alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got CO2, which people are using a
lot of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've got hydrocarbon with
hexane, propane, and butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a new manufacturing plant right
outside of the Willett City Limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually, I was talking with
John McGowan, the lead supervisor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to apply for Type 7 and do
hydrocarbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I explained to John why.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, it's got the purge systems
get rid of it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got pharmaceutical grade
hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you've also got recirculating
systems where they're using almost none of
[SPEAKER_00]: the material.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all being recycled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to use all ways of
extracting to go into our products.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still going to be based as much as
we can solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the industry is moving very quickly in
that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's happening with all these
manufacturing places, let's look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole world and we'll bring it back to
where we are really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the world, you've got all these
companies and countries going legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Czechoslovakia.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Uruguay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, Columbia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Columbia took our flowers 40 years ago,
traditional flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to come after all of our
cannabis flowers right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the big company?
[SPEAKER_00]: The big boy in the box is Canada,
the first G7 nation that's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: distribute worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've gone recreational completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're now in talks to license 150
products that can go worldwide.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just shipped Aurora Cannamed,
just shipped to Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to Germany.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got the Israelis taking over the
medicinal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to ship all over the
world medicinally.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been out in front of us for about
20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we look at it while we're
sitting here trying to fight our way out
[SPEAKER_00]: of a box in this county in California,
the rest of the world is so quickly moving
[SPEAKER_00]: beyond us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take forever to catch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's good parts of that we'll get
back to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for right now, we're looking at the
manufacturing of these products throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're manufacturing oils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not really sending flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we do in this country?
[SPEAKER_00]: We send all of our manufacturing offshore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have any manufacturing anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The great thing is that cannabis,
really along with SpaceX, with Musk,
[SPEAKER_00]: what he's doing, and Tesla, we're going to
actually bring manufacturing back to this
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis is going to be the biggest
growth industry, manufacturing-wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And distribution-wise of any product of
anything in the world over the next 30
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to really lead the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all going to be manufactured
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to find out where we fit in
that role.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, we're losing a giant share
to Canada, really, and the Israelis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're really going to take that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you fall back to what we're doing
in the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what's in the state happening is
we're filing for a manufacturing permit
[SPEAKER_00]: and cultivation permit in Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have $250,000 to apply.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have $1 million in the bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've got to know somebody.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually working with an attorney
who's a former DEA agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my position being where I come my
whole life, I'm talking with a DEA agent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wanted to know if we were going to be
legal enough and follow the guidelines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had to explain to him what we've
done with the sheriff's debates with Tom
[SPEAKER_00]: Allman up in Area 101 and all the activism
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were no problem with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he checked us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have an attorney DEA agent
helping us get a manufacturing license in
[SPEAKER_00]: Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have to be West Coast and East
Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest of the states are going to really
chew this up very quickly if we don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you look at Washington,
Colorado, all over the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're not only losing our black
market flowers, we're going to lose our
[SPEAKER_00]: black market, well, forget the black
market, the other market cartridges and
[SPEAKER_00]: the other forms of manufacturing if we
don't move very, very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we really have an uphill battle in
many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you peel it back to the local
situation that we've got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it goes back to people who
are saying, you know, in Flo Cana,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all want to represent small farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say that's what the Emerald Cup is,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, there should be a new phrase
that comes out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to represent, we want to
represent, well, we are representing the
[SPEAKER_00]: best of small farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the end of the day,
that's all you can represent.
[SPEAKER_00]: When Mikey came to me from Flo Cana and
wanted to represent all the small farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, we already did that with Mendocino
Farmers Collective when I had a collective
[SPEAKER_00]: up in Area 101.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened was we took 50 people's
cannabis flowers and realized that only
[SPEAKER_00]: five or 10 of them would actually sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had to give it all back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we had to realize we had to
cherry pick just like the black market is
[SPEAKER_00]: because you just can't take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nowadays everybody knows, try to sell
B-grade black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't even want B-grade OGs,
not even if they're seven or eight,
[SPEAKER_00]: $600 a pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't even want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want the finest.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd move from a B-grade OG to a
high-grade flower, you know, with,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, perps or something any day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same in manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're going to go to a manufacturing
system, you have to have incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines that come out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even if it's going into an edible,
even if it's going into a tincture or a
[SPEAKER_00]: salve, it's still product in, product out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this isolate, this hemp,
you know, materials that they're doing for
[SPEAKER_00]: CVD, it's all garbage and they're already
talking about it all over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got to, you look at Fred from
CVD Mendo or Russell back there from CVD
[SPEAKER_00]: Healing Medicines, they're all growing
biodynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing high-grade organic flowers
and medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so whether it's Flo Cana's
manufacturing, you're going to have Flo
[SPEAKER_00]: Cana's going to be manufacturing in
Redwood Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have three or four in
Willets here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have one in Yukai.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have about 10
manufacturing plants in Mendocino County
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of those will make money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably only a couple.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's over 100-something permits for
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost all are Type 7 right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to be competing against
major manufacturers throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it still comes down to the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for you guys, what matters,
I guess, on the manufacturing side is if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to do a product, and you want
a white label with somebody like us or Flo
[SPEAKER_00]: Cana, you're going to have to have the
finest product or you don't even have a
[SPEAKER_00]: chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Amanda can tell you, if you look
at the distribution companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: I could go into all that whole thing,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got River, who is our distribution
company, just merged with Cana Royalty.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got distribution merging left and
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to do the same thing in
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to consolidate down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only people who are going to
really be able to have a manufactured
[SPEAKER_00]: product to go out are people that have
something phenomenal, people that love
[SPEAKER_00]: doing social media, people that have deep
pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that are great marketing people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you're not going to manufacture
a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you make a good product,
you could work with Flo Cana.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could work with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could work with somebody else and do
co-branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could do a white label.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could end up selling the product to
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we could do something together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ways to go about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really going to start with some
type of really fine product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you're going to drop down into being an
oil producer for concentrates and
[SPEAKER_00]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a bad living in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you start thinking about it,
I mean, I haven't done all the numbers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we run them around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're really good and you get
depths and you're bringing in 1,500 pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: a year, even if you're selling it for 300
bucks, by the time you pay your taxes and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else, you get all your workers
in there, you can still make 75 to 125
[SPEAKER_00]: grand a year if you're good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're only working six months of the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are coming and picking it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not really trimming it,
carrying it, dealing with all the issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get the rest of the year off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a world and life out there for
cultivators delivering just to
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what you're going to see is people
going into these fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've even got CO2 machines that will go
out there now, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And going into the fields and just
basically harvesting it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you really need to have the right
strains to go with that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we go into a whole thing about
when you're manufacturing products,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got to get quantity, and you've got
to get quality, and you've got to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have the right strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nobody wants OG anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking for terps and fine things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on a manufacturing level, this county
is going to do really good manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something else I want to say
before I lost my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We find the distributors that down in LA,
nobody cares about the Emerald Triangle or
[SPEAKER_00]: our organic solvent list.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care about snack, crackle,
and pop.
[SPEAKER_00]: They care about sauce and butane and stuff
and shatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were talking about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to have a better time with the
Emerald Triangle products and flowers once
[SPEAKER_00]: we get out of this box and get out of this
state and get across the country and
[SPEAKER_00]: across the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there, the Emerald Triangle name
has real value.
[SPEAKER_00]: People will want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's real hope for our products and
our flowers as we bust out and we compete
[SPEAKER_00]: against the international markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just comes down to not only that
flower being A grade, but really having an
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible product that goes with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So work with a great manufacturer,
work with a great distributor,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've got a chance and make a great
product, and you'll be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that, Carrie, you said we were
moving away from advocacy and into the
[SPEAKER_01]: business side, but I'm just going to talk
a little bit about advocacy and
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution as kind of a social justice
piece of the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did not mean to say that they're
mutually exclusive.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yes, of course, advocacy continues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I just wanted to talk a little bit
about how FloCon evolved, because a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: times when we look at what's going on with
agriculture and business in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the United States, it's very top-down,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's the folks who have a lot of money
making decisions about how they can make
[SPEAKER_01]: more money by infiltrating their power
down to the people who have very little
[SPEAKER_01]: control over their situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: How we grew up was really kind of the
opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started as a delivery service in the
Bay Area, and we were sourcing product
[SPEAKER_01]: from farmers in the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our founder, Michael Steinmetz,
had come up here and visited with farms
[SPEAKER_01]: and really saw the magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having been here from South America,
had a lot of appreciation for small
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture and agricultural cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the idea was that we really thought
what was happening here was special,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how do you get that to the public?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really at the core of what a
distributor is supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're supposed to find things that are
special and figure out how to get it to
[SPEAKER_01]: the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll talk a little bit more about what
that looks like in a scenario where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like a branded distribution company,
like FloCon, or if you're just providing
[SPEAKER_01]: things for the shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they're two very different models,
and I think that one model serves this
[SPEAKER_01]: region a lot better than the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were working with small farmers,
and they were telling us about some of
[SPEAKER_01]: their barriers in getting to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of those barriers were places to
safely store their product, where they had
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature and humidity control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a place to trim their product,
where they felt like they weren't in risk
[SPEAKER_01]: of things getting contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a way to actually get their
product into dispensaries without having
[SPEAKER_01]: to go to LA and to San Diego and two
different places across the state and work
[SPEAKER_01]: with dispensary owners one on one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so hearing these barriers from working
with them as a delivery company,
[SPEAKER_01]: as we started to work more into wholesale,
we started to think, how do we address
[SPEAKER_01]: some of those barriers?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we make it easier to get these
folks to market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, what a distributor is supposed to
be thinking about, but this is before we
[SPEAKER_01]: were really a distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was really the idea for the
campus in Redwood Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was the idea that if we built a facility,
kind of like go where the people are
[SPEAKER_01]: philosophy, if we went to where the
farmers were, and we built a facility that
[SPEAKER_01]: was licensed to do the manufacturing,
the trimming, the processing, the
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging, the testing, and then we had a
way to take their product downstream and
[SPEAKER_01]: had people on that end that could do the
brand ambassador and go to the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries and do the social media and
really push the things that the farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: may have an interest in, may not have an
interest in, but are really busy being
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers and going through the licensing
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the idea to bring centralized
processing and bring this facility was
[SPEAKER_01]: really born out of the needs we saw from
the farmer versus people saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanna have a successful distribution
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we get source from?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that that's why this type
of distribution model has the ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: actually disrupt big agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that if distributors work
together and really focus on the types of
[SPEAKER_01]: brands and the types of people that we
want to see in the marketplace and really
[SPEAKER_01]: advocating for what quality truly is,
that quality isn't necessarily THC level
[SPEAKER_01]: and quality isn't necessarily orange
hairs, that it's terpenoid and cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: profile, it's how the product was grown,
it's the amount of product that that
[SPEAKER_01]: person produces a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we have distributors that understand
this and advocate for this, that's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the whole supply chain take the
intent of the farmer and translate it all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way through to the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when a distributor is talking to a
dispensary owner about why sungrown is
[SPEAKER_01]: better, about why Mendocino is special,
that's going to translate into how that
[SPEAKER_01]: product is marketed in the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I absolutely think that distribution
can be a social advocacy if distributors
[SPEAKER_01]: decide that they are going to stick to a
certain brand, that their brand is small
[SPEAKER_01]: producers, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you decide that you're only going to
distribute people that produce under a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain amount a year, that's your brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And anyone that knows that if they're
getting product from you, that represents
[SPEAKER_01]: something in the sphere of manufactured
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important that we use
these business structures and these
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities to continue to try to create
the landscape that we want to see in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And playing off of something that Tim
said, about the global economy of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, which is coming, Canada wants to
own us all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all going to be IA in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm telling you, that's where big
business is right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like we're fighting each other
a lot in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of my little soapbox.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like we're fighting each other a
lot in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while we're doing that, the Mounties
are coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we need to start banding together
and realizing that in short order,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is going to be a global
commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: When that happens, the Emerald Triangle is
going to be a teeny tiny speck in that
[SPEAKER_01]: global landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we can establish now through a
unified voice that we are the quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we are the craft, then we will have
the biggest share of the market for that
[SPEAKER_01]: level of product, the product Tim's
talking about, the really world premiere,
[SPEAKER_01]: high class product that we have here in
this region of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to work together on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to work together through
branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to work together through
marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to mention that I think out on the
table is forums to join the Mendocino
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Rissa will say a second about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So membership is $200 for a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we work with a lot of allied
organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we basically work on promotion and
branding of products that are produced in
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we work with the county promotional
alliances and tourism boards.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with the Mendocino Appalachians
Project and other groups that are trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to work on specific branding to this
region.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work on state policies that enable
things like event licenses and farmers to
[SPEAKER_01]: do direct sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're really interested in
Mendocino industry and really protecting
[SPEAKER_01]: the brand of Mendocino County,
I think it's important that we really have
[SPEAKER_01]: unity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the last thing I wanted to say
was about the idea of challenging big ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now agriculture in the United
States, as many of you know, is very
[SPEAKER_01]: monoculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not using diversification.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not using regenerative
practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all suffering for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis, because of prohibition,
has had the benefit of having grown up in
[SPEAKER_01]: a place of ingenuity, creativity,
sustainability, having to be hidden and
[SPEAKER_01]: being off the grid, which is a pain at the
ass, but at the same time a model for how
[SPEAKER_01]: we should all move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it's important that also
through our distributor work, through our
[SPEAKER_01]: processing work, through all the work that
we do at every level in business license,
[SPEAKER_01]: we really have to remember that we have an
opportunity to challenge the agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: model.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're trying to do that with the
centralized processing in campus.
[SPEAKER_01]: The idea that farmers have the ability to
scale up by sharing these costs,
[SPEAKER_01]: by moving these costs off the farm is
very, very different than what we see in
[SPEAKER_01]: industrialized agriculture, as is the push
for regenerative farming practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're working on a regenerative
standard for farmers to help them move
[SPEAKER_01]: towards closed loop systems, to help them
learn how to use beneficial insects and
[SPEAKER_01]: compost teas and the things that we know
are good for the earth and that we want to
[SPEAKER_01]: be part of the brand of what is quality
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really all fits together and it all
fits in really well with Mendocino County,
[SPEAKER_01]: a place that banned all GMOs, a place
where everyone's a craft farmer because no
[SPEAKER_01]: one's allowed to have more than 10,000
square feet, which we should totally use
[SPEAKER_01]: in our branding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have a huge opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm hopeful that companies like
Flocona can be helpful in not only
[SPEAKER_01]: building the brand, but really allowing
1,000 farmers to flourish underneath the
[SPEAKER_01]: support.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the end of the day,
in every single market across agriculture,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the small, the craft, the organic,
the small batch, the individually loved
[SPEAKER_01]: and produced product that is the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's who we are here in Mendocino
County.
[SPEAKER_01]: The market may not be reflective of that
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are still learning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's really important we
remember that we're still activists and
[SPEAKER_01]: advocates, even when we're talking about
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll leave it there.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you so much, Amanda Ryman.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim, you sounded like you had a comment
when she was talking about the 10,000
[SPEAKER_00]: square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with her on the amount he's coming
right at us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have nothing against Canadians.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of friends that are
Canadians.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might even have been in a partnership
with some Canadians.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're looking at Canomed merged with
Aurora, became a $1.2 billion company.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing Cronos.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing these companies that are
becoming gigantic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was hearing somebody they're buying
airports so they can transport this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: around the world and not have people in
their way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it really is a global market that's
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you step back and look at us,
we're sitting here at 10,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Santa Barbara's got 15 acre farms and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely absurd that our
supervisors haven't moved to the half acre
[SPEAKER_00]: level, or even one acre, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just opened up this whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here in the heart of the Emerald
Triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're being restricted so heavily
while the rest of the world is just coming
[SPEAKER_00]: right at us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my hat's off to the Canadians.
[SPEAKER_00]: They knew what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they took advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to be the ones to be
remembered as the kings of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: queens.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question about processing this
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this year seems to be such a
transition year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And people will have their first light
depth harvest coming in mid-July.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going to happen to that product if
there's not enough processing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Farms that are licensed to process their
own that can process it all on their own
[SPEAKER_03]: because of different restrictions with
coding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Will Flocona have a processing center?
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you think there are enough around
Mendocino, both of you?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do have a processing center in
Redwood Valley that opened officially
[SPEAKER_01]: about a week ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're hiring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anyone is interested in being a
processor for Flocona, you can go to our
[SPEAKER_01]: website and fill out an application.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need people because there's a lot
of cannabis to process.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing about processing is that there
are very strict standards from Cal OSHA
[SPEAKER_01]: about worker environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's very different than sitting at
a table, maybe even with a little mask on.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be a completely clean room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people have to be wearing gloves and
hair nets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everything has to be sterile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that it's hard for a lot of
farmers to come up to that standard,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if the right regulations allow them
to trim on their farm this season,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to be tough to do it in a way
that's going to satisfy some of the state
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there should be more places
like Flocona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it can be a version of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's a bunch of farmers that you
want to get together and purchase a small
[SPEAKER_01]: building that's kind of easy to build out
into that type of room and then share the
[SPEAKER_01]: expense, that may work better than trying
to make each individual farm licensed to
[SPEAKER_01]: do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that there's ways that people
can try to work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that centralized processing is
a really good option for folks to lower
[SPEAKER_01]: the cost and still build rooms to
compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's probably one of the hardest,
I mean, more than distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Distribution is just putting it on a truck
and driving it from one place to another.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the processing, that's actually
handling live plant material, plant
[SPEAKER_01]: material that's already been tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of responsibility there
that nothing happens to it after the test
[SPEAKER_01]: has come back clean and before it's been
in the consumer's hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot can happen in that processing
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, there's a lot of machinery in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of machinery in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amanda, you both missed, well,
no, maybe you didn't miss a very animated
[SPEAKER_02]: discussion before lunch about distribution
and how many farmers are suffering because
[SPEAKER_02]: they've got product, they can't distribute
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The legal outlets and dispensaries and
retailing are not being able to get their
[SPEAKER_02]: product there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one is, how does a farmer get Flocona
to distribute their craft cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And two, I wanted to ask if you are seeing
the same trend in manufacturing that Tim
[SPEAKER_02]: referred to and is Flocona getting into
oils and manufacturing and joining.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where's your plant, Tim?
[SPEAKER_02]: You said you're gonna, Emerald Cup is
gonna start a plant, a manufacturing plant
[SPEAKER_02]: in Willets?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, it's actually outside the city
limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the old Mosier Garden Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one block behind the dump out there,
waste management.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually, it doesn't feel like an
industrial park.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually an eight and a half acre,
three step up park.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a pond next to it and you overlook
the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're fortunate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna really be an industrial park.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very excited about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll let Amanda answer the questions
you asked her.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, first, we need more places like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's very, very important because we
do need more outlets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, I'll say Flocona is not taking
on any new farmers because we don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: the capacity to process for any more
people than we're already processing for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why we're hiring more people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can hire more people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can bring on more farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We plan to be able to bring on anyone that
wants to work with us as long as we do a
[SPEAKER_01]: farm audit and see their practices and all
of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we also have a responsibility to the
farmers we currently work with to be
[SPEAKER_01]: quality in our processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we try to bring on too much,
that quality goes down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stuff starts to slip through the cracks
and that's not fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because the regulations are so strict
and we're just now going through our
[SPEAKER_01]: permanent state licensing process,
we just have to be really careful about
[SPEAKER_01]: our growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: That we don't hurt the integrity of what
we've already built.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that being said, we do have a farmer
relations team that will take your
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as we start taking on more
farmers, we'll contact you and schedule a
[SPEAKER_01]: farm visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: We come and visit the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see your practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk to you about what your
expectations are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then to answer the question about
manufacturing, we are going to start
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing on the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a partner out of Colorado that's
going to be coming in and doing white
[SPEAKER_01]: label manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if our farmers want to take part of
their product and turn that into an oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll be able to get that done there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be able to co-brand with Flocona
with the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then eventually what I see is edible
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you really have very little idea
what flour is in your edible product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm looking for all the way down
the supply chain where you're buying a
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie and you know that it was made with
oil from Huckleberry Hill Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that I think is really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or Lady Sativa Farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that that's really what
we're pushing towards, is we want folks to
[SPEAKER_01]: know that when you buy a product that has
Flocona oil as an ingredient, that it
[SPEAKER_01]: represents the highest quality because
it's representing this very unique group
[SPEAKER_01]: of craft farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So white label means that the manufacturer
isn't putting their brand on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're basically making it as an
ingredient for the farmer and Flocona to
[SPEAKER_01]: co-brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Amanda, would you say that model that
you're working with the farmers is that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're contracting with a farmer,
that you know what their quality is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you're testing and purchasing the
cannabis and then processing it at your
[SPEAKER_03]: central processing plant or making it into
oil or edible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you've already contracted to buy that
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's one business model, correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I want to ask, yeah, about that and
ask Tim if that's what Emerald Cup is
[SPEAKER_03]: doing as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically the kind of the previous
model was that the farmer would sell their
[SPEAKER_01]: pound wholesale and they would just walk
away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then whatever happened to that pound
after they sold it was whatever happened
[SPEAKER_01]: to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It went into oils or it went into
something else or maybe it went into
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we work more with the farmer on a
contract basis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's not exclusive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to sell everything to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can totally work with other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we give them a down payment and then
they get a percentage of that product at
[SPEAKER_01]: retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if that product is turned into a $20
cookie, instead of only getting the worth
[SPEAKER_01]: of the flour that went into that cookie,
they're getting a percentage of that
[SPEAKER_01]: cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the white label piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're basically purchasing it at the
retail level.
[SPEAKER_01]: That cookie is co-branded so that farmer
gets part of that revenue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we have a whole menu of
services.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the biggest things we offer,
honestly, is storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Storage is a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our farmers are seasonal farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not producing all year round.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're pulling one or two harvests,
but they need that to last all year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having safe, secure temperature and
humidity controlled storage was one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest barriers we saw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thankfully at the property in Redwood
Valley, because it used to store wine,
[SPEAKER_01]: it has a ton of storage that's built
exactly for that type of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that in the end of the day,
right now, that's probably the best paying
[SPEAKER_01]: service that we can offer farmers in terms
of their needs this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a separate contract or separate
relationship than saying you're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: purchase that stored cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's different levels.
Correct, correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: The storage, it still belongs to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's on the shelf in the storage
facility, still belongs to the farmer,
[SPEAKER_01]: still their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can come get it at any time,
take it away.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, and Tim, what is your business
model?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few things in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them you guys were talking about
earlier about the situation and the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation and distribution and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be really even more of a mess
because if you look at it now,
[SPEAKER_00]: it used to be if you had a product and it
dried up during the summer, at least
[SPEAKER_00]: during the summer months, you could move
it out and get a pretty good price for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it became a shorter window
because of the depths coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's basically, if you don't sell your
product between April 1st and May 1st,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's gonna be 50 million pounds of
depots coming from Santa Barbara and from
[SPEAKER_00]: Salinas and all those wholesalers and box
buyers are already down there waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had people turning down stuff for
780 a pound because they know it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be 600 for A grades.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those people down there have now put
the time into their filtration systems and
[SPEAKER_00]: into their greenhouses and into their
above ground soil mixtures.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not gonna have the pesticide
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's gonna be a giant amount of
depots coming out that are so huge that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna watch, whoever's got flowers
right now, you're gonna be crushed if you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't move that out in the next few weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be 3, 400 a pound because
there's so much coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have that challenge because we
can't go out of this state with a
[SPEAKER_00]: breadbasket of this country.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis flourishes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to grow too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've already done that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no matter what Flow Cannon wants to do
and help, they can only help so many
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got 5,000 farmers in this
county, if they got 1,000 farmers,
[SPEAKER_00]: they'd overwhelm them, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: The same with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really, it's still, at the Emerald
Cup, you had 600 entries last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like it always was.
[SPEAKER_00]: The top 10 or 20% are fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: The rest are B grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, most people in the
Triangle think they grow A grade,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they're growing B grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until you really get into those
regenerative farming practices and you get
[SPEAKER_00]: a high grade soil system and you really
know how to grow a fine flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gonna be a real challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole thing coming in with
the depots this year, the markets that are
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in, what's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, like I said, we're not trying to
start really large because we have four of
[SPEAKER_00]: our own permitted farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our potential new distributor has a
million pounds of trim under contract
[SPEAKER_00]: that's permitted right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about needing 30,000
pounds of shake to run our CO2 machines
[SPEAKER_00]: for the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, oh, by the way, I got a
million pounds of contracted trim that I
[SPEAKER_00]: can give you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the size and scope that's gonna
come at people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just like everything else,
we're gonna find the finest products
[SPEAKER_00]: because when it's powered by Emerald Cup
oils, if somebody uses an oil and does a
[SPEAKER_00]: white label, we do a product with them and
it goes out and says powered by Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: Cup oil, we wanna make sure that that's
really, it's noticeable, even down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you really notice that high,
that subtlety, and it used to be everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: hit all the low grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Into the edibles or into places they
wouldn't get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But whether it's a tincture or an edible
or whatever else, you're really gonna want
[SPEAKER_00]: really fine material because people are
gonna know the subtleties in the high.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the way down the board,
it's gonna be high grade materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not looking to do that much,
but we are looking for some key people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a few people around that do some
really incredible cultivation and creation
[SPEAKER_00]: of flowers and stuff and products too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're open to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: My business director, Director of
Business, John Bekehling back there,
[SPEAKER_00]: he's the one who drugged me out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We formed about 11 companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he runs most of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can talk to him or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're open to doing partnerships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Flo Canna, hopefully they can help you
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a great company.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim Blake and Amanda Ryman.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy 420.
[SPEAKER_03]: Happy 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy 420.
