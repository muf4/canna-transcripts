[SPEAKER_01]: There's people now that are really
starting to do great things with
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they've been doing great things
with hydrocarbons, but now they've really
[SPEAKER_01]: learned how to refine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen a few people actually
pulling really strong terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_01]: from hydrocarbon extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorless, like colorless terpene profiles
with colorless oil, like using
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really good flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: For terpenes, I was really impressed with
Dr. Jack Hughes on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's really spent a lot of time preserving
terpenes and distilling terpenes out of
[SPEAKER_01]: crude extracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keeping good profiles, he's just put
so much time into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We met him.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was one of the first trade shows we
did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually just found this business card.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw him at Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegas as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we saw him at HempCon in San
Bernardino.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was in the Jetty extracts booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that was him.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I can't believe that I knew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just realized it the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, the cool thing is we've
watched a whole bunch of people level up
[SPEAKER_00]: over the course of the last five years on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many people have gone to a new level of
their understanding of how they want to
[SPEAKER_00]: interact with the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people have their own little
bubbles, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They find their niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they find their niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they find their niche.
And they find their niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they find their niche.
