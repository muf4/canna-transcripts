[SPEAKER_06]: in three two one we are live okay thank
you for joining us everyone we have here
[SPEAKER_06]: we go Kevin Jodri is entering the room
Chris Anderson is entering the room and
[SPEAKER_06]: that is me Peter Saveri so Jason what we
were talking about earlier is kind of like
[SPEAKER_06]: can you talk about the evolution of kind
of your grows and your grows style from
[SPEAKER_06]: like when you first started growing I
assume it was not at a commercial legal
[SPEAKER_06]: commercial scale so was it was it in the
garage was it outdoors was it up in the
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt area was it oh it was definitely
outdoors it was in the mountains you know
[SPEAKER_02]: we back then called them Grilla Grows you
know we you'd hike bags of dirt chicken
[SPEAKER_02]: shit whatnot up and down mountains and you
know hide them as good as we could and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know it was like that for for years and
then eventually we we started moving
[SPEAKER_02]: indoors I mean the evolution is kind of
started at a slower speed and has just
[SPEAKER_02]: sped up to a whole different world now I
mean it blows my mind to see everything
[SPEAKER_02]: that's going on yeah I you know I was
really young I was I started working you
[SPEAKER_02]: know it'd still be growing I'd be growing
Grilla Grows with my dad and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: patches out in the middle of nowhere and
you know doing construction with him for a
[SPEAKER_02]: little while and then eventually moved on
to just working big indoor scenes and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know learned how to grow both ways you
know the technology wasn't there so you
[SPEAKER_02]: know we weren't doing testing and we
didn't know near the science we just you
[SPEAKER_02]: know we were taught from our parents and
we knew how to grew you know we knew how
[SPEAKER_02]: to grow the plant and you know funny have
Kevin here because I mean the guy his
[SPEAKER_02]: brain works different he knows so much
more on on this and you know all the
[SPEAKER_02]: descriptions of living organisms and all
that but yeah we could sit there and I
[SPEAKER_02]: could tell how to if a plant has told me
how it looks you know I just always kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of fed it the same I've evolved would have
fed it but I know how to grow a plant I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't really know how to describe it but
I'm not intuitive intuitive yes you
[SPEAKER_06]: basically learned with your dad right and
and was this in like the 80s the I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't look that old um well I'm 40 you
know I remember growing nine years yeah I
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely remember you know starting to
work with him when I was around you know
[SPEAKER_02]: eight probably you know I was probably
picking leaves when I was about six you
[SPEAKER_02]: know so I was yeah I was really young and
you know it was a whole different world we
[SPEAKER_02]: were super freaked out just because you
know we did have camp flying over our
[SPEAKER_02]: house multiple times and landing at our
house coming in our house we dealt with
[SPEAKER_02]: all of that I've already you know told
these stories a lot and you know it's kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of I really love to talk about it as much
anymore is good to let the story out at
[SPEAKER_02]: first and now now we're kind of past that
we've you know we went from doing these
[SPEAKER_02]: you know just just back down like I said
we grow you know 10 to 20 pounds and sell
[SPEAKER_02]: it for four to five thousand dollars and
you know we were really really we were a
[SPEAKER_02]: real poor family back then but our life
was just great so if we didn't need
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of pounds we just we needed just
just what we could live on it was a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: different type of growing wasn't you talk
a little bit about what you were growing
[SPEAKER_01]: back then what types of cultivars and
strains and how that's evolved oh my gosh
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean POT we call it you know we grew pot
we grew seaweed we had we had seeds from
[SPEAKER_02]: friends every neighbors we all traded
seeds it wasn't there wasn't so many
[SPEAKER_02]: strains I mean and as we know a lot of
these strains have there's been one strain
[SPEAKER_02]: you know crossed a thousand times now
there's just so many strains it's crazy to
[SPEAKER_02]: watch happen even when I was in my teens
growing you know indoors there was still
[SPEAKER_02]: probably four or five strains and you know
that that's evolved just it's amazing to
[SPEAKER_02]: watch it and it's it's exciting honestly I
mean for me I love the plant I love
[SPEAKER_02]: growing right now I'm growing seven
strains and six green or seven strains and
[SPEAKER_02]: six greenhouses that have actually never
even grown before I've ten strains six
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses and seven of them I don't even
know exactly what they're gonna do I've
[SPEAKER_02]: seen the final product through other
people but you know it's really exciting
[SPEAKER_02]: to see because they're just amazing you
know there's these people out here that
[SPEAKER_02]: what are they called Kevin just the
genetic the people are you know all these
[SPEAKER_02]: there's lots of people like you know I'm
growing stuff from let's say sea junkie
[SPEAKER_02]: right now and lemonade and you know
there's all these they're incredible there
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know so you know the evolution of
the strains changing it's just crazy to me
[SPEAKER_01]: it's how do you decide what you're gonna
grow do you take what's available are you
[SPEAKER_01]: making proactive choices like this year
well let's say this year I mean I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: sticking with stuff that I know people
will like I mean the Green Lanterns seem
[SPEAKER_02]: to do really good it's a very very potent
strain seems to be this day and age people
[SPEAKER_02]: really like high THC that's like what
they're going for they want to see these
[SPEAKER_02]: numbers from 25 no personally it's not
what I love but that's what they really
[SPEAKER_02]: like out there Green Lantern is a very
special strain because it floors you it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't have tons of flavor it's gassy and
grown and cured perfectly because it does
[SPEAKER_02]: have like you know is about half OG in it
but uh these other strains you know let's
[SPEAKER_02]: say like runs it's a very popular strain
but it's taste amazing and I mean when I
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke it has lots of like the purple
oracle flavor that was one of my favorites
[SPEAKER_02]: and back in the day um what's the cherry
what's the cherry one Kevin could you add
[SPEAKER_02]: on there what's that do like a cherry pie
yeah the cherry pie the cherry pie is in
[SPEAKER_02]: lots of these and that was one of my and I
really liked you know so I'm kind of going
[SPEAKER_02]: with I always will grow an OG because I
love the gassy OGs I love the just the
[SPEAKER_02]: dominant indica it's it's I say OG is
queen I mean that's what you say it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: it's always people always love OG I love
OG but I do love flavors I have this um so
[SPEAKER_02]: hum citrus I'm growing and it tastes like
an orange it's a very citrusy flavor I did
[SPEAKER_02]: notice you know let's say an emerald cup
last year a lot of the flavors that top
[SPEAKER_02]: you know that were up there the the top
were were more exotics and you know so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's it's weird certain places I mean as
we know it we know East Coast loves the
[SPEAKER_02]: gassy flavors they love the sour diesel
they love the OGs I mean I mean that's
[SPEAKER_02]: just coming from a person that produces
marijuana you just know where it goes and
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what they love but it seems like
it's turning into more of an exotic type
[SPEAKER_02]: of of like out there and a high THC so
between both of those you know I look and
[SPEAKER_02]: see what the public really likes what I
what I like you know just kind of roll the
[SPEAKER_02]: dice on a lot of it and hope that it you
know I don't know you kind of learn a
[SPEAKER_02]: strain I could tell OG exactly when I flip
it how big it's gonna get I know what to
[SPEAKER_02]: feed it I know everything about it so when
you pick a new strain it's a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: different thing you have to pick you know
you don't know when you flip it if it's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna let's say skittles one year grew
that I flipped it it grew one inch and
[SPEAKER_02]: then started budding they were tiny you
know let's say the run you flip it ill
[SPEAKER_02]: grow it'll double its size so you kind of
have to learn strains it is risky to
[SPEAKER_02]: switch and grow a bunch of different
strains but I really like the variety I
[SPEAKER_02]: like having I know I'm growing great
strains because like I said the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that maybe genetics I mean they're
crushing it and so I'm not really worried
[SPEAKER_02]: about being good I know I could do the
quality I mean that part I'm not super
[SPEAKER_02]: worried about either so you put that
together and it should be fun and it makes
[SPEAKER_02]: it way more interesting than growing all
OG I did that for last but not last few of
[SPEAKER_02]: you before probably four or five years in
a row just all OG because that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: people wanted cool beautiful plants love
it but you know we need more we need like
[SPEAKER_02]: you say abolition we need to evolve for me
I've been growing weed like I said it's
[SPEAKER_02]: really like really grown weed since I was
probably about 12 and so the excitement in
[SPEAKER_02]: it for me is definitely seeing new strains
growing new strains and getting the
[SPEAKER_02]: feedback from the consumers and I mean
that's what it's about that's really what
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping to talk about a lot on this
is we really need to educate the consumers
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's that's you know that comes from
you know the the dispensaries Chris for
[SPEAKER_02]: Edward roots you know people going out
there and getting our herb out there
[SPEAKER_02]: telling our stories knowing where the herb
that they are buying comes from where that
[SPEAKER_02]: money that you know who they're supporting
what they're putting in their bodies you
[SPEAKER_02]: know all of that comes back to educating
the consumer and if we all work together
[SPEAKER_02]: like podcasts like this you know and get
the word out and let them know you know
[SPEAKER_02]: they buy it from a family-run farm our you
know we support a small community
[SPEAKER_02]: basically they help support a whole
village and I mean that's really what's
[SPEAKER_02]: happening you know and that's what keeps
our little town going yeah I I think I
[SPEAKER_06]: mean you're talking about education and I
think it's interesting that you you do
[SPEAKER_06]: have to balance kind of growing hype
strains versus maybe stuff that you and
[SPEAKER_06]: your dad grew or your neighbors grew that
you really loved but doesn't have the
[SPEAKER_06]: height like like when Chris has to go down
you Chris were you just down in LA think
[SPEAKER_03]: he's on the 405 right now I'm actually I
just hit the valley down on the five I
[SPEAKER_06]: just came down the grapevine into the
valley you're in the you're in SoCal right
[SPEAKER_06]: now so like in terms of when you're
interacting with shops and bud tenders and
[SPEAKER_06]: owners and purchasing decision makers you
know telling the story of something that's
[SPEAKER_06]: not a hype strain but that Jason has been
growing or any of your other farms have
[SPEAKER_06]: been growing for decades and is you think
is amazing but the kind of general public
[SPEAKER_06]: is like that's not the hype strain that
I'm looking for they just haven't smoked
[SPEAKER_03]: it yet but yeah I'm actually not currently
our major focus is on moving a lot of bulk
[SPEAKER_03]: product we are not servicing a whole lot
of dispensaries at this point in time
[SPEAKER_03]: we've kind of regrouped and honed in our
whole strategy on distribution to instead
[SPEAKER_03]: of why we had a vision of covering all the
bases and full vertical integration and
[SPEAKER_03]: all the whole nine yards and I still feel
like that is something that's out in the
[SPEAKER_03]: future potentially however we've we've
really honed our whole process and
[SPEAKER_03]: business and financial model into first
mile distribution and procurement and and
[SPEAKER_03]: delivering that product to other brands
and distributors across the state more
[SPEAKER_03]: more so than retail at this point we are
redirecting a whole lot of our energy here
[SPEAKER_03]: in the next two three four five six months
back to the brand and retail and and
[SPEAKER_03]: getting shelf space and and having those
conversations with bud tenders and buyers
[SPEAKER_03]: and and and that education that Jason
speaks of is is absolutely uber important
[SPEAKER_03]: but how do you get the mass consumer base
to swap up the fluff and the vapor of all
[SPEAKER_03]: these designer strains which are chronic
crucial I like smoking all of them too for
[SPEAKER_03]: sure I just like POT hot what's wrong with
that you know whatever happened to the pot
[SPEAKER_03]: strain I love the evolution I love all the
genetics the evolution to me is is is more
[SPEAKER_03]: based on medicine and the evolution of
genetics and and breeding and and the
[SPEAKER_03]: unknown medicines that can be unlocked in
that evolution is is super crucial of
[SPEAKER_03]: course we all like the flavors and the
high and and the terpene profiles and all
[SPEAKER_03]: that stuff we're you know I think most you
know we all we all enjoy all of that stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: however I just see the evolution of
cannabis and the medicine part is what
[SPEAKER_03]: gets me really excited and I'm obviously
not a doctor or a scientist but there are
[SPEAKER_03]: doctors and scientists out there pushing
the envelope and you know so that that's
[SPEAKER_06]: exciting to me so I I want to do we got
what I like about this is we have plenty
[SPEAKER_06]: of time to dive into some of these topics
so I don't have to gloss over them but uh
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to get into kind of the evolution
of each of your like the many pivots and
[SPEAKER_06]: twists and turns you've taken and kind of
your current line of thinking but let's
[SPEAKER_06]: stick let's stick with kind of cultivation
and stuff like that um Jason give me an
[SPEAKER_06]: example of something that you like to
smoke um that you don't see out on the
[SPEAKER_06]: market or think that people necessarily
appreciate um what's it and Chris or Kevin
[SPEAKER_02]: or well my dad my dad has this seed strain
he's been working on for a while it's
[SPEAKER_02]: called Supergirl and I mean it it's it's
amazing it's completely pretty much done
[SPEAKER_02]: by September I mean buds are giant which
you know when you bring a bud you know
[SPEAKER_02]: this big and it dries this big it's people
don't love it in a bag it's you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: bag of peels not crazy but it the high is
amazing it's you know I mean I still have
[SPEAKER_02]: when my dad shows me his weed and I look
at it and oh yeah you know I I know
[SPEAKER_02]: personally on the market it's not this
purple nug that looks like it's dipped in
[SPEAKER_02]: sugar but it's amazing you smoke it and
it's like you know I mean what he grows 15
[SPEAKER_02]: plants you know and he puts so much time
and love into them you smoke it and you
[SPEAKER_02]: could just taste it it doesn't hurt your
throat the high is amazing it's clear and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know it's great I mean so when it
basically it comes down to it's you know
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like you say the hype a lot of that
weed is amazing like I said I do I love
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking runts I mean it's tastes really
good um ice cream cake I mean who who
[SPEAKER_02]: could say it's the most beautiful looking
plant I mean it's purple it's amazing but
[SPEAKER_02]: it tastes okay you get a little flavor
then it's gone the high is okay but yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: you know my dad has some seeds that you
know when we pop them and we actually
[SPEAKER_02]: grows a few plants so I'll rather smoke
some of that than some of these other
[SPEAKER_02]: strains because it just tastes great looks
not quite there but yeah it's called super
[SPEAKER_06]: girl maybe one day we'll have to bring it
out talk about your your because when we
[SPEAKER_06]: were talking before you were talking about
playing with some new products and and
[SPEAKER_06]: specifically roots organic and so can you
talk about your setup like you said you
[SPEAKER_06]: have seven greenhouses are you in pots are
you in raised beds are you talking I'm in
[SPEAKER_02]: raised beds I mean I love growing
organically I have changed so many times
[SPEAKER_02]: and anyone around here that says they've
only grown organic is pretty much full of
[SPEAKER_02]: crap I mean when we were younger we didn't
know shit you know we I put Osmocote on
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottom of a thing the ground in the
middle of nowhere with drip lines I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: know I use Bromore you know we used to
literally dip our hands in Avid like we
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't know any of this stuff when we were
younger and so I went through the
[SPEAKER_02]: evolution of just using whatever I was
taught for years GHP you know a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: different stuff I mean it wasn't good I'm
not gonna yeah but when you don't know any
[SPEAKER_02]: of this near younger you're just trying to
produce and get a certain amount of yield
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know for your boss and make
everyone happy you're just listening to
[SPEAKER_02]: people that's what you do as you learned
you know and I mean obviously my dad was
[SPEAKER_02]: happy with any of that that's for damn
sure but uh as as we evolved you know I
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely started going back into I've
always the raised beds or pots you know I
[SPEAKER_02]: have planted you know all your holes right
into the ground but you know we were just
[SPEAKER_02]: used you know the usual the worm the
chicken shit you know the basics um lots
[SPEAKER_02]: of bat and stuff like that and you know
you know what I'll tell you right now is
[SPEAKER_02]: if you say you know everything and growing
then you know then you're never gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: you're never gonna you aren't gonna move
on you're gonna get better at what you do
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've always listened I learned and I
take advice from other people and in this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry it changes so much um growing
that the knowledge has changed so much and
[SPEAKER_02]: this year what I'm doing you know last
year tried certain things you know and and
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked it it worked out good but I have
some friends that you know we were
[SPEAKER_06]: childhood friends pretty much baby just
quickly can you talk about some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things you tried last year and kind of
what I use lots of mocha I use Dr. Earth
[SPEAKER_02]: and chicken shit and bone meal and I'm
saying into my dirt I mend my beds really
[SPEAKER_02]: tough with all kinds of great nutrients so
my beds have enough stuff and I'm at first
[SPEAKER_02]: work honestly I probably barely need to
feed it but then I start powering on all
[SPEAKER_02]: kinds of organics you know last year I did
try some new stuff with green grow and
[SPEAKER_02]: tried some of their products I had a I got
really lucky I had a really good friend I
[SPEAKER_02]: fished with or have a good friend I fished
with that that is a tea guru and last year
[SPEAKER_02]: is my first year to really learn how to do
tea which I still don't know shit honestly
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not number 10 like I do but I know
what to put in because what he told me
[SPEAKER_02]: because I listen but I know what to put in
you know and these tea and I brew tea for
[SPEAKER_06]: the whole run and so talk about kind of
some of the things he tried to drill into
[SPEAKER_02]: your head well it's not drilling into my
head it's basically how long you brew key
[SPEAKER_02]: it's what you put in the tea everything
you put in takes some 24 hours some 32
[SPEAKER_02]: hours I mean it goes on and on it's the
amount I mean people write there's tons of
[SPEAKER_02]: books on this that probably I mean I'm
just saying it's evolving there's too much
[SPEAKER_02]: for me to learn in a year so he he gave me
his recipe and that was mostly for the
[SPEAKER_02]: growth stage so I use that my plants grew
they look like celery they grew so fast my
[SPEAKER_02]: starts that were in five inch pots were I
mean it was like I mean they grew like
[SPEAKER_02]: bean poles I've never seen nothing like it
I was really excited and then when it came
[SPEAKER_02]: to the bloom stage he didn't really give
me any that so then I had to start digging
[SPEAKER_02]: I started going with some green grow I
started going some root stuff they have
[SPEAKER_02]: this turk teas and this bounty bounty
makes teas and so I started I mean you
[SPEAKER_02]: could go in the stores and you could buy
pre-made teas for a lot of money or you
[SPEAKER_02]: could buy just you know the right
ingredients I spent $200 and I still have
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff from that and at the end of last
year I could tell you right now my yields
[SPEAKER_02]: were down and my quality was up so I mean
you you could smoke and I was told this
[SPEAKER_02]: from a few of the judges you could smoke
the joint all the way down to the bottom
[SPEAKER_02]: of the roach and it still tasted good and
I I think that was from the tea honestly
[SPEAKER_02]: and so now this year what I was trying to
do is like I was saying with the roots is
[SPEAKER_02]: these are two really good longtime old
friends I've known them my whole life you
[SPEAKER_02]: know they're they're in Eugene Oregon
they're in a whole different area and I
[SPEAKER_02]: remember them coming here because they had
a grow store it was mostly like a fish
[SPEAKER_02]: store back then and so they came here
probably 12 to 15 years ago and they sat
[SPEAKER_02]: down and they were just tripping on all
the weed grown here and just how this you
[SPEAKER_02]: know our basically cannabis culture we
live in those we were thriving and they
[SPEAKER_02]: want you know they're excited about it and
so to me it was really special that we all
[SPEAKER_02]: went all the way around and we met right
here and I said let's work together why
[SPEAKER_02]: are we not working together and so one of
my best friends which he's like one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: main guys who produces their products he
is a genius he talks to me and I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: understand half the stuff he's saying but
he's basically helping me with this
[SPEAKER_02]: organic recipes and you know I'm using a
lot of their products this round and it is
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it's fun and for me it's a whole
new thing I have new strains I have new
[SPEAKER_02]: product and you know that's a lot when you
know what you do you know how to do it and
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I'd be fine doing what I've been
doing for the last 10 years you know when
[SPEAKER_02]: I say that because I've switched so many
times the last 10 years of just growing
[SPEAKER_02]: with you know the regular ingredients I
use it's a lot to really do that and trust
[SPEAKER_02]: and other people especially when I have so
many eyes on me to to grow really quality
[SPEAKER_02]: product so but anyways so now I'm doing a
whole new different feeding regimen I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: using the same dirt I'm adding a lot of
the same stuff to the dirt and I'm used to
[SPEAKER_02]: doing a lot of these a lot of new strains
and it's besides that you said intuition
[SPEAKER_02]: of knowing okay well my plant looks like
there's too much nitrogen in it you know I
[SPEAKER_02]: could I could tell that before I send off
to him to the lab because we never had
[SPEAKER_02]: tests we've never I've never tested my
weed once I never tested my dirt it's this
[SPEAKER_02]: it all just started happening now you know
we did test for THC we smoked the weed you
[SPEAKER_02]: got really high high THC you know it
wasn't it's just one of these things like
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from me and I mean I could see you
know Kevin and Chris it's like this is our
[SPEAKER_02]: life we've been doing this our whole life
so you know people were ahead of us on the
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor game like that you know co2 and
this and that we have co2 we had big old
[SPEAKER_02]: diamond lights you know we you know big
old bulbs and it didn't we're behind the
[SPEAKER_02]: technology but we all it's in our it's our
heritage it's what we've been doing we
[SPEAKER_02]: know how to grow weed we know the plant so
we don't even need all that technology you
[SPEAKER_02]: know so we could actually we're so lucky
that I could I could skip around and I
[SPEAKER_02]: could grow other food that I personally
know is good and do it in the same way
[SPEAKER_02]: that I've kind of been doing it and I have
a feeling it's a turnout good and I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: right now my crops look amazing I mean
I've stocks that are giant which sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes scare me because the giant stock
on a debt plant isn't always the biggest
[SPEAKER_02]: bud but right now it's starting to stack
and everything is looking really really
[SPEAKER_02]: good yeah it's just you know for me it's
exciting I need some more excitement you
[SPEAKER_02]: know and you know winning cups and all
that that's definitely fired me up having
[SPEAKER_02]: you know one of my best friends in the
world Chris watching him his business
[SPEAKER_02]: thrive watching so many of my really close
friends take this this journey we're on
[SPEAKER_02]: right now and run with it you know because
you know it wasn't really it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: half-half split around here probably even
less probably a 30-70 of people that went
[SPEAKER_02]: the way that we went and you know really
it was a pretty scary scary move that we
[SPEAKER_02]: did you know go from outlaws to you know
be out in the public and be on the New
[SPEAKER_02]: Yorker and give interviews and you know
tell your life I mean definitely wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: easy so I'm saying all of this type of
stuff is what is getting me excited and
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping me going and this this way I mean
I I love the plant I love growing I'm a
[SPEAKER_02]: very small-scale farmers still and that's
fine with me you know I mean I'd rather do
[SPEAKER_02]: quality over quantity any day of the week
you know all day all day okay so you have
[SPEAKER_01]: a big old filing cabinet behind you is
that for all your paperwork you have to do
[SPEAKER_02]: now there's so much paperwork it's yeah
that part of the game now you're gonna bum
[SPEAKER_02]: me out see now you're not part of the
conversation I hate that part of the game
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah that's literally I leave metric I
wanted to hire someone but my wife wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: to take that on well it's not the best
thing for a relationship is metric I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you right now but uh yeah the county
the paperwork we had a hard three years
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know right now we're still
battling and I mean I have stuff with the
[SPEAKER_02]: county that I've been working on for three
years straight the easiest stuff you would
[SPEAKER_02]: think could be like let's just get it done
and it's just not done you know so yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: the paperwork is a nightmare but we're all
starting to settle in and figure out where
[SPEAKER_02]: we're at in this game and how you know how
it's gonna pan out and we know that hey we
[SPEAKER_02]: are essential right we know that I mean
it's amazing right now you know what's
[SPEAKER_02]: happening in this time and that people
love weed I mean it blows my mind right
[SPEAKER_02]: now seeing how much weed is out there and
the demand for our weed is just as high as
[SPEAKER_02]: ever you know and that's you know like
when I scroll through Instagram and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know I'm looking pretty much everything on
my Instagram is weed because you know
[SPEAKER_02]: that's who I follow and you'll come across
giant greenhouses that are you know I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know 10 I don't know what are they
20,000 square foot greenhouses maybe even
[SPEAKER_02]: bigger with just lights and this and that
I scroll right through that I don't even I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't care about that I look at like a
plant and some small farm and you see
[SPEAKER_02]: little veggies around and just a beautiful
bud and that's what I want to look at I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean the rest of it's just like rows of
weed I don't really I don't care they're
[SPEAKER_02]: probably feed it tons of salts and crap
and it just doesn't really mean anything
[SPEAKER_02]: to me and I know because I know what the
best and that's really what comes back to
[SPEAKER_02]: the consumers it's not fair a lot of them
don't know what is what they're smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: what they're putting in their body out
there you know are you doing what two
[SPEAKER_02]: turns a year or I do too I do too and a
lot of people you know that people come up
[SPEAKER_02]: here you could set these up you can put
lights you go all year round I'm like I
[SPEAKER_02]: need a break and I have kids I have a life
I want to go vacation I want to know
[SPEAKER_02]: life's fast you know I got a 16 year old
and 11 year old and yeah I don't need to
[SPEAKER_02]: go around all year this is this is plenty
I mean we've been doing it like all year
[SPEAKER_02]: our whole life I mean we grow indoor we
grow outdoor indoor outdoor outdoor so to
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to change get rid of the indoor
focus on you know growing beautiful full
[SPEAKER_02]: Sun and you know with our climate it's
just it's worked out great you know I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: you never know what the weather is going
to hear last year we probably could have
[SPEAKER_02]: done a third round it you know stayed
beautiful for longer but it's fine with me
[SPEAKER_02]: man it's it's plenty of weed and you
really have to put all your energy into it
[SPEAKER_02]: if you really want the product that I want
to give to the consumer I'm looking at the
[SPEAKER_06]: chat on YouTube and a Braff Zachlin said
I'd go as far as to say bag appeal is set
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis back with bullshit breeding goals
so Chris can you talk about like you know
[SPEAKER_06]: you're you're on Jason's farm a lot can
you talk about kind of I mean I know you
[SPEAKER_06]: you hung up the cleats as a grower so I
want to talk about nice so what do you
[SPEAKER_03]: what do you what are you running at home
right now then let's see I got one oh I've
[SPEAKER_03]: been playing with I got a bunch of
genetics that I actually like years ago
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I got a this crucial OG seed from
this dude up in Harris that brought OG up
[SPEAKER_03]: to so I'm like 25 years ago one of the
dudes there's like 10 people that claim
[SPEAKER_03]: they brought it up there whatever wherever
it came from I don't care I got it an OG
[SPEAKER_03]: seed that actually ended I planted it is a
bag seed and ended up being a male so I
[SPEAKER_03]: started pollinating all these different
genetics with that one male that I got so
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I've been pulling males out of
that to pollinate stuff every year but so
[SPEAKER_03]: there's it's six different six plants six
different strains they're all like crosses
[SPEAKER_03]: of this OG there's a I got a fruit loop
seed from Johnny Casali I got an XJ
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a milk and cookie seed that hi
Larry from LA gave me at a San Bernardino
[SPEAKER_03]: High Times Cup like four years ago there's
a train wrap purple oracle trainwreck
[SPEAKER_03]: cross that's stupid stupid stupid fire I'm
gonna start to trickle these out next year
[SPEAKER_03]: they're starting to stabilize finally so
should be some good stuff coming out but
[SPEAKER_03]: uh last year I grew my first 12 pounds
[SPEAKER_06]: you've watched him so what have you seen
with kind of the evolution of his journey
[SPEAKER_06]: whether it's cultivation style or running
a professional small operation or well I
[SPEAKER_03]: really really really am stoked he
transitioned over to teas I did I made
[SPEAKER_03]: that move myself uh seven or eight years
ago and then I haven't been growing much
[SPEAKER_03]: herb for the last few years but um it went
from spending however much money on
[SPEAKER_03]: plastic bottles for the full of fertilizer
to 50 pound bags of of amendment into a
[SPEAKER_03]: brew tank and the cost of goods dropped
tremendously terpene profiles shot out the
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking roof um so I'm a I'm a firm
believer in in in teas and I'm super
[SPEAKER_03]: stoked Jason has trans transitioned that
direction for sure um man I'm all over the
[SPEAKER_03]: place though I I unfortunately I would
like to spend more time with Jason on his
[SPEAKER_03]: farm but I mean I've been there three or
four times this year and and uh I what I
[SPEAKER_03]: can say is that his crop this year looks
phenomenal so whatever the hell he's doing
[SPEAKER_03]: this year is good so that that the roots
organic decision and and that relationship
[SPEAKER_03]: is has so far proven to be a good one um
and you know I really appreciate what you
[SPEAKER_03]: said Jason about the honesty of of where
we've came from in terms of our practices
[SPEAKER_03]: out there in the hills and all these
people up here up and so on and humbled
[SPEAKER_03]: and in the emerald triangle trying to be
all righteous about organic and stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: which we should be now at this point and
we should be pushing that and we should
[SPEAKER_03]: all be growing organic but anybody like
Jason said that claims that's what they've
[SPEAKER_03]: been doing for forever is is a bunch of
crap so we're all learning we're all
[SPEAKER_03]: evolving we're all trying to be better
people and do better things um we were
[SPEAKER_03]: young and dumb and trying to make a bunch
of money and it didn't you know that not
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody was that there's a lot of
conscious you know earth people up there
[SPEAKER_03]: that have always been that way and didn't
you know use blue juice grow more and
[SPEAKER_03]: spray out of it or and they didn't do that
but there's a big percentage of people up
[SPEAKER_03]: there that certainly did so I appreciate
the honesty and the candidness there and
[SPEAKER_03]: the the again we're we're we're here
staring our face ourselves in the mirror
[SPEAKER_03]: about our our prior lives and how we can
improve our current uh actions in this
[SPEAKER_03]: world Jason has kids you know he's gonna
leave this farm to his kids and so a piece
[SPEAKER_03]: of property is super important to him and
keeping it clean and and then like he also
[SPEAKER_03]: said that you know I believe the education
to consumers for sure some of it certainly
[SPEAKER_03]: should be pointed as Jason said towards
what what are you putting into your body
[SPEAKER_03]: and if consumers knew I ain't a lot of
them maybe they just don't care they're
[SPEAKER_03]: eating McDonald's anyway you know so maybe
the most consumers don't care but the ones
[SPEAKER_03]: that do we don't grow enough pot to feed
all the consumers anyway so let's find
[SPEAKER_03]: those consumers that do care because there
are enough of them that do care they just
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know where to find us yet they're
they're finding us slowly but surely but
[SPEAKER_03]: um so anyway uh Jason's farm is absolutely
beautiful it's been incredible watching
[SPEAKER_03]: the the evolution of him as a business man
and and a community leader and a farmer as
[SPEAKER_03]: well it's not just the cannabis evolution
we're like you know we're growing up and
[SPEAKER_03]: and dotting our eyes and crossing our t's
and and becoming real real life
[SPEAKER_03]: businessmen which is a cool thing too you
know we're stepping up to the plate as a
[SPEAKER_03]: community on that level so and Kevin's
certainly been leading that charge uh
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely no hot air there like you you
took it seriously to the professional
[SPEAKER_03]: level from the get-go on this 215 kicked I
kicked off and a large percentage of of
[SPEAKER_03]: the people I know weren't into that yet
and in fact believe I've always believed
[SPEAKER_03]: in the medicine but we're anti any kind of
regulation or legality so the fact that he
[SPEAKER_03]: he took the initiative and became a leader
in our community and in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: community and and uh has been driving a
major driving force and that is is super
[SPEAKER_03]: inspirational to me and and uh you know I
felt like I kind of stepped out of the
[SPEAKER_03]: closet pretty early and so on but Kevin
was in that shit 10 years before me so
[SPEAKER_03]: kudos to that for leading the charge and
kind of opening the door for the rest of
[SPEAKER_03]: us you know that lived that old life to be
comfortable more comfortable maybe not
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable but a little more comfortable
still me stepping into this new life um so
[SPEAKER_03]: it's it's an exciting time for for me and
for for us man I I really believe we made
[SPEAKER_03]: the right decision and decisions heading
this direction I just believe it with
[SPEAKER_03]: every fragment of my being and the
indicators currently are proving that to
[SPEAKER_06]: be so what when you say this direction do
you mean going into the into the legal
[SPEAKER_06]: market okay so yes sir so so given that
all three of you are long-term cultivators
[SPEAKER_06]: and operating in in the joyful California
legal cannabis system Chris you were when
[SPEAKER_06]: we started touching on business you were
talking about kind of the the wholesale or
[SPEAKER_06]: the bulk so can you talk about the
evolution of your vision from like because
[SPEAKER_06]: at one point you were growing and you
decided entering the legal market that did
[SPEAKER_06]: you were you growing when you first
entered the legal market um absolutely and
[SPEAKER_03]: what stopped me from cultivating is the
police coming to my farm no I I had a
[SPEAKER_03]: collective I had a patient base the
Mendocino County was dragging their feet
[SPEAKER_03]: getting their ordinance in place and so I
focused all my my energy on my commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: piece of property in Benbow and my
distribution retail manufacturing nursery
[SPEAKER_03]: permit permits that I filed with Humboldt
County for that piece of property and kept
[SPEAKER_03]: on cultivating because I had a patient
base and a collective and I was feeding
[SPEAKER_03]: patients medicine um Mendocino County then
finalized their ordinance and I didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have the bandwidth to do it all and I was
focused on the Benbow property and I
[SPEAKER_03]: really little I mean like four thousand
square feet little and I'm at the very
[SPEAKER_03]: very very very very very northern tip with
Mendocino County knowing what they would
[SPEAKER_03]: have to fly over and drive by to come to
my house where I live the house my
[SPEAKER_03]: grandparents built and they decided to
drive two and a half hours from Ukiah with
[SPEAKER_03]: 35 people to bust my four thousand square
foot farm driving by acres and acres and
[SPEAKER_03]: acres of illegal pot with no collective or
patient base so fuck you Mendocino County
[SPEAKER_03]: and fuck you fucking fishing game for
doing that what what year what year was
[SPEAKER_03]: that I don't even know three years ago or
something okay but like five years ago the
[SPEAKER_03]: reality is that I honed a skill in over
this fucking crazy life of finding the
[SPEAKER_03]: silver lining and the silver lining in
that was that I didn't go to jail and I
[SPEAKER_03]: focused 100 percent of my energy on my
commercial piece of property and Benbow
[SPEAKER_03]: and getting this distribution thing off
off the ground and if I wouldn't have done
[SPEAKER_03]: that I would still be spread out I would
still be all over the place I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: have focused I wouldn't have honed in on
something and so that was the beginning of
[SPEAKER_03]: the honing and the evolution and the or
the whatever you want to call it of from
[SPEAKER_03]: that period to now has been keeping my
ears wide open listening sponging watching
[SPEAKER_03]: not talking and seeing what all these
other entities were doing and the mistakes
[SPEAKER_03]: they were making and having conversations
more so for intelligence with really big
[SPEAKER_03]: investors and and listening to them and
and having them kind of guide and and say
[SPEAKER_03]: well wow maybe you should do this or maybe
you should do that or maybe you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: do all of that maybe you should do this
one thing and do it really well some
[SPEAKER_03]: investors conversations will know that's
the right thing to do you need 10 mil
[SPEAKER_03]: today you need 20 million that million
isn't enough you need 20 million right now
[SPEAKER_03]: let me force it down your face you need to
grow fast and all I gotta say to that is
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the wrong strategy and slow steady
and organic has proven to be the way for
[SPEAKER_03]: redwood roots I'm not saying that any
other way is right or wrong for anyone
[SPEAKER_03]: else but I know what's worked for us and
you know we still have our eyes on retail
[SPEAKER_03]: we still have our eyes on delivery we
still have our eyes on maybe nursery
[SPEAKER_03]: certainly have our eyes on processing as a
distribution company we know how crucial
[SPEAKER_03]: processing is any any and I saw that come
in two years ago I just haven't had the
[SPEAKER_03]: capital or the funding or the bandwidth to
get ahead of the game but I saw this
[SPEAKER_03]: second coming years ago I knew exactly
where this was going and but you know we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have to listen to anybody tell us
what to do or where to spend our money or
[SPEAKER_03]: how to grow we get to do that on our own
and at the same time as listen to what
[SPEAKER_03]: other people have to say and their
opinions of where we should go and what we
[SPEAKER_03]: should do but at the end of the day we get
to make our calls and make that decision
[SPEAKER_03]: for ourselves so sorry I'm kind of
rambling now but I like it hey Chris talk
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit more about the economics of
bulk versus branded or retail and what
[SPEAKER_03]: you're seeing out there bulk gets farmers
paid immediately if they're working with
[SPEAKER_03]: the right distributor ha some distributors
not so much so retail is brutal it is
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking brutal it's cutthroat it is people
are straight corporate American America
[SPEAKER_03]: modeling under pricing to get market share
and putting little guys trying to put
[SPEAKER_03]: little guys out selling eight dollar
fucking eights fuck you ain't the way to
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking play and just so we know like what
we're talking about how many farms are you
[SPEAKER_01]: like distributing for and getting their
product out there for probably this year
[SPEAKER_03]: we sold product from 120 farms the next
year I bet it'll be 240 and I assume you
[SPEAKER_06]: started with kind of the farms that were
all your friends like a Jason and you were
[SPEAKER_06]: fulfilling a need for him because what
I've seen and you know a lot of friends
[SPEAKER_06]: who are up in the hills or wherever it's
like you're at the total mercy of some
[SPEAKER_06]: distributor who just doesn't give a shit
about you who's then gonna take your
[SPEAKER_06]: product and bring it to a shop that
doesn't give a shit about you and you know
[SPEAKER_06]: you don't have the time to get off the
farm and so to have somebody who I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about the two of you who you've
known for a long time who you trust who's
[SPEAKER_06]: out there trying to do right by you must
be I mean Jason that must be a godsend to
[SPEAKER_06]: have Chris is someone you deal with rather
than you know random distributors
[SPEAKER_02]: cold-calling you and wanting to strike
deals I mean 100% it's like you said I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean the wholesale market is easy you know
it's easy to get paid but you know we
[SPEAKER_02]: really I got really lucky you know
obviously to get my name out the way I did
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it started with Kevin at the Golden
Tarps 2017 you know I got the win there
[SPEAKER_02]: with the Green Lantern and it started
rolling from there so yeah the wholesale
[SPEAKER_02]: works for anyone and it's quick it's you
know you sell your weed you get some
[SPEAKER_02]: so-and-so they get to claim your wonderful
grown herb and put on the shelf is theirs
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know that's that's great I mean
you get paid and you know your family gets
[SPEAKER_02]: gets the eat and it all works but it's
really about making the right decisions
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's when you don't know what you're
doing you know I don't really want to put
[SPEAKER_02]: out too many names out there but it's like
when I first won the cup and I went with
[SPEAKER_02]: you know well Connor let's just say you
know I don't have much bad to say about
[SPEAKER_02]: him but I didn't really know you know I've
Chris my best friend you know he's doing
[SPEAKER_02]: his thing and I was so excited you know I
was like oh my god maybe I could get out
[SPEAKER_02]: there this is really happening I didn't
know what route to go I was more acting on
[SPEAKER_02]: excitement and and you know so I had to
learn right and you know I did a little
[SPEAKER_02]: thing with them and honestly it was great
they did me right but I wasn't feeling it
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't feel it my soul I didn't feel my
heart didn't really make me feel great
[SPEAKER_02]: what made me feel good was showing up the
Emerald Cup this year with a bunch of my
[SPEAKER_02]: best friends that I personally know are
amazing farmers and what they do is real
[SPEAKER_02]: and who they are is real and the product
they produce is is the best that I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: that's to my soul right there I already
won our booth was fucking amazing we had
[SPEAKER_02]: the best group of people and so yeah I
mean how happens so I mean doing this
[SPEAKER_02]: journey with Chris we both talked we both
when this all started unrolling you know
[SPEAKER_02]: one of my things I was tripping out
Michael I've been growing weed my whole
[SPEAKER_02]: life my dad was growing weed his whole
life I mean this is this is our life this
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't we aren't just jumping in we aren't
2017 we started whoa weed this is our life
[SPEAKER_02]: and I started feeling like oh my gosh this
ball is rolling what's happening we're
[SPEAKER_02]: just gonna all get pushed out of our
fucking heritage it's gone you know and
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was scary but I knew there was
something deeper I remember one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: first days sitting around when Chris was
coming up with this redwood roots and we
[SPEAKER_02]: were all deciding if we were gonna sign
like basically these affidavits with the
[SPEAKER_02]: county and a lot of people said if we sign
this or that we're gonna get fucking we're
[SPEAKER_02]: emitting everything and we're gonna
probably get audited and go to jail you
[SPEAKER_02]: know and we didn't know what the hell was
going on so basically you know going
[SPEAKER_02]: through this journey and having friends
like Chris to be able to soul in and talk
[SPEAKER_02]: and and then obviously work with is a
blessing I mean without them I'd feel
[SPEAKER_02]: alone and no like I said I have a lot of
friends that feel different about all this
[SPEAKER_02]: you know they went the whole other route
and you know I still hope the best for
[SPEAKER_02]: them you know I don't I don't ever want to
see somebody go to jail for marijuana ever
[SPEAKER_02]: and I hope everybody stay an outlaw you do
fine it's nothing wrong with that I feel
[SPEAKER_02]: for me the position I'm in I feel like I
was meant to be in this position I feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like Chris was meant to be in this
position and there's a lot of other people
[SPEAKER_02]: in our that were meant to be in this
position you know I'm excited to work with
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris I went he basically watching him
like you know we were I was still growing
[SPEAKER_02]: weed I was still making money I was
surviving I mean I watched him give up
[SPEAKER_02]: everything and basically go deep deep in
the hole and work his ass off and had so
[SPEAKER_02]: many people not believe what he was gonna
do was gonna really work out and I did
[SPEAKER_02]: believe it I fucking knew he was gonna do
it because you hear him talk it's like you
[SPEAKER_02]: have that passion that drive you know that
will to not give up you're gonna win
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna make it and so I'm not
surprised how you know where he is and
[SPEAKER_02]: what he's doing and I'm so fucking happy
he is where he is because he is helping
[SPEAKER_02]: out so many farmers so many families and I
mean we're talking people that were
[SPEAKER_02]: there's so many people that were at these
big corporations like you said they got
[SPEAKER_02]: handed millions of dollars and oh my god
it's great well who are they calling now
[SPEAKER_02]: my boy you know they're calling him up you
know come help us out and I guarantee you
[SPEAKER_02]: know getting paid from a community a small
business a family-run business it feels so
[SPEAKER_02]: much better than getting a check from some
big corporation it really does and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know it's like I said it's hard I still am
I still have things going on here and
[SPEAKER_02]: there where it's like is this the right
decision or that the right decision
[SPEAKER_02]: because I do want to stay relevant you
know I do want to be out there and have my
[SPEAKER_02]: name out there and you know there's a lot
of these big companies that will help that
[SPEAKER_02]: happen but the same time you have to kind
of work with with you know what what your
[SPEAKER_02]: heart and soul but what you feel good
about you know I mean I'm I'm 40 I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: growing weed my whole life and I've been
blessed you know you're doing a job with
[SPEAKER_02]: something you enjoy your whole life I mean
what more could ask so at this point I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: just gonna keep you know trying to you
know I'm not I have relationships also
[SPEAKER_02]: with Humboldt brand you know there's
another group there's another small
[SPEAKER_02]: business you know it's like staying local
keep it spreading my love out there spread
[SPEAKER_02]: you know giving weed to this person that
person is great and I mean Chris kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: went more to the wholesale thing which I
wanted to do some of but to keep the
[SPEAKER_02]: Ridgeline name out there and keep it
growing I need to be on shelves and I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you like he said it is a cutthroat
game it costs so much money I'm finally
[SPEAKER_02]: getting my first jars out this next month
and it's been like a year and a half
[SPEAKER_06]: thousand dollars so so you were you you
were just bringing your brand to market no
[SPEAKER_02]: no well my brand I've been co-branding
with everyone you know you have Ridgeline
[SPEAKER_02]: with all kinds of people but actually make
some of my own jars which I'm still I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna do these jars oh man they are
beautiful but you have one I'll grab on
[SPEAKER_02]: here in a minute I'll show you but I'm
gonna actually get to drop this special
[SPEAKER_02]: jar with my buddy Chris and we're gonna do
that probably next month and so to be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to you know because I could still make it
but he has the connections and he's doing
[SPEAKER_02]: the legwork and so you know for me to be
able to grow the weed put it in the jars
[SPEAKER_02]: that I designed give it to one of my best
friends and he gets to go out and
[SPEAKER_02]: distribute it to people and make people
happy and I mean it's just it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: beautiful thing so how many pounds are you
produced do you think you'll produce this
[SPEAKER_02]: year um you know I like to say I like to
tell you right now whenever anyone looks
[SPEAKER_02]: at my greenhouse and says man that you're
gonna kill it how much is that you know I
[SPEAKER_02]: do not project I know the average I mean
let's just say a thousand somewhere in
[SPEAKER_02]: there but you'd never know growing weed
you can look at my stuff right now it's
[SPEAKER_02]: the most beautiful greenhouses but the
growing parts easy part once those buds
[SPEAKER_03]: start growing once they start swelling how
does Aurora greenhouse projections going
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah exactly all of a sudden there's all
of a sudden there's a fucking storm hits
[SPEAKER_02]: like let's say last year all of a sudden
there's a storm oh shit beautiful buds
[SPEAKER_02]: start molding or all of a sudden you have
aphids or russet mites or you know we as
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers we're dealing with all kinds of
shit that nobody out there knows oh your
[SPEAKER_02]: weeds good your weeds bad they don't
realize that there is tons with all these
[SPEAKER_02]: new strains we're getting these strains
from different parts of the state come new
[SPEAKER_02]: bugs new diseases and they fucking will
they'll hammer you you know I just had a
[SPEAKER_02]: very close friend lose three beautiful
greenhouses had to throw them all out for
[SPEAKER_02]: for Syrian will I mean this is we're
talking a silent killer this is a score
[SPEAKER_02]: you can't see this is I mean this is a
basically a corona of of weed but exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: right there you know what I'm saying so we
go through a lot of shit as farmers when
[SPEAKER_02]: you want to I would hope I hope to get you
know average out of an 80 footer I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: you always want to get a pound a foot you
want to get 80 pounds I like to get 140
[SPEAKER_02]: shall a greenhouse you know I mean the max
I usually do in a 20 by 80 is around 137
[SPEAKER_02]: to 140 so I mean that's kind of you know I
know my max I know what I want but you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't it's it's not about what you want in
this game you just got it you got it we
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't working indoors we aren't working
with you know co2s and air conditioners
[SPEAKER_02]: we're working with the climate or you know
we're working with we're outside there is
[SPEAKER_02]: there's all kinds of stuff outside to ruin
a farmer quick so we just have to knock on
[SPEAKER_02]: wood do our best and grow the best weed we
can and I mean I you know I think as of
[SPEAKER_02]: right now it's looking good and that's you
know now I'm just waiting to these buds
[SPEAKER_02]: keep swelling and hope all these fucking
weird genetics I'm running turned into
[SPEAKER_02]: some big old buds and not some killer
little purple dime-sized no you never know
[SPEAKER_06]: never know so so of what you'll harvest
this year what percentage of it do you
[SPEAKER_06]: think will go into your your branded
product versus bulk wholesale I mean I
[SPEAKER_02]: damn definitely I like to make a lead put
at least half of it you know yeah I like I
[SPEAKER_02]: like half of it you know at least and you
know it's stuff like I don't know I mean I
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely look at what looks the best I
mean I want the best I want somebody to
[SPEAKER_02]: open up my jar and look at that bud and be
like wow that is a beautiful weed you know
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I literally I'll never forget when
I when that first big drop happened and I
[SPEAKER_02]: had these people waiting for some of my
weed forever writing me on Instagram and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was in those flocon jars and then he
sent me this picture he opened it up and
[SPEAKER_02]: these little shitty nurdles of weed were
in this hand and I was just I wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: drive to him and hand him a bag of weed
like so basically I want I want the best
[SPEAKER_06]: if my half-ass looking so what's funny is
someone on the chat said I tried flow kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of once blueberry muffins from Bryceline
and it smoked like it was stored in a car
[SPEAKER_02]: for a year I don't know to say about that
because they do grow some good herb but
[SPEAKER_02]: you know if you over buy your herb and it
don't go out the door and it's in a little
[SPEAKER_02]: jar for a long fucking time well it
probably excuse me a daughter in there and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm cussing away but yeah I should get
here good yeah I know I mean you know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: it's kind of that comes out also to the
distributor you know you hope a
[SPEAKER_02]: distributor is gonna put a beautiful nug
in a jar and not put some just crappy
[SPEAKER_02]: little buds in a jar because these
consumers are paying a lot of money and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell you right now that money is not
barely any of it's going to us okay you
[SPEAKER_02]: know if there's so many middlemen you know
the state there's so many middlemen that
[SPEAKER_02]: you know there I feel for how much the
consumers have to pay for a quality
[SPEAKER_02]: product it's not fair and it's not the
growers reaping most of those benefits not
[SPEAKER_06]: even probably 10% of it honestly Chris
you're primarily focused on bulk now so
[SPEAKER_06]: are you gonna be bringing Jason's product
to this hit his brand his CPG brand
[SPEAKER_06]: product to market or are you gonna stay
focused on bolt like are you gonna mix it
[SPEAKER_03]: up do a little of both no we're
transitioning like I said before we're
[SPEAKER_03]: transitioning a pretty good chunk of our
energy back towards retail and the brand
[SPEAKER_03]: both Redwood Roots brand and a very
limited select group of farmer brands like
[SPEAKER_03]: Jason's Ridgeline we just got we're very
honored at the opportunity to to work on a
[SPEAKER_03]: very small level with the farmer farmers
cut which is I think the Emerald Grown
[SPEAKER_03]: co-ops I believe it's their their new
brand but Daniel Stein from Bryson Forest
[SPEAKER_03]: Farms Happy Days Casey O'Neill and then a
down home farm some up in the grass valley
[SPEAKER_03]: area are the three first kind of flagship
farms that are participating with the
[SPEAKER_03]: brand but it's a co-op grown the the
packaging is just fucking beautiful it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like a kind of like a not hand scissor
trend but literally like hand leaf trimmed
[SPEAKER_03]: buds and a half ounce jar and then there's
a couple other farm brands Sun Love Farms
[SPEAKER_03]: we got some pot of his in jars already
Green Light Farms 707 we got some of his
[SPEAKER_03]: herb already in some jars we have a bunch
of conversations going that have been
[SPEAKER_03]: going now for quite some time seeds
planted a year or two years ago even with
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these conversations but some
collab projects some collab projects for
[SPEAKER_03]: some new skews for Redwood Roots some some
concentrate lines some tincture some
[SPEAKER_03]: tincture line sad health and wellness
lines we're going to be ramping up the
[SPEAKER_03]: brand Redwood Roots brand and and start
starting to get to retail here over the
[SPEAKER_03]: course of the summer leading into next
fall we're looking at our strategy is is
[SPEAKER_03]: is hone in on a very limited small number
select group of shops that are already
[SPEAKER_03]: representing brands like ours that are
willing to pay the price let the consumers
[SPEAKER_03]: come get the pot and then it will spread
slowly and organically from those kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: retail locations and then we can spread
out and go from there but I we feel like
[SPEAKER_03]: we're not going into every $12 wholesale
8th dispensary and trying to get into 600
[SPEAKER_03]: shops we're going to try to get into 50
shops and they're all going to be high-end
[SPEAKER_03]: high-priced shops that will pay the price
to get these farmers the money they
[SPEAKER_03]: deserve and let it grow slow and organic
we'll have some some budget skews to get
[SPEAKER_03]: into those other shops that don't want to
pay what we want to you know pay the price
[SPEAKER_03]: that we want to charge so we'll have some
some budget ounce half ounce eighths
[SPEAKER_03]: smalls duff trim you know the whole pouch
idea everybody's going after the smalls
[SPEAKER_03]: shit now it's what I see and what I'm
hearing is concentrates have lost their
[SPEAKER_03]: muster a little bit our live residence
still the thing but there's people like
[SPEAKER_03]: raw garden that are pushing it out for ten
dollars a gram or some crazy shit so there
[SPEAKER_03]: it's that that market is it's all over the
place it's super fucking difficult to put
[SPEAKER_03]: your finger on it and even even
contemplate where it's going whereas all
[SPEAKER_03]: these other skews are a little more
settled I feel like at least for right now
[SPEAKER_03]: and so we're definitely gonna go back
after retail for sure and Jason Jason's
[SPEAKER_03]: new jars are the inspiration to get back
at it and that the booth at the Emeril Cup
[SPEAKER_03]: that we had in the you know eight out of
the ten top winners are people we
[SPEAKER_03]: represent 13 out of the top 20 winners are
people we represent so to to let that
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity slide it would be fucking
lunatic so we we have you know we got a
[SPEAKER_03]: bunch of urban jars right after the cup
and did a little launch locally and got
[SPEAKER_03]: into Sonoma area blah blah blah and and
then the reality is that you know
[SPEAKER_03]: bootstraps grassroots that's a real thing
we don't just have a bunch of capital to
[SPEAKER_03]: do to do it all we just don't and our
margins we're making a little bit of money
[SPEAKER_03]: selling bulk wholesale and and again able
to get these farmers paid real quick and
[SPEAKER_03]: and the money they're asking and and so
that keeps the boat floating we we still
[SPEAKER_03]: and I've always believed that shelf space
and the brand is the long game and that
[SPEAKER_03]: wholesale of getting farmers paid and
getting up just giving us the ability to
[SPEAKER_03]: to survive this hurricane and hunker down
and and just like Jason said keep the
[SPEAKER_03]: brands relevant on some level but I mean
Ridgeline's not gonna be in every shop in
[SPEAKER_03]: the state not ever he doesn't grow enough
pot you know even if he put his whole
[SPEAKER_03]: thousand pounds in his jars that's gonna
get into maybe a hundred shops if you want
[SPEAKER_03]: to service those hundred shops all year
and once you get into a shop you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: ever want to lose that shelf space so
there's a lot of farmers with brands that
[SPEAKER_03]: think they're gonna go do it and build it
and I hope the best for them but I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: think it's a good strategy for them at
this point in time I think it's it's way
[SPEAKER_03]: too competitive there's slotting fees
still out there there's no farmers that
[SPEAKER_03]: can afford a slotting fee are you kidding
me so I still know that the brand is the
[SPEAKER_03]: long game but we we also just need to keep
our community alive and surviving these
[SPEAKER_03]: times and so I really believe that we're
still in another wave of hunkering yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: we're gonna go to retail but we're not
going big it's not time to go big yet it's
[SPEAKER_03]: just not it's time to hunker and fucking
settle and hone in your processes and your
[SPEAKER_03]: procedures and your team and just get
fucking tight as fucking all hell and then
[SPEAKER_03]: you can keep going to battle with these
big fuckers because that's what it's
[SPEAKER_03]: really about we got ten people on our
staff we're buying new vans we're hiring
[SPEAKER_03]: more employees we're not firing 40% of our
staff and selling our vans and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: continue to grow slow and steady and pick
the right partners and be super fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: conscious and careful about what we do
this is our money we're not playing with
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody else's fucking money this isn't R
&D money out of some venture capitalist
[SPEAKER_03]: fund that's literally two hundred thousand
dollars of R&D money that could just
[SPEAKER_03]: fucking vanish and they don't give a fuck
this is our fucking life all of our lives
[SPEAKER_03]: not just me not just Jason there's a
community of people up where we live and
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not just so hum I'm not so hum centric
there used to be this so hum thing it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like we're all the same people in the
Emerald Triangle all of us are the same
[SPEAKER_03]: we're all trying to make it we're all
trying to survive doing what we love to do
[SPEAKER_03]: we just want to stay where we live where
we love you know now I'm rambling again
[SPEAKER_01]: but so you know Chris one of the themes
that's come through in almost all the
[SPEAKER_01]: discussions we've had lately is that in
the in the current environment smaller
[SPEAKER_01]: operations companies that are maybe a
little more flexible are better able to
[SPEAKER_01]: survive than the larger ones with more
overhead what do you think about that well
[SPEAKER_03]: like I said we're hiring on staff and
buying vans and expanding slowly but
[SPEAKER_03]: Shirley and I all I hear from those bigger
entities is implosion implosion implosion
[SPEAKER_03]: left right left right one after another so
I don't think those companies are all
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna vanish those big guys but I don't
know I think there could be there's a big
[SPEAKER_03]: shakedown going on I don't I mean some of
those companies are so big they're just
[SPEAKER_03]: they're gonna somebody even bigger than
them is gonna buy them and just throw more
[SPEAKER_03]: money at it and I mean you know I don't
know man I just I feel like it's the proof
[SPEAKER_03]: is in the pudding about how to you know
how to get where you're trying to go and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just this this market is too
unsettled it's it's no one still knows
[SPEAKER_03]: anybody that says that they know what's
gonna happen I'll punch him in the throat
[SPEAKER_03]: because they're just wrong they are nobody
knows what's gonna happen so who in any
[SPEAKER_03]: business model when they don't know what's
gonna happen unless they have money to
[SPEAKER_03]: throw away I it is gonna just go crazy big
and it's just not the right thing and so
[SPEAKER_03]: we're very genuine and real about our
grassrootsness and who knows maybe we'll
[SPEAKER_03]: take investors I'm not trying to say we'll
never take an investment or partner with
[SPEAKER_03]: the venture capitalist firm or some
corporation Patagonia is a pretty cool
[SPEAKER_03]: corporation you know what I mean there's
cool there's good people doing good things
[SPEAKER_03]: out there in the world with their with
their business so we're not in any hurry
[SPEAKER_03]: to go there and it would certainly have to
be the right partner but for right now
[SPEAKER_03]: we're we're pretty we're pretty not
comfortable comfortably uncomfortable
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe it might be the right way to say it
I'm very humbled and I'm this is not me
[SPEAKER_03]: but I'm really confident in our community
and where we are today and what we're
[SPEAKER_03]: bringing to the table I am I'm really
confident I think you know we've been
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about Interstate International
forever but there's a generation in SoCal
[SPEAKER_03]: which is the biggest market in the world
as we know that doesn't even know what
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt County is or where it's from or
the Emerald Triangle no never care and
[SPEAKER_03]: they don't care and those are not our
people the further away from Humboldt
[SPEAKER_03]: County you get the more Humboldt County
has a name because you ask somebody in
[SPEAKER_03]: Australia cannabis you ask somebody in
Spain you ask somebody in fucking China
[SPEAKER_03]: they're gonna say Humboldt County that's
what they still say and so there's plenty
[SPEAKER_03]: of high-end consumers across the world and
interstate that will pay us the price
[SPEAKER_03]: point and get you your money Jason and
Kevin and so it's slow steady let's sell
[SPEAKER_03]: the book let's get you paid let's keep the
fucking boat floating let's get the brands
[SPEAKER_03]: relevant let's be really slow and cautious
and steady and by the time Interstate
[SPEAKER_03]: International opens we'll be sitting
pretty and we'll be ready to fucking crush
[SPEAKER_06]: well so that gets to the Appalachian
conversation which is which is happening
[SPEAKER_06]: right now so what for the three of you
what are your I mean obviously to say it's
[SPEAKER_06]: it's grown in Humboldt is one thing but
that doesn't guarantee anything so do the
[SPEAKER_00]: three of you put any weight on this
concept right I used to have a kid named
[SPEAKER_00]: Luke Brunner working for me who was a
brilliant young dude and he had done all
[SPEAKER_00]: this extensive research on how
Appalachians add value and so when I got
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk to Senator McGuire at my office
and we had a conversation he said hey how
[SPEAKER_00]: do I help you in in your area and I said
listen for what we need long-term we need
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of certification that says
organically produced because USDA won't
[SPEAKER_00]: give it to us and we need an Appalachian
of origin so that we can start to have
[SPEAKER_00]: brand value because our regions like even
even not just humble but like Santa Cruz
[SPEAKER_00]: Grass Valley Trinity Mendo Humboldt we're
all known for producing really high
[SPEAKER_00]: quality cannabis and it may not be
important in California but it sure the
[SPEAKER_00]: fuck is important outside of California
and so I had this opportunity to speak to
[SPEAKER_00]: him and that was really the initial
conversation about Appalachians with
[SPEAKER_00]: politicians and McGuire watched that show
shit and so what happens next is we get
[SPEAKER_00]: into the whole Appalachian program and the
International cannabis farmers association
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to really go at it and they start
trying to form all the pieces and now
[SPEAKER_00]: we've had all these different hearings
that we had our moment to make comment the
[SPEAKER_00]: origins council which mean Coleman got
heavily involved in it because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: they're far more developed in their in
their direction of how they want to apply
[SPEAKER_00]: it but for us the long term the value is
priceless and people argue about it
[SPEAKER_00]: because they say no one cares but that's
not true that people do care and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you look at your market as a
neighborhood market then that's not where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're selling where we're trying to have a
global market and Humboldt County has a
[SPEAKER_00]: global market ability just like the other
regions I mentioned and so for Jason and
[SPEAKER_00]: for Toth you know Jason's internationally
recognized as a cultivator and and the one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing I gotta tell you too right is that
what you gotta remember is my mom was a
[SPEAKER_00]: brilliant scientist and she said to me
there was a quote from Einstein but it
[SPEAKER_00]: said that intuition is the is the the
epitome of all genius that it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimate expression of genius that
scientists have to study what people do to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand it but they don't necessarily
create it and so you're a really good
[SPEAKER_00]: representation of that and many of people
like you and Humboldt where your career
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledgeable that transcends science
because ultimately how do fuck did you win
[SPEAKER_00]: back-to-back cups if you're not good right
so so I know I'm serious I mean I check it
[SPEAKER_00]: out opposite of 60 million dollars right
these guys driving these things into the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking wall and you got you got dudes in
Humboldt County and Trinity and Mendo and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's important for cultivators to
understand especially young coming-up
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators because you have to believe
you can make an impact you have to believe
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a chance you have to believe that
within the world of cannabis you could be
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody too because our desire was always
to live this life forever and as we go
[SPEAKER_00]: into this new phase of it everything seems
to be so doom and fucking blue because all
[SPEAKER_00]: the cats that are coming in with with
buckets of money but that doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: that the customer wants the product and so
Appalachians are things that protect brand
[SPEAKER_00]: value and like Toph was saying none of us
I'm only 20,000 square feet right so I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: never put enough jars in enough store to
be in every stores where I'm at but I
[SPEAKER_00]: never intended to I wanted to be able to
put the jars in the places where they were
[SPEAKER_00]: most desired and I wanted people to be
able to appreciate that product and and as
[SPEAKER_00]: a as a group we're under an umbrella where
the Humboldt County farmers and our
[SPEAKER_00]: individual Appalachians will help dictate
expression to the consumer of saying hey
[SPEAKER_00]: Gelman's shit that he chooses comes out
this way we like it and Toph has other
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers that he grabs him Kev's stuff does
this it'll become a recognition like all
[SPEAKER_00]: things are people just don't walk around
blindly they do in modern cannabis because
[SPEAKER_00]: they haven't had any time to be able to
practice playing and buying in these legal
[SPEAKER_00]: markets but as time goes on it well and
you're 40 I'm 54 but none of this stuff is
[SPEAKER_00]: really for me my time was in 40 year prior
where I was in the paint this is for my
[SPEAKER_00]: kids so like it's easy for me to do this
shit now because I know what I'm doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: for I'm doing it specifically and further
my region further my fuck crew further my
[SPEAKER_00]: children and and that's the part that
Appalachians has the value and it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: part that the cultivators have to
understand that Humboldt County Mendo
[SPEAKER_00]: Trinity these are regions where people
have been doing this multi-generationally
[SPEAKER_00]: and they have a field for the product that
science has to understand it doesn't mean
[SPEAKER_00]: that a premium agronomist isn't a
brilliant guy and they don't do phenomenal
[SPEAKER_00]: work but you you you have to understand
that art and science is separate and that
[SPEAKER_00]: arts are and so what you see is a lot of
art and and that's where this Appalachian
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff comes into play and before I forget
too when we were talking about trends and
[SPEAKER_00]: heritage strains you got to remember that
the cats that are buying herb now didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke cigarettes they smoked vape pens so
they're flavor addicted and so they
[SPEAKER_00]: they're at their introduction to
consumption of smokables was flavored vape
[SPEAKER_00]: pens that never happened in the whole
history of dope smoking tobacco and forms
[SPEAKER_00]: of tobacco with it with it with the
interconnection between smoke right so
[SPEAKER_00]: this group that comes in now is all vape
pen so what they want is flavors because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what they know they don't they and
then as the trend goes by we'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: reintroduce them to the earthy things that
were pop well we used to just grow herb
[SPEAKER_00]: but until until this they get saturated
with their desires being fulfilled to make
[SPEAKER_00]: them happy with what they consume in a
vape pen that's what's going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: trend because all the fruits all the
citrus is all that shit all the stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from oil that changed people's
profile of what they wanted to smoke and
[SPEAKER_00]: weed because it was so fucking intense in
the mouth that they became disappointed in
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and so they had to start steer the
profiles and the flower into that
[SPEAKER_00]: expression to get the customers to come
back into flower but that's a trend that's
[SPEAKER_00]: that'll that'll turn around over time too
and that's why it's important to bank
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties where you got to hold the
genetics so that you can go reintroduce
[SPEAKER_00]: them into the market when it comes time
but right now like I used you as an
[SPEAKER_00]: example the other day about heritage
strains in a speech where I was like look
[SPEAKER_00]: if if people gave a fuck now how can Jason
killed it with the white ruts right why
[SPEAKER_00]: did that win when it was heritage people
judging it so they were there were people
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know Swami judging it and it's
why me 70 fucking seven right it was at
[SPEAKER_00]: his birth like um he smoked about as much
herb as anyone on earth and he was a he
[SPEAKER_00]: was a really emphatic um you know champion
of your variety because he said hey the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality was just fucking superlative
that's that's the important part is that
[SPEAKER_00]: trends and shit change the regional
influence has an impact and us as a
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural influence has an impact and all
the regions around California and and for
[SPEAKER_00]: me anywhere in the United States and
globally if your area produces something
[SPEAKER_00]: of quality and the people are minded to
produce something of quality take
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage of what we did here in
California with the Appalachians and start
[SPEAKER_00]: to protect your brand for globalization
because ultimately it's gonna have a value
[SPEAKER_00]: and if you get your hands into it before
someone makes it impossible to you do
[SPEAKER_00]: better on a community level and that's
what we need is because we are a community
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the thing is all these regions
people know each other you you you worked
[SPEAKER_00]: off a handshake for years and almost
everybody I know handles a couple hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: million fucking dollars in cash that ran
through their fingers over the course of
[SPEAKER_00]: their hustling career so when I talk to
these guys in the modern world about money
[SPEAKER_00]: and business I look at them and I'm like
look you have a fucking 18 em card in your
[SPEAKER_00]: pocket ain't no cash looks like so it it
makes it hard to have a conversation that
[SPEAKER_00]: makes sense because they look at all of us
like we're like fucking Stone Age but we
[SPEAKER_00]: were actually really competent at the old
business and our understanding what people
[SPEAKER_00]: like is cannabis is pretty accurate still
you know and and that's that's the point
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why it's nice to be on the show
with you and Leon Toth because you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: respect both you guys because you good
dudes and you also about your shit and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're about your community and that's as
real as it can fucking be so do you think
[SPEAKER_06]: someone like Jason needs Appalachian to I
mean Appalachian is kind of more rigorous
[SPEAKER_06]: than obviously you know he's in southern
Humboldt or you know wherever someone's
[SPEAKER_06]: base like he's already that filing cabinet
behind Jason has CD FA and then if he
[SPEAKER_06]: wants to do the organic comparable he'll
have another filing cabinet for that and
[SPEAKER_06]: then if he wants to be Appalachian you
know origin control a southern Humboldt
[SPEAKER_06]: specific region he's gonna have a third
filing cabinet as and how many what's the
[SPEAKER_06]: square footage of your cultivation as a
small as a not raw garden sized operation
[SPEAKER_02]: how big you Jason oh ninety six hundred
square feet yeah it is worth it it is
[SPEAKER_00]: worth it for you because if you take a
look at how wine moves we put wine in the
[SPEAKER_00]: right market it's worth five times more
than it is in a regular market so stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of Napa sells for a hundred and
Napa 500 in China because it's got a
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking Appalachian on it it's it's about
the long term and the thing is that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: in the beginning of a process that will go
on forever and so I wish that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: younger so I could like ride this shit now
but I know that I'm doing it for my kids
[SPEAKER_00]: so that when my children are older they
have a farm that has a specific impact
[SPEAKER_00]: because ultimately indoor is so similar
even though there's and I argued about
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachians for indoor because you want
all cultivators to have a chance to
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit but ultimately the outdoor
expression in his situation and then his
[SPEAKER_00]: hand on it combined with genetics is his
thing and if he was the same as everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: else so why does he keep on fucking
winning so it's it's one of those things
[SPEAKER_00]: where the end result answers the question
it says that he's doing something
[SPEAKER_00]: different because he's running something
that other people have that cut other
[SPEAKER_00]: people use that dirt other people use that
shit but his environment coupled up with
[SPEAKER_00]: him and the genetics and his choices and
how he operates makes something that's
[SPEAKER_06]: absolutely exquisite that's the value so
actually on that point Chris you you work
[SPEAKER_03]: with how many farms like I said currently
we've we've sold herb for about a hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: and twenty hundred thirty farmers this
year so far so you smoke a lot of weed
[SPEAKER_06]: from a lot of farmers so can you talk
about something that maybe two different
[SPEAKER_06]: farmers grow the same cut that you've
noticed just is different based on where
[SPEAKER_06]: they're based can you give a concrete
example where they're based or their
[SPEAKER_03]: practices you know not all these there's
farmers that are using each other's
[SPEAKER_03]: formulas and sharing feeding regiments and
whatnot but at the end of the day it's I
[SPEAKER_03]: think both of those things are coming into
play it's not just the Appalachian but
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah the I mean I don't even I can't even
really think of any specific examples just
[SPEAKER_03]: off the top my head but I can tell you
that I've seen a lot of the same cuts from
[SPEAKER_03]: the same nurseries growing at different
farms that come out looking way different
[SPEAKER_03]: they smell different they look different
they smoke different so it's Appalachian I
[SPEAKER_03]: think comes into play what it's grown in
what they were sprayed with what they're
[SPEAKER_03]: fed with how they cured it how long did
they cure it what temperature they cured
[SPEAKER_03]: it at how long has it been in a turkey bag
was it in a turkey bag was it in a
[SPEAKER_03]: cardboard box was it in was it stored
underground was it stored in a garage with
[SPEAKER_03]: no insulation at 70 degrees there's a
million things that come into play with
[SPEAKER_03]: when it comes to what that consumer is
tasting or how they're feeling so yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen it all over the place for sure
it's super interesting it's very
[SPEAKER_01]: fascinating for sure yeah so that tells me
that that Appalachian is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: really difficult which we know it's going
to be it is and then it's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: really localized and really specific so
Kevin how do you think it's going to work
[SPEAKER_01]: out what do you think it's going to look
like on the ground at the end of the day
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't we don't have the final regs in
play but the bottom line is that if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: because what Chris was talking about
that's all part of Appalachian too
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachian is is is location process and
we're part of the process but it's process
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics and location and process is all
those things we talked about so say say
[SPEAKER_00]: you're in a region and what we're saying
is that our our curing process is longer
[SPEAKER_00]: where we take more time we make sure that
the plant the product after cutting never
[SPEAKER_00]: goes over 65 degrees so we don't flare off
any monos and we don't oxidize the product
[SPEAKER_00]: that's holding stability we talk about the
speed that it moves through the system and
[SPEAKER_00]: and how it's never transferred unless it's
preserved in quality that's the stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: we learned from all these other countries
that did Appalachians where they figured
[SPEAKER_00]: out how to refine the process till it was
absolutely rock-tight for them and it it
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't mean that everyone is going to
get paid from it but what it does is it
[SPEAKER_00]: creates the upper shelf you have to have
the upper shelf because the higher the
[SPEAKER_00]: upper shelf it brings every other shelf up
below it but if the top shelf is ten bucks
[SPEAKER_00]: you're fucked if you're down below that
but if the top shelf is 50 bucks then
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some room and what it does it
starts to allow you to create exquisite
[SPEAKER_00]: markets and then normalize markets and
then bulk markets because everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: deserves good grass to smoke but when
you're talking about work that required an
[SPEAKER_00]: ungodly amount of fucking labor you're
selling a Maserati you're not selling a
[SPEAKER_00]: Honda they're different Honda is a
beautiful car too but Gunther didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: stitch the leather seat in it so when it
comes to us with the Appalachian how it
[SPEAKER_00]: rolls out is is the what I like about it
is that they're actually taking their time
[SPEAKER_00]: and the groups are putting arguments
together that are trying to lessen the
[SPEAKER_00]: fees so that it's not so expensive to
begin one and it's not so expensive to
[SPEAKER_00]: change one and that we're creating
variability in the genetics that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: using so that you're not tied into a
specific thing because why you had the
[SPEAKER_00]: data from the monks so remember I sent you
an email where I laid this whole thing out
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been studying this shit for years and
I'm not an Appalachian expert but what I
[SPEAKER_00]: care about is how do you take their ideas
and use it to assist us in what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing and not follow it verbatim because
cannabis is not wine so it has to have its
[SPEAKER_00]: own criteria and the idea that it's
something that brings value to regions
[SPEAKER_00]: that have historical relevance and that
the impact is genuine and it's like I said
[SPEAKER_00]: it creates the upper shelf and it allows
you to start to validate outdoor cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way that's needed because we know
from consumption point of view that the
[SPEAKER_00]: thickest richest greasiest shit is coming
from outdoor so indoor is a smoother and
[SPEAKER_00]: it is usually because of that diurnal
swing and temp and the fact that they
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilize methodology and if you're
running it as a organic indoor you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a really premium product but if
it's regular salt grown it's very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: and so you don't have these subtleties and
nuances as much the cultivator themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: adds influence but not like the specific
regions within California that add
[SPEAKER_00]: influence and I think that once you start
to create this as long as it's not to own
[SPEAKER_00]: us on the operator where it's too much
paperwork and too much money then over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of the next 15-20 years what you've
done is you started to first legitimatize
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as an ultra craft product to fit
in all the echelons of all the other craft
[SPEAKER_00]: products because everyone's consuming it
but now you just have to call it that and
[SPEAKER_00]: then what it does it starts to create the
value for all the small farmer over time
[SPEAKER_00]: as long as we can hold our properties like
that's the hard part for us is how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain the land and how do you maintain
the family integrity to get to that point
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're going to get paid and we were
paid before now we're going through this
[SPEAKER_00]: transition and we're still actually okay
I'm feeding my kids I'm not rolling in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking paper like I used to but I'm also
happier than I've been in a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: because I know I get to go run the farm so
like there's this there's a there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: beauty to being legal in a way that it's
it's not about you man it wasn't about me
[SPEAKER_00]: tripping on the game it was that I looked
at my kids and realized that by the time
[SPEAKER_00]: they get older our whole life will be gone
and so what do we do and so to me the
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachian is the key to move this
forward and if we just study how they came
[SPEAKER_00]: about it was wine with the monks the monks
were the ones that figured out the best
[SPEAKER_00]: processes and they figured out the best
locations because they were funded by the
[SPEAKER_00]: church so they didn't have to get paid
make it wine they had to have it for mass
[SPEAKER_00]: so everything that we have on great data
is really from the Franciscans and so they
[SPEAKER_00]: figured out where everything grew best and
how it grew best and what was the impact
[SPEAKER_00]: of the soil and the air and the
environment and the elevation on that
[SPEAKER_00]: grapevine we don't have that amount of
data we're beginning it and that's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the point is that it has to just be
flexible enough to let you get involved
[SPEAKER_00]: without too much money flexible rules to
begin so that it's not too exclusionary
[SPEAKER_00]: from the beginning and then have an
ability over time to adjust and refine so
[SPEAKER_00]: that it fits the needs of the farming
community and the customer and now you got
[SPEAKER_01]: some real shit so isn't it like Jason has
that information but innately like yes he
[SPEAKER_00]: has it intuitively intuition right
intuition which is the which I went to
[SPEAKER_00]: Russia with my son right my son's a
world-class weightlifter so I get invited
[SPEAKER_00]: to Russia to go to the Russian Sports
Institute to get him studied and I'm at
[SPEAKER_00]: the Sports Institute the fucking smartest
sports scientists in the world and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: filming this athlete and I said what are
you filming him for he goes we're trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand what he does so that we can
explain to other people how they should do
[SPEAKER_00]: it and I said you can't create that and
they said no we can never create what we
[SPEAKER_00]: do is we analyze research determine how
they did it and try to get someone else to
[SPEAKER_00]: copy because ultimately creation is
creation and that's the art and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really what I think like Jason and a lot
of the guys Chris work with an increase
[SPEAKER_00]: own situation he's intuitive he's an
intuitive hustler because that's he's
[SPEAKER_00]: building his business by himself so that's
intuition and that's I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: imperative to put that out because all
young cultivators all young artisans and
[SPEAKER_00]: all crafts have to realize that if you
feel like you got a skill and when you
[SPEAKER_00]: touch it it's genuine chase that shit
because that's your brain and your body
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking tied into your spirit and that's
where wonder comes out and that kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff it it it's valuable to him because
his location and his ability and his
[SPEAKER_00]: choices make that value so that what it
does it allows us two kids down the road
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to have real estate that has a
value so that they have security they have
[SPEAKER_00]: heritage we don't we don't pass any thing
down anymore in society nobody's passing
[SPEAKER_00]: skill sets from generation to generation
and Appalachians when you look at these
[SPEAKER_00]: farms in in Italy in France and stuff
you're talking 400 years of people passing
[SPEAKER_00]: a farm down do you know what the most
profitable fucking business on earth is
[SPEAKER_00]: per person is a winery in France and
they're generating off of 600 acres over a
[SPEAKER_00]: billion dollars with like a hundred and
twenty five people that's the that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: most balling ass lucrative business on the
planet for that number of people working
[SPEAKER_00]: it so when someone says this shit doesn't
have a value at that upper extreme it most
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely does and we may not have the
ability to produce 600 acres in that form
[SPEAKER_00]: but in our niche markets we do and once
you start to get the public to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what's produced they can start to put in
orders and you have pre buys you even have
[SPEAKER_00]: auctions on the batches so that when you
have a vintage year when the when the when
[SPEAKER_00]: the assessors come in and say these are
primo crops you start to get bids I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think anybody has any idea what pots
really work people are talking about two
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar grass and I'm like in the wrong
fucking business you're not selling timex
[SPEAKER_06]: watches we're selling Rolex watches so
just quickly I asked if people have
[SPEAKER_06]: questions and it exploded so let me start
catching up for these questions but the
[SPEAKER_06]: the one that everyone wants an answer to
is Kevin so everyone's basically asking
[SPEAKER_06]: can you ask Kevin if his skunk projects is
still in the works it is it is it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: in the works and I spoke about it a couple
times what I did is I I had gotten ill a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple years back and I just didn't expect
that the I was that way I was in a coma
[SPEAKER_00]: but I didn't expect that it was gonna fuck
me up so badly and slow me down and I
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't really do I could go to work but
I couldn't do all my extracurricular
[SPEAKER_00]: projects and by the time I kind of got
healed back like this was two years ago so
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel great now but man it was like I had
aged like a hundred fucking years and I
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't move the project forward I just
sat with all the material and I kept
[SPEAKER_00]: everything alive but by the time I get
back to being healthy I'm in a new
[SPEAKER_00]: business model with my operation and so
what I did is I took all the genetics all
[SPEAKER_00]: the seed stock all the parental stock and
I licensed it to another company that I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: connected to so that I can have them do
the actual sifting work and reading on it
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I can go in and help them with
selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which company is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which company?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't you want to know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what it does it allows me to be
able to utilize other operations that are
[SPEAKER_00]: larger to do the sifting and the hunting
but otherwise it was gonna have to keep
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting on the weight and I thought I was
gonna get to use the farm but when you
[SPEAKER_00]: start to run your numbers on the farm and
you find out how much you make really
[SPEAKER_00]: working on the farm you realize that every
square foot of your farm has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: operational so all the way I behaved for
decades which was R&D all over the place
[SPEAKER_00]: and testing shit and running shit once we
get into this new system it's a fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking nightmare and it's also
financially impossible on your farm to
[SPEAKER_00]: play hunt and chase when you're having to
tag and identify every one of these plants
[SPEAKER_00]: and have them batched and it's a fucking
nightmare and so I just said hang on so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going anywhere and I'm not
tripping because ultimately I wasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to be first to the market I just
knew that I could access material that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had myself and I knew that when I threw
some feelers out into the world to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: did anybody have any stock from the late
70s I was able to get it when we tried to
[SPEAKER_00]: open those seeds up a couple years ago the
technology wasn't refined enough and so we
[SPEAKER_00]: opened them government pop we still didn't
get them to extend so now the hormonal
[SPEAKER_00]: basis is better and I know we're gonna be
able to do some good embryo rescue on and
[SPEAKER_00]: start to pull some of this old stock that
I acquired because it wasn't just to hunt
[SPEAKER_00]: the you know the road killer everybody's
obsessed with roadkill but like it was to
[SPEAKER_00]: hunt an error because like when I got to
California in when I get California 87
[SPEAKER_00]: that was this it was just so much good pot
and it was all coming from all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: place but it was just rich and diverse and
interesting and it's it's my roots that's
[SPEAKER_00]: my heritage strains and so that was the
whole purpose of the project was to pull
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff out and it'll happen but
legalization kind of slowed down the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to use the tools like I used to
use and then I unfortunately got really
[SPEAKER_00]: ill and almost fucking died in the
hospital so it's it's there it's just not
[SPEAKER_00]: being able to be focused on the forefront
right now I think everyone was happy with
[SPEAKER_06]: that answer so get getting back to what
we're just talking about with Appalachians
[SPEAKER_06]: or relevance Appalachians for all three of
you so this is from Don Jose how long does
[SPEAKER_06]: it take to adjust a strain to a specific
area environment so Jason can you talk
[SPEAKER_06]: about some genetics you've run and maybe
something you've noticed like three years
[SPEAKER_06]: into running something versus the first
year of running that um well I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just blown away with all the stuff
Kevin's saying I was just listening to
[SPEAKER_02]: that um I can I just interrupt that one
second because I wanted to go back to
[SPEAKER_02]: where he's just talking about the R&D and
you know me and my dad we love you know
[SPEAKER_02]: cross-pollinating making strains I mean
that's one of our favorite things to do
[SPEAKER_02]: together and I have some you know amazing
genetics I've took the green light lantern
[SPEAKER_02]: I've crossed it into these OG you want
these strains these ice cream cake strains
[SPEAKER_02]: other fruity strains and I want to grow
them all I mean I've even popped a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of the seeds and now I'm sitting there
going you know where do I put them you
[SPEAKER_02]: know I could only plant six six plants for
my personal so you know like you said it's
[SPEAKER_02]: like there's so much out there we want to
try but you almost have to leave it for
[SPEAKER_02]: those people that are dedicating their
full space to that um and then I wanted to
[SPEAKER_02]: go to the Appalachians real quick just
because I felt like I've been an
[SPEAKER_02]: Appalachian forever as a kid from Humble
who's you know I've been lucky enough to
[SPEAKER_02]: travel a good amount everywhere I've ever
gone if I were you know where you're from
[SPEAKER_02]: Humble County oh you grow wheat I mean
that's all I've been told my whole life
[SPEAKER_02]: and so you know when you know I've been
offered honestly by places in Santa
[SPEAKER_02]: Barbara you know to grow Ridgeline well
hey we'll do a few acres of light depth
[SPEAKER_02]: for you you know I'm like no I mean I want
Humble County on my brand you know where
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from I don't want you know somebody to
buy my smoke that's grown in Santa Barbara
[SPEAKER_02]: or you know Salinas or wherever in another
another area so I feel like the
[SPEAKER_02]: Appalachian thing is pretty real and like
I said I feel like we already are in our
[SPEAKER_02]: Appalachian and I want Humble County to be
on every package you know produced in
[SPEAKER_02]: Humble County that I sent out there to the
consumers getting back to the question you
[SPEAKER_02]: asked that's a hard one um I mean I guess
I'm figuring out right now I'm growing a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of strains that I've personally only
seen indoor you know I've only seen that
[SPEAKER_02]: so I'm gonna know a lot more I mean
hopefully we get back to this after this
[SPEAKER_02]: first you know season probably or this
first round you know late July and I'll
[SPEAKER_02]: know what these strains are doing I feel
like if you are you know a good grower you
[SPEAKER_02]: know what you're doing you're gonna grow
good herb no matter what but you know like
[SPEAKER_02]: I said every strain is completely
different and you do have to learn a
[SPEAKER_02]: strain you have to learn its tendencies
some mold some grow way faster than others
[SPEAKER_02]: some like more nitrogen so you know they
all are different um I don't know a
[SPEAKER_02]: specific strain I couldn't really put my
finger on that um yeah I don't know you
[SPEAKER_00]: know it was easier before climate change
started to becoming more aggressive
[SPEAKER_00]: because like what Don Carlos is asking is
he's like how long does it take for the
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plant to acclimatize to a region
because epigenetically the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic in its genome which means it can
suddenly adjust suddenly gently adjust
[SPEAKER_00]: over time to fit the environment better
because it's an organism that wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive just like your your body is a
plastic living body that the genes can
[SPEAKER_00]: modify and move so that you're able to
constantly pick up information and that
[SPEAKER_00]: way you pass that information downstream
so when people talk about breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: projects you know you're looking for a
large chunk of time because every year
[SPEAKER_00]: that you bred you chose the best ship that
survived that season so it picked up the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic information of survivability from
each one of those years and when you have
[SPEAKER_00]: a gene pool you know within the gene pool
you have something that's going to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: and live and it used to be like just even
a few years back remember we had the
[SPEAKER_00]: drought right so there was like five or
six years where you weren't getting rain
[SPEAKER_00]: until like fucking December in Humboldt
and so anybody that was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: developmental work during that time for
Humboldt County built things that finished
[SPEAKER_00]: way later than they should and now you're
going into a situation where we're getting
[SPEAKER_00]: rain again come November or you should get
it back in and the development of things
[SPEAKER_00]: that went along that time frame and no
longer applicable so I think what it comes
[SPEAKER_00]: down to is if you're trying to develop
stability in a line in an area it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: a measure of time from swings so you need
to take a look at what you're working at
[SPEAKER_00]: now in terms of environmentally then go
back X amount of years to when you began
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'd be able to get an idea of what
did you do your development in
[SPEAKER_00]: environmentally and I don't so I don't
think there's a set answer of like you
[SPEAKER_00]: know three runs and it's acclimated 72
generations of breeding and it's good it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really about selection and desire for the
market combined with what worked
[SPEAKER_02]: environmentally it's a lot of work being a
breeder too man it's oh it takes so much
[SPEAKER_02]: time I mean I guess if you want to take
plants and throw them indoor make them do
[SPEAKER_02]: their thing quick but I mean it's you know
for me it's a year you know every time
[SPEAKER_02]: well that strain is okay well next year
we'll see how this one is a whole year
[SPEAKER_02]: that super girl that my dad has you know
it's I don't even know it has train wreck
[SPEAKER_02]: in it he's been doing it since you know we
were all growing train wreck so what is
[SPEAKER_02]: that 15 20 years ago and now he has it
where it's finishing you know at the end
[SPEAKER_02]: of August early September you know so just
like you say but it's not really a strain
[SPEAKER_02]: it's more of us evolving the strain you
know with the climate like you say so it's
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah that's a lot of work that's why it's
nice you know I mean I like that's one of
[SPEAKER_02]: my favorite things to do is you know breed
is being a breeder but now like you said
[SPEAKER_02]: we have to we have our square footage and
the more strange you put in the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: with all the metric and all the paperwork
it's a headache it's a pain in the
[SPEAKER_02]: nightmare yeah it's a nightmare and batch
testing oh it's gnarly but that's why you
[SPEAKER_02]: know kind of I want to see what strains
are gonna come out the best in our area so
[SPEAKER_02]: yes I'm taking a risk right now growing so
many different strains like we know you
[SPEAKER_02]: know a lot of strength I'm growing they've
proven themselves indoor time and time
[SPEAKER_02]: again I guarantee I could probably I guess
I can't guarantee that because we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know they're indoor strains but I know I'm
gonna grow them pretty damn good and we
[SPEAKER_02]: will see if they don't come out good we
won't grow them again we don't know what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're gonna how they're gonna react in
this climate we have you know today
[SPEAKER_02]: today's 85 yesterday was 100 tomorrow's be
5 and we're gonna get an inch of rain so
[SPEAKER_02]: you know this is an indoor facility in
Arizona you know this isn't an indoor
[SPEAKER_06]: facility anyway this is good is the the
kind of global warming weather stuff going
[SPEAKER_06]: on really affecting you guys right now
like is it just all over the place in
[SPEAKER_06]: terms of like you used to have
predictability I mean obviously you'd have
[SPEAKER_06]: something happen in a season that was
unexpected but you had expectations it
[SPEAKER_06]: seems like now you just don't know what to
expect every single year no not at all I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean really we grew full term plants we
grew in the summer full term we grew
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor in the winter and yeah you know
depths really only came around I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know what do you think 10 years ago I mean
really fully started hitting so yeah I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean it was just kind of the way what was
that 20 20 years ago I'm fine but I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: saying it's like you know that was our
life is this we would just always it was
[SPEAKER_02]: full term plants we'd grow all summer long
and then the winter comes you'd go inside
[SPEAKER_02]: so yeah it's that the weather is
completely unpredictable you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: almanac's on it said it's gonna be a
wetter May but you know we did like you
[SPEAKER_02]: said last year we could have got a whole
nother running it didn't rain forever it
[SPEAKER_02]: was you know we're into October there's no
rain you know I mean the year before we
[SPEAKER_02]: had a gnarliest storm ever and we had weed
molding everywhere so you know working
[SPEAKER_02]: with the climate is a whole different game
but at the same time working with the Sun
[SPEAKER_02]: and the environment weed is I mean it's
way better I guarantee it's you know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: getting the THC is gonna be higher it's I
mean just everything about sun-grown weed
[SPEAKER_01]: is better so I just want to say that as a
consumer as and a patient which is always
[SPEAKER_01]: how I'm experiencing these conversations
what I want to hear in order to make that
[SPEAKER_01]: bridge be a successful one to get from
here to there so everyone's survives and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're there is what I've heard today I
can't even begin to tell you that Jason in
[SPEAKER_01]: particular because you're here is able to
integrate everything all briefly this
[SPEAKER_01]: fucking shit you have to go through with
the regulations and the metric in this
[SPEAKER_01]: integrate that into what you've been doing
traditional and otherwise and now legal
[SPEAKER_01]: and still maintain the integrity of your
process as a consumer who does care that
[SPEAKER_01]: the product is clean and only cares about
a future that has a craft cannabis in it
[SPEAKER_01]: right I like I like all cannabis but
that's the future that matters right um
[SPEAKER_01]: and the business model is there if you can
make the bridge right direct to consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of that that's what I want to hear
that's exactly what I wanted to hear that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're able to maintain that so I just
want to put that in like Chris said slowly
[SPEAKER_02]: and steady wins the race you know there's
been there's so many people moving in and
[SPEAKER_02]: they want to just throw tons of money and
build out and do all this crazy stuff and
[SPEAKER_02]: they have no idea about growing in you
know in the elements and the climates and
[SPEAKER_02]: you know I'm not trying to go crazy I just
keep focusing on what I'm doing and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know I'm proud of what I do you know
there's there's always gonna be courses
[SPEAKER_02]: and Bud Budweiser of course like Budweiser
but then when I drove through Sonoma a few
[SPEAKER_02]: months back and there's just line at this
brewery I said you know what's that line
[SPEAKER_02]: for asked my sister and she said you know
piney beer I'm like holy shit you know
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a line a mile down the block and
you know so I mean what I'm getting at is
[SPEAKER_02]: you're always gonna buy that that random
shit and you know it's still gonna get you
[SPEAKER_02]: high it's you know but is it gonna make
you feel good is it you know clear nice
[SPEAKER_02]: thoughts are gonna be able to you know go
out and smoke a nice joint at the end of
[SPEAKER_02]: the evening and just feel feel you can
feel the difference of a nice fresh
[SPEAKER_03]: outdoor but I mean some people some people
like to drink Opus one some people like to
[SPEAKER_01]: drink Franzia there you go yeah and my
feeling about this is selfish man you've
[SPEAKER_01]: got the knowledge you have the genetics
you have the things we want to survive
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah we're blessed man I'll tell you what
you know I mean especially with this whole
[SPEAKER_06]: lockdown thing we got people tuning in
from around the world there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: people saying it's 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're waking and baking watching
this and they appreciate it
[SPEAKER_00]: Kevin have you done a lot of reveging I've
done a lot of reveging and what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna find is the more determinate the
plant wants to flower the harder it is to
[SPEAKER_00]: pull it back and so determinate the flower
is always upper latitude plant so stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that's equatorial stuff this long flower
and hazes and Cambodians and shit like
[SPEAKER_00]: that that'll come back relatively easily
because it's almost always in a semi
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetative state but if it's something
like a broad leaf man that shit takes time
[SPEAKER_00]: and so what I would do for people is I'd
go up to the hill and they'd say look we
[SPEAKER_00]: threw this out as a seed this fucking
plant supernatural we don't know what to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with it and so I started trying to
clone the flowers which works sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: but a lot of times you end up rotting it
in the tray and it doesn't work you take
[SPEAKER_00]: it like you know 40% of the canopy off and
then I dig up the plant put it in a burlap
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking bag like a tree and then you bring
it into an indoor and set that thing up
[SPEAKER_00]: under 24-hour light because you have to be
able to get that hormonal reversal to go
[SPEAKER_00]: back into juvenility and all you got to do
is as it dries out just don't overly feed
[SPEAKER_00]: it with heavy nitrogen just enough so that
it's in a positive so you're if you're if
[SPEAKER_00]: you were driving it through a PK push and
it finished flower you need to reset that
[SPEAKER_00]: and go back into a higher nitrogen level
and be patient and I've had plants take up
[SPEAKER_00]: to almost five and a half months to
revenge and people would come in they see
[SPEAKER_00]: this ugliest looking thing you ever seen
in your life because all the buds are
[SPEAKER_00]: rotting off basically and dry and falling
out and then all the new helicopters come
[SPEAKER_00]: out and so the point is that if it's
valuable enough take your time and be
[SPEAKER_00]: patient it doesn't happen overnight if it
wants to turn quickly you can do it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: month and you can pull a cut off but like
I said I had a I had a killer plant I got
[SPEAKER_00]: out of somebody from another location that
was phenomenal and I held it for him but
[SPEAKER_00]: it took me over five months to revenge it
so I'd rather keep copies of the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm testing in clonal form to make it
easy but sometimes you know you just one
[SPEAKER_00]: of them things you run a plant it turns
out to be the best thing you ever seen in
[SPEAKER_00]: your life don't fucking smoke it take the
top 40% off the rest of the plant dig it
[SPEAKER_00]: up with the shovel and get two or three of
your friends to put it into a root bag and
[SPEAKER_00]: then tie it up like a tree and bring that
shit into a building and set it up it's
[SPEAKER_00]: worth the time because ultimately like
with with what we're doing all of us have
[SPEAKER_00]: seen herb that's so much better than Eddie
the herb was smoking right now we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have it anymore a lot of these newer
strains are so unstable that you know I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean the seed strains we have way quicker
but a lot of these other ones there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: little light showing or just a little
weather change all of a sudden they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: hurt me out on you they're not proven but
revenge is something that you can do just
[SPEAKER_00]: be patient and 24-hour light not excessive
food levels just normal let it slowly come
[SPEAKER_00]: back over time because really what you
have to do is go through hormonal change
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah hormonal shift is the is the key part
you want to get they get it back to come
[SPEAKER_01]: from senescence to juvenility following up
on on what Kevin was talking about about
[SPEAKER_01]: future consumers being like coming from
the vape world does that mean that maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: they might be like into sauces and hash
and concentrates things like that so I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: curious Jason are you do you do you grow
for hash for other stuff is that a part of
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're doing as well well you know if
I definitely did some fresh frozen last
[SPEAKER_02]: year it was amazing I used some of my
smalls this year we did some sauce through
[SPEAKER_02]: Humboldt brand that turned out really
really good I did definitely don't grow
[SPEAKER_02]: for that you know I like I said I take a
little amount you know maybe to enter the
[SPEAKER_02]: Emerald Cup maybe so I could actually have
some personal smoke and for you know me
[SPEAKER_02]: and my friends or whatnot but uh you know
like I said the smalls could do anything
[SPEAKER_02]: they're versatile you don't get that much
for them and I definitely don't want them
[SPEAKER_02]: going to my jars so yeah yeah I don't grow
for it but I definitely I enjoy you know
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm good with about one dab in the evening
you know right before dinner I'm not I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: not wanting to just hit them all the time
I like smoking joints man so here's my
[SPEAKER_01]: question are you are you as versatile in
your business model as you are in your
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation for instance if you attract
more people to your brand by having other
[SPEAKER_01]: products out there and eventually they
make their way to your flower which is
[SPEAKER_01]: where you want them to be isn't that a
good thing is is like is that a nod we
[SPEAKER_02]: have to make to where the markets go it's
amazing it's exactly where I want to be if
[SPEAKER_02]: I have amazing fresh frozen or a sauce
maker or somebody that wants to do a
[SPEAKER_02]: collaboration with me I'm down with it you
know I'm open with collaborations because
[SPEAKER_02]: I grow good weed I have no idea how to how
to make oil sauce fresh frozen you know
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm old-school hash you know I could make
hash you know I don't know that so and I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't pretend to yeah I'm open any any
type I believe it definitely helps a brand
[SPEAKER_02]: to have multiple products come out of what
you grow yes go ahead the the the only way
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can hold the product to showcase
a season is in a concentrate form because
[SPEAKER_00]: flour breaks down just due to the fact
that it's got too much organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: right and so a small amount I think of
stuff that we make should always go into
[SPEAKER_00]: some form of concentrate via a traditional
hash but even if it's in our inner in a
[SPEAKER_00]: BHL extract where it was diamond and sauce
that shit'll just sugar up over time but
[SPEAKER_00]: if it's held cold and you open a three
four-year jar up it's still rates and so I
[SPEAKER_00]: think that that's the only way that you
can kind of take people back to let them
[SPEAKER_00]: see what the seasons were like so that you
get to show them this this this
[SPEAKER_00]: progression of time and that's what that's
what's cool about it by holding
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate form is that you you just get
to kind of go back in time and say man
[SPEAKER_00]: 2017 was a fucking epic year look at the
look at the oil the herbs long gone but we
[SPEAKER_00]: still have some oil left it will break one
out of the freezer yeah you know I know
[SPEAKER_00]: you do we go no this was the good hash and
it skins up and when you cut it it's fresh
[SPEAKER_00]: and that was like with Frenchie you know
he was always saying shake the can because
[SPEAKER_00]: you can you can hold that for time and I
think that that's something that that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: important to because otherwise nobody gets
to see what the farm did in the years
[SPEAKER_00]: prior and you can kind of help people
understand the changes in environment and
[SPEAKER_00]: in your development as a cultivator by
what the product smokes like in that oil
[SPEAKER_00]: form it's it's it's it's not it doesn't
have to be so fucking difficult because
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately we're all smokers who want to
share good smoke with other smokers so it
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't like we're disconnected from the
dope game we're born in the fucking dope
[SPEAKER_00]: game and what we want to do is have you
embrace it with us you know what I mean
[SPEAKER_00]: now that we're not fucking criminals and
being persecuted and hung up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking street it's a lot better because
now for the first time you could really
[SPEAKER_00]: get people to get caught up in let's enjoy
good pot together it's not anybody smarter
[SPEAKER_00]: or better it's just that we're all fucking
humans who have that commonality so let's
[SPEAKER_06]: talk pricing a bunch of people were asking
if you guys are liking it seems like
[SPEAKER_06]: prices are going back up so a couple
questions like we talked to Chia Rodriguez
[SPEAKER_06]: from Arcana flower or Mendocino
generations and she was talking about how
[SPEAKER_06]: two years ago everybody was calling her
for trim because they wanted to turn it
[SPEAKER_06]: into extract and nobody really cared about
the flower now she gets no calls for trim
[SPEAKER_06]: they're all for flour so I guess let's
start with like Jason yeah well so you're
[SPEAKER_06]: selling bulk so obviously like tell us
where prices have been going for flour and
[SPEAKER_06]: trim and then Jason you do have what are
you doing with all the extra like the trim
[SPEAKER_06]: from your farm is that worth anything
right now or what's kind of your model for
[SPEAKER_03]: using the whole animal bones and all well
Chia's on point 100% I would say it's more
[SPEAKER_03]: like a year ago every phone call that I
got where I need ten thousand pounds of
[SPEAKER_03]: trim a week I need ten thousand pounds of
trim a week all day every day every phone
[SPEAKER_03]: call those same people including Humboldt
County manufacturers they were
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturing centric and distillate
centric are all now think they're flower
[SPEAKER_03]: distributors they don't want they don't
even they don't even call this
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturers don't call me for trim they
call me for flour so it is completely
[SPEAKER_03]: swapped around in all those big farms and
Central Cali Central Coast Santa Barbara a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of that pots going to manufacturers so
that market is saturated more than flour
[SPEAKER_00]: it is brutal they can't sell the flower
they can't sell their flowers so fucked up
[SPEAKER_00]: they have to send the flower to
concentrate it's so bulk that's right
[SPEAKER_00]: straight up big brands brother yeah you
take any shitty weed you take any shitty
[SPEAKER_02]: weed you turn an oil you put some bullshit
turps in there and then some person be
[SPEAKER_02]: like whoa that tastes like fucking candy
it's still this shitty weed you know some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the big brands in the state that have
been shopping in that in those areas that
[SPEAKER_03]: we were just discussing are hollering at
us hard and they want to fill their jars
[SPEAKER_03]: with our herbs and they'll pay and it's
transitioning as we speak today in this
[SPEAKER_03]: moment prices for trim or we're selling
trim for averaging probably $100 a pound
[SPEAKER_03]: still today it went down and then it kind
of got went back up a little bit it was in
[SPEAKER_03]: the 50 $60 mark about six months ago and
now it's back up into the 80 to 120
[SPEAKER_03]: probably averaging about a hundred for us
I don't know what's going on out there for
[SPEAKER_03]: other people but that's what's that's what
I see all day every day we're selling
[SPEAKER_03]: flower nut to the farmer right now between
a thousand and fifteen this depends on
[SPEAKER_03]: what it is and where it's from and quality
and who it's going to I see it I see it
[SPEAKER_03]: the price actually continuing to go up for
the next 30 days I think we might see a 16
[SPEAKER_03]: we might see an 18 I think come July
August it's gonna get back down into where
[SPEAKER_03]: we're at currently today and then I think
you know fall is gonna be what it is we'll
[SPEAKER_03]: be back down into the 800 to thousand
category and we're not gonna sell pot at
[SPEAKER_06]: that price unless the farmer makes us what
when was the last time you saw 1800 yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: last time you saw 1800 we're talking depth
we're talking yeah I don't know it's been
[SPEAKER_02]: a minute um you know it's probably I don't
know five years I can't even I can't tell
[SPEAKER_02]: you the prices have been so all over the
board and you know who would have thought
[SPEAKER_02]: a pandemic would all of a sudden make the
prices go up right all of a sudden we have
[SPEAKER_02]: a everybody wants to chill at home and
smoke weed and you know I I'm doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: same thing so I totally understand um I uh
what you're asking me before too you know
[SPEAKER_02]: with the trim is yeah we wanted to do
something with everything we have so yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to sell all of it there was a time
we used to throw a shaker head off the
[SPEAKER_02]: hill didn't matter and then all of a
sudden it was worth a ton and I mean look
[SPEAKER_02]: like you said people wanted shake nobody
even wanted but so uh you know I think
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a there's something for all of it
um definitely the littles they're
[SPEAKER_02]: versatile pre-rolls you know pre-rolls are
great um you know I definitely make sure
[SPEAKER_02]: to sell every bit we can I mean it'd be
nice to make papers out of the stems if I
[SPEAKER_02]: had the right people to do it I'd love to
do that as well you know there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: good product I mean I was picking leaves
the other day and I mean they were so big
[SPEAKER_02]: and juicy I was I wanted to juice these
leaves and uh you know I've never done
[SPEAKER_02]: that or I've never drank the juice from
them but they look so great so yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: there's lots I could do with do you ever
make can agars no no what is that once we
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it's their role in a it's cool
looking but they smoke like shit man I
[SPEAKER_00]: leave I don't give hotly people you make a
yeah you make a pot leaf cigar but the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem is it doesn't fuck it tobacco no
yeah you may have wet then you heart it
[SPEAKER_00]: hardens up and it forms okay it couldn't
look any cooler but I've never had one
[SPEAKER_00]: that I enjoyed smoking very thin yeah yeah
now I'm old traditional paper smoker I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean for pricing though right now like
because they've been squelching down on
[SPEAKER_00]: all the the hot operations street prices
exploded and so I mean I think runs moving
[SPEAKER_00]: at like 32 from indoor just you know month
to two ago I had someone tell me 38 five
[SPEAKER_00]: down in the city right now so I haven't
heard those numbers in fucking years yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: so what I know is that you're gonna see
some changes in price and what fucks us in
[SPEAKER_00]: California is that there's not enough
storefronts and too much large production
[SPEAKER_00]: so is an overproduction situation it
doesn't reflect the reality of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: because we only have you know 1500 stores
so when you open this shit back up and now
[SPEAKER_00]: you have stores to move urban to the
pricing will I think rise up again but
[SPEAKER_02]: like there's some there's huge buildouts
so when all these giant buildouts happen
[SPEAKER_02]: well that's definitely gonna make the
market you know kind of flying out a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit but that's why Appalachians
humble our brands that's why we have to
[SPEAKER_02]: stay who we are because I mean those those
big those big buildouts are still they're
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna grow what they're gonna grow they're
gonna grow killer Coors Light weed you
[SPEAKER_02]: know yeah yeah it's gonna be great it'll
be great for them but we you know if we
[SPEAKER_02]: keep educating the consumers and they know
what we're growing you know and they know
[SPEAKER_02]: that we are they sell they buy my weed
it's gonna be great it's gonna be you know
[SPEAKER_02]: it's grown organically well not only that
the money I get you know I coach baseball
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm part of lots of you know things in
southern Humboldt well this money helped
[SPEAKER_02]: my community go so it's not only what
they're smoking it's where that money's
[SPEAKER_02]: going and you know what that money's
helping out it's helping out schools you
[SPEAKER_02]: know we donate you go to the basketball
gyms you see our farm names on the gyms
[SPEAKER_02]: you know so it's a it's a lot more it's a
big it's a big thing and that's what I
[SPEAKER_02]: feel this whole legal market not only are
my kids safe from having the house raided
[SPEAKER_02]: like that so many times as a child you
know but now my kids you know basketball
[SPEAKER_02]: team has Ridgeline farms on the back you
know I could put Ridgeline arms banners
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere I could I've always me and my
family have always been great you know
[SPEAKER_02]: supporters of the community but now we
could actually have our brands out there
[SPEAKER_02]: and it really makes our children proud and
you know like like Kevin said you know I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: doing this for my kids you know and that's
really it I'm doing this for the community
[SPEAKER_02]: I want southern Humboldt to thrive I want
the emerald triangle the triangle to
[SPEAKER_02]: thrive you know but uh you know we uh we
use Humboldt County this is our heritage
[SPEAKER_02]: this is what we've been doing our whole
life this is what our family our parents
[SPEAKER_02]: our grandparents I mean this is you know
this is the law there's a lot bigger
[SPEAKER_02]: picture going on right now and you know
people like you Peter you know put us out
[SPEAKER_02]: there I hate doing things like these I
wish I could because Kevin is an amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: speaker but why I'm doing this is so the
consumers can learn who we are and that we
[SPEAKER_02]: are real people and we're not just about
money we're about our families and our
[SPEAKER_02]: communities and we're about you know
giving the best herb throwing the best
[SPEAKER_02]: herb you know to the and giving it to the
the people Cheers oh yeah it's a beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: daughter right there bud we love when kids
and animals come on so you got both right
[SPEAKER_06]: now so Kevin so Kevin you you planted this
year right yeah yeah and I ran last year
[SPEAKER_00]: too I I was gonna skip the season because
the the license shit was such a freak show
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of a sudden I pulled the annual
and and a company hit me up and said hey
[SPEAKER_00]: would you be would you be willing to run a
run for us so this year though I already
[SPEAKER_00]: have my my my annual renewed and so I'm
and my farm's fully ready all the soil's
[SPEAKER_00]: been tilled all the cover crops have been
put in and I'm just waiting to go in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground when this last of this little
weather bumps and then I'm gonna run like
[SPEAKER_00]: I said I just run a full term and for me
that's that's just really because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: where I wanted to be as an older guy I
wanted to go back to what herb was to me
[SPEAKER_00]: when I was young so I've been through the
whole fucking game for as a grower I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to do an intense season and then
have the rest of the year not that I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: excited it's gonna be great yeah and and
and are you growing for your own brand are
[SPEAKER_06]: you gonna white label it or just sell it
in bulk or what's the well I'll do two
[SPEAKER_00]: things actually I'll co-brand with a
company so the the company will have me on
[SPEAKER_00]: their label for their product because I'm
growing the product from them and then I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to also grow something that wasn't
in their catalog for myself because you
[SPEAKER_00]: mean you're growing their genetics yeah
I'm growing their genetics and then I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: produce it they'll produce their product
for them and then I'll get recognition on
[SPEAKER_00]: the jar which are you allowed to say who
that is yeah yeah it's for the cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: okay so I'll also I'll do work for the
cookies and it's a good contract and what
[SPEAKER_00]: it does it allows me to be able to have
surety on the business because it it I
[SPEAKER_00]: need the stability to cover the actual
business and then what I'll do is I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: take of that 20,000 square foot I'll pull
4,000 square foot off and I'll do that
[SPEAKER_00]: myself and I have something that I really
wanted to run that just is an outlier
[SPEAKER_00]: freak and I just said you know this has to
be produced just because I got to see it
[SPEAKER_00]: in the market and then once I produce it
I'll figure out how to move it into the
[SPEAKER_00]: world from there but I just know that I
need to grow it on the hill because the
[SPEAKER_00]: quality of flowers superlative and it's
got numbers that are ridiculous under your
[SPEAKER_06]: own brand name yeah I'll do it under my
own brand name so what's the brand name
[SPEAKER_06]: get it what's the brand my brands Port
Royale okay so all right mm-hmm is your
[SPEAKER_00]: store still open it's open right yeah yeah
we were open and we just actually like I
[SPEAKER_00]: think we just officially opened up the
coffee shop the tourist area we opened up
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole thing we got a smoke lounge
going in this summer so we have a full
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor lounge going in legal smoke lounge
and we turn the store into a drive-in kind
[SPEAKER_06]: of so you have a built-in retail outlet
for your own brands I do I do but the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is that and which is cool are you
gonna carry a ridge line I'm the owner of
[SPEAKER_00]: the store but I don't handle any of the
inner transactions I can refer you to the
[SPEAKER_00]: buyer team I try you know it makes it used
to be a lot different because at one time
[SPEAKER_00]: we ran everything ourselves because that's
how the operations work but as you go
[SPEAKER_00]: forward with all this new shit it's just
not that way anymore and so the only thing
[SPEAKER_00]: I have full control over what I do is the
farm and so this is it'll be nice because
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do business that's business and then
I can do something that I want to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: myself I love the flower yeah yeah it's
great having a lot of school and
[SPEAKER_00]: coronavirus may have been a nightmare for
him in a lot of ways but the happy kids in
[SPEAKER_00]: the house it's just been great we were at
the river yesterday and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: probably go take off and hit the river
tomorrow I got some cool blow-up shit we
[SPEAKER_00]: can go down the rapids with but a lot of
it is just as a producer you have to do
[SPEAKER_00]: things that that you know will make money
because you have bills to pay the county
[SPEAKER_00]: charges me 20,000 whether I harvest the
buck or not the state charges me 14,000
[SPEAKER_00]: whether I harvest the buck or not so
that's 14 that's just what's that 34,000
[SPEAKER_00]: right there right then I got another 5k
going out to like waterboard and all this
[SPEAKER_00]: other shit so you're looking at like
almost 40 grand coming out of your pocket
[SPEAKER_00]: if whether you make a dollar and so 40
grand is almost taking home like 70 so if
[SPEAKER_00]: you make 70k you'll take home around like
42,000 so that's a 70,000 dollar a year
[SPEAKER_00]: job and the man wants your taxes boom they
want that money yeah you have to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't screw that up and so a small
portion of the cannabis on the canopy can
[SPEAKER_00]: be me so that I can kind of enjoy being
myself and then the other part is good
[SPEAKER_00]: business and I don't mind growing their
varieties because the stuff they're
[SPEAKER_00]: putting out is highly marketable and my
business dealings with the company have
[SPEAKER_00]: been nothing but good you know I have no
complaints it's been straight normal solid
[SPEAKER_00]: business and that's what I what I needed
when I you know got involved in this stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: so we just had a Los Angeles retailer on
who's vertical and also grows and has his
[SPEAKER_01]: own branded product on the shelves
including his own and I hate to bring up
[SPEAKER_01]: the dreaded two word taxes but he said the
taxes in California are so fucked up that
[SPEAKER_01]: it makes more economic sense now for him
to bolt his own flower rather than put it
[SPEAKER_01]: on his own shelf and it sounds like you're
in the same boat yeah the retail the thing
[SPEAKER_00]: with the store is that stores give you
access to people if you if you're if you
[SPEAKER_00]: do a store if it's not in a geographical
area where you get phenomenal traffic you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to make it very streamlined so when I
laid out my storefront it was designed to
[SPEAKER_00]: handle quick traffic through the facility
and have minimal staffing but intelligent
[SPEAKER_00]: people behind the counter and you know I
mean I like I think some of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: stores I've ever been to is like Dockside
up in Washington so Dockside in Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: is really well done stores where they got
a customer service level it's phenomenal
[SPEAKER_00]: and the layouts are incredible and the
fucking experience is phenomenal and so I
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a chance to check out the Dockside
operations and I was so impressed but I
[SPEAKER_00]: realized that they would not work for me
at all here because of what we're where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're at and what we're going through and
so the store is something that gives you
[SPEAKER_00]: access to the public it helps you
understand what's moving through Distro
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like a window and but it's not where
the profit is it pays for itself it pays
[SPEAKER_00]: for the investment cost to build it pays
for the employees it creates an ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a license that's in in continuing but
you know for me being a farmer especially
[SPEAKER_00]: because I actually run my own farm so I
consider myself the laborer so I get I get
[SPEAKER_00]: to pay myself labor and then I get to make
profit from my company and because I was
[SPEAKER_00]: always a person who loved to grow pot
being outside for long hours in the sun I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't see it as a punishment so like you
know for me I mean I'm a blue collar New
[SPEAKER_00]: Englander so like the work thing isn't a
problem I actually like what I do a lot I
[SPEAKER_00]: like it so much I've done it my whole
fucking life so it's there's like a dual
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit where like I get a good paycheck
as a worker and I get to do what I love
[SPEAKER_00]: but the store is more of a matter of
building supply chain components and it
[SPEAKER_00]: gives you a really good window but man for
people that have stores in areas that you
[SPEAKER_00]: know are going to be impacted by COVID
heavily in terms of financial situations
[SPEAKER_00]: man I look like pity these poor people
because you don't you don't want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody fail I don't take glee and seeing
anyone get the shit kicked out of them
[SPEAKER_00]: really like I go you know sometimes you
might deserve it but if I celebrate it too
[SPEAKER_00]: much it means I'm fucked up and so I try
not to get caught up in that and so what I
[SPEAKER_00]: know is that with us as operators each
license has its own pitfalls and they they
[SPEAKER_00]: all have a plus and a minus and you have
to clearly identify what that is before
[SPEAKER_00]: you get involved in it so that you can
understand that if you're gonna put that
[SPEAKER_00]: into your portfolio it has to cover itself
and it might not make money but it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain component that lets you have
a different type of strength in your
[SPEAKER_00]: business and I mean whoever would have
thought we had to do all this shit like
[SPEAKER_00]: really like the complexity that we're
going through to survive is mind-bending
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's people say well that's business
but I'm like I've been in business for a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time no other business you have to do
this much weird shit I mean it's crazy so
[SPEAKER_06]: so with you said it was 20,000 square feet
mm-hmm and 16 is going to the cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: collaboration yeah roughly probably like
15 because I'm actually gonna pull one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the benches out because I didn't get a
chance to to do the work on that lower
[SPEAKER_00]: bench to prep it like I was doing the
others and I just said it I sometimes you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to make sure when you're doing the
labor that it's workable and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: important to fill the whole canopy always
at the same time and that's where like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadians best examples of Canadians they
got a million square foot of green house
[SPEAKER_00]: they should have ran like a hundred
thousand square foot and instead they ran
[SPEAKER_00]: a million square foot and they only could
move 50,000 square feet so it's the same
[SPEAKER_00]: with what we're doing is I'm filling up
the quantity that I can control myself
[SPEAKER_00]: with a single worker and so up to 24 is
going that way 16 could potentially go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cookie but probably more like 14 so
I'll pull 2,000 right out of the canopy
[SPEAKER_00]: this year not run it because it when I
started laying out my time schedule on the
[SPEAKER_00]: work I realized that I'm not dialed in
enough to cover another 2,000 square foot
[SPEAKER_06]: of labor but but so with cookies are you
running their genetics or your genetics no
[SPEAKER_00]: their genetics remember I have the nursery
that supplies them so all of their all
[SPEAKER_00]: their breeders feed the nursery I'm
involved with my old nursery is a new
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery but now it's a single client
nursery and it puts the genetics that the
[SPEAKER_00]: proprietary farms the farms that catch the
first release of the lines so there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: humble population group which is farms in
Humboldt County that are going to work
[SPEAKER_00]: producing product for cookies and then
other farms within California that produce
[SPEAKER_00]: they all come get the genetics from us at
the shop and so what what we do is we just
[SPEAKER_00]: produce what's needed that would work well
in our environment so that it reflects
[SPEAKER_00]: well on the on the brand itself so it's
not a bad deal as a cultivator because
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't want to feed you shit that
won't work they want to feed you stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that works so that you have an ability to
put their product out and stuff that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing on the indoor end is
stunning it's just that when you put it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the outside you know you get a fuller
richer expression and the steering of the
[SPEAKER_00]: choices are based off of because remember
we have a test facility for that stock too
[SPEAKER_00]: so the cookies test facility for outdoors
behind the one log so we have a full light
[SPEAKER_00]: that greenhouse and an outdoor next to the
nursery that does the R&D for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: these projects so I'm not involved in that
in the sense of the R&D component other
[SPEAKER_00]: than come by and smoke with some of the
weed the one log team is which isn't bad
[SPEAKER_00]: because you get caught up in too much shit
you drown time-wise but the point is that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a thought-out process because what
they want to be able to do is create the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun-grown lines around the state to
highlight sun-grown production and then to
[SPEAKER_00]: find the varieties that shine in sun-grown
best and then let the things that shine in
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor be best because to say that people
don't like indoors to say that you'd be
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong it it's desired by two different
people and their education isn't to get
[SPEAKER_00]: people to leave indoor and go to outdoor
it's to let people know there's various
[SPEAKER_00]: grades of cannabis and that all the time
when you experience enough of it you'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to find your own balance in what you
desire and where it's grown or how it's
[SPEAKER_00]: grown but the point is to create the best
product in all the environments so that
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor is well done mixed lights well done
outdoors well done good grass is good
[SPEAKER_06]: grass right so with with um have they
guaranteed like we'll buy x volume from
[SPEAKER_06]: you or is it kind of a more fluid
relationship no it's it's what what the
[SPEAKER_00]: way you work it out with this will be the
way you work it out with any of these
[SPEAKER_00]: operations that provide you material is
that you'll um you'll produce the material
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll give them an estimation of how
much you believe is going to come off your
[SPEAKER_00]: farm based off your square footage and
your production methods and at the end of
[SPEAKER_00]: the season you do a quantification testing
to find out are you clean because before
[SPEAKER_00]: they take the product into the system so
you do a pretest pretest comes up it gives
[SPEAKER_00]: a an idea that you have no heavy metal
issues you have no microbial issues and no
[SPEAKER_00]: no no other banned substances in the
product and then it also gives them a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid level so they can get an idea
you do an estimation of your yield and you
[SPEAKER_00]: can give it to them on since i don't have
my own processing facility what i do is i
[SPEAKER_00]: pass it on to a processor but i can tell
them i have x amount of bucked flour and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they can do the calculations on what
they normally average on from bucked to
[SPEAKER_00]: finished so say i have 400 pounds bucked
we might say that comes out to 260 pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: finished that'll give them an idea broken
up off your metric configuration tags
[SPEAKER_00]: because remember this is all track and
trace and then that product moves into the
[SPEAKER_00]: chain so as long as the products have the
quality that they want it moves and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: how it should be with cannabis like any ag
product where there's no such thing as you
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it for us we take it off your hands
even if it's shit so like that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: work like that because who would who would
do that in business right so there's
[SPEAKER_00]: always an incentive for the farmer to make
sure they do a good job because this way
[SPEAKER_00]: the product moves and if a brand is
willing to work with you as a farmer it's
[SPEAKER_00]: your responsibility as a farmer to make
that brand look good regardless who it is
[SPEAKER_00]: i don't give a shit if it's the littlest
distributor to the to the biggest company
[SPEAKER_00]: as the farmer your obligation is to farm
the damn weed and do your best job and
[SPEAKER_00]: when we do that we do a good job and so i
don't mind growing other people's products
[SPEAKER_00]: and i know in the future as the
appellations come in we'll start to
[SPEAKER_00]: stabilize what we actually produce and run
in these areas so that customers can get
[SPEAKER_00]: the same product a couple years in a row
my only problem with flipping varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: frequently is that you don't get the
repeat buy next year on the same product
[SPEAKER_00]: unless where's it coming from if it's not
coming from you and so i think that as we
[SPEAKER_00]: go forward and you have enough producers
producing enough cannabis on the bulk
[SPEAKER_00]: level we'll be able to go back to not
having to chase the strain du jour and
[SPEAKER_00]: work with things that shine on our
property i only produce a thousand pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: a thousand pounds moves into the system
and that's what i produce every year so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like saying i'm going to produce a
thousand cases of wine that's what i
[SPEAKER_00]: produce that's just how it is and we can
use other agricultural models to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how that works and it doesn't
help us in a congested california market
[SPEAKER_00]: but if i'm looking down the road it most
fucking surely does because what i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: building is a quality market because don't
tell me people don't like no shit i mean
[SPEAKER_00]: people can drink all the fucking Budweiser
they want but i haven't had a can of that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit in a long time and i don't drink a
lot of beer so but if i want a beer i go
[SPEAKER_00]: get what i like and if i'm at someone's
house and they offer me a Budweiser and
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm chilling i'll drink them too i'm not
going to turn it down but the point is you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't ever see me go to the store and buy
12 pack of that shit so i know that if and
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm not saying i'm every consumer but
people kind of operate pretty similarly we
[SPEAKER_00]: just have to create a level of production
quality that is seen by all our craft
[SPEAKER_00]: regions so that people start to understand
that craft herb is good and then they can
[SPEAKER_00]: start to find regions of products that
they like and things that shine in certain
[SPEAKER_00]: areas and the main point for all of us in
production sales manufacturing processing
[SPEAKER_00]: is to is to try to build a steady reliable
business model that's based off of paying
[SPEAKER_00]: the fucking people back that you took the
product from just do the goddamn business
[SPEAKER_00]: and that way what it does is everybody
trusts each other because you've got 55
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking contracts but if i don't trust you
i don't give a shit anymore i don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to deal with you and we really went back
to what we used to do way back in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: where we kind of looked at each other and
said we're both here for the long term
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah we both fuck up we lose money yeah
now we can do business and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that resonates to the customer
because what it says is we're here for the
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking long term and we're willing to
fight for that and that means we care it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not it's not on a portfolio sheet of i
have a weed farm you know i'm in weed
[SPEAKER_00]: business that's great are you are you a
dedicated producer are you like chris is a
[SPEAKER_00]: dedicated purveyor so he was a producer
but now he's a purveyor he looks to find
[SPEAKER_00]: the things that are quality to put into
the market jason's the creator of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things like the it's a chain without each
person doing the best doesn't work hey
[SPEAKER_03]: kevin can do you mind can i ask a question
and just say fucking i don't have the
[SPEAKER_03]: answer for you obviously if you if you
can't answer but yeah yeah how do you how
[SPEAKER_03]: do you and cookies determine what the
price point is on your pot next year in
[SPEAKER_00]: that contract you know if if a lot of it
works off of you know the when you're when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going through a supply chain that
with all the processes are controlled they
[SPEAKER_00]: know how much the product has to cost in
order for those touch points to make money
[SPEAKER_00]: through the chain for them too so you get
an idea and the whole point of like the
[SPEAKER_00]: appalachian situation just like the
farmer's reserve is to bring a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: attention to a product it starts to allow
you to have a little higher pricing for
[SPEAKER_00]: the farmer because the actual untrimmed
herb a little less trimmed and a bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: container saves you money on packaging and
trimming so the way you approach the the
[SPEAKER_00]: final piece has to be backwards from the
retail because ultimately people are
[SPEAKER_00]: saying pounds are going to go for 100
bucks and i'm like well it costs me 160
[SPEAKER_00]: just to grow the fucking pound so how can
i sell it for 100 bucks if it's 160 to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it impossible i got fucking taxes the
taxes are more than the prices people are
[SPEAKER_00]: quoting and i'm just like it's impossible
the taxes dictate the price through the
[SPEAKER_00]: chain and then the idea is to figure out
how do we over time get our design
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a better quality product and so
because of that you'll be able to put a
[SPEAKER_00]: premium across the board on it that's
reasonable for the customer but also gives
[SPEAKER_00]: another point to everyone downstream from
you which then gives you long-term shit if
[SPEAKER_00]: you are not making money we do business
forever it's when we start having no money
[SPEAKER_03]: that we start not doing business thank you
so much that makes all the sense in the
[SPEAKER_03]: world it's pretty much like reverse
engineering yeah you got to go backwards
[SPEAKER_06]: from the retail yep i get it thank you
easy so so i think we'll close on that
[SPEAKER_06]: because i gotta deal with dinner but we
still have like 150 people tuned in monday
[SPEAKER_06]: night we're gonna have an aquaponics
section session with steve raisner potent
[SPEAKER_06]: ponics leading the discussion all of our
guests today will be receiving a
[SPEAKER_06]: grassroots fabric pots living soil raised
bed so you guys have to send me your
[SPEAKER_06]: mailing addresses and uh on that note
