[SPEAKER_02]: Alright, well we're here with Walter and
Judy from Soul Spirit Farms and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing a farm interview today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's get started with some questions
for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you tell us about your background
with cannabis and how you got started?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I started using cannabis as medicine
when I injured my back in 92.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found it was the only thing that really
took care of my pain and also,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it did a better job than the
pharmaceuticals and I didn't like the
[SPEAKER_01]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my intro.
[SPEAKER_01]: 92.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you started farming at that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I started farming pretty shortly after
I met Judy when Jerry Garcia died.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started touring around the country and
went into Louisiana and there was no
[SPEAKER_01]: flower there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got to, you know, I need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really, you know, it makes me
functional.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I sat down, read the grower's guide
from cover to cover and went to the
[SPEAKER_01]: hardware store and bought some lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: Classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was all in the hardware store at that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was no grow stores, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in 96.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had to get the like 150 watt metal
halide street lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Porch lights, porch lights, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A couple of porch lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Combine them into a single housing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, had a couple of seeds
in a jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it was just luckily I'd saved some
seeds at one point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that experience of taking that,
you know, inanimate object or seemingly
[SPEAKER_01]: inanimate object and then a couple of
months later being able to share super
[SPEAKER_01]: tasty, homegrown, loving medicine with...
Did it turn out what the flowers are?
[SPEAKER_01]: The flower was fluffy and whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It wasn't perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was, it was really good kind buds
in Baton Rouge, Louisiana in 96.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which, yeah, there was no hiding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd share a little bit with somebody and
they'd call me out in seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd be like, where did this come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no hiding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was just that I fell in love at
that moment with the whole experience of
[SPEAKER_01]: it, every part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like for you, farming cannabis is
about the medicine and the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sharing that medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with people and being able to help
other people out like that is special too,
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And needing it myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell us about your farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what's going on with Soul Spirit?
[SPEAKER_02]: How long have you guys been in operation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so we've been farming out there for
20 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: No till the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a permaculture background.
[SPEAKER_01]: Took some courses previous to even buying
land.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that helped with the search of like,
okay, we need good sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to be efficient with things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have two wheel drive access to our
farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have gravity for water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have all these little things that make
it a pretty good little spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've been, like I said,
practicing no till for 20 years in this
[SPEAKER_01]: one area where we're farming the cannabis
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just working on reducing our inputs
the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never have brought in the heavy equipment
and flattened or graded or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in the true native soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a true permaculture experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been following you guys for a while
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys really are a shining example
for this model of permaculture type
[SPEAKER_02]: systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are Dragonfly Earth medicine
certified, is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Sun and Earth certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, because you guys are the one
farm that I know of that actually uses
[SPEAKER_02]: animal husbandry as sort of connected with
the farming practices that in Willow Creek
[SPEAKER_02]: is one of the few that do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely not the everyday farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do try and, like I said, do everything
we can to reduce those inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: In all the ways we gather some leaves out
of our forest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now we have this problem with
too much small brush and trees in our
[SPEAKER_01]: forest from previous logging and bad
management.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so using that material to build our
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then we don't have to go out to
somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys mulch it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Heavy mulch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Heavy mulching is one of my main things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys have a chipper?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always struggled with large scale
mulching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so previous to having good access to a
chipper, we used a lot of the forest
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we would buy some organic rice straw
or something like that or whatever to
[SPEAKER_01]: supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trying to buy things from locally
produced.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we now are working with the Willow
Creek Fire Safe Council.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I have access to their chipper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: To help out with the forest area around
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the meantime, I get to put some of
those chips on our own land.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, actually we both ended
up in Humboldt originally as environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: activists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when we first came through,
it was right during Redwood summer and
[SPEAKER_00]: there was a lot of activism, direct action
going on trying to save the old growth
[SPEAKER_00]: Redwoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once we kind of decided that we
wanted a homestead of our own,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the perspective that we
came to this all from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our background.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's important to us is living
sustainably, working in concert with the
[SPEAKER_00]: land.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is also how we go about farming
cannabis because that's ultimately the
[SPEAKER_00]: most important thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an expression of our activism is this
farm, this homestead and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be able to share that with people
is super important to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes through in the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about hiding anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about like, let's be regenerative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's build this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's sequester carbon as much as we can
and make a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you talked about using mulch and leaf
from the forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys have any other interesting
methodologies that you work with?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're dabbling in a little of this and a
little of that for sure and trying to find
[SPEAKER_01]: what is the most regenerative we're
working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those mulch piles naturally give us
those indigenous microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can put that pile of wood chips in the
forest and use it like a rice box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like IMO.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, in essence, your own version of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of doing that, rice,
all that, well, if I have a couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: yards of over here and a couple of yards
over here and a couple of yards over
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the large just scaled up
version.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so then I can just mix those chips in
and then we can spread those out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've done an IMO on our thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any opinion?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know if any types of wood work
better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have like hardwoods that work
better?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, for me, it's what's local is
super important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do want, you know, I don't think
it wouldn't be good to be all like dug
[SPEAKER_01]: for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be a little bit much,
probably.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a little bit of pine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, as long as you can let it
sit for a while and let it start
[SPEAKER_01]: decomposing, let that maicillium start
running through that pile, it's really not
[SPEAKER_01]: too much of a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can chip in the leaves with it,
then that helps with that, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and not be such a because it's carbon.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's it's acts like a carbon filter and
it grabs onto things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at first it can lock up some
nutrients if it is just wood chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is whole tree chips and brush and
all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Already pre decomposing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and then so then, yeah, we run it
through with all those material and then,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, then let it pre decompose some.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that really, you know,
yeah, that gets it all going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really makes it so that there any
of those problems should should,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, let your nose know, you know,
go in and smell that pile and make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: it's got that, you know, earthy yummy
smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it smells super pungent, like a crazy
walnut, whatever sort of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be a little wary of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but and then if you mix it,
too, you know, so we have, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: when we're mulching those trees,
it's madrone, it's dug for its tan oak,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, yeah, and it's all it all
becomes good love in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for that info.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as far as, you know, they always say
that growing is half the battle and
[SPEAKER_02]: harvesting and drying is another half of
the battle for preservation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys have any, you know, have you have
you dialed that in?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have any, you know, techniques you
like to for your flowers that make your
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so we do a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that help for sure is one thing is
we're we're all right there on site close
[SPEAKER_01]: by.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the there's no hauling totes of weed
halfway across the country or whatever in
[SPEAKER_01]: the back of a truck.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just hand carried to the drying room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that reduces impacts and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to not fill overfill my,
you know, just be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be careful and appreciative of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was cringed when I see the people on the
top of a ladder throwing their nuggets
[SPEAKER_01]: down into a bin.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's trichomes on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, let's let's keep those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because to me, it's it's all sacred
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have like the special jar here
and here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'm going to say for myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's all special.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all, you know, and so I want to treat
it all that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, like we do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We we do light depth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that gives us the ability to
stagger our harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that gives us the ability to dry
for a little longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dry cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, take that and slow that process
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's too often just nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that, I think, is super key to not
losing your terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's I mean, that's one of the major
differences, too, as far as like if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking craft cannabis versus mass
produced is someone who's trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: squeeze every little bit of profit out of
it is going to speed those processes up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, things are lost when you
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to really create craft cannabis,
you take your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, does this cultivar take,
you know, 10 days in the drying room to be
[SPEAKER_00]: at its fullest expression?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, is it, you know,
maybe it's 12, maybe one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the same thing is 10 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the next year, something's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's but you have you can't you
have to do what you're doing based on what
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have it some set regimen in your
head or on paper and be like forcing your
[SPEAKER_00]: will upon the whole system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about listening and smelling and
using your senses to figure out when
[SPEAKER_00]: something's ready and going with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And letting those plants finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: All good things to those who not be in a
hurry to, you know, harvest that because,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, oh, you know, you got to got to
wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, speaking of waiting, we've been
waiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been waiting to check out some of
these flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we see what the three samples are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we brought this soul shine,
which I think it's a it's a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: special, really refreshing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a turpinoline dominant, which is one
of the rare turpenes to have dominant in
[SPEAKER_01]: your in your flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a little bit like trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is turpinoline dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trainwreck.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that sort of some of those
characteristics to it, which a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people think of as pining, but it's it's
another turpinoline that is in a pine
[SPEAKER_01]: tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it does have that that pining.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it doesn't have much pining,
but it had had a really good amount of
[SPEAKER_01]: turpinoline and well rounded.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's like not the proper term to
use anymore, but indica or sativa.
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's activating.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good good breakfast focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you got to go to that meeting and
maintain your focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also still potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tests well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing product.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Round two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Round two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this one here came out just just
glorious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The white runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The white runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice nose on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just really special all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was really impressed with with that
plant altogether.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been hearing some really good things
about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been breeding with it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good set of genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we ran the other runs without the
white in front of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just run.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's all the same parent,
just different phenos of the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this phenom better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked better for our farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell it's a beautiful flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so like got some purple and it checks
all the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a good one for converting people
who think they only like indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's always one of my favorite
things to do is to go down to a place like
[SPEAKER_01]: L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: and pop jars out and be able to show
people once they come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really fire indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might have been buying it as indoor
for the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Check the technique.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that about kind of the regenerative
cannabis and permaculture community.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just they produce quality of flowers
that are really comparable to some really
[SPEAKER_02]: high grade cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just all about the biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe it is the highest grade.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's nowhere you're going to
get, you know, three per cent terpenes and
[SPEAKER_01]: all that without the sun and the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, that's one I haven't smelled in a
while.
[SPEAKER_02]: Headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think I grew it like 10 years ago and I
just haven't seen it around very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I haven't been around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of the things, too,
is we like, you know, for me, more
[SPEAKER_01]: important than that THC number is,
well, how is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's the effect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I found that that doesn't
correlate very well with THC number.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one that doesn't tend to test over
20 percent even.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hardly marketable.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you tell people headband and
like, yeah, that's the that's the jar that
[SPEAKER_01]: gets hit the hardest at the at the Emerald
Cup event or something like that.
Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and and it does.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you know, it smells amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know what terpenes these are this
is dominant in?
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's karyophyllene dominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, it really kind of reminds me of an
oil refinery.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lived in Louisiana, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my gosh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about gas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's a classic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the headband.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important for people to keep the
classics growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we don't, if we lose all the
stuff that tests, you know, around 20 or
[SPEAKER_00]: even lower, it will be gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and we may discover like,
oh, wow, there was properties in that that
[SPEAKER_00]: healed Crohn's disease or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we'll lose it if we get so focused on
these high THC producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's horrible that that there is a
risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, and and it's so tempting to
go down that road like, well, if they all
[SPEAKER_01]: finished in eight weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, but then you're limited to certain
variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That doesn't that doesn't please me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not pleased.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm that daytime activating sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm farming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be awake and focused.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't find I need that knockout.
[SPEAKER_01]: Variety except to knock myself out at the
end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do mostly smoke, you know,
like sour diesel is another we grew and
[SPEAKER_01]: just love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it came out close to four
percent turps and just, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: super fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, like that's that's but it
takes a long time to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's not on very many menus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I didn't bring that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys want to talk about where you can
find your products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, it's that's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to get out into more and more
stores, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's always as a hard hard thing is
without marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in Sebastopol, they have maybe not all
of these in particular, but they have
[SPEAKER_00]: several of our different cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're a really huge supporter of
small regenerative farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I support that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those types of businesses is what we need
to spend our money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the retailers who are going out of
their way to support small regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: farms, if people go and support them,
then maybe others will think, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that is actually like it's
worthwhile for me to create space on my
[SPEAKER_00]: shelves for these types.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: A great place down in the L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a CESPE that's really just.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CESPE Creek Collection Collective in
Ojai.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're probably sun grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regenerative flower and have created
because that's what we've found is if if
[SPEAKER_01]: if we can get that retailer to put in a
little bit of that education.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that person comes in and says,
well, what do you have that's five hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: percent THC, you know, you like,
hey, well, can we can we talk about that a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like because in our experience,
you know, that's not the number that
[SPEAKER_01]: matters.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had some really good flower that
doesn't test high for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would prefer it usually over,
you know, something that's test really
[SPEAKER_01]: high, but is is less of a broad spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when we're focusing on any one
thing, we're going to lose some of some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's just like, you know,
for lack of a better term, entourage
[SPEAKER_02]: effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Loosely coined, but has a lot of interplay
dynamics with all of the combination of
[SPEAKER_02]: all the secondary metabolites.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you get a store that'll that'll help
helps you know, with that narration,
[SPEAKER_01]: then, you know, we do great.
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds like a great push for the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turpenes over THC is the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and also, you know, for the
customer who is looking for earth
[SPEAKER_00]: conscious flower, you know, people who go
out of their way to buy organic food or
[SPEAKER_00]: spend a little bit more money on something
that's fair trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the people that are looking for
flower like ours.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really for flower like everybody in
the Willow Creek Cannabis Alliance,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that is the difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, between what we're offering
and what you might get from a hundred acre
[SPEAKER_00]: farm somewhere in a place that has a lot
of other industrial agriculture with risks
[SPEAKER_00]: of all sorts of pesticide drift and,
you know, all sorts of stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, we just think it's
really important that farms like ours are
[SPEAKER_00]: able to remain in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there are people that want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just unfortunately, sometimes they
don't know that it's even an option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's great that we're able to,
you know, provide content like this,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that helps people find out that
it's an option, that it's a choice that
[SPEAKER_00]: they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great look.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's probably you guys
just said like a dozen different things
[SPEAKER_02]: that we could spin off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess the final question would be if
there's one thing in the industry you
[SPEAKER_02]: could see changed either regarding,
you know, like education or regulations,
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you think like the most important
thing would be that you'd like to see
[SPEAKER_02]: changed if you had to pick one?
[SPEAKER_01]: To pick one, it would, because it's a big
one, it would be the tax because that is
[SPEAKER_01]: creating just a chain reaction of
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: If because we don't have those economies
of scale that those giant farms have,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of our little costs are a little bit
higher.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that all gets taxed and then
taxed again and then taxed again and up to
[SPEAKER_01]: seven or something different times that
that's getting taxed or more even.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to where and then that gets to the
retailer who then, you know, has to make
[SPEAKER_01]: their margin too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our little difference in price
keeps getting amplified and amplified.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what what we're looking at in the
current market situation that the tax is
[SPEAKER_01]: completely out of control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is crippling the entire industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate to call it industry, but whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crippling us as the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crippling the wholesaler,
the transportation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the whole there's no margins because
the government is taking such a huge cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're taking so many slices that it all
adds up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they had that event yesterday in
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't I didn't follow it too closely,
but it was, you know, to repeal the taxes,
[SPEAKER_01]: to repeal the cultivation tax,
and then also to give the equity farmer,
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry, equity retailers, a break on the 15
percent state tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think Newsom is going to follow
through with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he's a politician and following
through isn't there necessarily their
[SPEAKER_01]: specialty, but he's definitely made some
some noises in that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can just we have to keep up the
pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let let them know, because it really
like so much tax on anything is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: direct people to going elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And elsewhere is the traditional black
market, whatever you want to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The old market and and that's,
you know, crippling the legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then and then, you know, to have our
prices be just so high really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really prevents people from being able to
get access, good medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I had one thing I would change,
I would be I know it's a pipe dream,
[SPEAKER_02]: but direct to consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree with you because so we operate
a little but in breakfast at our farm in
[SPEAKER_00]: the summers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, I cannot sell our own
cannabis to our guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about the vineyard model
and like the wine tasting model,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a huge tourism boon for Napa and
other counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it is odd to me that the
government is fine with people drinking
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol and basically driving around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's OK for those vineyards to
directly sell bottles of wine to the
[SPEAKER_00]: people that come for those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet I cannot do that when somebody
comes to stay at our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to actually have my flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it leaves the farm and it goes
to the distributor, which currently our
[SPEAKER_00]: distributor is in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would then package it down in Long
Beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then if I want it to be able to have
access for my guests, I would actually
[SPEAKER_00]: have to then get it shipped back to a
retail location nearby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would have to have my guest go to
that retail location to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What a supply chain fiasco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yes, I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The direct to consumer sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that they should allow some
amount of on farm sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people want that experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're looking for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know there's all sorts of things popping
up with that farm, you know, farm visits.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys are doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people that have stayed have had this
amazing time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really been it's been good for us to
really talk about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you might as well just plug that
really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys do offer this service,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, one of our whole original
reasons for settling on this particular
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of property was that we wanted to be
able to introduce people to permaculture
[SPEAKER_00]: and natural building and, you know,
just sustainable living in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's fun now that they can come and
we have the cannabis growing on site as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it opens it up to a whole other
group of people who maybe they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: think that they're just coming because
they like weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they find out like, oh,
wow, actually, look at all this other cool
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think that sometimes it like
sparks a little a little change in them,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, shift in mind, which is sort of
what we're all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thank you so much for coming and
talking today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really been interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Russell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'll smoke some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we should try that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
