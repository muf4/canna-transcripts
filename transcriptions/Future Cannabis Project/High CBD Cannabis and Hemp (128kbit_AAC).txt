[SPEAKER_00]: Low and behold, when the first labs come
out, that was Steep Hill was first,
[SPEAKER_00]: then Pure Analytics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pure Analytics comes out, Samantha Mill is
a brilliant scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I meet her and she says, hey,
I can do predicative work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, nice, let's look into
predicative work and find out what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start to take a look at what's taking
place with Lawrence's work and what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing with the Kanatonic line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we start pulling out the outliers that
let us breed these lines to get a greater
[SPEAKER_00]: stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawrence ends up passing away from cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He gives me his whole collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I then diffuse it into the cannabis
community so that it's in the hands of
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put on all these programs on how to
cultivate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I put them in touch with
extractors that had the ability to do
[SPEAKER_00]: medical extraction so that all these
patients would be self-sustaining.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't a medical guy prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a historic black market cultivator,
technician, trafficker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I take over dispensary 11 years ago
and I get humanized from the experience
[SPEAKER_00]: because I see real need for medical stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, these people are
absolutely dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tripped me out because I'd never
been around people who were dying before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see people die from gunshots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see not slow death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did not know what it looked like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't realize that you could
replace so much medicine from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went on this run.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm involved in the foundation of
modern CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say, hey, this is going to be
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lo and behold, they start to mine
Kentucky hemp, Chinese hemp, because
[SPEAKER_00]: people say, hey, we can just use this and
it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it does work to a degree, but the
efficiency isn't the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the overall spectrum of benefits isn't
the same because you're not receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to give you CBD alone,
but CBD has to have some THC present in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to be optimized for uptake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because the way the receptors
release and recover it, you get a longer
[SPEAKER_00]: recovery rate, longer sickle grade in the
body if we have THC present.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, what's the hemp just has no THC at all
in it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Below 0.3.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not that it doesn't have any THC
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that hemp wasn't selected for
smoking purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp wasn't selected for smoking purposes,
fiber purposes only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I realized as just this
revelation was that none of us smoke land
[SPEAKER_00]: race cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: As much as people think it's land race,
it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took land race populations and they
chose the plants they wanted to use for
[SPEAKER_00]: their patches, propagated it, cultivated
it, and then they kept the males they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to pollinate the seed for next year
into the females they wanted to use for
[SPEAKER_00]: next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as man touches that shit,
it's a cultivated variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Land race is naturally occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what they could do in Afghanistan,
Africa, is they could go into land race
[SPEAKER_00]: populations and find the outliers that
lived through the drought that year,
[SPEAKER_00]: lived through the local locust.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that lived through the locust,
they could then add to the genealogical
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that survived this new pathogenic
issue, add it to the genealogical
[SPEAKER_00]: population.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get the genealogical information
present.
[SPEAKER_00]: But fundamentally, that cannabis was used
as medicine and it was used in CBD form.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're equatorial, and just because I
got to see so much data, I started going,
[SPEAKER_00]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that we consider psychoactive
on spiritual use, stuff we want,
[SPEAKER_00]: heady weed, that all comes from zero to 20
on the equator, that's where people had
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible lifestyle, where you had plenty
of water, you didn't have to worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: freezing to death in the winter,
it wasn't over 90 degrees, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: never that hot on the equator,
because I used to work on the equator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not that hot, it's just incredible
sun intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you start to get above 20 to 40,
and it's in the 30s that we're talking
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanistan, Pakistan, where you have some
of the most savage weather known to
[SPEAKER_00]: mankind, and no water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started realizing that it breaks
down really pretty well, where the easier
[SPEAKER_00]: your life was is where you cultivated
spiritual cerebral cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more you moved away from the zero
towards the 40, where basically it ended
[SPEAKER_00]: all normal cannabis production,
you started having CBD dominant cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: on one to one ratio cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nope, not hardier, better for you to
consume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hardier in a sense that it works in that
environment, but not hardier if you bring
[SPEAKER_00]: it down to the equator, because it has to
have an ability to work with all stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: we're talking about over the 30,
and that range is high desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because high desert is considered in
a definition, less than 10 inches of rain
[SPEAKER_00]: a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I need to have a different type of root
system, and I need to have a different
[SPEAKER_00]: type of leaf structure to be a more
efficient radiator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to have an ability to control
desiccation more, so higher trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: levels, because triches really do help
desiccation the drying out of the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lo and behold, how do you hold
flour in Morocco?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I started getting into hash
making, probably like, let me see,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would have been around same 99,
2000, I started doing all my water process
[SPEAKER_00]: back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lady who had lived in Morocco for
about four years, and she was showing us
[SPEAKER_00]: what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes, you guys are not letting this
shit dry out enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, you have to take it to zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I started coming up with my own
drying systems in pizza boxes,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I used big commercial coffee
grinders to do the microplaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when me and Brandon hook up from 3rd
Gen, he was dying, because I was using
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee grinders to microplane 15 years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it did was it let me make really
high quality bubble, and we had access to
[SPEAKER_00]: truckloads of shake at the time coming out
of all the huge mass of indoors,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it was a waste product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had all these massive operations
where we would run all the ice water hash
[SPEAKER_00]: through the systems, and then run it
through the filtration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we would dry it in the pizza
racks in the house, and then micro it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then run it through dye presses that I
had welders whip up for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once the material, once they got
tired of that varietal, I would just
[SPEAKER_00]: repress it in new dye.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would throw it in a brand new dye,
repress it again, and it would come out as
[SPEAKER_00]: a brand new product as far as the store
was concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd be like, oh my god, that's a much
better product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same product in another form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like the turkey bag
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You bring it to them in one turkey bag,
they don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go back in the house, bring it back in
another turkey bag, they'll take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, they'll take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that, and so we would deliver
a really high quality product,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you start to see the nuances of
perception.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point was, she was telling me that
they have tins the way they tin up the
[SPEAKER_00]: hash in Morocco, where they're holding it
for years with no mold, no holdability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started realizing, I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because the flour degrades so quickly
in these very low humidity environments
[SPEAKER_00]: that they can't hold flour, and that's why
hash production was valuable for these
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you were to look at the hash from
any of those countries, it would have a
[SPEAKER_00]: way more balanced chemotype.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd see a much more dominant CBD ratio,
so not disproportionate, but more like a
[SPEAKER_00]: one to one, or a one to .5.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I started getting all the
Pakistani genetics getting shipped in from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Pakistani hash fields, the first thing
I did was propped it all up, and then sent
[SPEAKER_00]: it to the lab, so I could start to take a
look at it on a predicative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it let me understand what was
inside, and that's when I started
[SPEAKER_00]: realizing this hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started being able to put together a
lifetime of doing this and saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: whoa, the data says this, which makes
sense for what we think, therefore that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know that with all these varietals
that came through, all the original
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghanis, if you run all those originals,
they're like 9%.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got low numbers, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We skewed them, and then, unfortunately,
the storefronts are obsessed with
[SPEAKER_00]: numerics, and it completely screws up the
reality of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It screws it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like it's leveling back out.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the fruits come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fruits are coming in because that's
trip levels now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's skewed turp levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have stuff that's 2.6 on a total
turp that's ungodly quality that you would
[SPEAKER_00]: say it has five times the turp levels of a
5% because the numbers don't quantify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like saying, I always use,
yeah, you're pretty, but you're not a nice
[SPEAKER_00]: person.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, you can add 100 pretty points,
and you keep adding pretty points.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep adding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep adding them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't change the fact that you suck
to be around, so I'm good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just get the fuck out of the car.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it is to me with cannabis,
where there's no reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the only way to perceive this
stuff in real life is to understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: there's things that you can use in context
to understand where we're going wrong with
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're doing now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as the reality comes in and people
become more educated, it'll be a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why when I get to mess around
with Abrams, where at first they were
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like the wine industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get all these top wine execs come in,
and they attack me on judging weed because
[SPEAKER_00]: they go, we want to take over the industry
and how sommeliers run it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, the key difference between you
and I, my friend, is that you're judging
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoids and ethyl alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no matter what alcohol you're playing
with, it's the same basic booze,
[SPEAKER_00]: ethyl alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can put it in your mouth and spit it
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't spit out the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's in the cannabinoids that the
effect is dominated by, so you have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So eventually it traumatized them because
they said, you basically have to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: career weed smoker to be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, yeah, because I got to be able
to smoke 40 varieties and tell you,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the one that worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I hang out with normal
individuals, they're like, you're a drug
[SPEAKER_00]: addict because they watch me smoke so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, no, I'm not a drug addict.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that I can function normally on
high levels of intoxication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can discern, this was the one that
worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you put them all back in the cookie
jar, I'll still pull the same one out over
[SPEAKER_00]: and over again, because that's what we do
for a living.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not me, it's other people like me.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a career, you're a career.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the wine guys finally were like,
all right, all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then we had a better relationship
because they weren't being so adversarial
[SPEAKER_00]: because they're very intelligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of them are PhD scientists and
viticulturists and sommelier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sort of them, they're like the top of
the food chain and how things are
[SPEAKER_00]: perceived.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can smoke with them some reefer and
they're on their hands and knees begging
[SPEAKER_00]: for me to take them home so I can put them
into a cot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just like, you ain't judging
anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know that to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to be able to say,
hey, these are the things that happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the public is the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I get academics to come in,
each individual that comes into cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to disprove what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because you're not one of their peers,
you must not be as sharp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so therefore, our lifetime of doing
this at every level humanly possible
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't mean anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this from this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they find out is that they're
mistaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you end up building a
relationship so now you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I don't pretend to be a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am fascinated with science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use scientists.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm a field operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm about getting product to the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm about helping farmers get product
to the table.
