[SPEAKER_01]: Ron, we'd like to get started with the
nursery model and where you're at today in
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ron Edwards, CK Nursery out of Willets.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run a nursery, have been in business
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our, we were in the 9.31 program
as a nursery cultivator and last year we
[SPEAKER_00]: switched over to just strictly a nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long fight to get the nursery
going because it's kind of been an
[SPEAKER_00]: overlooked parts of the regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the original regulations came out,
it looked really good and easy that a
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery was able to self transport and to
me that was the attractive side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something I've been doing for a long
time and the state is continuing to refine
[SPEAKER_00]: the nursery regulations as myself and now
there's a group of about seven of us that
[SPEAKER_00]: are starting to organize having a little
cloud as a nursery organization to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: state to realize that the needs of a
nursery are unique, particularly even down
[SPEAKER_00]: to the distributor transport license
because we are not transporting the
[SPEAKER_00]: product when it or storing it at a very
valuable stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're trying to get the camera
requirements and the GPS requirements,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of that removed because unlike if you
are a cultivator, you have your finalized
[SPEAKER_00]: products, you have that stored at a
location and then you move it from that
[SPEAKER_00]: storage location out to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas with a nursery, you just are
moving that product from your cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: area to your vehicle to be delivered on
that aspect of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a lot of track and trace
regulations yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The county has track and trace regulations
but as currently the state was proposing
[SPEAKER_00]: that plants had to be tagged when they
were eight inches tall but we pointed out
[SPEAKER_00]: to them that if you take the lollipop rock
wool cube, you could be at eight inches
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're not even rooted yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're just continuing to work on the
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also as far as farmers markets go,
last year we were able to sell a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: product to farmers markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a really good opportunity for us to
have direct interaction with customers to
[SPEAKER_00]: determine their microclimate, whether
they're a hoop house full season,
[SPEAKER_00]: if they were growing CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now we don't have that contact so
we're doing it through social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little more difficult to do it that way
but we're still working through it and
[SPEAKER_00]: hopefully the county here, we're really
pushing for the county to have farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: markets because to promote an individual
farmer or brand, that customer really
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to see you and talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you can build that brand up
because as your product goes out,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we have clones and dispensaries,
it's just a customer coming in and buying
[SPEAKER_00]: it and they really don't get that full
understanding of what it is we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we as a nursery are working to get
labels that will have more information,
[SPEAKER_00]: QR codes so that our customers when they
see the product on the shelf can get back
[SPEAKER_00]: to us to know what our clones are like.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say we hope to do that,
it's because currently with only seven
[SPEAKER_00]: permitted nurseries, we're having a hard
time keeping up with supplies as
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation styles have changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going from the 9.31 program to where you
had 99 plants to now 10,000 square feet,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators are needing 1,000 clones as
opposed to where they were looking for two
[SPEAKER_00]: to 300 before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's gonna be really important with
your nursery to start working with a
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery schedule so that you can tell
your nursery that hey, I need X number of
[SPEAKER_00]: clones at this height on this date to make
it work better.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also learning as nurseries that we
will start to be taking prepayments as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as the dreaded penalty that you get
at your auto mechanic.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't pick up your product on a
certain time, it's going to cost you so
[SPEAKER_00]: much more per day because as a nursery
operator, we are limited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have 2,200 square feet but it's
really hard because in reality,
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the nurseries here in Mendocino
County are really a cottage nursery as
[SPEAKER_00]: we're looking at the regulations to
expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I look at my business plan as the way
the county is currently set without
[SPEAKER_00]: transferability, there's only so much
money I'm willing to put into my business
[SPEAKER_00]: and not knowing that I can recoup that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also not really clear on what has to
be remediated if you shut down your
[SPEAKER_00]: garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I get a cannabis currently,
the county when you get a building permit
[SPEAKER_00]: is putting cannabis on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm waiting for some transition in that
for them to say that it's just a regular
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse that way it wouldn't be part of
any extinguishing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was going on that's still not really
clear yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as the county goes,
it's going to be the nursery is a
[SPEAKER_00]: commitment and I don't know how long it
can be because it's going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: No other large scale agricultural nursery
takes such a labor intense approach to
[SPEAKER_00]: reproduction that we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really is not efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you are having a person take a cut,
put it in a cutting and take care of all
[SPEAKER_00]: that and early on in this process,
I was talking to a venture capitalist and
[SPEAKER_00]: the first thing he said is, can you have a
robot do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you're going to see in the
future will be more of tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: where it'll actually be up to the
cultivator to spend more time or there'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be some type of intermediate nursery type
operation to raise that from the little
[SPEAKER_00]: micro propagation up to what you want
because I do understand as we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to be more efficient, we'd like
somebody else to spend that time to get
[SPEAKER_00]: that plant up to a good size so that all
you as a cultivator have to do is flower
[SPEAKER_00]: but that takes time and money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking at that, I do know that most
nursery prices are higher this year
[SPEAKER_00]: because we are all now starting to have to
take in account the license fees,
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're at and really looking at it as
a business instead of just doing it with
[SPEAKER_00]: volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas cultivation, before we just knew
that if we sold 10,000 clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: we did good and we really weren't looking
at our bottom line but now we're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: start to figure out actually what is our
production cost on that so that we can get
[SPEAKER_00]: a good product out to do that and so
that's kind of where nursery's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of the most confusing areas when
it comes to the regulations and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really a full-time job for me to run the
nursery and really another full-time job
[SPEAKER_00]: just to try to figure out where the
regulations are taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seed issue, someone was asking about
seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a struggle to get the county to
understand that no, as a nursery,
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally we didn't sell clones in
Mendocino in the winter time because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: an outdoor and mixed light area where some
other areas in the Bay Area you sell
[SPEAKER_00]: clones year-round but that I saw dramatic
shift in that last year is that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: selling clones year-round.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a little slowdown in December but
we sold at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So orders started picking back up in
January, February and it's a little
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated because there is no real
model.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have been selling clones for 15 years
and all of my business plans, all of my
[SPEAKER_00]: projections have been off completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last year and in previous years before it,
come July, somebody would call and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey Ron, what do you have?
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd come over with a truck and a
trailer and I'd be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the year, well that no longer happens
is we actually sold more clones in August
[SPEAKER_00]: than we did in July last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's gonna be a little transition and
there's going to be eventually larger
[SPEAKER_00]: operations that come in that have basic ag
and tissue culture experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be, I feel that we're
positioned well because we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: different type of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a natural day-length clone that we
sell which we're gonna transition to more
[SPEAKER_00]: of the dispensary because that's a product
that a customer can pick up, put outside
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't have to supplement a light
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's already UV hardened off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's different than most of the
clones that are sold now that are 18 hour
[SPEAKER_00]: clones that you have to supplement the
light or if you're putting it right into
[SPEAKER_00]: light depth, it'll flower right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what we're going to do.
