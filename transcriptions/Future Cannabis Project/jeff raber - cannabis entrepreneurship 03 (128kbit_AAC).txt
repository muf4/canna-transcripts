[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the difficulties of building up
the sales avenues of the business and
[SPEAKER_00]: really getting the business started once
we had secured the funding, the equipment,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the place, it was a big challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you find cultivators when
they're all, you know, hiding and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to be found?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the only place you can really find
them is that mutual meetings bought the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are public.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone can find them online or in other
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought that would be the first
target for us was we're just going to find
[SPEAKER_00]: a list of dispensaries in Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go start knocking on doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put our, you know,
press the flesh, they say, or put our
[SPEAKER_00]: boots on the ground and really just go out
there and start talking to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a quick sense of, wow,
there's a very insignificant understanding
[SPEAKER_00]: about what testing is and what it really
means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people hate the idea of a test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually means it's something you're
probably going to fail.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, no one likes the test at the
DMV.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one likes the test at the schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one likes to be tested for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So quickly you come to, well, I shouldn't
go in there and say I'm a tester and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to test all your stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably not going to lend towards
continuing the conversation or really
[SPEAKER_00]: helping you go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, how do you frame the approach?
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, look, I'm here to help you find
the best things for your patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here to help you screen the quality
of products that you've got and help
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone understand that, you know,
there is quality control and assurance and
[SPEAKER_00]: that your supply chain is really what
you're hoping it would be and that they
[SPEAKER_00]: can start to understand the dosing that
they're using.
[SPEAKER_00]: And can effectively use the medicine
that's cost effective for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cost that we're going to add to
you coming in here to do this service is
[SPEAKER_00]: very nominal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I can come into your dispensary
location, I would like to select samples
[SPEAKER_00]: out of every bag that you hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can show up once a week or on a
regular basis to your liking and offer
[SPEAKER_00]: these battery of tests that you guys could
start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was how the whole conversation had
began.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after hundreds of, I'm not interested
in doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like I have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm afraid I get a lower number and people
won't understand that this is still good
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be effective for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mindsets of like, why are you using the
equipment you're using?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you interpret these results?
[SPEAKER_00]: This makes it more complicated for me to
make my sale to patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure I want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's literally a risk of holding the
bag that can be contaminated as a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others eventually started to feel here.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are around.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very professional and had some
that said, you guys are fantastic from
[SPEAKER_00]: what I hear, but until I'm forced to do it
by law or by regulation, I'm just not
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel like paying for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beginning of 2010 is when we started
opening our doors for service and offered
[SPEAKER_00]: testing to the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the early part of 2010,
there was one other prominent lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: Steep Hill Laboratories that operated up
in Oakland, California, in the northern
[SPEAKER_00]: part of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use gas chromatographs at that time
and we were using liquid chromatograph.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in 2010, there was very little bit of
an understanding of, okay, this stuff may
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to be tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a lot of people ask, oh,
you can test this plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, it's still a plant, dispensary
owners, state regulators, other people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, even cultivators, patients
like you, what, what are you going to
[SPEAKER_00]: test?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you trying to test for?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does this testing really work?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning of 2010, there was
definitely a really grave lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding that you could even approach
this plant and test it in some sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still just a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like any other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that we were interacting with
predominantly at that point were mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary owners, operators, or managers
of the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the ones trying to make the
financial decisions, understanding what
[SPEAKER_00]: may be best for patients, how to
understand product quality was certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's a way I can kind of check the
quality of my cultivators, that would be
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients seem to be very appreciative of
the type of testing that was being offered
[SPEAKER_00]: at the few places in Southern California
that were doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of the idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: There had been just a little bit there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if you build it, they will come
and over time you'll be able to educate
[SPEAKER_00]: and explain why you're doing these things
and how that formalizes this product and
[SPEAKER_00]: treats it just like every other product
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the Echinacea, all the St. John's
wort, all the pharmaceutical products,
[SPEAKER_00]: your food, all of those things are tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: We eventually changed our pitch to be
like, you realize your dog's medicine is
[SPEAKER_00]: tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that this is, you know,
of lower quality or people are not as
[SPEAKER_00]: important and you wouldn't test this type
of medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: That caused the dispensary owner to come
right outside of his, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: little back office and was like,
well, it was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hadn't really thought of it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll consider using your service.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't, but that, you know,
kind of at least got the thought process
[SPEAKER_00]: going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that kind of shows how many
people are, were thinking about it at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very difficult sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was definitely days of tens to,
you know, eventually over a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: like I swear we hit a hundred places and
no one wanted to use this service.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did find a few.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually found a few dispensaries
that said, I really want to demonstrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a legitimate operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a professional operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I care about the people that we're
providing these medicinal products to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they want to also do what we were
saying, like, let's formalize these
[SPEAKER_00]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's understand them better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's show everybody that this is just
another botanical product and something
[SPEAKER_00]: that everyone can benefit from.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should treat it like every other
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a few dispensaries started to test on a
consistent basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked them, you know, would you
also do microbiological testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you do pesticide testing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said, yeah, if you get the
equipment, we'll make the commitment to
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can show up every week and we'll
screen for these types of things too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next piece we got was
microbiological testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we found a, a technology that would
allow us to test for mold in 48 hours and
[SPEAKER_00]: realizing that turnaround time is
exceptionally important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody wants to sit on the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to keep it fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, how do I, you know, tell
somebody I have to take seven days to do
[SPEAKER_00]: your testing and get back to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: By then it's all gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was pointless.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you, that was never going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So two days was as fast as we could find
technology to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seemed to generate enough
interest, like, all right, I can wait a
[SPEAKER_00]: day or two, or I can kind of package it,
get it ready while you guys are going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can put it onto, you know,
onto the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that was, you know,
a big piece in our development.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next step was where do we go from
here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoid profiling was first,
microbiological testing was second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Along that we went to a couple of trade
shows and we found, we put up our,
[SPEAKER_00]: here's the label that we think should be
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a little logo that says,
we were the ones that tested it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can trust the numbers were done in an
accurate fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of the integrity that goes
with that is the people behind doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and what their certification
program would mean, how we're doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is on display to the consumer and
eventually consumers say, oh, it's,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, workshop tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: I trust, you know, I've seen them testing
other stuff.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we put that there for consumers so they
could understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We advertise that at trade shows for
dispensary owners, other producers,
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators could then say, oh wait,
I can take my stuff to the dispensary so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they already know I've done that type
of responsible portion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That actually gives me a way of,
you know, marketing myself and saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a responsible operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've checked these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: This lab has verified my work product for
this, you know, this harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it made their conversations,
I think, easier with dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_00]: at least the first round did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you come back and your numbers are
very different, the second time,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh-oh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm done with that testing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just tell everybody that I'm always
this good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was why we use tested on dates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, we've seen that in other
markets, but we thought that's the only
[SPEAKER_00]: way to say when were these numbers,
you know, acquired, when might they be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to change if they're stored over
longer periods of time?
[SPEAKER_00]: How might the product be slightly
different from that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was this some sort of test that can't
be valid because it was done two years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: and an edible product that's obviously
being manufactured more frequently than
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was one of the elements that we had
added.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at this trade show, we had our label
up there and another individual came up
[SPEAKER_00]: and said, I'd be really interested in
investing in your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see that this is where things should
actually go and where they should head in
[SPEAKER_00]: the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You seem like a very responsible group of
individuals, professional.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see anything else like this out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, that did lead to the next
step in our development after months of
[SPEAKER_00]: convincing him and his family that this
was a very good decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: That he said, OK, I'll take the risk and
give you guys a little bit more money.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allowed us to acquire pesticide
testing and terpene profiling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And along with that, we were able to bring
in house a Dutch scientist, a wonderful
[SPEAKER_00]: individual named Sita Elzinga,
who actually had eight years of experience
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Dutch national system and his
graduate studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really understood things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had spoke and met each other at a
conference together down in Laguna Woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And immediately the two of us were like,
you know, oh, my goodness, you understand
[SPEAKER_00]: the bigger words I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: You understand the technical complexities
of what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go have dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about what we could do
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to formalize his position
with us upon securing the other
[SPEAKER_00]: investment, which was about a year after
we had gotten started.
[SPEAKER_00]: That led to what I think we're known for a
lot today, which is terpene profiling and
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at all the other products that are
present in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people say it's just cannabinoids,
THC or CBD now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people don't even know what CBD was
when we first started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was the goal, showing people the
other molecules that are present,
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to breed in different directions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Labs will enable that and start to drift
away from only THC or only one type of use
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can breed it for that, you have to
be able to breed it for other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first started testing for
terpenes, the rationale and reason was you
[SPEAKER_00]: could see I test three different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all smell different.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look very different, physiologically
feel different, but they have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: exact THC number.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the same exact cannabinoid
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see anything different on my
machine, yet I know they're very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to start looking at other
molecules and other things to start to see
[SPEAKER_00]: what these differences are.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first offered terpene testing,
other labs said they're trying to just
[SPEAKER_00]: charge you for another test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't see where there's any value in
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just want to get more money from the
dispensary guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, everyone's like, Oh, I offer
terpene testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to do more of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see terp festivals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there are, you know, that's a very big
trendy word on social media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all sorts of slang terms around it
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people didn't even know what a
terpene was when we started doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still today, a lot of people are like
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to educate them about it's
related to the smell, the aroma,
[SPEAKER_00]: but really causes the physiological
effects that make cannabis unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has been, you know, a big part of
what we've been working on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That started back in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got different equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were able to continue to bootstrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a couple other clients that said
you offer broader testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The clients we did have and started with,
they wanted to do more testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we became a little bit more efficient
getting the same number of samples,
[SPEAKER_00]: but being able to do more tests and get
more dollar value for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Driving around Southern California for
50,000 miles a year to go anywhere and
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere, whether it was Palm Springs,
Bakersfield, San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we live in Pasadena or Los
Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those places are quite a ways away
from where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every week we were going to those places
to hand select samples and make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were collected properly and building
up our reputation for being responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allowed a lot of discussion,
a lot of interaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really was a good thing for us and
the community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could explain last week's results.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could explain what else was going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could answer technical questions while
we were there and started to then also
[SPEAKER_00]: offer educational seminars.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people were testing, I would show up
and give them a little PowerPoint
[SPEAKER_00]: presentation to the staff so that they
could understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some asked if we would do it for their
patients and certainly we would.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I recognized we really have to get out
there more so and start talking to more
[SPEAKER_00]: and more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to talking to dispensary
operators, cultivators, eventually doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: more so, I made an effort to go out and
talk to state regulators, other types of
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals and explain how you could do
testing, why testing was important and
[SPEAKER_00]: where we really need to see this done in a
regulatory fashion so that the supply
[SPEAKER_00]: chain is controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So upon testing for dispensaries,
you've got a couple months of operating
[SPEAKER_00]: time with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: With them, things are going pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing them on a weekly basis,
on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the feedback that we received from
that were patients love the information.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very happy to see that someone has
checked the quality control, that they
[SPEAKER_00]: feel better knowing it's past the
microbiological screen, knowing that there
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't pesticides that were screened for
that were found inside of the products and
[SPEAKER_00]: really appreciating some of the
cannabinoid numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When terpene values came in addition to
that and we expanded the label,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was a whole new realm that they could
then look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I trust the name,
but I can at least trust these values if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're on here and if these are the types
of things that I've used before and I
[SPEAKER_00]: like, then I know as a patient that that's
some sort of product that would work for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our feedback from the dispensary
operators were our patients really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really liked the testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They really see the value in this type of
thing and we're glad that we can offer it
[SPEAKER_00]: to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a huge competitive advantage for
dispensaries who opted to offer tested
[SPEAKER_00]: products as opposed to those who didn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have a large cluster of them
in a very small area, how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiate yourself?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you offer different things to the
patients and other information?
[SPEAKER_00]: This was a great tool for that kind of
thing and certain dispensary owners really
[SPEAKER_00]: recognized that right away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some that were in other areas actually
used it, posted every result and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: look, I even grabbed tested samples from
other dispensaries and they found
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our supply chain is clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very diligent.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very different type of offering to
the consumer or the patient consumer that
[SPEAKER_00]: wants to understand what they're putting
in their body who may be immunocompromised
[SPEAKER_00]: or really under sick or other types of
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to ingest anything that
could cause harm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So pesticides and molds could be worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the feedback was patients really enjoy
the service and really appreciate that and
[SPEAKER_00]: found it to be very, very beneficial to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every entrepreneur builds their
business plan with the hockey stick in
[SPEAKER_00]: mind and it was definitely not the hockey
stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very, very slow, hard work
effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way that we, when we look back at all
of the clients that we've tested for and
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that we've been doing business
with, there are very few that has still
[SPEAKER_00]: continued to test from the first days that
we started.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got a couple, they started with
us and have tested all the time,
[SPEAKER_00]: every single time and keep doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are others who tried it for a little
while then dropped off and it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: constant effort of finding new clients,
constantly going out there to try and
[SPEAKER_00]: build the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that really is the most important
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really just kept you able to maintain
and sustain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was never really where they're all of a
sudden everybody decided to go ahead and
[SPEAKER_00]: start testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now test, we opened a laboratory in the
state of Washington where it is mandatory
[SPEAKER_00]: to test for the recreational market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's been required to test and what you
see there are there's a couple of labs
[SPEAKER_00]: that offer services.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one who gives the highest THC value
and the ones who charge the lowest price
[SPEAKER_00]: are the labs that get the best amount of
the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not even that all of a sudden
regulations change and you're a successful
[SPEAKER_00]: lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's all sorts of other ways that you
have to differentiate yourself and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still difficult because they're not
checking the scientific integrity or
[SPEAKER_00]: validity of all the tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have labs that are giving gravely
inflated numbers on flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't even repeat the number for fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: People think that that's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's difficult to say, hey regulator,
you've certified that these labs should
[SPEAKER_00]: operate but you haven't checked that they
do their operations properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no proficiency testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no accuracy checking.
[SPEAKER_00]: On what exactly the lab is doing,
now you've given everybody this false
[SPEAKER_00]: sense of that's an okay lab but really
they're giving them misinformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me when people told us as we were
building up I don't want to test,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd rather see you not test than test
wrong and get the wrong values.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I have misleading information on
doses and I thought I was taking 25
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams when really I was only
consuming 10 and the next time I go and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually get something that's 25 and that
can be very detrimental to the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could be exceptionally harmful.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you told them they never knew they'd
probably always start at a slower regime
[SPEAKER_00]: and work their way up and that's a lot
more safe from their perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see lots of benefits for testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people out there are still saying
well it cost me more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Patients are starting to say they really
want it and that's why we started to go
[SPEAKER_00]: out to more and more of the trade shows to
educate patients and say this is why you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to ask your dispensary for testing.
Thank you.
