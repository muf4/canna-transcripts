[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody in this audience probably has
heard that we need more research about the
[SPEAKER_04]: medical uses of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But most other folks that aren't involved
in doing medical cannabis research don't
[SPEAKER_04]: understand the unique challenges that
exist to try to get this research done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so today I'm really delighted to be
here to moderate a panel that has some
[SPEAKER_04]: real heavy hitters in the cannabis
research space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they represent both sort of academic
and non-academic research.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we've got a nice breadth of
experience to really get at the issues of
[SPEAKER_04]: what are the things that are inhibiting
our progress towards that epiphany when we
[SPEAKER_04]: have enough cannabis research to,
for example, reschedule or other
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting things that could happen when
we get that magic amount of research that
[SPEAKER_04]: we need.
[SPEAKER_04]: So without further ado, what I'm going to
do is this is the structure for today.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to have each of our panelists
do a brief self-introduction.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then our first question will be sort
of open-ended.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it will be from your experience,
what have been the opportunities and
[SPEAKER_04]: challenges in studying medical cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: And lastly, we're going to touch just a
little bit on a federal level policy,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is the Medical Cannabis Research Act
of 2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some folks on the panel who have
some things that they'd like to sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: bring forward on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Sue Sisley.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm an internal medicine physician from
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the president of Scottsdale Research
Institute.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're focused primarily on doing
controlled trials, looking at flower,
[SPEAKER_02]: both smoked and vaporized flower,
for trying to put flower through the
[SPEAKER_02]: entire FDA drug development process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're best known for this study.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've probably heard about the FDA phase
two trial looking at cannabis for treating
[SPEAKER_02]: veterans with PTSD.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we also have other study.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing a clinical trial with
University of Michigan looking at cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: for chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have another study looking at,
we just finished a safety study on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also building a national patient
registry, which I'm hoping to talk about
[SPEAKER_02]: later, a cannabis patient registry,
very in-depth national database,
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting information about how patients
are reacting to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Daniel Piamelli.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a professor at University of
California, Irvine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have been studying cannabinoids and
endocannabinoids for the last 25 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: more or less.
[SPEAKER_01]: And currently, I am the director,
along with Professor Bob Solomon in the
[SPEAKER_01]: School of Law of the UCI Center for the
Study of Cannabis that just created.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its mission is to understand the
challenges and possibly provide solutions
[SPEAKER_01]: also for the challenges that are lying
ahead of us now that cannabis is being
[SPEAKER_01]: legalized throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm Mowgli Holmes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm the CEO of Filos Bioscience.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a cannabis genomics and plant
breeding company based in Portland,
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so unlike, I think, everybody else
here on the panel who is generally focused
[SPEAKER_05]: on the medical side of the research issue,
everything we do is focused on the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: side.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it actually turns out that it's even
harder to get plant research done in the
[SPEAKER_05]: United States, especially in universities,
than it is to get medical research done.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was also the chair last year of the
Governor's Cannabis Research Task Force in
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon, where we were charged with putting
together a roadmap for how the state of
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon could get research done on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our findings were that there's
basically no way at the time for Oregon
[SPEAKER_05]: universities to do the kind of research
that we wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And things are starting to loosen up a
little bit, especially here in the UC
[SPEAKER_05]: system, where people are more aggressive
than they are in other states.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it is still very difficult to get any
of this research done, especially when it
[SPEAKER_05]: comes to linking actual plants and what we
know about the plants to medical outcomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's what we're focused on.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, I'm Tom Marcotte.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a professor of psychiatry at UC San
Diego and also the co-director of the UC
[SPEAKER_06]: Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a neuropsychologist by training.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just briefly, the CMCR has been around
since 2000.
[SPEAKER_06]: So following the Compassionate Use Act
passage, the Senate, the California
[SPEAKER_06]: legislature put aside money to look at
potential medical benefits of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we conducted seven clinical trials
looking at neuropathic pain, MS-related
[SPEAKER_06]: spasticity, ended up having positive
findings in all of those studies back in
[SPEAKER_06]: the 2000s.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was primarily smoked cannabis or
vaporized and also THC only.
[SPEAKER_06]: Currently, our center has four clinical
trials, either running or getting ready to
[SPEAKER_06]: start.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have a take-home study looking at
low back pain.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is an eight-week study.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're starting up studies looking at CBD
for severe autism, looking at early
[SPEAKER_06]: psychosis as well as essential tremor,
and also have some observational
[SPEAKER_06]: mechanistic studies looking at bipolar
disorder and HIV neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other aspect our CMCR is interested in
is public safety.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I'm the PI of a study looking at
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've been fairly successful in this
sort of era.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have some funding from NIH,
some from the state, some from private
[SPEAKER_06]: foundations, and are using product from
NIDA, the University of Mississippi,
[SPEAKER_06]: as well as synthetic CBD from Incest,
as you may have heard, also Clamp Drive
[SPEAKER_06]: from Tilray that was just announced last
week.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you all know, we are really blessed to
have such a depth and breadth of expertise
[SPEAKER_04]: on this panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And without further ado, I want to launch
into sort of the primary question that the
[SPEAKER_04]: panelists have been asked to address,
which is what have been the challenges and
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunities of working in medical
cannabis research?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wanted to sort of jump in and give
my own sort of take on that to sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: kick it off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So back, like many people, I was
introduced to cannabis in college.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although what I'm really talking about is
about that time that I was in college,
[SPEAKER_04]: the endocannabinoid system was being
discovered by folks like Daniela.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really inspired me to want to go do
that work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in my first postdoc, I was working at
the Queen Center for Biomedical
[SPEAKER_04]: Engineering in Honolulu, Hawaii in a
Schedule I facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were trying to do research on the
effects of cannabis on the immune system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I found out really quickly was
that it was really hard to get product,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it was really hard to get funding to
do this work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevertheless, we did some studies,
and it was a great period of time in my
[SPEAKER_04]: life.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I personally went off and did some
work in the biotech sphere, where in my
[SPEAKER_04]: past I have done some work in R&D and in
quality and manufacturing of
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I came back to the industry right
now because it seems like there are some
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunities that exist within the
state-regulated programs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my new experience in doing research is
in the context of working with GB
[SPEAKER_04]: Sciences.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we hold licenses in both Nevada,
as well as we are working with LSU
[SPEAKER_04]: AgCenter to be one of the two providers of
all the cannabis products to the state of
[SPEAKER_04]: Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so through these, we have some
interesting opportunities for doing
[SPEAKER_04]: research on plant genetics, on things like
we've been doing a lot of work on in vitro
[SPEAKER_04]: propagation techniques to ensure the
genetic fidelity of our lines,
[SPEAKER_04]: as well as doing chemophore profiling.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been a really exciting time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've also done a lot of work to try to
standardize, and we've done some basic
[SPEAKER_04]: science work to try to link profiles to
specific disease indications.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've filed six patents, and our lead
compound is for the treatment of
[SPEAKER_04]: Parkinson's.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were getting really excited because
we were getting close to having enough
[SPEAKER_04]: data to try to file an exploratory IND in
this area.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we hit a snag, which was even though
we had standardized our compounds at our
[SPEAKER_04]: facility in Nevada to what I would
consider a GMP standard, because of sole
[SPEAKER_04]: source, we couldn't use our own compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've had to source them overseas.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had to use a contract manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's Catalent Pharma is going to be doing
our prototype formulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the process is super, super
complicated, whereas if any other kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: drug development we were doing,
we wouldn't have to go through these
[SPEAKER_04]: machinations just to get the compounds in
the order and get them into a trial.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, I'd like to invite Sue to
compare and contrast that with your
[SPEAKER_04]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're focused on flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've had a real challenge dealing with
the DEA NIDA monopoly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of you know that the National
Institute on Drug Abuse has, through
[SPEAKER_02]: University of Mississippi licensing,
they've enjoyed a government-enforced
[SPEAKER_02]: monopoly since 1968 on the only federally
legal supply of cannabis for controlled
[SPEAKER_02]: trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even what Andrea mentioned about
growing cannabis in Louisiana still
[SPEAKER_02]: wouldn't be usable for any controlled
trials.
[SPEAKER_02]: She can grow the best, most diverse
chemovars in the universe, and none of
[SPEAKER_02]: them will be allowed to be used for any
controlled trials, which really is the
[SPEAKER_02]: only thing that matters to the medical
community, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We only care about randomized controlled
trials, and that's generally what gets
[SPEAKER_02]: published in peer-reviewed journals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So until we have diverse, you know,
until University of Mississippi is ever
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed to access diverse genetics,
we're stuck with these, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: this really low-quality plant material
without any access to any unique
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids except batches of THC and
CBD, and that's all we know about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you dare ask for any unique
chemovars that are widely available
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout the regulated markets,
you can't get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, I'm not criticizing University
of Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that this monopoly needs
to end.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been striving to start a national
conversation for the last decade about the
[SPEAKER_02]: problems with this, the fact that they
need to license other growers for
[SPEAKER_02]: research.
[SPEAKER_02]: The DEA pledged to the public back in 2016
that they would finally end the monopoly
[SPEAKER_02]: and license other growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't moved forward on that at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's over, you know, 26 applications
that have been sitting on the desk of the
[SPEAKER_02]: DEA for two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of them have been processed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the meantime, you know,
we could be enjoying a renaissance of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis research in this country if we
were allowing other private growers to
[SPEAKER_02]: provide, you know, we have all these
expert growers here in this conference who
[SPEAKER_02]: could easily be providing important
chemovars for our studies, and they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: allowed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we all need, as taxpayers,
we need to demand that the DEA move
[SPEAKER_02]: forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And license other growers, and I think Tom
can speak to the fact that what he just
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned about the notion that Tilray,
a Canadian LP, is now allowed to export
[SPEAKER_02]: study drug into the U.S., but yet we're
not allowed to, any of our expert,
[SPEAKER_02]: our talented farmers are not allowed to
provide medicine for these studies is just
[SPEAKER_02]: an abomination.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends, my colleagues at university
ask me, why do you do this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I tell them what we have to go
through to just run an animal study or an
[SPEAKER_01]: in vitro cellular study with cannabinoids,
plant-derived cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I walk them through the process,
they look at me, then their mouths open
[SPEAKER_01]: and their jaws drop and their eyes roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: They say, why are you wasting your time on
this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You all know what I'm talking about,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You all know what I'm wasting my time on.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm wasting my time on getting a schedule
one license, which means that a certain
[SPEAKER_01]: number of things have to be done before,
during, and after the process just in
[SPEAKER_01]: order for us to start collecting
preliminary results to write a grant
[SPEAKER_01]: proposal which then will require another
year, year and a half, two years,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be funded.
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I saying that this is impossible?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm here and we are doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got a very large nine million
dollar grant to study the impact of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids on adolescents, so it is
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so much of that energy could have gone
to science as opposed to bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_01]: To science as opposed to useless red tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so many of the questions that we would
like to ask are just not askable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We cannot ask them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very recently, we were on the phone with
Tom Marcotte and a colleague of ours from
[SPEAKER_01]: UC Davis who is an agronomist,
he's a plant biologist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't want to steal Maugly's thunder,
but he already, Maugly, already alluded to
[SPEAKER_01]: the difficulty of doing plant biology with
cannabis in the context, in the present
[SPEAKER_01]: legislative context.
[SPEAKER_01]: This person, a UC Davis, a very
experienced plant biologist, had never
[SPEAKER_01]: done any work on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when Tom and I introduced him to the
steps that had to be taken, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think at one point we were considering
seriously, Tom, whether it was worth the
[SPEAKER_01]: effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, he said like, well,
no, no, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's still do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So eventually, these scientists,
we were able to, I think, to persuade him
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was really worth the effort
because, you know, literally the idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: having to grow cannabis at UC Davis in the
present context was so hard for a
[SPEAKER_01]: scientist who is busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you gotta also see it from this
perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are not in a for-profit structure like
my two esteemed panelists.
[SPEAKER_01]: No profit or profit, but you know,
you're dedicated to the study of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why my colleagues, my friends,
ask me why you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me say just a few words why I am doing
this because it's good to see the
[SPEAKER_01]: challenges, but it's also important to
understand that these challenges are worth
[SPEAKER_01]: overcoming because what we have here I
think is a phenomenal opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say a historical opportunity if it
wasn't an abused term, but it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a sense, historical because not so many
times in the life of a person or a
[SPEAKER_01]: country, there is the situation we have
now where an entire host of chemicals
[SPEAKER_01]: produced by a plant have been closed to
research and to perusal by scientists and
[SPEAKER_01]: to use by clinical investigators for
almost 100 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, this is opening,
slowly but surely because that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: trend, this is opening and we don't even
know the questions that we need to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is the amazingly interesting
thing about this is that we are opening a
[SPEAKER_01]: new window on the brain and the body.
[SPEAKER_01]: We discovered the endogenous cannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the opportunity of creating new
classes of analogies that could be,
[SPEAKER_01]: if not replacing, certainly complementing
the opiates which are causing an epidemics
[SPEAKER_01]: that is destroying our country.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could be opening a window on new cures
for new diseases like, no, new cures for
[SPEAKER_01]: old diseases like autism, like forms of
epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all this, I think, because this plant
and its components and what it means for
[SPEAKER_01]: science have been actually closed to
research since 1937, since the enactment
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Marijuana Attacks Act under the FDR
administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why I think we as scientists
are so excited about this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Tom is, I know I am, the other
panelists I also believe are, just like I
[SPEAKER_01]: am, and that's why I think we can put up
with this BS because it's really,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you think about it, it's really BS.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is BS and I'll tell you why,
I'll tell you why.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if, as a scientist, I want to do
research on cannabis, I have to go through
[SPEAKER_01]: all these hoops.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a federally funded institution,
in a public institution or a private
[SPEAKER_01]: institution that receives funds from the
federal government, this is what I have to
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody else doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have issues cultivating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have issues passing the state borders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I was in a private lab in Irvine,
California, instead of being at University
[SPEAKER_01]: of California, Irvine, and I wanted to do
any type of research on cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I had my own funding, I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now why is that a problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a problem to me because I believe
that the fact that the vast majority of
[SPEAKER_01]: scientists in this country who are funded
by the federal government, by the NIH,
[SPEAKER_01]: the NSF, et cetera, cannot take a look at
this plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means that somebody else will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those who will be looking are not
necessarily the people that we want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at this problem because they come
to the question with an agenda and we
[SPEAKER_01]: shouldn't have that agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should have no agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our only agenda should be get the data,
understand what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I could probably go on for another
hour, so I better stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: So after we had this research task force
in Oregon and we were trying to ask the
[SPEAKER_05]: question, how can researchers,
medical researchers who generally exist
[SPEAKER_05]: inside federally funded universities,
how can they do studies that with human
[SPEAKER_05]: subjects that actually use the cannabis
that is available to people instead of
[SPEAKER_05]: isolated cannabinoids which we know act
differently or the terrible, terrible weed
[SPEAKER_05]: that is grown at University of
Mississippi?
[SPEAKER_05]: And there really is no concrete way.
[SPEAKER_05]: So many researchers are getting really
creative.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing observational studies
they're pushing the limits of how much
[SPEAKER_05]: they can suggest to the subjects of the
observational studies what kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: products they should buy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a group in Colorado that is
getting people high in a van outside the
[SPEAKER_05]: university before they bring them in and
put them in the brain scanner.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they have to do it on the street.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people are getting very creative,
but in general there's no way to get
[SPEAKER_05]: people the actual plan that they're gonna
be exposed to.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so what we realized is that we could
get all that, if we wanted to do plant
[SPEAKER_05]: work, we could get it done more
effectively in a company where we just
[SPEAKER_05]: don't face all those restraints.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also because we're not working
directly with human subjects, we don't
[SPEAKER_05]: face the incredible array of some of the
very reasonable restraints that the
[SPEAKER_05]: federal government puts on how you do
human subjects research.
[SPEAKER_05]: But our job is to figure out how to
understand the plant and feed the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: into those medical research pathways.
[SPEAKER_05]: How to make plants that have high levels
of these other cannabinoids that we wanna
[SPEAKER_05]: study.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how to characterize the plants in a
way that makes the studies data
[SPEAKER_05]: understandable.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for instance, we're working with a
group at the Oregon Health and Science
[SPEAKER_05]: University now that's trying to do a
controlled, a semi-controlled
[SPEAKER_05]: observational study where they know what
varieties people are taking.
[SPEAKER_05]: They can't administer the plant
themselves, but they wanna know what
[SPEAKER_05]: people are taking.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as you guys know, no one knows what
anything is.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's thousands of different varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're genetically testing the varieties
to try to feed those into the study so
[SPEAKER_05]: that the researchers can know that at
least everyone's getting the same
[SPEAKER_05]: genetically identical plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are all those problems to solve.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one thing I just, I want people to be
clear about is that there's this whole
[SPEAKER_05]: raft of terrible regulatory problems,
but that's not, that's only half of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other problem is that we're actually
just dealing scientifically with an
[SPEAKER_05]: incredibly complicated subject.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the endocannabinoid system is really,
really complex.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are many receptors that do many,
many things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then on the plant side, there are
thousands and thousands of different kinds
[SPEAKER_05]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have perhaps dozens of active or
potentially active molecules at different
[SPEAKER_05]: ratios in each plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so it's just combinatorially a hard
scientific question to do controlled
[SPEAKER_05]: studies with anyway.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you merge that with the
regulatory problems, it's really
[SPEAKER_05]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's important for the
industry to know, I mean, a lot of you out
[SPEAKER_05]: there are people who are trying to make
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're making them without much
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like right now, there's this new wave of
people trying to make products that have
[SPEAKER_05]: THCV in them.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we think that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have hints.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a friend who smoked it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we don't know, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just don't know what's gonna happen
once we actually get data about that
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_05]: And maybe it works, and maybe it doesn't,
and maybe it only works.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you also have this much limonene and
this much beta karyophylline mixed in in
[SPEAKER_05]: the same dose.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we just don't know, and we're not
gonna know for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the industry is gonna be reliant on
researchers figuring all this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_05]: In a big way, it's the project of the
cannabis industry to map all the
[SPEAKER_05]: complicated universe of cannabis varieties
and all the compounds in there and all the
[SPEAKER_05]: combinations to map that complexity to the
complexity of human reactions and human
[SPEAKER_05]: medical conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we are so far from doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the industry is so far out ahead of us
making stuff and trying it that one whole
[SPEAKER_05]: other source of research data is gonna be
from the industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have this kind of unprecedented
opportunity to pull in big data from the
[SPEAKER_05]: industry, which is being allowed to give
people stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if we can find ways to pull in that
information, for instance, the kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: study that Sue is doing, which is trying
to set up this network of patient data,
[SPEAKER_05]: pulling in data like that from people who
are using all the products out there in
[SPEAKER_05]: the industry, that's not a controlled
study.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's a new world of big data where
we can pull in so much data, and it can be
[SPEAKER_05]: messy and dirty.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if it's big enough, we can tease out
what matters and feed that back in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's the other thing that I just
wanna say, is that doing this research is
[SPEAKER_05]: really difficult, and we need the industry
to care about it, and we need the industry
[SPEAKER_05]: to help, because you guys actually are in
a position to help.
[SPEAKER_06]: In regards to what we think about the
night of cannabis, at least in our studies
[SPEAKER_06]: many years ago, we did see a positive
effect.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not saying there aren't better
strains, et cetera, but still even
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever you think of the night of
cannabis, we still saw THC effects on
[SPEAKER_06]: really difficult to treat conditions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since you just said that, can I add one
thing?
[SPEAKER_05]: So we just tested it genetically.
[SPEAKER_05]: We got a sample from one of the remaining
patients, and we sequenced it,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it is 96% skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Skunk, it's straight skunk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we talked to David Watson,
who was the creator of skunk, and he said
[SPEAKER_05]: that actually, many, many years ago,
under a DEA license that the OMS had,
[SPEAKER_05]: shipped some seeds to, I don't know how
they weakened it so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: But yeah, but it's real cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'd say very interesting seeing what
the other strains produce.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just making a point.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that goes sort of the challenges of
doing this type of research when we wanted
[SPEAKER_06]: to do a study looking at high CBD
treatments the night of the farm
[SPEAKER_06]: ultimately developed a 16% plant,
and then we ran into conflict with the
[SPEAKER_06]: FDA, who had concerns about the safety,
that there wasn't adequate human safety
[SPEAKER_06]: trials in vaporized and smoking high CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then we had to go through a negotiation
to come up with a compromise of two 8%,
[SPEAKER_06]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there are challenges in getting high
CBD content out of Mississippi,
[SPEAKER_06]: particularly when it comes to the kind of
oral treatment.
[SPEAKER_06]: They now have an extract, I think they
have going.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the last thing I just want to
echo is the frustration amongst all of us
[SPEAKER_06]: in terms of being able to access real
world cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in addition to the medical side,
which we're very interested in CMCR,
[SPEAKER_06]: I commented that we're also interested in
public safety and from edibles to infused
[SPEAKER_06]: drinks, et cetera, we cannot touch those
products at all to either see what's in
[SPEAKER_06]: them or to see what the effects are,
either cognitive or medical benefits and
[SPEAKER_06]: so forth.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it is a very frustrating situation
right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we've really covered the idea
that the sole source from Ole Miss has
[SPEAKER_04]: been a real challenge as far as getting
research to the level that we'd like to
[SPEAKER_04]: see it at as well as the challenges of
getting materials across states and into
[SPEAKER_04]: different territories.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things that I think that we
didn't really touch on and I think is
[SPEAKER_04]: something that's super key to the industry
itself is the idea of moving money,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis companies have a hard time moving
money because you can't have a bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so speaking from our experience as a
publicly traded cannabis company,
[SPEAKER_04]: we are fortunate to have relationships
where it's industry sponsored research and
[SPEAKER_04]: we're working with eight different
universities in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: and abroad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the biggest challenge we have is what
to do with the money or how to transfer
[SPEAKER_04]: the money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I imagine that all of you have your
own experience with funding or lack of
[SPEAKER_04]: funding or moving money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Would any of you care to jump on that one?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Center for the Study of Cannabis at UC
Irvine has a legal component and that
[SPEAKER_01]: component is heavily interested in the
issue of banking in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, the person who runs the
legal part of the center is not here.
[SPEAKER_01]: His name is Professor Robert Solomon and
he's not here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is clearly a matter that deserves
a conversation that must be started and it
[SPEAKER_01]: has already started.
[SPEAKER_01]: It must be expanded state by state.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are ways, in my limited
understanding, there are ways through
[SPEAKER_01]: which we can overcome the current
restrictions that do not require any major
[SPEAKER_01]: intervention from the federal government.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, how feasible those ways are is a
matter that legal experts adjudicate in
[SPEAKER_01]: very different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what has predominated so far has been a
very conservative outlook, basically
[SPEAKER_01]: stopping short any attempt to change the
status quo.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am optimistic, especially because
revenues are at stake here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Important state revenues are at stake and
important issues are at stake.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you pay taxes?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we know that our regulators,
our lawmakers want the tax money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am optimistic that something will
change in that direction, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I could also bring my very,
very limited, very small experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: as Director of the Center for the Study of
Cannabis, we reached out to cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: companies and we had an overwhelmingly
positive response.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wanted to help us in some way or
another.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we reached out to our own
University of California Office of the
[SPEAKER_01]: President and asked them, and that was
probably a mistake, I'm just kidding,
[SPEAKER_01]: asked them, I always say it's always
better to ask for forgiveness than for
[SPEAKER_01]: permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we did ask their opinion, honestly,
and they were understandably very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very cautious.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, well, if it comes from the
selling, the cultivating, the distributing
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis, you cannot take any money,
not even as a gift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say, but how would a cannabis company work
if they aren't doing any of those things?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that too, the interesting,
and I want to close on a positive note.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interesting thing is that there is
money involved and when there is money
[SPEAKER_01]: involved, people get motivated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even the Office of the President of my
great institution, even though they are
[SPEAKER_01]: very conservative, they would like to
change things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to see some light at the
end of the tunnel.
[SPEAKER_01]: And of course, I don't want to bring up
this issue, a political issue here,
[SPEAKER_01]: but with the current political scenario,
with the current Attorney General,
[SPEAKER_01]: that is quite hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a quite hard stance to take when you
have against you the Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just globally, the research funding
available in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: has traditionally been available only to
study cannabis as a drug of abuse.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is what we've been up against,
trying to do efficacy trials on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've never gotten government money to
study efficacy until just recently we got
[SPEAKER_02]: our first government grant from the state
of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, it's the states that are taking
the initiative to study efficacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The federal government, there's very
little, only recently have we seen federal
[SPEAKER_02]: government money available, small amounts.
[SPEAKER_02]: To study cannabis as a substitution for
opioids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those are fairly small grants and I
really applaud Tom and CMCR, their work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, they have done most of the seminal
studies looking at cannabis as a medicine,
[SPEAKER_02]: as looking at efficacy and safety in the
same studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So their work, we would hardly have any
efficacy data at all if it weren't for the
[SPEAKER_02]: California state funding of CMCR many
years ago and their now renewed funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hoping, the reason we have data is
because of these guys here that are doing
[SPEAKER_02]: this work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I want to point out that in Canada,
we see Canadian LPs allocating millions of
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars to study cannabis as a medicine
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a big game changer, I think,
that will help.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they understand that paying for
clinical trials means millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: When industry people in the US tell Dr.
Piemeli that they want to help fund his
[SPEAKER_02]: research, I think they're looking at maybe
a $10,000 grant or maybe five or 10 grand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't understand to do a controlled
trial is millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: The study we're doing right now,
a simple FDA phase two trial with only 76
[SPEAKER_02]: subjects is $2.2 million and that's a very
low budget trial.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just have to, industry has to be
aware that when they say they want to fund
[SPEAKER_02]: controlled trials, that they're looking at
millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe not for your work, but generally
that's what it costs for human trials.
[SPEAKER_06]: I completely agree with Sue about the
funding being sort of few and far between.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have been fairly fortunate recently,
sort of this take home study looking at
[SPEAKER_06]: vaporized cannabis versus dronabinol
actually is funded by NIDA, surprisingly
[SPEAKER_06]: enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's other studies that are more
mechanically mechanistic looking at
[SPEAKER_06]: bipolar disorder and HIV neuropathic pain
are also NIH funding.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a little movement in the
direction to look at non sort of addictive
[SPEAKER_06]: behaviors, but it's still not very much
money.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just want to point out from a high
level that even though I think it's
[SPEAKER_05]: really, really good that companies are
trying to fund research, that was our
[SPEAKER_05]: decision was that we could get this
research done more effectively inside a
[SPEAKER_05]: company than in any other way.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the LPs in Canada have enough money
and the universities there can do work and
[SPEAKER_05]: companies like GV Sciences are pushing
hard to do real research and all of that
[SPEAKER_05]: is critical and it's gonna be critical for
a few years, but I just want us all to
[SPEAKER_05]: keep in mind that there's a reason why in
the rest of the research world,
[SPEAKER_05]: the government funds basic research and
then when that research gets far enough
[SPEAKER_05]: along that it can be, it can turn into
something applied, the private sector
[SPEAKER_05]: takes it over and brings things to market
and that's how the world works and that's
[SPEAKER_05]: fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the reason why basic research is
funded by the government is because it's
[SPEAKER_05]: really expensive and the first many stages
of most research programs are nowhere near
[SPEAKER_05]: a product.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the basic research that lays the
groundwork and companies don't want to pay
[SPEAKER_05]: for that basic research because it's too
many years away from any product and if it
[SPEAKER_05]: gets done in universities with federal
funding, you can do those years of basic
[SPEAKER_05]: research and you can do them in a way that
is impartial and not, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: prone to being shifted in any way by
commercial interests.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're going into this phase now where a
lot of the research on cannabis is gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: be funded by companies and I think most of
us are well-intentioned, but that's not
[SPEAKER_05]: how research should really be done.
[SPEAKER_05]: It should be done by universities without
commercial pressures driving them to come
[SPEAKER_05]: up with certain results.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we need to get through this period and
ultimately the research should go away
[SPEAKER_05]: from you and me and go back to these guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the things we were talking about
sort of as a group is that cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: industry is sort of plagued by
pseudoscience and I think that's really
[SPEAKER_04]: what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because there's that absence of a
large database of that basic science
[SPEAKER_04]: happening like in other fields,
things fill in the gap and so would anyone
[SPEAKER_04]: else like to talk about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if you don't mind, I have a comment
on, I don't want to give this audience the
[SPEAKER_01]: impression that when we are dealing with
the federal government, we are dealing
[SPEAKER_01]: with the monolithic structure,
mono-ideological structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, you know, the federal
government is influenced by the
[SPEAKER_01]: administration because that's their boss,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it doesn't mean that people within
don't have their very articulated and
[SPEAKER_01]: strong opinions that they temporarily keep
under wrap, but eventually can and will,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, come out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working with the National
Institute on Drug Abuse, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the last 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a member of their national
advisory panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been on study sections.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know very well and I'm friendly with
their scientific director, Norah Volkow.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know where they're standing on this
matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're concerned, of course, about the
use of cannabis, but they're also
[SPEAKER_01]: cognizant of the potential applications,
the potential health application.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are cognizant, but don't forget,
their job, their mission is not to fund
[SPEAKER_01]: studies on the health effects of cannabis,
the positive effects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're called the National Institute on
Drug Abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a mission and they have to study
abusable drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Abuse part is what they care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we're really missing when it comes
to the federal government is, first of
[SPEAKER_01]: all, political will.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the first thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And second, we're missing an
inter-institute agency through the NIH,
[SPEAKER_01]: through including the NSF, Cancer
Institute, the FDA, that looks at this in
[SPEAKER_01]: a unified, thoughtful, intelligent way and
has some it has a portfolio, so it has the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to access funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this is not something about drug
abuse or something about mental health or
[SPEAKER_01]: something about neurological disorders or
something about cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something about each of those things
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, scientists, people with
experience in the problem must be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: make a recommendation that can be heard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why the National Academy of
Science Committee on the Impact of
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis, that was a member of,
decided, wrote as a recommendation the
[SPEAKER_01]: creation of a research agenda on cannabis
that brings together all those federal
[SPEAKER_01]: stakeholders and gives them a unified
voice and possibly a unified portfolio as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's look at the federal government
with some positivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it's hard right now, but let's try
and make that effort.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I think that's really,
really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last topic that we wanted to sort of
address was many people may be following
[SPEAKER_04]: the Medical Cannabis Research Act of 2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the things that it proposes to
do is to eliminate the sole source by
[SPEAKER_04]: forcing the EA to admit at least two more
certified cultivator growers and also open
[SPEAKER_04]: up some right of way rights to the
Veterans Affairs Department.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like, at this point, to simply
throw this one over to the panel,
[SPEAKER_04]: for those panel members who would like to
jump on that and give their opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't support that bill, even though I
recognize that this could be symbolically
[SPEAKER_02]: the end of the monopoly with University of
Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact that they're only agreeing to
license two new growers for research and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're probably going, you know,
this is basically just creating a
[SPEAKER_02]: corporate monopoly on top of what is
already an existing university monopoly of
[SPEAKER_02]: Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm not a fan of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the only right thing to do is for
the government to properly adjudicate all
[SPEAKER_02]: 25 plus applications that have been
sitting on their desk and evaluate all of
[SPEAKER_02]: them in terms of merit, in terms of
quotas, and let's do this properly.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I apply for a DEA schedule one life,
a DEA schedule one license as a
[SPEAKER_02]: researcher, every single application gets
evaluated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not like we just say, oh,
we're gonna look at these two,
[SPEAKER_02]: just pick the two best.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a properly approved protocol,
a scientific protocol, then you will be
[SPEAKER_02]: approved for a DEA schedule one license as
a researcher, which is what we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to say, I'm only gonna take two,
I think it's a bad model and it looks like
[SPEAKER_02]: this has been created by some of Gates'
donors to ensure that they get a license
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think it's really unfair.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we do need to end this monopoly and
I'm hoping someday, you know, the same way
[SPEAKER_02]: Tilray exported study, or is planning to
export drug for Tom's Tremor study,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe someday Tilray will agree to export
flour into the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we can finally break the monopoly
on flour and force the government to
[SPEAKER_02]: license other growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sue, I've been wondering, even if they do
license two other grows, aren't the laws
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna be such that they have to get their
starting material from Mississippi anyway?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we're assuming, although I
spoke to Dr. El Soli, who runs the
[SPEAKER_02]: University of Mississippi Lab,
and he said that he refuses to sell
[SPEAKER_02]: starter material because he said that
that's their IP.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the University of Mississippi has,
not that anybody would want their genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: anyway, but the point is that that's
taxpayer dollars that have gone to support
[SPEAKER_02]: this monopoly and now he's saying that
it's protected as their IP and they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: willing to share it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think in our application, we had to list
which foreign entities we were gonna buy
[SPEAKER_02]: from, so we have to purchase genetics from
outside the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to make two points.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is immediately related to previous
speakers and is not a scientific point,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'd still like to make it,
and it's the following.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we think about the Soviet Union,
the Soviet Union was a socialistic
[SPEAKER_01]: country, so property was entirely owned by
the state, and then it became a private
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that process, not a lot of good
things happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we have to be a little bit
thinking about that model as we consider
[SPEAKER_01]: the passage from a state monopoly to now a
new situation where there is no monopoly
[SPEAKER_01]: and there are private individuals bidding
or working to get a piece of the cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the reason why I think this is so
important is because let's not forget that
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of the folks who were growing
cannabis were folks from minorities,
[SPEAKER_01]: from underrepresented minorities,
and these folks are more and more excluded
[SPEAKER_01]: from the business, and they don't have a
voice because the cannabis industry has a
[SPEAKER_01]: voice, can be more or less audible,
but is a voice, but these folks tend to
[SPEAKER_01]: not to have a voice, and I think the one
thing that would be terrible, I'm thinking
[SPEAKER_01]: in particular about the state of
California, if moving forward we got into
[SPEAKER_01]: a situation from a monopoly of the state
to an oligopoly from large corporations,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some of the folks who have been part
of this industry forever now would be
[SPEAKER_01]: penalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the first thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a scientific point that the,
thank you, the scientific point I think
[SPEAKER_01]: is, I'd love to hear your comments about
it, and also your comments about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially as a geneticist, because I'm
not a planned geneticist, so I read,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what I read I may or may not
understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's what I, the problem that I have
with cannabis is that we have hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we have marijuana, right,
with an H.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is how the federal government divides
the plant, right, marijuana and hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they acknowledge it, it's the same
thing, but I think they acknowledge it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and at the same time they deny it,
and to me, understanding the diversity of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant before we take any measure,
or at least at the same time as we take
[SPEAKER_01]: measures to unpack this monopoly,
I think it's really, really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We still don't know, and Duke Magali,
correct me if I'm wrong, but we still
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know if a plant has more THC than it
does CBD, there is an enzyme that makes
[SPEAKER_01]: either of them, there's one enzyme for
one, another enzyme for another,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have a shared precursor, why some
strains have one more of one, and why some
[SPEAKER_01]: strains have more than another,
is that how the environment can affect
[SPEAKER_01]: that, and how this plays out with the
other 102 cannabinoids number growing that
[SPEAKER_01]: are present in the plant, like
cannabidivirin that was mentioned before.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is no talk, even at the federal
level, and I know because I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: talking to folks in D.C.
[SPEAKER_01]: about this, there is no talk of looking at
this from a scientific perspective and
[SPEAKER_01]: asking, so what is this thing,
what is this plant, how is it that it has
[SPEAKER_01]: these properties?
[SPEAKER_05]: Those things we can figure out,
and we're starting to.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we know how many copies of the THC
synthase and the CBD synthase are in those
[SPEAKER_05]: plants now, and we're tracking down all
the metabolic pathways, and then in the
[SPEAKER_05]: future, if we're gonna have whole plant
medicine, it'll be a genetically defined
[SPEAKER_05]: plant where we know, okay, this is a plant
that makes these compounds because it has
[SPEAKER_05]: these genes, and those are knowable
things, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, and we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: So a while back, the governor of New
Jersey said when they legalized cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in New Jersey that it should be grown at
Rutgers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rutgers said they couldn't do it because
the federal government would cut off their
[SPEAKER_00]: federal money, and recently, I believe
that Jerry Brown vetoed a bill that would
[SPEAKER_00]: have allowed universities in California
grow their own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wonder what you think about the New
Jersey recommendation, and I wonder what
[SPEAKER_00]: you think about Governor Brown vetoing
this bill, that about two days ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: Brown vetoed a bill that would have
allowed universities in California to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: their own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, that would have put California
on a collision course with the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government, and Brown apparently didn't
wanna do that, but it looks like the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislature understood what Dr. Cicely is
talking about, that if we're gonna do
[SPEAKER_00]: research, we need to let the researchers
grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the DEA's administrative law
judge, when it came to the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Massachusetts, said, yeah, let Dr. Kraker
grow his own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is absurd.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about research here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not talking about crummy 4% cannabis
that is grown in the University of
[SPEAKER_00]: Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, I'll just say that of all the
decisions that suck for all of us,
[SPEAKER_05]: that one, I can understand, because the
reason why it's been so hard to do
[SPEAKER_05]: research on cannabis in universities,
I mean, correct me if I'm wrong,
[SPEAKER_05]: has been a general feeling that you're a
federally-funded university, and if you
[SPEAKER_05]: piss off the federal government too much,
you could lose your funding and get no
[SPEAKER_05]: research done.
[SPEAKER_05]: The UC system has been way more aggressive
than any other universities anywhere,
[SPEAKER_05]: but they've also been very careful about
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: One thing that no university has done is
just start to grow the plant, and I think
[SPEAKER_05]: if a university went that, and that's the
most frustrating thing for me,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I think if any university went that
far, they would be in concrete danger of
[SPEAKER_05]: being shut down or having their funding
stopped by the feds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that was a pragmatic
decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have a different experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're working at LSU, the LSU AgCenter,
and under the state-regulated program
[SPEAKER_04]: there, the university is allowed to grow,
and we're doing a market system.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a private vendor, so you're a
private vendor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are models for that, but it's not
on campus.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of a hybrid model.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, I get what you're saying, but there
are, let's say there's workarounds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Even that blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm really impressed with Louisiana for
doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can if you're in Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sure if you can if you're in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my understanding of the veto,
going back to the question, and I might be
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong, but I read the letter that Governor
Brown wrote, and it specifically blocked a
[SPEAKER_01]: bill that was authorizing expenditure of
$2 million per year.
[SPEAKER_01]: To my friends here at the University of
California San Diego, and the reason why,
[SPEAKER_01]: the reason they were made for vetoing,
it was not in opposition to science,
[SPEAKER_01]: was the fact that there wasn't what Prop
64 had explicitly stated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is some politics behind this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the Bureau of Cannabis Control,
which is the agency that has been
[SPEAKER_01]: nominated to create it to really implement
Prop 64, I think they, for some reason,
[SPEAKER_01]: feel that they are in charge of the entire
pot of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this might be my over-interpretation
of the facts.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was my remote understanding that that's
why it ended up being, this is 1996,
[SPEAKER_06]: vetoed, was sort of complexities of
matching up what CMCR was going to do via
[SPEAKER_06]: Prop 64 or other mechanisms, and there was
some confusion.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think, as Daniele says,
I don't think it was specific to
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivation and stopping that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of people that are looking
for sources of cannabinoids outside of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis plant, whether synthesizing it in
the laboratory, growing it from strains of
[SPEAKER_03]: hops, or using yeast to grow cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to get your take and see if you
think that this is something that will
[SPEAKER_03]: pave the way for more widespread open
research, or if it's something that would
[SPEAKER_03]: keep it in the hands of corporate research
and pharmaceutical companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's a few different ways people are
trying to get cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_05]: Besides the cannabis plant, there are
companies that are trying to put the genes
[SPEAKER_05]: that make all of the necessary parts of
the cannabinoid pathway into yeast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard for me to imagine that those are
going to scale up in a way that adds up
[SPEAKER_05]: economically, because the cannabis plant
is an incredible production engine.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't know what will happen with
that.
[SPEAKER_05]: If that becomes the domino way that
cannabinoids are made, yeah, that'll
[SPEAKER_05]: centralize control of that in the hands of
companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the plant will still exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is also now a bunch of reports of
people getting CBD from plants that aren't
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't think those reports are accurate.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure someone will demonstrate that
shortly.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I don't think that those plants make
actual CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, bye.
See you next time.
