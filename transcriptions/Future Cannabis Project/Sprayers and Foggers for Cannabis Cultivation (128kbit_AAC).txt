[SPEAKER_01]: I see a paint sprayer in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We touched on that, the paint sprayer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, Scott, down in Carpinteria,
before everything happened, we were
[SPEAKER_03]: researching atomizers and things like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk about what you're seeing for
people spraying in greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, most people are using a
paint sprayer for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis community loves paint
sprayers, and maybe they work good for
[SPEAKER_01]: minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be something Scott could talk
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as a lot of these oils and the
sulfurs and things that people are using
[SPEAKER_01]: need a great amount of agitation in order
to be thoroughly applied properly and not
[SPEAKER_01]: leave residue, and residues create
phytotoxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And technically, you're supposed to be
spraying early, early in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before the sun comes up, not in the
evening time to let that stuff necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: soak in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what ends up happening with paint
sprayers is that they don't agitate a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of these products that are allowed in
cannabis, because there's not a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: them used.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of them do need a great amount
of agitation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they separate, that's what causes
those residues, leaves the phyto,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then isn't effective for whatever
you're trying to treat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we run into that a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I mean, having agricultural spray
tanks of any kind, they can be small,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can be large, but they have to have
an agitation system on the inside in order
[SPEAKER_01]: to make all this stuff really work how
it's designed to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Scott's research more into
droplet size.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, he kind of gets crazy on it,
but that's my base side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because what my kind of experience,
like the first time I was introduced to a
[SPEAKER_02]: paint sprayer was in 2016, which was
really one of my first big commercial
[SPEAKER_02]: projects.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that time I was like, this is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seemed to really solve a lot of
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: I liked that it was really lightweight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Personally, I think those like over the
shoulder atomizers is by far the worst
[SPEAKER_02]: piece of equipment that ever was designed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It leaks all over employees and nobody
wants to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if an employee or cultivator doesn't
enjoy using a piece of equipment,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're not going to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we went to farm after farm after
farm, seeing the same system systemic
[SPEAKER_02]: issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had those little atomizers with the
jug that leaks all over employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody likes that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't articulate them into the
plants, so they just kind of walk through
[SPEAKER_02]: the building and just kind of blow in the
air and kind of pretend to do their job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or then you end up with a paint sprayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the benefits of a paint sprayer is it
has a lightweight hose with a lightweight
[SPEAKER_02]: nozzle that's easy to articulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a high air pressure, so it'll move
the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can articulate the plant into the
correct position with the spray gun
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real hindrance of the paint sprayer is
the context.
[SPEAKER_02]: A paint sprayer is designed to typically
spray water-based or oil-based paints.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have different homogenization
requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're also spraying a product onto a
vertical surface and so gravity is
[SPEAKER_02]: homogenizing the product for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of those apply to a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other issue is that the
nozzle is not designed for the type of
[SPEAKER_02]: atomization that pesticides need,
because again, it's spraying paint.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not trying to kill pests with
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then the other concern is droplet
size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're a conventional farmer and you
have a pest issue, you typically contact
[SPEAKER_02]: your ag extension office.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ag extension sends a representative
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They correctly identify the pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: They recommend a pesticide for you to use.
[SPEAKER_02]: There comes along specifications for
droplet size that are necessary for that
[SPEAKER_02]: particular compound to kill that
particular pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they give you these little cards
that have water-sensitive like ink on it
[SPEAKER_02]: or something so that you spray it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's almost like a little grid that
shows you that, yeah, I am hitting the
[SPEAKER_02]: correct spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what people need to really wrap their
mind around is if you're trying to kill a
[SPEAKER_02]: russet mite, you know, just for whatever,
we'll just say russet mite is 100 microns
[SPEAKER_02]: across or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're shooting a droplet size
that's five times the size of that insect,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, you also have gaps that are the same
size as the droplet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have two issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're hitting a pest with a water droplet
that has no pesticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're hitting a plant with only
pesticide.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're missing the insect
altogether.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went to farm after farm after
farm all through 2016, 2017, 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are using pest sprayers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't get on top of pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I can't remember what year it
was, but in the first, I think really the
[SPEAKER_02]: first regenerative conference up there in
Portland, Susan Wainwright, the bug lady
[SPEAKER_02]: was there and she talked about this
phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that was the first time I really
had it explained in that way where I
[SPEAKER_02]: really had an aha movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think why it hasn't settled on the
cannabis industry is because Susan usually
[SPEAKER_02]: talks to you like a scolding teacher.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think people follow sometimes
because her tone's a little disrespectful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what she's trying to say is helpful in
that you need to have a proper nozzle that
[SPEAKER_02]: atomizes properly, that has small enough
droplets so that you're actually hitting
[SPEAKER_02]: the pest with a homogenized solution that
will actually kill the targeted pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, paint sprayers are great for
spraying nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll never get on top of pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Eric was consulting on a project just
recently where they're spraying and
[SPEAKER_02]: spraying and spraying and spraying and
spraying.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he suggested they use the commercial
sprayers.
[SPEAKER_02]: The crew has an objection for one reason
or another for the sprayers on why they
[SPEAKER_02]: don't wanna use them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what's important is that nozzle is
designed to homogenize and atomize
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticides for the issue of dealing with
pests.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're in a real pickle right now in
cannabis in that there hasn't been a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of focus on our needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have the big dram sprayers that
have these giant plastic tanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Will those cause issues with microbial
issues sometimes?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not, in my opinion, the best suited
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need new equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need a piece of equipment that is
designed for the regulated cannabis market
[SPEAKER_02]: that has the characteristics of an
agricultural sprayer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just doesn't fit yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not here yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The electrostatic technology is nice,
but you see it in a little wonky small
[SPEAKER_00]: form or extremely complicated big form.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't allow the smaller operator to
use some of the technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's why you see so much of
the paint sprayer tech is because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: readily available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree, they're not making the
products that we need for our industry
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's plants, but it's different in
that you can't use so many of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: tools prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that cannabis by nature,
the fact that it's epidural layer and the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of that is so convoluted and
unique in its composition that it allows
[SPEAKER_00]: you to have a lot of hiding places,
tough to get up in the canopies,
[SPEAKER_00]: tough to cover and spray correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the canopy starts to become huge,
like some of these operations,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're basically just trying to outrun it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you see these shorter day
cycles where there's a limit on how long
[SPEAKER_00]: they're gonna flower these rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of that limit is based
off of how long they can outrun the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem before it becomes so problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't get any value at a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I see a lot of big ops that don't
sell flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only sell concentrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause problems go to production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yup.
[SPEAKER_00]: They cleanse it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I know we all laugh because it's
just so fucking real.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis plants, it's its own little
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been saying that for a while,
but it doesn't mean that you can't take
[SPEAKER_00]: tech from other industry combined and dial
it in, but it just has to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't seen that yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing about agitation that Eric
was talking about, it's huge because I
[SPEAKER_00]: remember a lecture you gave Scott,
I was at where you were talking about a
[SPEAKER_00]: nematode distribution and how when you
check the nematodes in the beds,
[SPEAKER_00]: you saw them all over the place in terms
of number.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you realized that it was due to the
fact that the tanks weren't agitated when
[SPEAKER_00]: they did the application.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you were getting was no nematodes
in some portions and then all the
[SPEAKER_00]: nematodes and others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just highlights that same situation
where everything has to be mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: continuously or you're spraying liquid
with does nothing or you're spraying
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's phytotoxicity,
which you damage as the plant opens it up
[SPEAKER_00]: to the pathogenic entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you have a whole nother set of
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever scale you're at, the difference
between the ends is what really kills you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know what, what Eric
experienced that this one particular
[SPEAKER_02]: facility that he stopped by is that
literally changing to the appropriate
[SPEAKER_02]: agricultural sprayer within what,
a couple of weeks or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: There was noticeable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, within a couple of weeks,
so phytotoxicity went down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you know, that's injury due to
sunlight and being intensified through a
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical or compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have half the building that's
getting an excessively concentrated
[SPEAKER_02]: solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got half the building that's getting
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of it's getting on top of the pest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then now because of the paint sprayer
handle, you're also now, when you are
[SPEAKER_02]: spraying, you're also missing the pest
altogether because the droplet size is too
[SPEAKER_02]: big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Too big?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it's like, I guess a good
example would be like shotgun shells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like shotgun shells come in a single
slug.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come in like a six shot, and then
they come in like a 40 shot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you shoot that up against the wall,
the single slug leaves big gap around it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a six shot is going to make six
holes, but there's big gaps around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so as you go down and BB size,
you cover more ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, that's what's really
missing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So us personally, for our clients,
we've been just kind of adapting spray
[SPEAKER_02]: guns from, you know, agricultural areas to
other pieces of equipment that they like
[SPEAKER_02]: to use right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big Frankenstein time right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scott went, we went to the World Ag Expo
together and Scott stopped by every booth
[SPEAKER_01]: that had anything to do with spray,
nozzles, things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was insane, but actually we learned a
lot, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, if you ask them what works for pump
and sludge, they look at you like you're
crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was just going to say, so at the
Expo, like what were your learnings there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I know like, for example,
are you still a blue mat enthusiast?
[SPEAKER_02]: I love blue mats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, like you're the one who
introduced everyone to blue mats and you
[SPEAKER_03]: were the champion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, for everybody I know, the carpet
area, but like, so, you know, and you saw
[SPEAKER_03]: them and you were like, oh my God,
these service specific purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what did you see, you know,
your dorky nozzle research?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what, what, what do you see?
[SPEAKER_03]: What'd you learn?
[SPEAKER_03]: What, what do you think you could apply to
this industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think, you know, the overall
message is that the current context of
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture is not suited really to what
I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's suited to using really highly
soluble chemicals and water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So every piece of equipment is suited to
very water soluble salt chemicals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I would go around to the
different spray people and what Eric was
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about, the sludge is like,
okay, if I want to do something that's got
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit of texture to it,
a little bit of organic something,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to define it to the chemical
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: A sludge, you know, because most of the
chemicals just become a water solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so water soluble.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like water.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the nozzles, all the screens,
all the filters, all the pumps,
[SPEAKER_02]: all the, everything is suited to
essentially spraying water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I would say, well, what if I wanted
to spray a sludge to see if they had any
[SPEAKER_02]: sort of reaction and they look at me like
the hell, what, you know, and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, I'm spraying organic products and it
has a little bit of a texture to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just use the word sludge to see what
you, and he's like, well, nobody wants to
[SPEAKER_02]: spray sludge.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the biggest orifice thing you
have?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they would pull out, okay,
well, if we're, you know, dealing with
[SPEAKER_02]: really crummy well water that has silt in
it or something, this is what we would
[SPEAKER_02]: use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And none of that stuff is anywhere near
close to what it would be desirable for
[SPEAKER_02]: spraying compost tea, for example.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, Sarah and I had to come up
with techniques because nothing is really
[SPEAKER_02]: all that suited to spraying tea at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had to figure out other techniques
to avoid having to spray tea at scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we had to come up with new strategies
to solve the problems that didn't involve
[SPEAKER_02]: tea because it was too complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and, you know, I keep kicking
around, you know, building some spec
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment, but I don't want to do
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do my role.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I want to do analytics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to do math.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be an equipment supplier.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to make shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to be a manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive to design that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I did, I did some blow mold design on
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had this little idea years ago and I was
like, if you want to burn money quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: get into R and D.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have a need though.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like right now people are failing
with paint sprayers or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I say DRAM, they're the biggest one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's things I like about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot I don't like about their
equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, you know, the real issue that I
think we've experienced as cannabis people
[SPEAKER_02]: is, you know, we've done, we've used damn
near everybody's product and we've seen
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've tried to help a farm be successful
damn near every product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, after the project's over,
I'll reach out to the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, Hey, you know, we were just at
this farm for a week.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the issues that they're having.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we're quantifying.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the problems we're seeing,
you know, and they respond like,
[SPEAKER_02]: who the hell are you?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, well, I'm a person
that tries to get people successful with
[SPEAKER_02]: your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are the things that I regularly
see.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far, the only people, the only
people really that have been receptive to
[SPEAKER_02]: our feedback has been grassroots fabric
pots and sustainable village, which is who
[SPEAKER_02]: sells the blue mats.
[SPEAKER_02]: No other agricultural.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think Tyler is actually watching right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, what's up, Tyler?
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, grassroots has been great.
[SPEAKER_02]: They listen to the market and they make
changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and, you know, sustainable village,
those are the people that sells blue mats
[SPEAKER_02]: out in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had a running dialogue with Steve
from blue mats for five, six years now,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they make updates based on what we're
seeing in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, there's this resistance or
this like culture, like was being said way
[SPEAKER_02]: at the beginning is, you know,
there's this clashing of cultures and
[SPEAKER_02]: clashing of, um, we're on this team or
you're on the weed team.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far zero TBR.
[SPEAKER_02]: Manufacturers have been receptive to our
feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: Zero spray manufacturers have been
receptive to our feedback.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, at some point, somebody
will fill those niches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
