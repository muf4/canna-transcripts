[SPEAKER_00]: When we're looking at product out here,
a little disappointed on the concentrates,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when it comes to cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think a person should be paying
over $40 for a good cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I say a good cartridge, there
shouldn't be any propylene glycol in it,
[SPEAKER_00]: MCT oil, any other additives that could be
harmful to the consumer as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also flavor additives,
which is very interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I noticed that a lot of companies out
here are using way too many what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally derived terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're buying terpenes from various
companies, whether it's in Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: California, other states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't give the user a good
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't taste like a particular strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think these companies and I
don't think these budtenders that are
[SPEAKER_00]: selling these products are also educated
on what's actually going into these
[SPEAKER_00]: products as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually create a lot of cartridges
in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a very efficient process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using distillate, cannabis-derived
terpenes, very good flavor profile,
[SPEAKER_00]: good potency, and ultimately affordable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's the affordability aspect
that's going to help change that market
[SPEAKER_00]: shift from the illicit market,
again, to the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's fairly insane when I'm seeing good
cartridges that are over $50, seeing live
[SPEAKER_00]: resin that's $100 plus, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre-tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-tax, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you add 37% tax on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the average Joe out here cannot afford
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the way that the
industry is moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you look at market analytics,
for example, you see a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: that's reverting to more infused products
and concentrate over flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the days of just combusting flour
are coming to an end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that said, I think California has
incredible flour out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to Colorado, I think you have a
lot of bad product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you go to those select
dispensaries, you can find some really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, just similar to Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of roll the dice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're very excited to come out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully we'll be open in about 10 months
or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, bring those high quality
concentrates basically to the average Joe
[SPEAKER_00]: and really expand that market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you mentioned that you're going to set
up shop in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about why you picked
Sacramento?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sacramento, what we noticed and kind of
parallel to our brand is we really want
[SPEAKER_00]: just like hard, everyday people just
working for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sacramento also seems to really want
cannabis business dollars, very business
[SPEAKER_00]: friendly, unlike other cities within
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the type of municipal allies
that we try to align ourselves with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, give me some examples of cities that
you thought would be cannabis friendly
[SPEAKER_01]: that totally surprised you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we didn't think that L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: was super cannabis friendly, especially
with the high taxes, also with the
[SPEAKER_00]: application process out here as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing with San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also thought that Sacramento was
kind of just a good midpoint where,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, we can do some pretty heavy
distribution just across the state as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where do you plan on sort?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you're you're doing extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you need the source flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do you plan the source from here in
California?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are looking for partners for that as
we speak.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what kind of do you want indoor,
outdoor greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want it from a certain region or
Appalachian?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think off the bat, when we first
start our our production, I think we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be focusing more on cartridges
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Since we do go through a distillate
process, we don't necessarily need the
[SPEAKER_00]: most incredible, expensive flour to
extract since we are kind of stripping all
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpenes off and other things like
that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we'd probably be looking more
for like greenhouse to begin with,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have some specially trained raw
material acquisition folks who do go to
[SPEAKER_00]: these cultivations, who do study their
processes, look at their quality of flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, too, we want to make sure that
these companies that are providing us raw
[SPEAKER_00]: material are doing not just the minimum
testing, but making sure that they're even
[SPEAKER_00]: going above and beyond.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, we're looking for, you know,
specific pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for specific microbial
content.
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, in California, total yeast
and mold isn't tested.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure that that is above
or I should say below a certain threshold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terpene profiles, all that different
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, we want to make sure that we're
venting those raw material partners
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the acquisition experts, they're coming
from the Colorado market.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is correct.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are they looking for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like when they go out to basically buy
biomass, right?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you just mentioned like what
things they don't want to have.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think a lot of things you're looking
at is what's going into that fire to begin
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're looking at agricultural
chemicals such as like fertilizers and
[SPEAKER_00]: even pesticides as well, we know that
certain fertilizers have a lot of heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: metals in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're looking at a concentrate
company, if you're using a very clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: low metal fertilizers, for example,
that translates into the concentrate and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to have a very good flavorful
concentrate versus we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivations out there that are using
pretty common agricultural chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we noticed that those don't translate
super well when those things get
[SPEAKER_00]: extracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want to make sure that there's clean
chemicals going into that plant as
[SPEAKER_00]: naturally as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so having and basically that
translates into a clean extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you seeing kind of wholesale
pricing trends in both?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I assume you guys are now paying
attention to California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of what's going on in Colorado,
like biomass per pound pricing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you seeing in California and are
prices trending back up now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not one of those acquisitions
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have to ask them what that
California market is looking like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I imagine that it's quite more expensive
than Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, what we're seeing on a wholesale
price for trim, we're seeing probably an
[SPEAKER_00]: average between $150 to $200 a pound for
trim for snapshot in time 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what direction is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that trending up, down?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right now in Colorado, there's an
extreme price war occurring.
[SPEAKER_00]: A race to the bottom is how it's been for
the past two to three years that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: still seeing a pretty level market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike Oregon, for example, where they
actually have a huge surplus of product
[SPEAKER_00]: that's just been hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado actually has done a very good job
regulating the Colorado market in a sense
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're balancing that market,
where we don't have this giant surplus and
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually don't have that shortage
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think with outdoor cultivations in
greenhouse in Colorado, it's just been
[SPEAKER_00]: making that process a bit more efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, that's kind of driving down
those prices a little bit and making the
[SPEAKER_00]: product ultimately more affordable for the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: With your product portfolio of extracted
products, what's popping?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's new and getting hot?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you have like bait tanks,
you have live resin, you have live rosin,
[SPEAKER_01]: all these different products.
[SPEAKER_01]: What for you guys is kind of trending up
and down?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so what we're seeing right now in
Colorado is definitely high quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: affordable vape cartridges is by far the
most popular product, not only for
[SPEAKER_00]: residents who live there, but also for
tourists who are visiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado relies a lot on tourist dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: We obviously have some of the best skiing
in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, we have a lot of people come to
Denver and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially like the music scene over
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go to Red Rocks in Colorado,
you're seeing a lot of people use their
[SPEAKER_00]: vape pens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're seeing a lot of people using their
vape pens on the slope.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people use them at home too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just very easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of people out there who are
a little hesitant of taking a dab and
[SPEAKER_00]: using a torch or turning on an e-nail.
[SPEAKER_00]: People just like the ease of that high
quality vape cartridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with your vape cartridges,
what company are you sourcing from?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did you pick as a vape tank slash
cartridge?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually have our own suppliers
actually out in China where we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: custom make a lot of our materials because
we noticed that a lot of suppliers in
[SPEAKER_00]: China don't have the best products,
especially when it comes to product safety
[SPEAKER_00]: and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually have a very, very... We
have one partner in particular again in
[SPEAKER_00]: China who is making a lot of custom vape
pen cartridges and actually a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: custom packaging for us as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's so important to vent your
clientele in China because I think anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: over there is going to try to sell you
anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, one of our main concerns is
definitely public health and safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's definitely not in our interest to
get any of our clientele sick,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make sure that they're having a
very good safe experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think that's one of the kind
of current areas of research is our vape
[SPEAKER_01]: tanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously you can have different
companies that manufacture them
[SPEAKER_01]: differently, which would have different
levels of safety issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it seems like... So what, from what
you've noticed in the market of vape
[SPEAKER_01]: tanks, not specifically what you're using,
but what are some of the health risk
[SPEAKER_01]: components of that hardware?
[SPEAKER_01]: You could get clean oil and it goes into
these tanks and they don't test after,
[SPEAKER_01]: they test before it goes in, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can be like, no, it's clean,
it's safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then someone's inhaling heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the components that you guys
have noticed that are the leading causes
[SPEAKER_01]: of potential health risks for vape
cartridges?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we look at a lot of current studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, this needs to be studied
way more than it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're actually very much looking
forward to hopefully some more legitimate
[SPEAKER_00]: studies coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what we're seeing is definitely
non-ceramic based vaporizer cartridges do
[SPEAKER_00]: have actually quite a bit of heavy metals
when that oil is in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And additionally, again, we still don't
even know even how that translates versus
[SPEAKER_00]: when you do inhale from that cartridge,
how much of that heavy metal is actually
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out?
[SPEAKER_00]: How does heating it impact that heavy
metal intake as well, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just so much things that we don't
know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we always want to be on the air of
caution.
So thank you very much.
