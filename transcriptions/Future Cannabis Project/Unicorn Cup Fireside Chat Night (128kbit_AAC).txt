[SPEAKER_12]: Welcome to Future Cannabis Project
everybody and tonight we have fireside
[SPEAKER_12]: chats.
[SPEAKER_12]: I have been posting about this for a
little while now and I hope you're excited
[SPEAKER_12]: to join in in the conversation because we
have one hell of a set of speakers coming
[SPEAKER_12]: up to us today and just some of the best
conversations I have ever happened to be a
[SPEAKER_12]: part of.
[SPEAKER_12]: This lineup is a rock star.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have I think around over 10 of the top
people in the North American industry,
[SPEAKER_12]: some of the most authentic, true human
beings, two true people of the plant,
[SPEAKER_12]: humus beings, and let's just talk a little
bit and I'll let you know who's coming in
[SPEAKER_12]: on this show.
[SPEAKER_12]: Kevin Jodry will be there, career hustler.
[SPEAKER_12]: Josh and Kelly from Dragonfly Earth
Medicine, huge speakers in this.
[SPEAKER_12]: Jay LeBlanc is in and out.
[SPEAKER_12]: He's a little bit busy because he's
running the whole event here at the
[SPEAKER_12]: Unicorn Cup in the fireside chats.
[SPEAKER_12]: Shannon Ross, CEO Antidote, brilliant,
brilliant human being.
[SPEAKER_12]: Noel Lease, founder and of Nectar
Collective, head of extracts at Terra and
[SPEAKER_12]: Antidote.
[SPEAKER_12]: Don't forget about Michael West,
coordinator at Rubicon Organics.
[SPEAKER_12]: Marcus B.C.
[SPEAKER_12]: Bubbleman Richardson, chief trichome
officer at Whistler Technologies,
[SPEAKER_12]: one hell of a character and one hell of a
human being.
[SPEAKER_12]: He drops some major bombs.
[SPEAKER_12]: Pam West is in there, cross-trained
cannabis goat, earth wolf farms.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got, who else do we have in there?
[SPEAKER_12]: Jameson Wellborn from the Banyan Tree.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got some amazing human beings that
have stopped by and joined.
[SPEAKER_12]: Christian Clapton, director of sales and
marketing at Rosebud Cannabis Farms and
[SPEAKER_12]: Custom Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've got Ron Harrington was in the house
from Gold House Seas and Willowwood
[SPEAKER_12]: Consulting.
[SPEAKER_12]: Noel Lease, I mean like the lineup is just
phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can't wait to let you all get in on
this conversation.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I hope you all enjoy it because fuck
man, it was awesome recording it and it
[SPEAKER_12]: was even awesome.
[SPEAKER_12]: It was even more awesome being a part of
it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I can't wait to show every little bit
of it to you now.
[SPEAKER_12]: So without any further ado, let the show
begin.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome to the Unicorn Cup.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here for the Fireside Chat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a question was asked about
perspective, I think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Am I the only Californian here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Two?
[SPEAKER_03]: Two?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like currently like operating though,
in terms of like operational, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the question was, what's my view on
the Canadian cannabis industry as I sit
[SPEAKER_03]: here in person?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's interesting because to me,
I mean, I'm familiar with the industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: In Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the evolution of it became almost
identity-less where your package looks
[SPEAKER_03]: like, I have no idea what's in the
package.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't even have an identity on the
pack except a stick on label.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I look at it and I'm like, you're
taking the identity away from the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Canada, it over-cooperatized it to
the point where it's almost impossible for
[SPEAKER_03]: a small person to gain traction without
some collaborative effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's odd because to me, Canada had
such a thriving craft community for so
[SPEAKER_03]: long and the lack of ability to be seen in
any way that lets you highlight your
[SPEAKER_03]: differences, that lets you showcase what
you do, some kind of identity on a
[SPEAKER_03]: package.
[SPEAKER_03]: I looked at the walls and I knew some of
the companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had somebody take me to a store so I
was able to kind of understand how do you
[SPEAKER_03]: purchase at a store here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was just very hard to identify with
the product and understand what you wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: to get and then expectations of what the
quality was in the bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so hopefully, just like us in
California, we go through an evolution
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just think that really we're early and
we are, we're early in the new world of
[SPEAKER_03]: industry and there's teething pains.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the truth of it is, is the people who
regulate and control have very little
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the truth that I learned is that they
regulate us so hard because they believe
[SPEAKER_03]: we're so sneaky and the only way you could
believe that is if you were sneaky
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what I learned was that you guys
are really dirty and you think we'd screw
[SPEAKER_03]: you this hard and this is why you're doing
it to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was really insightful.
[SPEAKER_15]: You nailed it with the stealing of the
identity.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't know how to buy in a cannabis
store in Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: When I walk into it, everything looks the
same.
[SPEAKER_15]: All the packaging looks the same.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm often like, where's the hash?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like where's the extract?
[SPEAKER_15]: Sometimes they'll have a little sort of
spot.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, down to the covering of the
windows, you see all of that is done under
[SPEAKER_15]: the guise of protecting children.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's how they do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't have the windows open.
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to make it very safe for people
to come in and rob you so they don't get
[SPEAKER_15]: caught.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so you cover all the front windows
because God forbid if a child walked by
[SPEAKER_15]: that store and saw through the window,
it's okay if they see the massive amounts
[SPEAKER_15]: of alcohol that kill millions of people
annually right next door at the liquor
[SPEAKER_15]: store.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if they see cannabis products through
the window, you've now broken a federal
[SPEAKER_15]: law in Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: And also the packaging, you can't have fun
fonts.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't have anything that looks like it
was a cartoon or any type of unique cool
[SPEAKER_15]: packaging because of course that as well
is what they're marketing to children.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: So they allowed us to have federal
legalization in Canada, but under the
[SPEAKER_15]: guise that it's a dangerous thing that
children need to be protected from.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's what's led us to where we are
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think a lot of the laws were copy and
pasted directly from alcohol and tobacco,
[SPEAKER_06]: and we're forced to shoulder our way out
of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in Canada, I think the issue becomes
when the two goals of legalization are
[SPEAKER_06]: protecting children from cannabis and
converting the black market, but the
[SPEAKER_06]: regulations are written in such a way that
the only way somebody can move quickly in
[SPEAKER_06]: this market is to raise an egregious
amount of money legally and then deploy
[SPEAKER_06]: that capital.
[SPEAKER_06]: It turns to Bay Street, which is Canada's
Wall Street to raise all this capital
[SPEAKER_06]: quickly and then completely misallocate
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what's happened in Canada where
we had an incredible opportunity to become
[SPEAKER_06]: a world leader in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what happened was, greet, greet,
white collar businessmen and stock brokers
[SPEAKER_06]: and analysts who took the square footage
of your property and not the square
[SPEAKER_06]: footage of the building on that property
and appraised the value of your company
[SPEAKER_06]: and how many buildable square feet there
were on your acreage versus your 10,000
[SPEAKER_06]: square foot building and then raised
capital based on that are the problem in
[SPEAKER_06]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if we were able to properly allocate
half of the capital that was raised in
[SPEAKER_06]: Canada, we would be in a much better
position than we are today.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we've lost all trust in retail
investorship.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so there's a lot of jaded individuals
who listen to a lot of people who promise
[SPEAKER_06]: that they were here to build this industry
and here for the long haul, and they're no
[SPEAKER_06]: longer here anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's three years later.
[SPEAKER_06]: Literally, some of them are raising money
to go fucking mine asteroids.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, we have an issue here where
the people who actually care are left to
[SPEAKER_06]: pick up the pieces of a system that
doesn't cater to the people who got it to
[SPEAKER_06]: where it is today.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is the First Nations part of Canada,
too, which does have a lot more open
[SPEAKER_05]: availability to do different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you go into a dispenser on a First
Nations like land, you can have a
[SPEAKER_05]: different experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can average individual go there?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, you know, and when you when you link
up with, you know, the First Nations,
[SPEAKER_05]: you want to do something different,
you know, it really does help.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they have the ability to create their
own laws and their own abilities through
[SPEAKER_05]: packaging and working with farms and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a way to affect federal laws
through that to show them, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: with maybe different taxation and
different brackets and different ways of
[SPEAKER_05]: working at farms, direct sales that,
you know, that can make a change.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and just to touch on that,
the First Nations are actually not working
[SPEAKER_10]: with the feds at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: They've totally decided that they're not
going to have anything to do with the
[SPEAKER_10]: feds.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then when you ask the feds,
which we've had plenty of meetings with
[SPEAKER_10]: the feds, they're like, hey, what are you
guys going to do about this?
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you plan on doing?
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody want to answer that question?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they're all looking at each
other on the panel.
[SPEAKER_10]: So really, there's an incredible power in
Canada with the First Nations to be able
[SPEAKER_10]: to do it better and to be able to step out
and really check out how badly that we did
[SPEAKER_10]: it and be able to step in with some better
protocols, some better action forward and
[SPEAKER_10]: better education to the community.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think that, you know, they have
gold in their hands to maybe save this
[SPEAKER_10]: industry, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, there's definitely space.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's space to go forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, you know, I was, I was in
Berlin a number of years ago and I was on
[SPEAKER_03]: a, I was speaker at an event and I get on
this tour bus with the, with maybe 40 or
[SPEAKER_03]: 50 other people to go to this club and
everybody's asking each other what they
[SPEAKER_03]: do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone was some kind of investment
broker and I was the only grower on the
[SPEAKER_03]: entire bus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when people found out I was a grower
on the bus, have you ever seen that EF
[SPEAKER_03]: Hutton commercial where when EF Hutton
speaks, everyone listens, when,
[SPEAKER_03]: when, when you could see the murmur
through the whole bus and you could see
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone turn around and go, wow,
that's a grower because they had never met
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was like, this is fascinating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, what are you guys doing
here?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, oh, our world is really
hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cannabis to us is really easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, so you're going to come in
here and they go, yeah, we're like
[SPEAKER_03]: locusts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We go and take everything we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we moved to the next industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was such a, a revelatory statement
because it, it helped you understand the
[SPEAKER_03]: mindset of the investment group that was
coming in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what I knew at that moment was that
we were about to get into carnage because
[SPEAKER_03]: the people that were coming in were here
not to stay.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were here to take as much as they
could and then go on to the next industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't have an emotional connection
to people or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was, they were not, they,
they, it wasn't just herbs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was, it was sociopathic tendencies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was, it was such a, an eye-opening
moment because these were the groups that
[SPEAKER_03]: were about to demolish the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to see it firsthand.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in the U S same issues,
Canada, same issues, but I'm in,
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in a lot of countries working.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't matter where you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: The craft community is just getting
buried.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the people that are trying to bury us
aren't doing very good job.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're failing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the irony is that it's almost,
I hate to see people fail, but I kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: don't hate to see you fail.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me feel kind of good because your
intent was to destroy everyone around you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that wasn't our intent.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, we just wanted to exist as producers
and have a cannabis relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone else had this intent to where
we're going to take over and not just get
[SPEAKER_03]: market share, but we're going to take your
share.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not unique to Canada or,
or California, you know, every country I
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in, it's the same story.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the only way any of these groups
succeed is to actually work
[SPEAKER_03]: collaboratively in some capacity.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, when you said they want to bury us,
you know, it's an accurate metaphor.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the reason they didn't do a good job
is because they didn't realize that we
[SPEAKER_15]: were seeds.
[SPEAKER_15]: And when you bury a seed, it grows.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I think it comes down to,
you know, when you come from that
[SPEAKER_06]: community, you care how that community
views you and, and, and, and, and,
[SPEAKER_06]: and sees and judges you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas when you're not connected to that
community, you're playing by a completely
[SPEAKER_06]: different set of rules than somebody who
has a deep connection to this plan.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and I think that we all make our
decisions, you know, not based on
[SPEAKER_06]: financial enrichment, but you know,
what is best for the community,
[SPEAKER_06]: what's best for the plant, and then
ultimately what's best for us and our
[SPEAKER_06]: families.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that, you know, multiple
considerations are taken place.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas we're competing against people who
have very limited considerations.
[SPEAKER_06]: The consideration is, listen, am I going
to be financially enriched from this
[SPEAKER_06]: scenario?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes or no?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, let's fucking do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, I think that when you're
dealing with these, these people,
[SPEAKER_06]: you're, you're dealing with individuals
who are playing with a much thinner rule
[SPEAKER_06]: book than you're playing with.
[SPEAKER_09]: I also think that we're kind of moving on
to the next phase where the corporations
[SPEAKER_09]: came, the big guys came, they tried to
make a bunch of money, some of them did,
[SPEAKER_09]: some of them didn't.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now it's, where does it sit?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was the, the concept of,
can you actually do it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you actually grow good cannabis at a
scale?
[SPEAKER_09]: And now I think that we're looking at how,
since I've been to Canada, I've realized
[SPEAKER_09]: this is a craft built community,
it's a local built community.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hope that we see us move into more
micros, which is what we're about to do.
[SPEAKER_09]: And really be able to see the craft people
get a chance at this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because the corporations did fail.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're making it, some are making it,
but it's not so great out there for them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's a time, cannabis has the ability
to build a completely new paradigm of
[SPEAKER_09]: corporate structure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, do you see a future in the
micro cultivation license in cannabis with
[SPEAKER_06]: the current 2150 square foot canopy cap?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that works.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's set up for failure.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to be, it has to be adjusted.
[SPEAKER_07]: If they got a couple of people that knew
what the heck they were talking about and
[SPEAKER_07]: what it takes to make a buck in this
industry and still cover the COAs,
[SPEAKER_07]: the employees that you need, the record
keeping, the vaults that everything has to
[SPEAKER_07]: be done in the infrastructure that they
require, there's no way that you can make
[SPEAKER_07]: money with a micro.
[SPEAKER_07]: They just set it up for failure.
[SPEAKER_07]: So until Canada decides, you know what,
if we're a flea and we got to eat on the
[SPEAKER_07]: dog, the dog's got to be alive or there's
going to be no blood there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so until they figure out a way to make
it profitable, people can't keep losing
[SPEAKER_07]: money because the money is bleeding out of
investors into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Rich people got money and it just goes
right down the tubes and it's gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I, I hate to be negative about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, people say, oh, you know,
it's bad saying you're like a bunch of
[SPEAKER_07]: crabs in a pot, you know, and everybody's
climbing over each other, eating the guy
[SPEAKER_07]: underneath, but it's, it's kind of like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's, there's, there's structure
in it like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like where we live, I can give you some
ideas of like the compression.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Humboldt County, when they,
when they flew us with a satellite to
[SPEAKER_03]: really figure out how many active grows
there were, they figured, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: they, they were able to easily pick out
about 35,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I figured there was probably another
10,000 they didn't pick up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're talking about 45,000 grows that
were present.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Humboldt's the size of the state of
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only have 120,000 people.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would generate in about 8 billion a
year wholesale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that comes out to every single human
being in Humboldt County was getting 70
[SPEAKER_03]: grand a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you had five people in your house,
you're making 350,000 every house.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody, the money in Humboldt was
supernatural.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you got to see what happened when
regular people get paid.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we had 35,000.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if there was 45,000, how many
active licenses that occurred?
[SPEAKER_03]: So they went from that 40 down to 1100.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many active of this year?
[SPEAKER_03]: 250.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, and I have two cultivation licenses,
three that I'm tied into.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm three of that 250.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so how about Trinity County,
the whole County, Trinity was big.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Humboldt as an entity did 8 billion,
the Emerald Triangle did 14 billion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I did the economic essay for Humboldt
County, meaning that the university came
[SPEAKER_03]: to me for assistance years ago saying,
we want to do the first economic index of
[SPEAKER_03]: the, of the impact of black market
cannabis on the economy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they couldn't get any data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they came to me and said,
could you help us?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I knew we needed that number to
quantify our value as cultivators in
[SPEAKER_03]: Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was able to come up with half a
billion dollars of quantifiable data that
[SPEAKER_03]: the, that the university could use to
create the first economic index for
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I didn't know that I was going to
get credit for the study.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just helped the university out.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name got put on the study as the source
of the information.
[SPEAKER_03]: It brought an ocean of, of politicians and
tax specialists to my office from that
[SPEAKER_03]: moment forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause they said, you have a unique vision
into the game because no one else is
[SPEAKER_03]: coming up with these numbers that we can
quantify.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to let you know the real
numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause we know how much money's coming out
here because we measure the cash coming
[SPEAKER_03]: out of the trucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the, we're the government.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go, you're doing 8 billion wholesale
and the whole triangle is doing 14.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Mendo and Trinity, we're doing six.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'd say Mendo is four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trinity is two.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many active licenses exist in Trinity
today?
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven active licenses, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the problem is, is that everyone's
like, we're all going to die off.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's really taking place is we as
the people are dying off, the licenses are
[SPEAKER_03]: being sold and acquired and held so that
as the evolution goes on, those real
[SPEAKER_03]: estate valuations can re-rise and the
value of the crop can re-rise and new
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers will emerge.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think that they're bad people
that are coming in for the craft licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it kills me to see every one of
my neighbors sell their farm and run for
[SPEAKER_03]: their fucking lives.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's also the hard work variable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: You got to love it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You got to fucking love this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also, you know, there were a number of
individuals that got into the cultivation
[SPEAKER_06]: of cannabis, especially in Northern
California, but all over the world
[SPEAKER_06]: globally to be able to execute on a
certain lifestyle that they wanted to
[SPEAKER_06]: employ.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whether that be like, you know,
snowboarding or surfing or whatever that
[SPEAKER_06]: was.
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe the cannabis wasn't,
you know, the front and center thing in
[SPEAKER_06]: their lives.
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe being dedicated and,
you know, honing in on a hard work ethic
[SPEAKER_06]: wasn't something that they were doing over
the years.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were enjoying life and doing other
things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that now in this legal
industry where your margins are slim and
[SPEAKER_06]: measurable, there's a lot of individuals
that maybe don't want to do the leg
[SPEAKER_06]: lifting required to operate in the space.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're hearing a lot of complaints
around that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And some of that we just have to
understand is, you know, there was a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of margin for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so... The paid guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people I met, I mean, really,
honestly, there's two cultivators,
[SPEAKER_03]: ones that own cultivation and ones who
cultivate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ones that own cultivation have
infrastructure and employees and they get
[SPEAKER_03]: paid, but they're not the ones who
physically are on the job.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the ones that are leaving as
rapidly as possible trying to go find new
[SPEAKER_03]: money.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem is there's no money to
find.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm watching them run from state to
state to state to state and I'm just like,
[SPEAKER_03]: holy shit, you'd do better just to stay
home.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's real cultivators that
really love the craft, the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're still sticking with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're just trying to figure out what
scale they can operate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then like, if you're asking my opinion
on stuff, I'm trying to tell you how to
[SPEAKER_03]: like diversify and don't, whatever you do,
don't lose your land, don't lose your
[SPEAKER_03]: license, don't lose your farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Figure out what you got to do to keep it
alive and allow this evolution to occur
[SPEAKER_03]: because it will.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you're back into the world you
were supposed to be in.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that the transition is painful.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, and I think just to say to what you
were saying, Jamison, and also to sort of
[SPEAKER_10]: touch on what you were talking about,
Kevin, is that I think that we were
[SPEAKER_10]: cultivators and in that our community
members, we were hustlers, we were talking
[SPEAKER_10]: to each other, and also our equity was
seasonal.
[SPEAKER_10]: Having seasonal equity means that you have
equity at a certain time of year,
[SPEAKER_10]: but that doesn't mean that all of the
licensing and all of the people and all of
[SPEAKER_10]: the banks and everybody that wants your
money is working on that same seasonal
[SPEAKER_10]: equity that you have.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that right there is one of the most
difficult things because I know for sure
[SPEAKER_10]: in California as well as here,
everybody comes for you in the spring.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I mean, if you've been cultivating
for a long time, your funds are low in the
[SPEAKER_10]: springtime.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it really isn't just people not wanting
to work hard.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's people not understanding what the
work is now.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like we were speaking one language
and we were doing it really well and we
[SPEAKER_10]: were all speaking the same language.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now sort of this whole other thing
came and said, now we're forcing you to
[SPEAKER_10]: speak another language.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, a lot of us have been so busy
continuing to work, we didn't have time to
[SPEAKER_10]: open up the books and learn and speak the
other language as well as the seasonal
[SPEAKER_10]: equity wasn't there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's just, it's really important to
look at all aspects as to why the
[SPEAKER_10]: cultivators aren't the ones who are
holding the majority of licenses or the
[SPEAKER_10]: legacy market.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of us are still holding on,
but it's challenging because basically
[SPEAKER_10]: they're asking a fish to be a tiger.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we've all been working really hard at
being fishes and we're great at it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's a lot of different things in
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, and it's definitely not just the
cultivator, but like where we are,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your government does distro.
[SPEAKER_03]: So government handles distro for you,
so it's distro.
[SPEAKER_03]: The issue though is that they're
definitely not handling that product
[SPEAKER_03]: gently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you're having distro that's
destroying the quality of your
[SPEAKER_03]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not the cultivators fault,
but no one knows how to blame anybody but
[SPEAKER_03]: the cultivator.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we are, it's the distribution
straight up steals your money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking straight up steals your money
and folds up and leaves and you have zero.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only company that I can trust is a
giant one and everyone trips on dealing
[SPEAKER_03]: giant companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the only ones that pay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every one of these other distros screws
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all they have to do is make a single
error.
[SPEAKER_03]: They make a single error and they lose a
license for 24, 48, 72 hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to unload their entire business
and then get, so you make any errors in
[SPEAKER_03]: lab or you make any errors in distro,
you destroy, I mean, we're talking tiny
[SPEAKER_03]: errors.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're destroyed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the amount of oversight is heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: My storefront, we've had eight inspections
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking, they come through and dump
out the garbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go through all the stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go, what are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_03]: They go, tobacco residue and consumption
of alcohol evidence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, who the fuck's smoking
cigarettes and drinking booze in the
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm looking at them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what we got.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I'm a bit stubborn where I refuse
to fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think part of that is because I care
so much about our community and all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: legacy growers and the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can see all the negative aspects of
legalization and how things have unfolded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quite honestly, I knew it was going to
go down like that because I knew the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment that legalization happened and all
these large corporations got into power
[SPEAKER_01]: that they wouldn't want to pay their labor
to prune.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would scale up so large that they
would have to use pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they would fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I predicted all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I knew that mama cannabis is actually
in charge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all, as growers, infused with
her.
[SPEAKER_01]: And greed is never going to win.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only thing that's going to win is
people coming together as a community and
[SPEAKER_01]: as a collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of legalization,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's forcing us to evolve.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's forcing us to come out of our own
individual lives and come together and
[SPEAKER_01]: work hard together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that we've been doing
here in the Kootenays as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand the regulations suck and
that it's hard and difficult to
[SPEAKER_01]: understand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I understand that the government did
this in a way to destroy our culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I just refuse to give up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like we need to come together as
a collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to find the administrative people
and do it as a giant team and as a
[SPEAKER_01]: community because the world needs us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the world needs cannabis growers and
the cannabis community to help us evolve
[SPEAKER_01]: and shift into a new direction.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that the faster the craft
community can understand that they're no
[SPEAKER_06]: longer just selling biomass.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're also selling their story.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're creating their brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're telling us a tale of days gone
by.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we have to understand that
Seagrams was once some of the most badass
[SPEAKER_06]: gangsters around and with not a pristine
reputation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And 100 years later, they're one of the
most respected families in Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have to apply that same
understanding to our culture that is
[SPEAKER_06]: slowly going to be eroded.
[SPEAKER_06]: And destroyed over this next 100 years
where we have to champion it and we have
[SPEAKER_06]: to tell those stories.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the faster that these small craft
producers understand that they're not just
[SPEAKER_06]: selling hash rosen or they're not just
selling cured flour, but they're selling a
[SPEAKER_06]: brand and a story behind that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're selling their equity partners
and the way that they take care of the
[SPEAKER_06]: flour and what differentiates them and
where they came from.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the faster that those individuals
are going to be able to really shore out
[SPEAKER_06]: that niche that they need in the market
and identify their consumers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because realistically, we know the
consumers are out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just got to fucking identify them and
get them into the stores.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think there is an evolution happening,
too, with just plant medicine in general.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is a lot with legacy and craft
growers that they can do in the new
[SPEAKER_05]: paradigm of new plant medicines.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so maybe it's not just Mama Ganja,
which we love so much, and that's led the
[SPEAKER_05]: way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Into these new laws coming in.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's really important for us to
continue to advocate for this new plant
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine laws.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think as we also recognize part of
building regenerative farms or having,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, the DEM peer certified farms or
whatever, was to build a sanctuary because
[SPEAKER_05]: it was like, oh, it makes the gardens
healthier and it makes the trichomes more
[SPEAKER_05]: alive and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: But then you also realize, wow,
it makes me feel so good in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And everyone that comes by is like,
wow, you have this oasis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And all this food, I didn't know that food
looked like that.
[SPEAKER_05]: The lilocoys or kiwis, whatever it is,
male and female, you know, some plants
[SPEAKER_05]: won't bloom.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of a sudden you realize,
wow, I can start a nursery of just
[SPEAKER_05]: superfoods and just bringing people in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then even just now the whole new wave
of tourism, you know, and bringing people
[SPEAKER_05]: in and camping setups and having people
just breathe the air and being able to
[SPEAKER_05]: walk the gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we talked about like, it'd be fun to
like have like you pick where someone
[SPEAKER_05]: comes and they camp and they like,
I'll buy that plant at the end of the
[SPEAKER_05]: year.
[SPEAKER_05]: That would be amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, but just the idea of,
you know, bringing the micros up to A,
[SPEAKER_05]: the research, I mean, the farm gate sales,
you know, where we can, we need to be able
[SPEAKER_05]: to give the medicine which created the
whole thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, so if we are having a hard time
selling the weed, which, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm saying the lifestyle that's creating
the weed now is like becoming valuable as
[SPEAKER_05]: a retreat center or something that's
giving people new life on energetic
[SPEAKER_05]: levels.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, cause people need to be healed,
not just with medicine, but with other
[SPEAKER_05]: healing modalities.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I also think that, you know,
cannabis has always been deemed the
[SPEAKER_10]: gateway drug.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so cannabis, and we've been working
really hard to give her a place in the
[SPEAKER_10]: world.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of us, all of us here have been
in incredibly already successful at that.
[SPEAKER_10]: So now we really need to discuss,
you know, are we saving ourselves or are
[SPEAKER_10]: we saving cannabis?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because if you ask me, I believe that
cannabis is, is well on her way.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that she has taken leaps and
bounds through the education that we've
[SPEAKER_10]: been put forth already.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not saying to let go because I'm going
to be the last one holding on for sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: But I also think that it's important for
us to recognize and not have so much ego
[SPEAKER_10]: that it's not about us.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about the medicine going forward.
[SPEAKER_10]: And she has different modalities that she
needs to walk through and different doors
[SPEAKER_10]: that she needs to be.
[SPEAKER_10]: And maybe the legacy market is not one
that's going to get her to the next stage
[SPEAKER_10]: that she wants to be either.
[SPEAKER_10]: Not saying that the legacy market is going
to be done and we're going to stop growing
[SPEAKER_10]: or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: But just like Josh said, if cannabis is
the gateway drug, then that's the gateway
[SPEAKER_10]: to ayahuasca ceremony.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the gateway to MDMA.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the gateway to LSD therapy,
mushrooms, psychedelics, all of it,
[SPEAKER_10]: which we do now have the ability to jump
onto and say, oh, maybe it's not just
[SPEAKER_10]: about the cannabis plant, like Josh was
saying, but it's about all of the plants
[SPEAKER_10]: that change our lives.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that we now have this ability in
Canada to point five grams of any
[SPEAKER_10]: psychedelic plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like, holy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of the legacy market people are
the people who have been doing plant
[SPEAKER_10]: medicine ceremony for 30, 40 years
already.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we already have been sitting with our
friends in psychedelic therapy for so
[SPEAKER_10]: long.
[SPEAKER_10]: And a lot of the doctors that are taking
it on, much like the corporate cannabis
[SPEAKER_10]: industry that came in in the beginning,
are going to also bastardize the message
[SPEAKER_10]: that that plant medicine has.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I think that we need to pull up our
overalls and get out there and start
[SPEAKER_10]: ushering in all of the rest of the plants
that need to follow after cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think I'm lucky enough because
most of my family comes from a state that
[SPEAKER_04]: will probably be the last state to
legalize or medicalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about five kilometers that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if I go try and drive across the state
with what I brought to the festival this
[SPEAKER_04]: week and they'll throw me in jail for a 10
year minimum.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that led me to becoming a cannabis
refugee, moving to many of the early
[SPEAKER_04]: states that passed medical and
recreational laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: It allowed me to see kind of the laws
passed first in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: and then now here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the states, when they passed
those early laws, they passed fairly
[SPEAKER_04]: restrictive laws.
[SPEAKER_04]: And since then, they've actually come out
with kind of fixer bills that eased some
[SPEAKER_04]: of those early regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they did that because they didn't want
to have a proliferation of black market
[SPEAKER_04]: sales, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: So rather than making the industry a
little bit too lenient, they started to
[SPEAKER_04]: too tight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now that there's been kind of a wave
of legalization or medicalization kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: grow across the U.S., now you're starting
to see states actually trying to compete
[SPEAKER_04]: in order to be a competitive market for
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You hit on it earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: The federal government and the provincial
government's creating a government driven
[SPEAKER_04]: monopoly on distribution has essentially
crushed the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was DOA before the industry came out
because the government officials did not
[SPEAKER_04]: even understand the cold chain associated
with a perishable product.
[SPEAKER_04]: The minute the cannabinoids are harvested,
the minute the plants are harvested,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're starting a decomposition that we as
processors are going to try and minimize.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just like grapes and wine,
it's a perishable product that needs to be
[SPEAKER_04]: maintained.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even though I can produce a kilo of
isolate for less than a kilo of craft
[SPEAKER_04]: flour in the CBD hemp realm, we're not
going to see the world get flooded by low
[SPEAKER_04]: grade isolate.
[SPEAKER_04]: The isolate is going to be just like
distillate, a bulk commodity into the
[SPEAKER_04]: manufactured product, but ultimately like
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can make a gallon of ethanol at home for
less than a dollar gallon and go to the
[SPEAKER_04]: store and go to the gas station and buy it
for less than two or three or five here in
[SPEAKER_04]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: But ultimately, if I'm going to go buy a
bottle of wine and liquor, I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: spending whatever 20, 50 up to a hundred
dollars because of the story that's behind
[SPEAKER_04]: it, because of the terpenes that are
present in it, and because I know it's
[SPEAKER_04]: supporting kind of a craft market of
quality produced products.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think while the big producers were
able to get to market a little bit faster
[SPEAKER_04]: due to the capital expenditures,
ultimately the companies that are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be able to operate on lower margins with
better profits and profitability are going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be the ones that kind of focus on the
higher end quality products within the
[SPEAKER_04]: market.
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely agree with that statement,
but the previous statement to just play
[SPEAKER_06]: devil's advocate, from a North America
standpoint, I see it a little bit
[SPEAKER_06]: differently.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we look at state legalization,
when we look at 215 in California,
[SPEAKER_06]: when we look at Washington, when we look
at Colorado, we see the first wave of
[SPEAKER_06]: legalization and regulation being very,
I would more so argue towards loose where
[SPEAKER_06]: you can have products being manufactured
in less than commercial settings,
[SPEAKER_06]: being put into a medical and or
recreational system dependent on the state
[SPEAKER_06]: and those products with very little
oversight being delivered to end
[SPEAKER_06]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think this creates tremendously
positive effects because even if this is a
[SPEAKER_06]: short window before future regulation,
I think that it allows the new consumers
[SPEAKER_06]: who are entering the market now that
cannabis has been legalized to be exposed
[SPEAKER_06]: to a myriad of different products and
learn and explore what products work for
[SPEAKER_06]: them.
[SPEAKER_06]: We did not have that opportunity in Canada
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to jump through so many regulatory
hoops and create such large skews as
[SPEAKER_06]: Marcus can talk to, to be able to get a
product to market that there was no window
[SPEAKER_06]: of innovation where we had a quick
opportunity to draw in a number of new
[SPEAKER_06]: market entrants by offering them a bunch
of different products.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we really suffered where the
current consumers frequenting retail
[SPEAKER_06]: stores in Canada are primarily new
consumers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the consumers that have been consuming
prior to October 17th, 2017 are,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, more than likely sourcing from
different channels.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the thing about it though,
right, is that, I mean, I've been,
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been a nerd like a long time,
but 15 years now of, of like public front,
[SPEAKER_03]: public operational license kind of stuff
or allowed to be licensed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and what you got is you had such an
incredible time period during prop two 15,
[SPEAKER_03]: the diversity was supernatural.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had, I want to say we had like 30,000
stores or something in Cali, right down to
[SPEAKER_03]: 1100.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so you had tremendous, uh,
access.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had the ability for small batches to
be moved.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you had many, many cultivators feeding
us, so what you got was you got really
[SPEAKER_03]: fresh flour, diverse flour and flour from
people who were about producing flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you had excellent extract makers
and you had, there was, there was the
[SPEAKER_03]: beginning of the hash revolution,
but this was still really like the butane
[SPEAKER_03]: was moving forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we went into this full legal,
what you have is this radical
[SPEAKER_03]: disappointment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's, it's so odd because it's almost
impossible to get anybody happy with the
[SPEAKER_03]: circumstances because you're really not in
control of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have control of all the
variables.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to have control all the variables
from, from, from inception to set from the
[SPEAKER_03]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now you don't control everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm a vertical.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like in some operations, I actually do
control everything from genetic
[SPEAKER_03]: development to sale of the product out the
store.
[SPEAKER_03]: So every license all the way through the
chain, except lab I'm holding.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it lets me see what happens when you
have control of everything, but that's
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty rare.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so most people are in this situation
where they have zero control and they have
[SPEAKER_03]: an expectation of a product that a store.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for most people that go legal,
they only had, they went from street
[SPEAKER_03]: corner to storefront.
[SPEAKER_03]: California had 20, 20, 20, that came out
in like 96.
[SPEAKER_03]: So prop to 15, come on 96.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you had 25 years of storefront sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the people are just furious that they
can't get what they used to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't get that same treatment.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't get the same prices.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get worse quality flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's this anger and resentment,
which then allows the traditional to fill
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem is the people with
licenses are dumping so hard into the
[SPEAKER_03]: system that they collapse the traditional.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right now you can get indoor in LA for
800 bucks a pound indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You, you there's, there's, I want to say
outdoor units are like a buck 50,
[SPEAKER_03]: 200 fresh depth just went from four to six
at the storefront, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So four to six, if you're moving it
through the chain, if it's in the
[SPEAKER_03]: traditional, that shit's at two 50,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can sell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're seeing an 80% reduction in
the economy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing 80% reduction in,
in, in all aspects of anything
[SPEAKER_03]: peripherally touching cannabis and,
and all that it'll move forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: But our problem is that, you know,
we had so many years of this system that
[SPEAKER_03]: was actually pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like for me, I'm from traditional prior,
so I never used the storefronts in that
[SPEAKER_03]: way.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just sold product to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't need to access product that way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was never a consumer of the,
of the product through a store.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't really go into a dispensary until
I took one over.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it allowed me to understand who's
coming in, what they need and how they
[SPEAKER_03]: need it and what their expectations are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you fulfill it, you have loyal
customer relationships.
[SPEAKER_03]: But even now, if we try as hard as we
want, we still can't satisfy the people
[SPEAKER_03]: because of the way the system is set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just this, it's tumultuous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, but you have to just kind of like,
I, I, I key on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at it, identify it, and then I just
push it the fuck aside and I keep going
[SPEAKER_03]: because I know that there is a future and
it's just really having to be able to move
[SPEAKER_03]: through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the issue for us as smaller operators,
I mean, so I have to go grab investment
[SPEAKER_03]: for projects too, but I'm, I'm for the
majority of my life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I built everything and most people did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the problem is that they can't sustain
that capital bleed and you're not big
[SPEAKER_03]: enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you run your projections,
the, the monies aren't great enough to
[SPEAKER_03]: warrant investment from a larger entity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's always a scale up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody wants to scale up, but for
craft, you can't scale up.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't keep getting bigger and still
call it craft.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and that's really the issue,
you know, is that we have a limit to what
[SPEAKER_03]: we can do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't gather the funds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so like my, the way I operate is I try
to be collaborative with the people in my
[SPEAKER_03]: community so that what it does,
it allows us to kind of share info.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I can say, look, this is moving and
this is not moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: These things are happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: These things are not happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it just lets you see, lets you get
facts that this is what's going down and
[SPEAKER_03]: this is what's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that way people who aren't in my
position can benefit from that
[SPEAKER_03]: information.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what it does, it lets you know that's a
bad route, but that's a safe route and
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a great route.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and that's what we have always tried
to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: As, as community members is, is be cool
amongst each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and it's really, I think more crucial
than ever to behave that way right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause you don't have anybody but your
neighbor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just really look across.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, this is your allies.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not, not anybody else.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just think it's where that you guys keep
talking about, you know, legacy markets in
[SPEAKER_13]: different States and it's yet to be
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we keep using consumer,
but nobody's used patient really.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I think.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think that is a huge gap in this
transition.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I just spent the first four months of
this year in New York and I've been
[SPEAKER_13]: working in a tri-state area in work in
licensing down in the States or have
[SPEAKER_13]: traditionally.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's really interesting to see,
you know, this scramble for the definition
[SPEAKER_13]: of legacy in New York and New Jersey,
which are obviously huge cannabis consumer
[SPEAKER_13]: markets.
[SPEAKER_13]: They dictate a ton.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, you have a lot to say on that.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's like brilliant.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it dictates the trends everywhere.
[SPEAKER_13]: But that being said, like I was going to
mention, it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_13]: I whispered to Kelly, I was like,
you're a fantastic grower and you have all
[SPEAKER_13]: this clout for that.
[SPEAKER_13]: But then your, your take on the Canadian
market was as a consumer, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: and that's, that's the point that there
is.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I think, you know, the,
the term legacy, which is so hard to
[SPEAKER_13]: define, like really involves medicinal
it's the connection with cannabis as a
[SPEAKER_13]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_13]: That is very real.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: Well, and it's even just as Kel mentioned,
like, um, you know, with, with different
[SPEAKER_13]: seasonal equity, a lot of that too,
you were growing plants for patients and a
[SPEAKER_13]: lot of it had to do with establishing that
community and those inroads and those
[SPEAKER_13]: channels.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you knew that this person needed that
plant, but you could also use that margin
[SPEAKER_13]: to help somebody else out that couldn't
pay you anything.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so I think it's just really valid to
keep in mind the patient and, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: in that transition of what is plant
medicine and what does that mean to the
[SPEAKER_13]: standard person?
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, look at this festival and across
the lake.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, here you have this fireside chat,
but those are the people that are going to
[SPEAKER_13]: be buying the things at the end of the
day.
[SPEAKER_13]: And determining the market.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that's where, you know, the investors
look at BDS analytics down in the state or
[SPEAKER_13]: what's moving.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, you know, people say, well,
now I should start a gummy company because
[SPEAKER_13]: look, gummies are great or beverages are
great.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it's just chasing that thing instead
of remembering, like, you guys are the
[SPEAKER_13]: ones that start the trends.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a little bit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And to mention on New York, I have many
friends in New York and what their goal
[SPEAKER_09]: currently, it's Wild West is what they
say, is to build brands and package.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's something we learned as legacy
people.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need to package and put it out and make
it look nice.
[SPEAKER_09]: Something that we don't have here,
which is very disturbing.
[SPEAKER_09]: You hit a point before was Rawgarden put
out 1,316 products, different strains in
[SPEAKER_09]: one year, cultivars in one year.
[SPEAKER_09]: How many can you do in Canada?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or maybe six as an LP.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can do one basically every six months,
let's say.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that really, truly cuts down the
variety.
[SPEAKER_09]: And honestly, I don't even know if
Canadians want it because I've been
[SPEAKER_09]: studying the Canadian market and they they
they they're not we're not to that
[SPEAKER_09]: educational level yet because the consumer
and we are not those people and we are not
[SPEAKER_09]: to judge what they want to buy off of what
we like.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to buy pre rolls.
[SPEAKER_09]: They want to buy vape pens and they want
to buy flowers and we can the rest of
[SPEAKER_09]: those percentages drop way down and it's
all coming and it's all growing fast.
[SPEAKER_09]: Those other categories are growing fast
100 percent.
[SPEAKER_09]: But when you talk to the Canadian
consumer.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would like a reasonable price and I want
to be cheap.
[SPEAKER_08]: You guys sells pre rolls by the hundred
forty pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was like, what the fuck is that?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the culture is saying that they're
getting more money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the bottom line, too, is we're out of
the tobacco era, so nobody nobody knows
[SPEAKER_03]: how to roll weed anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, it's convenience.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're pen convenience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our pen market is re-blowing back up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're running like 30.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in the mid 30s on flower sales.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll say as a connoisseur of great hash
and great cannabis that entering the legal
[SPEAKER_15]: market in Canada really kind of crushed my
soul when I made my first batch of bubble
[SPEAKER_15]: and my QA's there and we're making and I'm
like, this is fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_15]: Whipping up, you know, five, six drag
kilos at a time.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're going to make a kilo of bubs.
[SPEAKER_15]: Get it in the freeze dryers.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm kind of like I only did this once.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, OK, let's separate all the
grades.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, we're going to keep all the microns
separate.
[SPEAKER_15]: And these are real nice ones here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Ninety seventy three one twenty.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, that's nice.
[SPEAKER_15]: Get it all.
[SPEAKER_15]: Get it all at the end of my QA's like,
OK, so how many are you going to mix all
[SPEAKER_15]: this together?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, well, no, no, you got it.
[SPEAKER_15]: We got to keep them separate.
[SPEAKER_15]: She's like, OK, so instead of twelve
hundred, I'll just multiply that by eight.
[SPEAKER_15]: Twelve hundred for each COA times eight.
[SPEAKER_15]: So now and then the next thing to crush me
was when Ontario was like, oh,
[SPEAKER_15]: yeah, we want your bubble.
[SPEAKER_15]: But we're going to need like four kilos of
it or and then if we sell it really fast,
[SPEAKER_15]: you got to have another four kilos right
away.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm thinking, how the fuck am I going
to get eight kilos of 90 micron bubble?
[SPEAKER_15]: How how am I fucking?
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like and then my whole team is like,
you're not, dude, you're not going to do
[SPEAKER_15]: that.
[SPEAKER_15]: We need you to mix them all together.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, mix them all together.
I'm the guy that created all the bags to
separate them.
[SPEAKER_15]: I want them separate.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't want them together.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_15]: But surely these things just crushed me
and I was like, OK, like I'll keep going.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then and then what you were saying,
Noel, like very accurate, like I want to
[SPEAKER_15]: really six star 90 micron bubble.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's like those aren't my customers.
[SPEAKER_15]: The customers in the Canadian market is
like they want something inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_15]: They want something.
[SPEAKER_15]: They want pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm like, well, I'm a hash guy.
[SPEAKER_15]: What am I going to do to bring those those
those people have only one piece of
[SPEAKER_15]: paraphernalia.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a big lighter.
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't have rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_15]: They don't have anything.
[SPEAKER_15]: No grinder.
[SPEAKER_15]: They buy pre-roll joints.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're about 85 percent of the Canadian
market.
[SPEAKER_15]: So now I'm like, what can I make for them
where they can only use a lighter?
[SPEAKER_15]: And then I had to come out with this
product called Hash Hits.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's like really, to me, it's certainly
not a six star hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: It would be a mediocre hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's what's supposed to go.
[SPEAKER_15]: But man, you know, it's five.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a gram.
[SPEAKER_15]: You get five paper tubes with a little
stainless steel bowl.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's point two of a gram of hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're killing it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like we sell so many of them in every
province.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like people love them because now the
joint smoker can like bridge over to.
[SPEAKER_15]: But that was hard for me that like I had
to go against my own ego and my own like
[SPEAKER_15]: what I thought.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, holy shit, like all I've been about
is the best quality ever.
[SPEAKER_15]: But now I'm in an industry that if I try
to make six star 90 micron bubble that
[SPEAKER_15]: like people like Jameson be like,
yeah, dude, that's fire.
[SPEAKER_15]: I will go bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, you enter the conference and take
pictures of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll be bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_15]: The company will be out of business.
[SPEAKER_15]: So now it's like we've got to figure out
something that's like that you can get to
[SPEAKER_15]: that marketplace, you know, that group of
people that they're certainly not us.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think it's a separation of skews.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: We as as processors have to take our
products, bring it in, do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do we do and pick it out and be like,
OK, well, this is going to go into infused
[SPEAKER_09]: joints because now that is actually the
number one seller because people,
[SPEAKER_09]: they just want to get high.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's just be honest.
[SPEAKER_09]: You get out of work.
[SPEAKER_09]: You want to get high.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you can do it in one joint and that
joint is a 40 percent THC or go out 40
[SPEAKER_09]: percent THC, I don't necessarily think you
care what star it is.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're always going to cream up the very
top and hopefully sell that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, here's the other thing because I
want to do that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So you make it and it's like they say you
do make the six star.
[SPEAKER_15]: The minute it leaves your facility.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got it at like minus 30 degrees Celsius.
[SPEAKER_15]: The minute it leaves my facility.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's now like Mike was talking.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just like these people are shipping
war like warm spinach without any like
[SPEAKER_15]: it's produce.
[SPEAKER_15]: You have to keep it cool.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it just gets degraded on the way to the
place.
[SPEAKER_15]: Every single dispensary.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you know what they keep in their cool
fridges?
[SPEAKER_15]: The few that they have fucking beverages
with 10 milligram of distillate nano
[SPEAKER_15]: emulsified.
[SPEAKER_15]: That doesn't need to stay in the fridge
like when people use ice, put the hash and
[SPEAKER_15]: the oil and all the weed you have in the
building in those fucking fridges and
[SPEAKER_15]: freezers because there's volatile
compounds beyond terpenes and terpenoids
[SPEAKER_15]: into thiols and thioates and esters that
are they're so volatile.
[SPEAKER_15]: They are just degrading if they're not
like cold.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what we're fighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the key is just understanding like
those different market segments,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That in 50 years what I go buy at a bodega
in New York City is going to be different
[SPEAKER_04]: than what I buy at a high-end canagar
lounge in New York City, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know the more educated consumers
are probably going to be keeping up with
[SPEAKER_04]: the trends on what genetics are being
developed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Trends on new types of hash and they'll be
more likely to buy it pay for a premium
[SPEAKER_04]: but ultimately in the early and draggingly
slow rollout that is federally regulated
[SPEAKER_04]: products.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have to be able to produce products
that we can we can sell to you know in an
[SPEAKER_04]: entire province for now eventually entire
countries because Canada allows export of
[SPEAKER_04]: products to other continents, but we need
to be able to sell products that can
[SPEAKER_04]: easily be replicable consumable and in the
early part of that market.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be something that follows
kind of a uniform standard operating
[SPEAKER_04]: procedure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas as the industry evolves,
you're not going to have your $20 bottle
[SPEAKER_04]: of wine or whatever $40 $50 bottle
extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to start to have that diverse
diversification of that of the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have your $40 gram of extract or
$100 gram of extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll have your $40 eighth or a $40 ounce
and I'm not going to buy the $40 ounce
[SPEAKER_04]: unless if I'm going to roll up a bunch of
joints to give away to a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: tourists.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I am going to be going to the market
and buying those $40 eights of genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't grown yet because I want to see
if that genetic fits with my patient
[SPEAKER_06]: profile my bio is saying so in California
in Canada in Washington in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have very very accurate market data and
understanding of consumers that are
[SPEAKER_06]: walking into the doors of these retail
consumption areas and we even have polls
[SPEAKER_06]: and other questionnaires that are proposed
by high-faluting corporations like
[SPEAKER_06]: Deloitte and BDS and places like that
quantifying the market opportunity and
[SPEAKER_06]: telling us how much money we could make
and how many consumers there really are.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fucking bullshit.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like there's no fucking way that these
individuals crunching numbers are able to
[SPEAKER_06]: ascertain the culture or the undercurrent
that has carried this industry for the
[SPEAKER_06]: last however many whatever number you want
to pick between five thousand and a
[SPEAKER_06]: hundred and so like my my my understanding
is like okay fine cool we all at the whole
[SPEAKER_06]: market including the suits understands the
purchasing parities and trends of the
[SPEAKER_06]: individuals walking in the door.
[SPEAKER_06]: What we're here to talk about and the
value we're here to add is how we expose
[SPEAKER_06]: those new groups to get those groups in
the doors and get markets to those
[SPEAKER_06]: individuals that will transition those
individuals because I'll tell you somebody
[SPEAKER_06]: like me is worth a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot more than somebody walking in and
buying a pack of pre rolls at the end of
[SPEAKER_06]: every week.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if you're able to convert a heavy
use consumer who's been using for decades
[SPEAKER_06]: decades of heavy use and it's not uncommon
you're going to unlock a tremendous amount
[SPEAKER_06]: of of revenue of revenue for your company.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you know we have the road map of
how to OK let's create pre rolls OK fine
[SPEAKER_06]: put just let him call him rocket rolls and
fucking fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool we're not I don't want to I don't
want to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to talk about how we create unique
products that we can get existing
[SPEAKER_06]: community members to change where they're
accessing their medicine from so we can we
[SPEAKER_06]: can change this trend in the right way
like that's what I think we should be
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about not you know OK pre rolls
are growing and so are vape pens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what we're assuming is that your
snapshot is correct and what it's showing
[SPEAKER_03]: is this is what happens in a market that
is inadequately developed and controlled.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you've lost the diversity and
you've lost the ability to capture you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not the people when I when I was
when I was actively in this shop in the
[SPEAKER_03]: heyday of before legalization people would
come in and buy six or seven hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars worth of oil at a time because
that's what they consumed and they had the
[SPEAKER_03]: income for it but they would come and buy
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't exist anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've lost that group because you've
dissatisfied them with what's taken place
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're using headset data so
everybody's using the same data set to
[SPEAKER_03]: build their operation and I'm just like
what if you want to do just don't do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah yeah yeah this was and it was
constant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it was it was for years and years
and years we had these type of sales
[SPEAKER_03]: because that's where people who wanted
products they couldn't because what they
[SPEAKER_03]: knew was that they knew friends who
blasted but what I had done is I had gone
[SPEAKER_03]: to all the friends that were good blasters
and said would you guys start filling our
[SPEAKER_03]: stores and all I need to do is have our
own labs test your product and then we'll
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll if you want we'll even brand it for
you if you don't want to put your name on
[SPEAKER_03]: it so you don't get revealed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we had was this ungodly
collection of product and it allowed us to
[SPEAKER_03]: catch the people who really consumed
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't they don't exist in the
dispensaries right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a travesty.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is fireside chatting amongst
themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: No but you were saying it is important
because what you're saying is that's us in
[SPEAKER_03]: B.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all in the same situation in the in
the fact that legalization created a
[SPEAKER_03]: barrier that that only allows specific
people to come in and they come in and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're risk adverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when when people say to me you know
what do you want to do I said do anything
[SPEAKER_03]: that goes over 68 days because nobody's
run anything over 65.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's real simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like go in the store and say there's 72
choices.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't do those.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that says don't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care if you love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's too many competitors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just understand that you can't follow the
map they're giving you because they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: know where the fuck they're going either.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to look at data and statistics
in a manner that is relevant to the
[SPEAKER_03]: situation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like I call it biblical and I'm
not really even religious but it's not
[SPEAKER_03]: real.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a snapshot of a moment in time in a
situation that is not open to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as we disrupt it we have change.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I want to recapture those people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to recapture the people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to me it's almost like it's the micro
groups everywhere that are really the new
[SPEAKER_03]: heart and soul of cannabis where you're a
two light four light region tent grower
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's all you have to that's your
infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have the ability to put a farm
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I meet these people I'm seeing
some of the nicest product I've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's the return to Kraft
production.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've always dreamt of home production
for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a dispensary owner I still advocate for
it continuously because for all my medical
[SPEAKER_03]: years nobody could afford it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why we did all that subsidy
shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean I gave away fucking millions and
millions of dollars for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes as I struggle now I'm like
whoa what did I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I ask myself would I do it again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go yeah because ultimately it was a
beautiful moment in time where you got to
[SPEAKER_03]: have a relationship with people that were
really needy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cannabis was that food.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's what they had to eat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for me all the years in the hustle I
realized that I had never understood
[SPEAKER_03]: medical cannabis and I didn't have any
clue about medical people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it caught me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It caught me emotionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to me home growing is medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all use of cannabis is medical,
spiritual, inspirational.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we want to define it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that the medical has the most
need and usually the least amount of cash.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that education falls right
behind that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Where you have pushed you know I
personally have pushed a lot of education
[SPEAKER_09]: about turbines let's just say.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that doesn't pay you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so to speak to your point I want to
talk about the things that are good and
[SPEAKER_09]: coming up.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the other side of it is the balance of
the books.
[SPEAKER_09]: The truth is in the numbers and we have to
make money.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're not making it easy for any of us
to do in any country I believe.
[SPEAKER_09]: We each have our own issues with it all.
[SPEAKER_09]: So to drive that it requires like Shannon
said in the past a large team of people to
[SPEAKER_09]: really truly drive the education drive the
concept of your story.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because I think that all you know in this
world of consumerism we're looking for
[SPEAKER_09]: unique individuals and unique storylines
that add a flavor to your product that you
[SPEAKER_09]: can't buy and you can't make.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's because you did it.
[SPEAKER_09]: You lived it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we need to capture that as a group
of small craft individuals and boutique
[SPEAKER_09]: growers and truly represent us as a whole.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because that's the only way we can have
the amount of pull we need to necessarily
[SPEAKER_09]: compete with a larger group without
selling pieces of our soul to get the
[SPEAKER_09]: money to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because we know that that's what it comes
down to if you go out and try to do it
[SPEAKER_09]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_09]: You are going to have to give up something
of yourself to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's always a price to pay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know I mean like if you're talking
about cannabis culture it's free exit and
[SPEAKER_03]: entry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when it comes down to cannabis
business under regulated rules you either
[SPEAKER_03]: play it or you don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't want to do it don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you do do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean it's that simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you have to really really really
want to be here if you want to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's that's the difficult part is
just desire doesn't get you far enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it comes to education it doesn't
pay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't look at it as payment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I did an ungodly amount of pro bono
education because I wanted to share
[SPEAKER_03]: information that I was receiving currently
and I knew I was getting stuff that was
[SPEAKER_03]: flying out of the pipe straight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just regurgitating into the
public so that we would have a more
[SPEAKER_03]: educated consumer group and cultivation
group.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I I didn't want to monopolize the
information so that I was the only one
[SPEAKER_03]: with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what I always knew was you're not
going to survive alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah that's all it's the love of it but
it's the love of the people too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I spent my whole life in weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so herb herb took care of me my whole
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what I know is that I don't have to
know you a benefit from you if you benefit
[SPEAKER_03]: from the information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what I know is that if if if when
I was needy and I got information that was
[SPEAKER_03]: valuable it was extremely important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said well I'm catching shit that
most people aren't catching.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in a lot of rooms that people aren't
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not signing NDAs that say I can't
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was I mean I've been spewing for
years so that people would get some
[SPEAKER_03]: insight about what was taking place so
that other people's could survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that way we got more of us in the
room.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Before I get into this I Marcus I didn't
know you're so funny man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just pulling it back to what Kelly was
referring to in a different language is
[SPEAKER_14]: between the legacy and and the commercial
market.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it it is interesting I will say.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: My my perspective is one from a pure
business.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've come to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_14]: I came out of high tech.
[SPEAKER_14]: High tech was a blast.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was there before.
[SPEAKER_14]: I was in in the world of Google when
AdWords weren't a thing.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I watched AdWords come on.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was absolutely astronomical.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean we were earning every dollar we
would spend on Google AdWords in those
[SPEAKER_14]: days.
[SPEAKER_14]: We were earning 10 bucks in revenue.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_14]: It was like shooting fish in a barrel.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it and that dried up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like it just it just dried up.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then you know as the as technology
evolved I got into product development and
[SPEAKER_14]: really understood how organizations should
operate.
[SPEAKER_14]: And after 20 years and you know getting
kicked so many damn times and learning the
[SPEAKER_14]: lumps of what it takes to run a
corporation.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's that's our opportunity.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: In Canada.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I hear about the U.S.
[SPEAKER_14]: and it's different mentality from a
business perspective.
[SPEAKER_14]: There is a lot of regulation here in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_14]: And and I'll tell you every company in the
Canadian market today is a startup.
[SPEAKER_14]: And what further compounds that is that
we're in a startup industry.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a cluster daily.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a cluster large LPs small LPs micros.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a cluster.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yet that's our opportunity.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's our opportunity to get organized to
understand the processes and learn the
[SPEAKER_14]: language Kelly.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's beautiful I will say.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've heard this word called this
combination a phrase of creative
[SPEAKER_14]: compliance.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: If you start to read the regulations you
can drive a Mack truck some of the through
[SPEAKER_14]: some of these as long as and I'll look at
Marcus and we'll go as long as you're a QA
[SPEAKER_14]: you know is drinking the same Kool-Aid
that you're drinking.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So there are ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we talk about the different you know
it's us versus them.
[SPEAKER_14]: But we forget about this layer right in
the middle and it's people.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not us versus them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like no no no no no no no no I'm just
saying the language language.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's individuals in our industry who
are motivated only by financial
[SPEAKER_06]: enrichment.
[SPEAKER_06]: 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then there's the others.
[SPEAKER_06]: and that's us, and there is a fucking
line, and it is us versus them.
[SPEAKER_06]: It very, very, very fucking much is us
versus them.
[SPEAKER_14]: So let me tell you this.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm not going to debate that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm talking about when we as commercial
corporate LPs, we want to sell our product
[SPEAKER_14]: into Ontario.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's this layer of people in there,
and they just want to help us.
[SPEAKER_14]: Regardless of shape, size, form,
they just want to help us.
[SPEAKER_14]: So having somebody to help interpret that
and understand that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And again, I'll go back to the startup
within a startup.
[SPEAKER_14]: Every province is still trying to organize
themselves.
[SPEAKER_14]: BC just reorganized the way that they buy
again.
[SPEAKER_14]: We got to relearn that.
[SPEAKER_14]: We have to build new relationships with
new people again.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it can be done, and the beauty of that
is we're small, we're nimble, and we
[SPEAKER_14]: actually have a brand.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've got a storyline.
[SPEAKER_14]: You guys are so damn awesome.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's authentic.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's so beautifully rich.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've seen the big publicly traded,
I've worked in those sterile walls and now
[SPEAKER_14]: down to smaller guys like Che and stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's our opportunity.
[SPEAKER_14]: They can't pivot like we can.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then that middle layer, they want to
help us.
[SPEAKER_14]: A prime example is Ontario right now.
[SPEAKER_14]: They've created a flow through model.
[SPEAKER_14]: So whether you've got three kilos for sale
or 10 kilos for sale, they want your
[SPEAKER_14]: product.
[SPEAKER_14]: You want to talk about supporting your
community again.
[SPEAKER_14]: There is an ideal opportunity,
and it's evolving.
[SPEAKER_14]: I imagine soon enough this flow through
model will be across the country.
[SPEAKER_14]: Alberta's trying to figure it out,
but that's our opportunity is to figure
[SPEAKER_14]: out how we can become nimble, use creative
compliance, and just be agile and get
[SPEAKER_14]: smart with products.
[SPEAKER_14]: Data is interesting, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_03]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're right about the agility,
because we had a question the other day
[SPEAKER_03]: about genetics, and everybody's going to
knock each other out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: In order to do stabilized seed lines,
you've got a couple-year development
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're looking for one-off hunts,
then that's instantaneous.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're doing TC work, it can be up to
nine to 12 months, depending on how
[SPEAKER_03]: infected the cultivar is and how many
times you've got to stress it to pull the
[SPEAKER_03]: pathogen out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can expose it and clean it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Regular propagation is two weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you have is you have the
scientific push, and then you have the
[SPEAKER_03]: craft push, and they're different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if it takes me 12 months to
propagate something and get it in,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I can do it in two weeks, then that
means that I'm faster than you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't mean that I can compete with
you, but it means I have a niche because I
[SPEAKER_03]: can get a product that's trending into
market quicker.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same thing with seed work.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see there's a trend in terpene change.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see volatiles that people want.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go, ooh, they're heavy, volatile
sulfurs are coming back into vogue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we know that we can run into those
populations quickly and then hunt out a
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivar versus try to develop a
stabilized seed line, which is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: take us a couple years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So stabilized seed work, which comes from
large businesses, is a radically different
[SPEAKER_03]: view than people that are hunting from a
smaller level.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're not really competing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And TC nurseries aren't really competing
with conventional nurseries because
[SPEAKER_03]: propagation is pretty simple, and TC is
extremely expensive to create the
[SPEAKER_03]: operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But pathogenically, you need the scrubbing
services.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the people that were doing small
nurseries were like, TC Goose is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: get them right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, no, they can't get the
product to market quick enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as long as you stay hyper nimble,
it's just the problem is staying hyper
[SPEAKER_03]: nimble requires a commitment to the craft
that's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for a lot of people in cannabis prior,
the reason why they got into cannabis was
[SPEAKER_03]: because it allowed you, I always tell
people, I said the beauty of cannabis was
[SPEAKER_03]: it let me work X amount days a month and
make attorney money, like doctor money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what did I get out of that?
[SPEAKER_03]: An unfucking believable good life.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had time to be with my kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to travel with my children.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to do a lot of shit regular people
don't get to do because I had the money
[SPEAKER_03]: and the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And someone said, you should have been
making more money every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, no, I made enough money.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I had time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the problem is that for most of
us at a career, we kind of understood the
[SPEAKER_03]: value of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the having to shift in and so like
for me at 56, I still I'm willing to go,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's hard to get a lot of people from
the world we were in to commit to that
[SPEAKER_03]: level of speed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the pace is what's killing them
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And but you're totally right that there's
there's these blinks you can get in,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you have to be totally cognizant of
the blink and you need to move today.
[SPEAKER_14]: That and the word consistency always comes
to mind in our shop, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Consistency, every harvest needs to be
consistent, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: That's really a big part of it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And in that, yeah, agility is a big,
a big move.
[SPEAKER_14]: And yet here in Canada, it's the agility.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a structured system.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think it's the, if we understand
that structured system, who we need to
[SPEAKER_14]: sell to at the different levels,
right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_14]: You've got your internal team you got to
sell to, then you got to get out and then
[SPEAKER_14]: you now you got to sell to the provincial
buyers.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you got to sell to the dispensary
buyer.
[SPEAKER_14]: Then you got to sell to the bud tender.
[SPEAKER_14]: And then ultimately you got the last mile,
which is the consumer.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've got five levels and that's all
buried in beautiful red tape, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, it's looking at that and
understanding the way that we can navigate
[SPEAKER_14]: through that will provide, I think,
opportunities for brands at our craft to
[SPEAKER_14]: truly come to the forefront.
[SPEAKER_14]: And we're seeing the crumble of the
mid-tier groups, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: They just can't do it.
[SPEAKER_14]: They cannot earn and keep the doors open
for the dollar in the wholesale market
[SPEAKER_14]: today.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's, it's an interesting market.
[SPEAKER_14]: It really is here in Canada.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's super competitive, extremely
competitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys overbuilt, like your,
your expectations of, of moving product
[SPEAKER_03]: globally, unfortunately just didn't come
to fruition.
[SPEAKER_14]: With US dollars though.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Right.
[SPEAKER_14]: US cash came down.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we couldn't, we couldn't use a
stock market in the US.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, but the thing is like,
you know, some of the California ops,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that we're going to see a lot of
these major ones fold up and nobody's
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about it, but I'm like,
I know you're not turning a profit and
[SPEAKER_03]: your investors at this point aren't going
to give you any more money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're going to see this cleansing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We figured that you should see a next year
and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: So next year should be a bloodbath again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll start to come out of it and
you get into 2024 and 2025 and you start
[SPEAKER_03]: to have normality because we've cleaned
out both big and small and you got to get
[SPEAKER_03]: rid of these bigger groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause really what they're doing is they're
dumping and in California, I'd say 40,
[SPEAKER_03]: 50% of the total product sold in stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other half of the product grown is
going out the back door.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's, it's sustaining groups that
shouldn't be sustained because ultimately
[SPEAKER_03]: what you're doing is you're using your
tools to be able to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your infrastructure allows you enough
product to sell at a low price to make
[SPEAKER_03]: enough to continue.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for small farms, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's this, it's this odd situation
where you understand how to manipulate the
[SPEAKER_03]: rules and you're big enough to be able to
sustain movement.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you can even register a nickel on
the profit, the investors will continue to
[SPEAKER_03]: feed, but anybody below that level is
dying.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's, it's going to suddenly flop in a
minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's I can't sustain forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're about to see the collapse
come and we need it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We need to get rid of all these large
operations that are not meant to be there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call them aphid factories because I tore
them, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're aphid factories.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what they're growing is they're
aphid factories.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never seen anything like it in my
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you stop moving, the plants are moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they literally moving on the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: So then like, you know, there's only six
companies that make dishwashers.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's only one or two companies that
make eyeglass frames.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are we heading to that sort of cold war
era in California that is leading the
[SPEAKER_06]: evolution of the cannabis sort of system?
[SPEAKER_03]: Without a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no question that that's what's
coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I'm looking at 2 million,
3 million square foot greenhouse
[SPEAKER_03]: operations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just got one that come online.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be running seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're looking, I think their goals at
risk right now, about a million pounds per
[SPEAKER_03]: year.
[SPEAKER_03]: The goal is to get a $80 ounce into the
store and of decent weed, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Decent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the problem is though, is that they're
marketing it as Kraft.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what it does is it confuses the
customer, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we had this debate about this
concept called Kraft at scale,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the largest operation has this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said to them, I said, isn't that a
fucking oxymoron?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like saying you're tall and short at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't go together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm laughing, but they weren't.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my thing is, take the lane you belong
in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what you need is you need
inexpensive cannabis for the majority
[SPEAKER_03]: because ultimately it's an agricultural
crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if we could grow inexpensive
cannabis cleanly in a sustainable fashion,
[SPEAKER_03]: then please let that happen because people
really need to buy $45 ounces because they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't have the money for a $95 eighth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my store is selling $85 eighths.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I'm touching the highest end of
the periphery of cannabis and I'm a Kraft
[SPEAKER_03]: operator at the same time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm kind of anomaly because I'm a Kraft
farmer, but I'm playing with monstrous
[SPEAKER_03]: companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it kind of lets you see the picture
in totality, but you have to have economy
[SPEAKER_03]: scale to create these agricultural
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once we have that, now we have a clear
division on what is Kraft.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we do, like what we've been
working on is we developed the Gangier
[SPEAKER_03]: program and we fought hard to get it into
Humboldt County so that what I was able to
[SPEAKER_03]: do was get all these people that were
buyers for these 140 store operations to
[SPEAKER_03]: come in and get an education.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what I do is I bring them in with
Kraft farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have farmers meet them in the parking
lot just to smoke weed with them and to
[SPEAKER_03]: throw a bag to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then I have farmers come to the class to
talk about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We bring an herb that's two years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let them know this is what two year
old herb looks like done right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what it does, it's recalibrating
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's allowing us to start getting
bigger companies to start creating
[SPEAKER_03]: relationships with Kraft farms because the
lead buyer of someone who's moving $2
[SPEAKER_03]: billion worth of weed realizes that's
better pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're working on this education,
but educating the customer, it's
[SPEAKER_03]: effective, but you better educate the
people who are buying the grass for the
[SPEAKER_03]: distro and who's buying the weed for the
store because they're the ones that put
[SPEAKER_03]: the product in the window and then the
data is based off of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the gatekeeper is the one who's really
controlling the data and people are trying
[SPEAKER_03]: to educate the customer constantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And all I'm trying to educate the customer
on is how do you buy weed in the new
[SPEAKER_03]: system?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the people who are gonna sell the
weed that you need to educate on how do
[SPEAKER_03]: you market it?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you showcase it?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you gradient on price?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how do we determine quality that's not
branding?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because right now branding controls price,
quality is quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Branding is branding and we wanna clearly
start to define it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we spent all this time developing the
system so that what we could do,
[SPEAKER_03]: and my goal wasn't to educate the
consumer, it was to educate the people who
[SPEAKER_03]: are gatekeeping our money so that they
have an ability to understand,
[SPEAKER_03]: wow, Kraft product is better.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's an echelon and there's an upper
echelon, then that's Kraft.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that way we are able to get lifted up
because Kraft has to be more valuable than
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial or we can't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's not about because we're there,
because I know a lot of Kraft farms that
[SPEAKER_03]: grow shitty pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just gonna say what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've been growing weed for a long time
and they were able to get subgrade herb
[SPEAKER_03]: into the system because the system had a
fucking need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there's no more need and now it
better be good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you're seeing is pretty good
isn't good enough and most people were
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have to really be clear about
what's good and what's not and developing
[SPEAKER_03]: these grading standards and getting the
ability to be able to say, I got you,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is better.
[SPEAKER_03]: Blending your hash shouldn't have to be
the case because the bottom line,
[SPEAKER_03]: they iron it.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you say in that, I'm the guy that
invented, I almost fell out of my fucking
[SPEAKER_03]: chair because it's so true.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're like, I'm the wrong person to
blend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the guy that separated it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't make me go back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have to because otherwise you
can't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's in that reality and it's the
communication to the people who are
[SPEAKER_03]: selling and buying and getting them to
actually sit down and experience the
[SPEAKER_03]: different products and be able to say,
look, I'm not trying to convince you with
[SPEAKER_03]: words.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna let you chill with the product
and you'll experience it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what's not taken place because we
don't have that open environment with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that the shops used to work was it
was radically more freely moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you could bring product in,
talk to the buyer, show the product,
[SPEAKER_03]: consume the product, give them some
product, let them think about the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they would take your product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's through a buyer that is
disconnected from anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd say in Canada, they are radically
under-educated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy Christ, you guys have a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have government officials buying your
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I realized, when I got to look at
this, yeah, because you said I looked at
[SPEAKER_03]: it like a customer, because that's the
only person I really care about in the
[SPEAKER_03]: business because everyone's bought a weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said, what's it like to go to a
store?
[SPEAKER_03]: Take me to a store.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Dennis and Mark took me to a store
and I was like, looking around and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: like, 140 pre-rolls in a container?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it was 140 and 60 and 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, people buy that shit?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that's a purchase?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I realized, wow, Canada, whoa,
your legacy market must be doing the
[SPEAKER_03]: majority of the good work because there's
nothing in the store that was good.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, the people who bought cannabis in
the past in Canada were not in those
[SPEAKER_15]: channels to get those jobs.
[SPEAKER_15]: The people who got those jobs were in
liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_15]: They were in liquor distribution and
tobacco distribution.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they just moved right into those jobs.
[SPEAKER_15]: I thought the same thing and I think the
same thing, but I will say there is a
[SPEAKER_15]: silver lining.
[SPEAKER_15]: There's cannabis people now, buyers,
that have been buyers over the years that
[SPEAKER_15]: are now going into those jobs.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I met a guy in Manitoba, this guy Dan.
[SPEAKER_15]: He called me up.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's like, oh, I'm one of the buyers from
Manitoba.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm like, oh my God, what's this going
to be like?
[SPEAKER_15]: I brought my pot-smoking uncle over to his
house.
[SPEAKER_15]: We go to this guy's house and I'm telling
you, I teared up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, every single room in his house
was overflowing with like he had rosin
[SPEAKER_15]: presses and he had grow tents and he was
3D printing tags for all of his plants in
[SPEAKER_15]: one room.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like everything in the house was for weed.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just thought, fuck, if we get more
guys like this being the buyers for the
[SPEAKER_15]: provinces, I mean, that's legitimately
what you need.
[SPEAKER_15]: You really need that.
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't have it yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you have to have the regulatory
support and the thing is that cannabis has
[SPEAKER_03]: become, cannabis is always cool,
but it's become allowed so that people who
[SPEAKER_03]: previously had to hide their stuff can
open it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was with all the state regulators
and I have this, what do you call it?
[SPEAKER_03]: An auditor and he comes walking up to me
and he whispers in my ear, I know who you
[SPEAKER_03]: are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fucking hair on my back stood up
because when you have the government
[SPEAKER_03]: auditors saying, I know who you are and
he's like, bro, I follow all your shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a tent in my house right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, I'm going to send you a photo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you give me your number?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, holy shit, I think it's
going to be all right because it's the
[SPEAKER_03]: truth.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're having a change.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just the problem is it doesn't happen
quick enough when your capital is
[SPEAKER_03]: bleeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the issue here is a bleed rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you control the bleed rate?
[SPEAKER_03]: And for a lot of the farmers I talk to,
I said, listen, just follow your farm and
[SPEAKER_03]: go get a job for a year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Lawrence Ringo's son, I bumped
into him the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lawrence Ringo is one of the pioneers of
CBD, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So like we're talking pioneer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was a sweetheart to me and I love
Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I bumped into his son and I've known
his kids for years too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, man, I followed my farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, and I went and got an Ag
permit.
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes, it cost me $35.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, how much can I grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: They said, as much as you want,
anywhere you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes, I put up a farm building,
say whatever you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's like, he was happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were cracking up.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, bro, farming is easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when is the last time you heard
someone say farming is easy?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, compared to cannabis farming
it is.
[SPEAKER_13]: I had a question and maybe Kevin,
you can answer this, but Marcus,
[SPEAKER_13]: you made me think of it when you said like
pharmaceutical reps come over and it's
[SPEAKER_13]: awesome to educate the buyers.
[SPEAKER_13]: But what happens when there's these large
companies that are investor backed that
[SPEAKER_13]: have retailers that have to hit certain
numbers.
[SPEAKER_13]: So what they do is what pharmaceutical
companies did, where they go in and they
[SPEAKER_13]: send sales rep with a bunch of perks for
the bud tenders who are then expected to
[SPEAKER_13]: sell a certain amount of that product.
[SPEAKER_13]: And so it's basically, you know,
you have these companies that are coming
[SPEAKER_13]: from more traditional sales backgrounds
rather than this is the best we have ever
[SPEAKER_13]: seen.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have to put this on the shelf and more
like, okay, the bud tenders know this.
[SPEAKER_13]: They all have the t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_13]: They're going to do a demo, you know,
and how does that impact that in your.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the problem, the problem with that
mentality and sales is that people get
[SPEAKER_03]: really pissed off if they push them herb
that doesn't do the job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as the person at the counter,
when someone buys weed from you and comes
[SPEAKER_03]: back the next day and throws it at you and
says, this shit sucked and you told me it
[SPEAKER_03]: was good.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of a sudden you don't want to push
that product anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a problem with all stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so anytime the employees lose favor of
a thing, you got to sit down and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: are you just tired of selling it because
we sell a lot of it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or are you having bad feedback that's
causing problems and maybe we shouldn't
[SPEAKER_03]: sell it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're two different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so selling flour that you need to
sell, but trying to sell sub pod flour and
[SPEAKER_03]: push it into the customer, that bites you
in the ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it comes back because ultimately what
you do is you lose the customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the more they try to force the
desire upon the individual, what they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't catch fundamentally to me is that
it's like, they don't have to smoke weed
[SPEAKER_03]: in their life.
[SPEAKER_03]: Weed is the drug that when you consume it,
it lets you see bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the drug when you consume it that you
do not conspire to fuck others over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're selling a drug that upon
consumption gives a lens of clarity about
[SPEAKER_03]: what just occurred.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you consume and go, I just got
fucked by you and you don't go back.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that's the issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just what's taking place is you got
not enough storefronts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you have limited storefronts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the stores control the flow of the
product too well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the people that can then make the
relationships with the stores are
[SPEAKER_03]: controlling it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the thing is they're having such
dissatisfaction that you're driving
[SPEAKER_03]: customers right out of the stores.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's backfiring on them as well because
they're losing customers from that
[SPEAKER_03]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can give them all the t-shirts and
hats and all the shit you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get four customers come in and swear
at them, which they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, have you ever been behind a
counter?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, it's an interesting experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially one that's moving a lot of
people and a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see rage and that shit doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, the more you try to drive sub
pod product by those methodologies,
[SPEAKER_03]: because cannabis as a consumption,
when you consume it, it's not fucking ice
[SPEAKER_03]: cream.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has a radically different effect on
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I talk to people all the time and I'm
like, does anybody in the building even
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke?
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to be a smoker to do the
business, but you better have somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: who's a consumer in your fucking circle,
who's clearly telling you this shit is
[SPEAKER_03]: garbage.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you don't have that and you're
making the assumption, even the scientists
[SPEAKER_03]: I work with in labs, they go, we're doing
all analysis by COA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm laughing and I'm like,
how do you fucking mind?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a lab that's gonna consume it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a human being.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to get a human in the room to
sample it, because this paper does not
[SPEAKER_03]: give you any information about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I get to fuck with some giants.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I see them stumble around the
dark, it makes me feel a little more
[SPEAKER_03]: confident.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I think the keeping us all isolated,
not allowing vapor lounges, having vapor
[SPEAKER_15]: lounges would allow so many people to
learn so much.
[SPEAKER_15]: If we had a place to consume together,
because right now there's really... The
[SPEAKER_15]: market we talk about right now in Canada
is not actually the market you think
[SPEAKER_15]: you're talking about, because that market,
the legacy market, most of those people
[SPEAKER_15]: still grow their own weed, make their own
hash, trade amongst their friends,
[SPEAKER_15]: buy with their friends.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're not really a part of the Canadian
market.
[SPEAKER_15]: The Canadian market is all these people
that are like, oh, they legalize
[SPEAKER_15]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm gonna give it a shot.
[SPEAKER_15]: I got a gummy and I got a little drink.
[SPEAKER_15]: It tastes like beer.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I got this other thing, this little
vape pen thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so it's this whole other group of
people that are currently... If you wanna
[SPEAKER_15]: pay your burn every month, they're how
you're gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's not through all of these.
[SPEAKER_15]: But at the same time, I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanna recapture those people.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanna sell Sixstar and Full Melt Dry
Sift.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I wanna have podium products that are
small batch and incredible and powered by
[SPEAKER_15]: regenerative farms like Rosebud and Dunn
and all these different groups in Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's what I wanna see.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it's like, until we can actually sit
around and consume cannabis in public,
[SPEAKER_15]: we're not gonna... The world changed when
people just started drinking beers in
[SPEAKER_15]: pubs.
[SPEAKER_15]: The conversations that occurred from those
experiences with that drug created the
[SPEAKER_15]: future world.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they started doing tea houses.
[SPEAKER_15]: And those conversations were different
from the ones that were being done by the
[SPEAKER_15]: laborers who were drinking the beer.
[SPEAKER_15]: These were different people who were
scholars and they were drinking tea.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that created conversations that
created a new future.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then people started drinking coffee
and coffee was super productive.
[SPEAKER_15]: That created a whole different reality.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is going to as well, but we need to
be able to hang out in public,
[SPEAKER_15]: just like you can go to a store right into
a vapor lounge and have these
[SPEAKER_15]: conversations and bump into one another.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's why we all loved Amsterdam in
the 80s and the 90s, because it was that.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was the only place in the world you
could go to and just bump into people from
[SPEAKER_15]: other places.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, like we do.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm from Denmark.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, I'm from Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: Let's talk.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think that's what's important about what
we're doing right here, right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is one of the few places I've seen in
Canada, events that allows us to do that
[SPEAKER_09]: and all get together and hang out and
converse with each other.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cause the community really is small in the
end.
[SPEAKER_09]: And to be able to sit with each other and
break bread, let's say, is a huge,
[SPEAKER_09]: that impact on how we all walk away and
think about it and who we talk to and how
[SPEAKER_09]: we go out and socially describe what we do
now and how we think of it is all
[SPEAKER_09]: influenced by each other's conversations
here.
[SPEAKER_09]: We need more events that are properly done
to be able to do so.
[SPEAKER_15]: I think even more than events,
we need normalized lounges that are in
[SPEAKER_15]: every city that you can just be
skateboarding and be like, Oh,
[SPEAKER_15]: weird.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I see pod stores all the time.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have zero interest in going in.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm like, Oh, I should go into this
generic shop.
[SPEAKER_15]: It looks like an Apple store that has like
all the products look exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I, and I'm like a cannabis consumer of
30 plus years and I can't fucking
[SPEAKER_15]: recognize any of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Is that a pre-roll joint?
[SPEAKER_15]: Oh, it's a vape cartridge.
[SPEAKER_15]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's weird.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just can't recognize any of it.
[SPEAKER_15]: But if I went by and saw a vapor lounge
that I could just go into, and here's the
[SPEAKER_15]: other thing about cannabis, you'd be
welcome at every table in that vapor
[SPEAKER_15]: lounge.
[SPEAKER_15]: If there was only one chair at a 12 person
table and you walked in, of course,
[SPEAKER_15]: come and sit down, man.
[SPEAKER_15]: We'll smoke with you.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, let's find out who this person is
and let's those conversations that are yet
[SPEAKER_15]: to happen are going to create our future
world.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a, we have a consumption license
at our, at our spot, but COVID made it a
[SPEAKER_03]: pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an outside one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because we have acreage there,
we just let the acreage be the lounge.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I love lounges and I go to the ones in
the city when I'm in town to check them
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my favorite one was this, the
Northwest Social Club in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was so eclectic and diverse and who
was there and how they ran it and the cost
[SPEAKER_03]: that it made it really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and what I tripped out on was the
clusters of people who are in their
[SPEAKER_03]: seventies and eighties.
[SPEAKER_03]: That were bringing in ounces of oil to
blaze.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, whoa, you're the concentrate
consumers of bulk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm quality though, you know, like,
but I couldn't, all tight eyed out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, my grandmother's age.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just like, oh, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it let me see that diversity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there was groups of women.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I always look for groups of women
because what I know is that if you see
[SPEAKER_03]: women coming into places or you see women
walking in areas and you see them without
[SPEAKER_03]: men, they feel safe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there must be low crime rate and
there's no pressure to go into the club.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what I saw is very different
demographics than bars and radically
[SPEAKER_03]: friendlier with if you could sit down,
there was always a space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we would go, me and Pedro would go and
hang out at the Northwest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd be in there for like nine hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everybody that we were supposed to
meet on business, I'd have them come to
[SPEAKER_03]: the club and meet so we could just hang
out and get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and they had such an incredible set
up where they had underneath on the
[SPEAKER_03]: basement.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had all the pool tables and old
school games and ping pong and
[SPEAKER_03]: shuffleboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on the, on the top floor, they had all
these TVs, but it only had four different
[SPEAKER_03]: kinds of movie, cannabis movies,
comedies, kung fu, and like old school
[SPEAKER_03]: eighties action, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you had interesting stuff and they had
music in an outside area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you went in, the food was really
cheap.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you could, you know, you could get a
drink for a dollar 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what it did is it allowed you not to be
victimized while you were in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you bought a yearly membership.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'd show up and drop a couple
bucks to get in.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was like my single favorite place
in the world because when I was hanging
[SPEAKER_03]: out, there's always somebody sitting next
to you and everybody starts to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you don't have that in bars the same
way, because once people get liquored up,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're a different person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not everybody transforms, but most
transform.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with cannabis, the transformation is
usually, man, this is so hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to smoke some?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and it's, it's to me, it's the way
the community has to be built.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I fully in agreement that the fact that
we're allowed to buy the product,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we can't consume it anywhere except in
our, we want you to take it directly home
[SPEAKER_03]: and consume it in your house with the
windows closed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can't smoke it anywhere in public.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it was like that in Vancouver
originally.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was what was really cool about
Vancouver was going to Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can do that here in North America and
buy seeds in the basement, whatever it
[SPEAKER_05]: was, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the Blunt Brothers Cafe.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to come up and blaze at the Blunt
Brothers cause I was like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, you know, and also just that kind of
was the patient care side of things too.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's when you talk about make groups of
women, sometimes that's like their therapy
[SPEAKER_05]: group where they're going through cancer
together or something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And, and I think for us always cannabis
was like becoming more intelligent and
[SPEAKER_05]: rising above, like what was left,
what was given to you like medically or
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's athletes, you know,
there's so many athletes in the world that
[SPEAKER_05]: are, you know, they're getting broken.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're getting compromised and there's no
real guidance in the medical industry for
[SPEAKER_05]: true health and wellbeing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I like the idea of lounges as well when
they're mixed with like elixir bars and,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, herbal, you know, exploration,
hydrosols, aromatherapy and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're like getting high.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of a sudden you're like,
Whoa, like experiencing plants in a whole
[SPEAKER_05]: different way, a better food, a better way
of existing at home.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's part of the magic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Of the ganja and bringing the community
together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I do think that's missing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that the medical industry and
getting the people that are left out,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, when the medical industry can't
do anything, that's where, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis really shines.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the, you know, the regulated
system, I just don't feel that medicine is
[SPEAKER_05]: really for those people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's almost more just blast out like
consumer medicine where I just really
[SPEAKER_05]: resonate with the craft aspect of it and
creating avenues and lounges and places
[SPEAKER_05]: where we can get together so we can
communicate what's working about the
[SPEAKER_05]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's not just a product that's going
out and it fits a data set and a,
[SPEAKER_05]: you know, a graph, you know, you're
actually learning how your medicine is
[SPEAKER_05]: reacting with people and then people
needing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just, I just will, I think all of us
would always stand, you know, for that,
[SPEAKER_05]: that light and moving forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope that we can still do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: With things that are happening,
you know, locally, local processors,
[SPEAKER_05]: being able to support local micro
producers and these events moving forward.
[SPEAKER_15]: I wanted to actually, you were almost
describing my vapor bar in, in like 2001,
[SPEAKER_15]: my, my, the melting point.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I had my first, my first lounge,
I opened up the melting point 2001 on
[SPEAKER_15]: commercial drive.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was in Jamaica on the beach and my buddy
called me and said, I found your,
[SPEAKER_15]: your place 11, I and I and I and I.
[SPEAKER_15]: 11 11 commercial drive.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, I rented it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Didn't even know what I was doing.
[SPEAKER_15]: Started a gallery, did the whole glass
show with a slinger and all the glass
[SPEAKER_15]: blowers back in the day.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like we did the regenerate and the
degenerate art shows.
[SPEAKER_15]: I opened a raw food living source cafe.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was a hundred percent organic,
vegan and macrobiotic.
[SPEAKER_15]: Everything was grown within a hundred
miles of the cafe.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was just the most magical place.
[SPEAKER_15]: I had the inhalation station of
vaporization with 12 different vaporizers
[SPEAKER_15]: on my table.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I was vaporizing people with like all
sorts of like different herbs,
[SPEAKER_15]: all different sorts of terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then if you were, the reason I opened
it, I wasn't selling any weed,
[SPEAKER_15]: but at that point Canada had a medical,
you know, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: You could get a license medically to,
to have cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I thought, well, you can't ask people
about their health.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's illegal.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like it's not my job.
[SPEAKER_15]: So people wanted to come in and use the
vaporizers and put their herb in.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I just, I'd also want to give a shout
out to Hillary Black, who prior to that in
[SPEAKER_15]: 97 opened up, you know, through
inspiration of California, the corrals,
[SPEAKER_15]: Todd McCormick, all these people that she
had spent time with down there.
[SPEAKER_15]: She came up to, she came back to Vancouver
in 97 and she opened the BC compassion
[SPEAKER_15]: club.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's wild to think that that was
really the one of the major catalysts that
[SPEAKER_15]: led us to our conversations tonight,
which are just so like, so different from
[SPEAKER_15]: the birth of what was created.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it was, you know, it wasn't just
Hillary.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was like, just like in California,
it was the gay community who brought this
[SPEAKER_15]: forward.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, they, they backed cannabis in a
way that no other person who lived in the
[SPEAKER_15]: sort of Joe Strati mainstream world would
do.
[SPEAKER_15]: And so these two dudes kind of hooked up
with Hillary.
[SPEAKER_15]: She started the BC compassion club and who
she was helping were the most vulnerable,
[SPEAKER_15]: the most ill, terminally ill, mentally
ill, like every time you have this type of
[SPEAKER_15]: illness, you can have homeless living on
the street, really the most vulnerable
[SPEAKER_15]: people.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was, that was who cannabis chose to
help first, because really there was so
[SPEAKER_15]: much propaganda against it.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was still very much like, Ooh,
like this is drugs.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was like, well, let's just help the
people who literally had the least and who
[SPEAKER_15]: had the most to lose in a sense,
because they just already had nothing.
[SPEAKER_15]: And to watch how the, how cannabis,
for me, it was very profound because I was
[SPEAKER_15]: a broker in the city at the time,
selling a ton of cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: in a penthouse apartment, just flipping
mad pounds to everyone.
[SPEAKER_15]: And with the compassion club, I was like,
Ooh, I can't make any profit off of this.
[SPEAKER_15]: I have to actually lose money and just
give the cannabis compassion club cannabis
[SPEAKER_15]: and just be like, here's some pounds.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, I don't want to make money off this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it, it was the first time in my life,
I was ever exposed to like making friends
[SPEAKER_15]: with people who would then die like weeks
later or a month later or a day later.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like there was, if you were around in
those days, and I'm sure it was no
[SPEAKER_15]: different in California, they were dying
every day.
[SPEAKER_15]: So this core group of people that were
helping people were also dealing with this
[SPEAKER_15]: super heavy emotion of, of, of death.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that was the birth of what has led us
now to talk about data points and
[SPEAKER_15]: marketing and compliance and QAs and
making me mix my bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it is just so, so trippy, you know,
I'm not necessarily against it,
[SPEAKER_15]: but it is a very strange pathway that that
would lead us to hear.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, the irony of how it began,
like I knew the story of San Francisco
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, but before Dennis Perrone died
and I met Dennis and knew him,
[SPEAKER_03]: but before he died, he has this get
together as a house and you had to have 30
[SPEAKER_03]: years in the hustle, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So only 30 year hustlers could go to the
event.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so me and a couple of my partners go
down and hang with Dennis before he dies.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and my buddy's got to hang out with
the other architects of Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was really about this honesty of we
noticed that our friends who were dying of
[SPEAKER_03]: AIDS could eat if they smoked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we started the first compassion
club and it turned into a five story
[SPEAKER_03]: monster.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you poor and needy, you got free
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I got into medical cannabis
and Dennis was a giant dope dealer,
[SPEAKER_03]: like people, I don't think people have any
idea that fucking Dennis Perrone was a
[SPEAKER_03]: giant dope dealer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was out of control for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they shot him and tried to kill
him.
[SPEAKER_03]: They really, really didn't like Dennis
Perrone, but, but inside that little
[SPEAKER_03]: motherfucker was a heart of a tiger and he
just would not break.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he was surrounded by brilliant people
as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a group, they drove it forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when I really got into medical
cannabis, it was, it was the inspiration
[SPEAKER_03]: for those people that I was like,
wow, man, if Dennis Perrone can do this,
[SPEAKER_03]: that means it can be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like he proved it, that you can be cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can, you can take care of people who
are ill and you just have to make sure
[SPEAKER_03]: that you are making enough money
successfully to sustain it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you have, you have the ability to do
this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, we, we did, we did an
ungodly amount of, if it was a CBD product
[SPEAKER_03]: for years, you didn't pay for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything to do with, with, with,
we were the ones that were releasing all
[SPEAKER_03]: the CBD genes into the system,
but anything to do with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you came to me and you had it,
your wife was dying, you were dying.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: We subsidized you and we tried to like,
hold your hand till you died.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was so emotionally intense because
we realized that I had never been ill.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hadn't been through the hospital yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know what it was like to be in
the medical system.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't understand that for us to reach
out and be friendly and, and kind and
[SPEAKER_03]: supportive was that emotionally heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're watching people break down and
you don't realize they're breaking down
[SPEAKER_03]: because they haven't been treated nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was, and, and, and it was heavy
because I didn't come from a compassionate
[SPEAKER_03]: background.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I come right out of the street.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for me to run the program was
insane because I wasn't trying to make
[SPEAKER_03]: money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was already, I already had made money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get into medical cannabis to make
cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got in because I wanted a different
direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for me, it was odd to see everybody
trying to like beat the captive audience
[SPEAKER_03]: to death.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I'm the most moral person in the
room and I'm by far the most criminal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it tripped me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was something I just, it was so
eye-opening that we were more moral in
[SPEAKER_03]: that regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was just like, Whoa, I've broken
every rule, but this one I'm not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm about you on that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the, the gay community AIDS created a
problem that was not dealt with correctly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And internally they discovered a product
that would help.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how many times has that occurred
through history, but we just lost the
[SPEAKER_03]: history.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what other myriad of problems have been
solved by this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Josh was just mentioning, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The legends, legends, legends of
compassion.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I think that we're really hitting the
nail on the head.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's starting to get late too,
but I'm really hitting the nail on the
[SPEAKER_10]: head, but I think what has happened is
that we've taken the compassion out of the
[SPEAKER_10]: legacy market by forcing the legacy market
into a non-compassionate industry,
[SPEAKER_10]: which I like to call an out industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we are, we were in it because of
compassion.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now if it's not going to be
compassionate, then I'm not in,
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not interested.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like it's not interesting to me anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm moving to psychedelics because at
least I can find a place of compassion
[SPEAKER_10]: there because I've always grown my plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've always grown my community.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've helped out in my community.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've brought medicine.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were the medicine makers before,
you know, anybody understood it and
[SPEAKER_10]: they're still catching up to us in the
pharmaceutical market.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we did it because, and we still do it
because of the compassion.
[SPEAKER_10]: But if they're going to force us and take
the compassion out of it, then it's just
[SPEAKER_10]: not as interesting anymore.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, if we bring it back to the
compassion, I mean, that's really what
[SPEAKER_10]: we're all talking about here.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I loved it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is basically like where we came back
to, it was like, oh, it's just compassion
[SPEAKER_10]: versus the industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the out industry versus the fricking
legacy market.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what it is, is the heart and soul
versus the money man.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there's just simply going to always be
people that are more interested in the
[SPEAKER_10]: heart and soul of the beginning of any
industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the reason why it becomes an
industry is because it started with heart
[SPEAKER_10]: and soul.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that's the reason why it was
successful.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, you know, Hey, cannabis is one of the
most adaptogen plants, adaptogenic plants
[SPEAKER_10]: in the world that we know of on this
planet and us as cultivators of it know
[SPEAKER_10]: that if we are to survive and if we are to
continue to bring plant medicine forward,
[SPEAKER_10]: then we need to follow her guidance of be
adaptable.
[SPEAKER_15]: Very well put, Kelly.
[SPEAKER_15]: The only thing I think about in all that
is like, yes, like I was there for a lot
[SPEAKER_15]: of that in the nineties and it was so
powerful and it was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_15]: how could you make how could you profit
off of those people?
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, how could you profit off patients
that are so hurting?
[SPEAKER_15]: It's just, but yet how can you sustain it?
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I sustained it through flipping mad
pounds and then donating the excess.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I go buy a hundred pounds and every
pound would be like five hundred grams.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'd be like, take out, make those four
fifty fours, add it all up and then go
[SPEAKER_15]: give that to the compassion club.
[SPEAKER_15]: But it was like I needed both systems to
to philanthropize to the other side.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the other thing I think about is,
yes, like some people are going to stay
[SPEAKER_15]: there.
[SPEAKER_15]: What's driving me isn't like profit
margins and all of this.
[SPEAKER_15]: I know how important it is to make these
products available to everyone,
[SPEAKER_15]: because otherwise they're drinking alcohol
and they're they're they're literally
[SPEAKER_15]: consuming things that are bringing down
their vibrations, which is it's really
[SPEAKER_15]: making the world a worse place.
[SPEAKER_15]: And if we can just slowly make like
psychedelics available to people and can't
[SPEAKER_15]: like with cannabis, she's leading the way.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, psychedelics are going to be in
stores soon enough.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, Dana Larson, what he's got at
the peyote store, the the coca leaf store
[SPEAKER_15]: in Vancouver.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's selling psilocybin capsules.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's just like, yeah, whatever.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like I'm doing it again.
[SPEAKER_15]: I did it with weed.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll do it with this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And once they allow this, there's people
that always need to push that envelope
[SPEAKER_15]: because civil disobedience, no matter what
you think, is what led us here.
[SPEAKER_15]: I always remind the corporate kind of
people like, listen, like it's if we stop
[SPEAKER_15]: pushing the envelope now, we'll become
complacent and we'll deteriorate,
[SPEAKER_15]: we'll collapse.
[SPEAKER_15]: We have to always push the envelope and
the envelope is pushing the rules.
[SPEAKER_15]: They're putting the boundaries that
they're setting for us.
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to keep pushing them right where
we are right now, because we have moved
[SPEAKER_15]: forward.
[SPEAKER_15]: The bottom line is, you know, my buddy
Ron, who I just visited, my mentor,
[SPEAKER_15]: my dear friend Ron, you know, took me
under his wing when I was 17, taught me
[SPEAKER_15]: how to grow weed, showed me more weed than
I'd ever seen in my life.
[SPEAKER_15]: He served 11 years in the Stony Mountain
Penitentiary for being a habitual florist.
[SPEAKER_15]: Eleven years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Child murderers and rapists and like the
most dangerous people that you could
[SPEAKER_15]: imagine.
[SPEAKER_15]: And that's really, at least here in Canada
for now, not happening anymore.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, we don't get guns put in our
faces anymore because we have a backyard
[SPEAKER_15]: full of plants.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like, so that to me, it's getting better.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I want to see how much better we can
make it by pushing the boundaries within
[SPEAKER_15]: this system.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't care if we collapse it and push
the boundaries to the point.
[SPEAKER_15]: We need to get back to some civil
disobedience though.
[SPEAKER_05]: And continuing with the being able to make
products, like it's fun to make products
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's compounding products that really
is what we need right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like being able to compound products I
think is a beautiful future coming.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a shout out to my mom.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're at a pot conference and they're down
on alcohol.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's that mom?
[SPEAKER_07]: My mom threw me out of the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I was 16, I was next door doing a
bong hit with my next door neighbor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I looked out the window.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was dusk about, you know, night.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I saw my mom's face in the window.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And after that, I got too quick.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got to go home.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I went home, my stuff was right on
the porch and I was out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, at that time, I'll hold you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you, so you were, I'm 56, but you were,
you're from that, you're from the absolute
[SPEAKER_03]: peak of this shit's heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: My family was organized crime,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was considered the worst criminal in the
house.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got relatives doing 200 years in
prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was the criminal because it,
oh my God, drugs, weed!
[SPEAKER_03]: Because weed was worse than heroin.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I trip out because the propaganda was
so unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now here we are now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I agree with you Marcus that we
were making these changes and we still,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: they're still stuck in people in the joint
left and right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not, we're not doing the job
we're supposed to.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of rhetoric.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what you're seeing is people becoming
cannabis aficionados, cannabis,
[SPEAKER_03]: not just consumers, but also culturally
aware.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the more the public becomes
sensitized, the harder it is to screw
[SPEAKER_03]: people because they're your jury.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you have to be able to allow this
to take place.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I mean, I've just been
waiting my whole life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just figure, well, I'm not gonna,
someone said, they go, what are you gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: do next?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, there is no next.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm gonna do this till I'm dead.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so because of that, I know that the
timeline is forever.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just need to make sure that I
make good movement and that I see
[SPEAKER_03]: long-term and that I try to build value
and I try to drag as many people forward
[SPEAKER_03]: with me as I can because it's hard to
party alone and have a good time.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Canada, the laws are like still
transforming, you know, like everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's important for us to continue to
learn.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's cool to hear about New York and all
the vaping lunges.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you can smoke anywhere in New
York City now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's so fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we're all talking about is
happening over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maine, you know, there's some really
amazing patient care available in Maine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of our farmers that we work with
in Maine have a really amazing system.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of good stuff in Michigan,
you know, incredible farmers, incredible
[SPEAKER_05]: genetics going on.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, the compost camps, they're
definitely feeling like the floods and all
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, just big love to those
families, you know, trying to make it go
[SPEAKER_05]: in Oklahoma, that whole scene.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going down next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michigan just hit the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oklahoma's hitting the ground next.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, my buddy was, my buddy's
telling me, we're in the next Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he hits me up the next day and he
goes, man, Hale took my whole crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, you're not the next Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be all right.
[SPEAKER_15]: How did Oklahoma go from giving Will
Foster 96 years in prison for growing some
[SPEAKER_15]: plants in his basement to just literally
letting everyone grow weed?
[SPEAKER_03]: The cash grab 2500, 2500 for the license.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cash grab and it's mind bending.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you got people in prison watching
this occur.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm expunged, but I'm a multi-time
felon.
[SPEAKER_03]: I collected a whole slew of the fucking
charges over the years, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they only come up when the federal
database pulls me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I had to write this letter of
contrition for my license.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I had to say, I apologize for the
crime I committed so that I can commit the
[SPEAKER_03]: crime legally today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I wrote as my statement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, does this work?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were like, well, I guess it's
contrite.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I was just like, this is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, I have all the
expungement.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I come up as a clean individual,
but the bottom line is what allowed that
[SPEAKER_03]: to happen was the money I made in the
hustle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause most of the people didn't have that
lawyer power where I had a lawyer
[SPEAKER_03]: entertainer for like 25 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like when you're hanging out with your
attorney all the time, you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: different life and most people don't have
that ability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for me, I'm like, I feel fortunate,
not smart.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the number of my friends that did time
in the joint and then like my family did
[SPEAKER_03]: time, all of a weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, we're still not done,
but we're moving forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this shit, that shit, I can handle you
slowing my business down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't handle you fucking people and
putting them in the joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if there was a choice between the
two, you can make my business life harder
[SPEAKER_03]: versus put someone in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause once you in prison, you in a
different fucking world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the average individual grown weed does
not belong in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: You about to have a bad fucking time.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're not a certain type of dude,
you have a bad time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I was facing 25 years and I remember
the judge asking my lawyer, how would be
[SPEAKER_15]: November 22nd be for the next date?
[SPEAKER_15]: And John Conroy, he's like, oh no,
your honor, that date won't work for me.
[SPEAKER_15]: Leans over to my ear and he goes,
cause I'll be at the cannabis cup in
[SPEAKER_15]: Amsterdam with my clients.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like in court, he says this.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm like, holy fuck.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm just like, this is my first time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Getting busted.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'm kind of like, okay, like, yeah,
that's true.
[SPEAKER_15]: We are going to the cannabis cup together.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it is important to be good friends with
your lawyer.
[SPEAKER_15]: And have the right lawyer.
[SPEAKER_15]: And have the right lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, well, you do have to have a
couple, but you have to have one key
[SPEAKER_03]: lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what happens is he becomes kind
of like your consulari.
[SPEAKER_03]: And through him, he finds your other
lawyers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't look for lawyers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your lawyer looks for lawyers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you say, look, I got a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's put a team together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your lawyer puts a team together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause the one thing you know is that
attorney you've chosen who's worked with
[SPEAKER_03]: you is about you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know that when they get in court,
they're fucking ferocious.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, I may have lost that case,
but the ass beaten, they were given the
[SPEAKER_03]: drug task force in front of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: The judge said, I don't understand the
line of questioning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And my attorney said, oh, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think this cop's smart enough to
actually fucking hold a job as a cop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to go at that first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, oh, this is great.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was watching him just smack the shit out
of these guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, if I even lose, it was worth
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy Christ.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what it's like to have some murder
attorneys on the screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, how about my attorney who worked
with my prosecutor for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then the prosecutor came to my
attorney in the middle of my case that I'm
[SPEAKER_15]: facing 25 years for.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it's the one of the first compassion
club cases in Canada.
[SPEAKER_15]: So Hillary black and the whole compassion
club crew, they're in the court case in
[SPEAKER_15]: the room, but the prosecutor in the
hallway asks, he says, Hey, did you hear
[SPEAKER_15]: about our good buddy?
[SPEAKER_15]: He's a, he's a judge.
[SPEAKER_15]: They've worked with him for 25 years as
well.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's got prostate cancer.
[SPEAKER_15]: He's in, he's in the hospital.
[SPEAKER_15]: Do you think your, your client could get
him a bag of weed?
[SPEAKER_15]: So now my prosecutor is trafficking in
cannabis in the hallway while prosecuting
[SPEAKER_15]: me for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was just like, Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_15]: I did get him a bag of weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're holding them, but holding them like,
but no, that's, it's some funny shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's true.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the end, but the issue is,
you know, that the legal system,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't care what country you're in.
[SPEAKER_03]: The legal system is expensive and the
average individual can't really fight a
[SPEAKER_03]: case.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to, they have to take a public
defender and cop a plea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they don't, people don't understand
that, you know, you're provided attorney,
[SPEAKER_03]: the attorney's job isn't to defend you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's to cop a plea.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you end up having to settle these
pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so most people just don't have the
legal power.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now I just, you know, when I was,
that's why I left Rhode Island really was
[SPEAKER_03]: that I was visiting my cousin in the joint
and he's doing 200 years in prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: All my friends about to spend the lives in
prison.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sitting there going, man,
there's no future.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all going to, we're all going to the
joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're carrying a bag of grass in your
pocket.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to prison at the time,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're all, we're all in crime pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, we're definitely going down for
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, this is, this isn't,
this isn't, there's nothing here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it had to become, it was 83.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the drug war was in full effect and
they were just sweeping people up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So me and Dale Gerringer from normal were
hanging out and we were talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: timelines.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said, woo, 83 was aggressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he goes, oh yeah, that was the year
where they went off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when I got smashed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you, you, you can't live a life where
every moment, the penalty is, is death.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too, it's just too much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and so I said, look, I'm going to,
I'm going to get out of here for a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then as when I was gone, I spent,
I spent an afternoon with a global level
[SPEAKER_03]: drug trafficker and he, he helped me
understand that cannabis was my life and
[SPEAKER_03]: was my future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I said, wow, that's, that's heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got, when I got out of the military,
I went right back into the game and never
[SPEAKER_03]: left because he helped me understand that
that was a time period and that the
[SPEAKER_03]: evolution of cannabis was about to begin.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said that we're about to go through
this radical global change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, wow, I'm going to,
I'm going to ride that change because
[SPEAKER_03]: being an herb is where I had my,
my, my best time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was where I felt most comfortable,
you know, consuming cannabis, being around
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis people, cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that was me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when I put it down, you put down a
piece of yourself, but I just I,
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone around me was going to prison and
I already been incarcerated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was just like, this isn't the fucking
life.
[SPEAKER_15]: No, but what it did here in Canada was it
made cannabis very valuable because we
[SPEAKER_15]: would get caught with it.
[SPEAKER_15]: And really you have to have hundreds of
pounds to go to prison.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was suddenly like pounds were like
so, and I don't know about 83,
[SPEAKER_15]: what pounds were selling for, but like by
93, it's like 5,500 to 7,000 us dollars in
[SPEAKER_15]: Manhattan for a pound of good weed.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you could buy it, you could buy it in,
in, in well, but like by the hundred
pounds.
[SPEAKER_15]: You could buy it by in Vancouver for like
2,400 Canadian to like on a high end,
[SPEAKER_15]: 3,200 Canadian, which at the time was like
1.48 exchange.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was like, you're paying like with
your American dollars, you're like,
[SPEAKER_15]: I think I just paid like 1300 us dollars
for this pound.
[SPEAKER_15]: And now this pound is worth like six or
7,000 us dollars.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I'm moving 200 at a time or a thousand
at a time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like it just became such a crazy place
where it was like the wild, wild West,
[SPEAKER_15]: but you also had all these amazing people
coming up who you'd become friends with,
[SPEAKER_15]: but then you'd never see them again
because they got pulled over in Spokane or
[SPEAKER_15]: they went down to Alabama or they like
went somewhere where it was like 10,
[SPEAKER_15]: 20, 30 years.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like it was just a crazy thing that you
were killing us.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys were killing us in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I'm sure all the guys that were flying
in, all the guys that were flying in to
[SPEAKER_03]: grab her from us.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had, we had become entitled and,
and, and the, the, the BC group was
[SPEAKER_03]: putting out better product and for cheaper
prices.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think at the time, you know,
you can get a unit for like 2,600 and in
[SPEAKER_03]: humble, you know, it was like 4,400.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, cause I, when I came to Canada,
I know as soon as I spoke, they knew I
[SPEAKER_03]: wasn't Canadian.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first words out of the cab
driver's mouth were looking for units,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a packs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, I'm California.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got, fuck you got weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, and then we would just hang out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the, that, that, that quality that was
moving out of Canada was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the price point was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if it wasn't for nine 11, and perp
California would have got buried.
[SPEAKER_03]: It saved our lives.
[SPEAKER_03]: You were killing us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you were actually nicer and more
friendly to deal with.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the guys I knew that did big,
big plane work where they had their own
[SPEAKER_03]: planes.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were just like, and we all got along,
but they were like, God, dealing with you
[SPEAKER_03]: fuckers up there sucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: He goes, the Canadians are so nice and,
and the herb is cheaper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had rivers of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can see the mountains here.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had no enforcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking here and I'm like,
wow, you, you could have went off.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plenty of water, no enforcement.
[SPEAKER_03]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have the helicopter.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, we had the helicopters, but it's same
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't mind them because even when I got
busted and they, they, they took me for
[SPEAKER_03]: 900 pounds one year, um, that 900 pounds I
lost being someone else made 900 pounds,
[SPEAKER_03]: my money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the years that you got fucked,
I got paid.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's a game.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I never tripped on the helicopters.
[SPEAKER_03]: You need, you need the difficulty to make
the mission correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's no difficulty, everybody plays.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and, and the people who play in the
game.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like that world required a certain type
of person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that time, that's what I was into.
[SPEAKER_15]: Well, I'll tell you the Beasters,
because you mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll say, you know, that was, uh,
that was not created by a Canadian.
[SPEAKER_15]: The original Beasters were American buyers
that would come up by massive amounts of
[SPEAKER_15]: weed and then sifted.
[SPEAKER_15]: They'd sift all the sift off the weed.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then they'd send the weed to these
different North Carolina and like down in
[SPEAKER_15]: Kentucky, like all these different places.
[SPEAKER_15]: And you know, it wasn't the only part.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was also really Breeder Steve
turning on the Vietnamese to growing
[SPEAKER_15]: cannabis, giving them grapefruit cultivar.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_15]: And don't get me wrong when they first
start, I'll never forget it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause I met these guys.
[SPEAKER_15]: They were like hardcore gangster dudes and
they were just like, man, this is so good.
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't need to have guns.
[SPEAKER_15]: I don't need to have bodyguards.
[SPEAKER_15]: This is amazing business.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, but what happened was they
pumped out amazing product for about two
[SPEAKER_15]: years.
[SPEAKER_15]: And then it was like, eh, we don't need to
go eight weeks or nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_15]: We don't need to really dry it properly.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it just went downhill because people
were coming up to buy it.
[SPEAKER_15]: You didn't have to do that anymore.
[SPEAKER_15]: And they just, they were more like in the
business of just like pumping out product.
[SPEAKER_15]: But the first product those guys pumped
out, I was beyond impressed.
[SPEAKER_15]: I was like, wow, like how could you,
it was a cultural thing because it was
[SPEAKER_15]: like Caucasian people are just fucking
each other over and fucking it up.
[SPEAKER_15]: And the way he put it to me, my buddy was
like, Vietnam's small, bro.
[SPEAKER_15]: Like if I have to go back there and I fuck
someone here in Canada, like I am bumping
[SPEAKER_15]: into them.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, so they were able to work
together in a way that like put out
[SPEAKER_15]: really, once they got the cultivars and
Steve definitely hooked them up with the
[SPEAKER_15]: cultivars, they were able to put out
really nice cannabis.
[SPEAKER_15]: And it just, it must've seemed like a
miracle to them from coming from like a
[SPEAKER_15]: really gangsterism, selling heroin,
selling cocaine to just leaving that
[SPEAKER_15]: behind and getting into this herb game.
[SPEAKER_15]: Cause there was that much money in the
herb game.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are still violent though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a buddy that got killed by the
Canadians.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you guys still had, it was biker gang
shit doing the trafficking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they owed my partner money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And instead of paying my buddy,
they just, they came down to Santa Rosa
[SPEAKER_03]: and they fucking murdered him at his house
over the debt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like college in upstate New York
during that time.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was this weed, a lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was really cheap when it was $4,000 for
anything, anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can get anything and you can get it
for 1300 US.
[SPEAKER_09]: That drove a pretty big market for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_15]: That was coming over native lands,
over the border.
[SPEAKER_15]: So there's just thousands of pounds a day.
[SPEAKER_15]: That whole Mohawk thing that happened.
[SPEAKER_15]: If you remember the Mohawk thing,
that was like, Hey, look over here.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: They had the guns and the masks and they
were supposedly protecting a field.
[SPEAKER_15]: That field was nothing.
[SPEAKER_15]: It was all like, it was like giving a crop
up to move 10,000 crops over the border.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, every single day they were
moving thousands of pounds and you could
[SPEAKER_15]: never feed enough into America.
[SPEAKER_15]: There was just really even just New York,
just New York.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so what happens now when New York,
the Northeast, the largest market in the
[SPEAKER_09]: world, let's say, actually gets out of its
cowboy stage and produces enough cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: legally that they'll never have to have
imported cannabis ever again.
[SPEAKER_15]: I will say one thing about that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I think he will as well.
[SPEAKER_15]: Terroir.
[SPEAKER_15]: Right.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Terroir.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's a craft thing.
[SPEAKER_15]: You can't get Jamaican.
[SPEAKER_04]: There were grapes when, when the Vikings
landed in the new world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't hear, I, I've never had a wine
from PEI, but I could tell you there are
[SPEAKER_04]: some fantastic wine regions in BC.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some fantastic wine regions in
France.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think you're going to end up seeing
is cultivars being developed for locally
[SPEAKER_04]: adapted for this environment that can fit
within that climactic standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, here in, here in the
Kootenays, that's, that's probably going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be shorter season plants, but there's
going to be some, you know, the high
[SPEAKER_04]: variety of pine terpenoids within,
within the environment and likely within
[SPEAKER_04]: the compost is probably going to
contribute to pine and other similar
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenoids being slightly higher within
the cultivars.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we can compare it to
microbreweries, let's say, if there's a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of people that drink Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_09]: People that drink Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same thing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going, there's going to be a lot
of people that drink micro brews also.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you're going to have to have both.
[SPEAKER_09]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think you can rest in business on
just one or the other quite yet having
[SPEAKER_09]: both of them.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, my goal was always to put out the
best all the time and say at the highest
[SPEAKER_09]: level possible.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I realized at one point that it wasn't
just the highest level of the connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the highest level of every grade
that you can go after.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have to put out a lower grade
because it is what it is, match the price
[SPEAKER_09]: point and put out the highest possible
grade you can match that price point.
[SPEAKER_15]: I just know I've traveled all over the
world and made hash all over the world and
[SPEAKER_15]: probably 26, 27 countries.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I have my favorites and there are
different profiles that are created in
[SPEAKER_15]: those different countries that I've never
tasted or experienced.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I can't even put it into language,
really, that just the overall feeling that
[SPEAKER_15]: you can get from cannabis that's been
expressed from a different terroir.
[SPEAKER_15]: You know, and so that, like to me,
where I really want to see this go is like
[SPEAKER_15]: I'd love to be able to see all of these
different terror.
[SPEAKER_15]: I mean, of course, the old Afghanistan and
Lebanon and all these different hash
[SPEAKER_15]: producing countries.
[SPEAKER_15]: But for all we know, there's hash
producing countries that we've never heard
[SPEAKER_15]: of that will, you know, like in Jamaica,
a perfect example is in the Westmoreland,
[SPEAKER_15]: they grow the best weed.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like, no, they don't.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's just where it was the furthest away
from the fucking army and the police force
[SPEAKER_15]: of Kingston.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's the furthest point of the island.
[SPEAKER_15]: That's that's why they went there,
not for the soil or for whatever else.
[SPEAKER_15]: But what happens when we really start
going to places for the terroir to find
[SPEAKER_15]: these different expressions that aren't
necessarily based on how much can I get
[SPEAKER_15]: and how fast can I get it?
[SPEAKER_09]: So when I went to Barcelona and we did,
you know, if you've ever been to
[SPEAKER_09]: spandibus, that's kind of like the new
Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we were getting hash from Morocco,
you know, and they were saying,
[SPEAKER_09]: oh, this is how they get it here.
[SPEAKER_09]: They like ski do it over.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're smoking hash from Morocco and
it's called Blue Dream and it's called OG
[SPEAKER_09]: Kush and it's called and I'm like,
wait a second.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we can't get the original genetics of
the land race that you guys have been
[SPEAKER_09]: growing for centuries anymore because all
of the people, the children have gotten
[SPEAKER_09]: hip to the game.
[SPEAKER_09]: And they've come and gotten genetics from
Amsterdam or Barcelona or America and are
[SPEAKER_09]: growing them there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're losing that traditional hash
that truly is Afghanistan, terroir.
[SPEAKER_09]: And maybe there'll be a difference in how,
you know, we can see it grown differently
[SPEAKER_09]: and different expressions from this
cultivars that we're using today.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I think it's a tragedy that we're
going to lose.
[SPEAKER_09]: In Jamaica, they didn't have lamb's breath
right there.
[SPEAKER_09]: None of the Rosses had lamb's breath.
[SPEAKER_09]: They had sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_09]: And because it's such a small island and
they don't pull their males, that was the
[SPEAKER_09]: end up talk was that we don't have that
anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't have it in a pure form.
[SPEAKER_09]: It doesn't exist because we ruined that
because of our geography.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we tried to take what we saw in the
world and bring it to our world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now, you know, the chase is land
races, but we're losing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are losing stuff, but like I just got
brought into this project in Morocco and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's to develop Appalachians of origin for
the farm so they can start to identify,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, the impacts of the region.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also to sequence the genetics and
get the fucking Dutch and American genes
[SPEAKER_03]: out of the pool because it's killing the
farmers because none of that shit is
[SPEAKER_03]: developed for drought.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when the agronomists come over from
these countries, they're telling them,
[SPEAKER_03]: you need more water to use.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll be great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're trying to tell them,
we don't have any more water.
[SPEAKER_03]: We only have this much water.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, nobody's kind of cognizant
of this limitation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're trying to say, well,
then you're not going to be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: produce cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, we've been producing it for
3000 fucking years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think we need the advice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what they realized is that what they
need is people to come in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the Moroccan government got ahold
of an Israeli group that's connected the D
[SPEAKER_03]: .D.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mary.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have someone who's a brilliant
cannabinoid scientist to be able to really
[SPEAKER_03]: do deep dives into profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have the sequencing groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got brought in to help them kind of
work with the farmers and start to develop
[SPEAKER_03]: this project.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the irony of it is that they got
infiltrated with American and Dutch genes
[SPEAKER_03]: and then they're failing because plants
that were produced in rock wool don't
[SPEAKER_03]: really give you water conservation.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you're not starving the plant off.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you're giving it optimal conditions
and you're dialing in your dry backs and
[SPEAKER_03]: all your fucking squirts.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the problem is it got optimal moisture
the entire time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is not possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we see, too, is that the European
market is far more driven towards what we
[SPEAKER_03]: would call traditional Moroccan hash to go
along with tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that the desire for the American
products isn't there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Europeans aren't desiring our products
as much as they want the traditional
[SPEAKER_03]: products, but they want them standardized,
stabilized and delivered freely,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know, frequently able to be
accessed easily like it's been for
[SPEAKER_03]: centuries in Europe.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so you kind of see the change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like when I was in I was in
Colombia, same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went there to work on a project and
people knew I was coming into Colombia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so all these old farmers out of Cali
had come down and picked me up and we went
[SPEAKER_03]: and hung out in Bogota.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they were the preservationists of the
old Colombian lines.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they said, our families have held this
for hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have like 50 different varieties
that we've held in form for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we're trying to do is bring these
forward in breeding projects and further
[SPEAKER_03]: them into the normal world because they
understand that the historical value.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go to what you go to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was telling somebody, I said,
you go to you go to Thailand and I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: when you get a bag of fucking runs,
you're going to be upset.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're like, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, trust me on this one.
[SPEAKER_03]: A tourist doesn't want runs in Thailand.
[SPEAKER_03]: They want runs in fucking Florida because
that's an indoor flower, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: make it anywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: But with with what we're talking about is
very specific stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so New York blowing up, everyone's
going to have their own internal market.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you would still want to import some
killer seasonal from Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_03]: You would still want to import some killer
seasonal from Kootenai.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd still want to import some phenomenal
herb from Colombia.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'd still want to touch Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_03]: You still want to touch all these
countries that produce phenomenal herb and
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe not replace your crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a competitor, but there's no way
New York can produce those products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no fucking way they're going
to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not going to do equatorial shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: So how long is that?
[SPEAKER_09]: How long does that take for us to get to
that point?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's happening right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: You think?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I guarantee it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to go like in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just know that all these countries that
are opening up, I'm brought into the
[SPEAKER_03]: conversations about sourcing product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so legal countries to legal countries,
it's happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the U.S., we're fucked for a minute
because we're not doing we're not opening
[SPEAKER_03]: the borders at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the problem with the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said two years ago, I figured five
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think five years because I figured
that the administration that I was in in
[SPEAKER_03]: America didn't give a fuck about us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I figured the Dems probably don't give
a fuck about us either.
[SPEAKER_03]: But maybe at the next election,
they'll be so desperate that they'll have
[SPEAKER_03]: to legalize.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so legalization is just a tool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's not about fairness or parity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's straight up a political tool to use
to get votes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so until they have the need,
there's no need to do so.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so for us in the U.S., we're just
hoping that we can go state to state,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is difficult, because if you if you
if it's contiguous, we can do a compact.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if we have to fly through the air over
a state that is not part of the compact,
[SPEAKER_03]: it goes on to federal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it creates this situation that's that's
tough.
[SPEAKER_03]: But globally, we're not the only producer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't I don't see cannabis from a U
.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective only because I'm touching
cannabis in other countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what I know is any country that's
legal can import.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we couldn't get enough urban
Israel from the production, we got it
[SPEAKER_03]: imported from Portugal.
[SPEAKER_03]: So people in Portugal are selling herb.
[SPEAKER_10]: I just think I think this is a really
interesting conversation, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: And while it's like my favorite part of
it, I'm going to cut it short because
[SPEAKER_10]: we've been here for a while and feeling a
little bit hungry.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've been going going for a while.
[SPEAKER_10]: But what I but what I did want to say is
that what we do is we continue to talk
[SPEAKER_10]: about culture.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're talking about the cannabis culture.
[SPEAKER_10]: And now we're expanding the word culture
to different areas, which we call terroir.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we talk about secondary
metabolites and we talk about terpene
[SPEAKER_10]: profiles, we talk about different
cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're talking about the culture of the
plant and that culture of the plant can
[SPEAKER_10]: only come from different areas in
different zones.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just think it's really interesting
that that term culture continues to come
[SPEAKER_10]: back.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are always honoring the culture of us
in the industry and us in different
[SPEAKER_10]: cultures.
[SPEAKER_10]: But how awesome for us to be able to honor
all of the different cultures that
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis comes from as well, because
that's the true culture.
[SPEAKER_10]: And when we talk about cannabis culture,
that's really what we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_10]: not just our associated association as
human beings with it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I just wanted to thank you all so
much.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's been a really wonderful evening.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm just going to kick out.
[SPEAKER_10]: This has been just so stimulating.
