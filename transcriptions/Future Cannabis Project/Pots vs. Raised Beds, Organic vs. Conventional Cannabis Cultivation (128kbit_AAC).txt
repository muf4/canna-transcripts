[SPEAKER_01]: I've experienced better yields and
production capabilities, consistency with
[SPEAKER_01]: pots in greenhouses versus beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've run a couple acres of each for a
couple years of each of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just find I get a better
consistency, outcome, density,
[SPEAKER_01]: the look that the market wants more
consistently with pots than with beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, and that's the stress of the
environment of a pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But beds for me, being a soil producer and
a soil guy, produce a super soil called
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Roots is all tested, non-GMO,
pesticide free, there's no contaminants,
[SPEAKER_00]: tested for heavy metals, things that the
industry isn't even talking about yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, a super soil is a product that
you can plant, you can get your life out
[SPEAKER_00]: of it, you add your beneficials and add
more biologics to the soil, which actually
[SPEAKER_00]: eat up the minerals, you know,
digest any kind of pumice stone that's in
[SPEAKER_00]: my mixes, you know, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's eating, it's eating and producing its
own environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you create, and me, this is my
opinion on beds versus pots, in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, beds, once you start creating
that living soil out of a first year soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have a right medium to actually
put down in it, you have to add less and
[SPEAKER_00]: less and you create more of a beneficial
environment, which produces a lot better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, I really believe in the
communication of a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that communications through
terpenes are, beneficials, microbes,
[SPEAKER_00]: they communicate through terpenes,
terpenes through pheromones, right,
[SPEAKER_00]: through the scents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the roots are actually talking to each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have one plant, yeah,
when you have one plant going and roots
[SPEAKER_00]: are going past, they can, they might not
be able to find what they need in that pot
[SPEAKER_00]: at that time, but when their roots are
three feet away and a plant's,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, not even that big, but the roots
are even bigger than that plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're searching for their needs and they
have a free flowing method that they can
[SPEAKER_00]: produce their own environment and to get
the same results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're saying, and I agree with
you, we're all in this together,
[SPEAKER_01]: so I'm not a hundred, you know,
exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just keeping that consistency
throughout the year, day in, day out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I find that harder with soil testing
when you have the actual results from the
[SPEAKER_01]: labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I experienced the difference than what
your experience, which is cool because we
[SPEAKER_00]: are different cats on the same dream
hammering it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing I don't like about beds in
a greenhouse or even with pots in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse is in the winter time on my
last run, going from the late winter into
[SPEAKER_00]: early spring, I always like to bring pots
in and put pallets or something over the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the beds to keep that root zone off
the ground because when the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions drop below, it's pulling that
coldness.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots won't grow if they're not in the
right kind of temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where rolling beds come
through.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rolling tables, you eliminate walkways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just find that your production per
square foot goes dramatically up with the
[SPEAKER_01]: pots rolling beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like, it's a hard one to
fully.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is what I've learned in the last
few years and I do a lot of, and so do
[SPEAKER_00]: you, we do greenhouse growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're a couple, we're a couple of
homies handling business, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: In a greenhouse, in, in greenhouse
environment, what was I going to say?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, so what I've learned instead of doing
less numbers in pots, when even on my
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor environment, I do less or twice the
amount of numbers, half the amount of veg
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I flip like in my greenhouses,
I put my plants in, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I flip within 10 days, immediately
flipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I produce smaller plants, more yields,
more consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my weights, my yields, everything,
the time, like instead of doing three
[SPEAKER_00]: runs, possibly hard to do three runs in a
greenhouse in a season, I can hammer out
[SPEAKER_00]: an easy four because my flipping time is
now, you know, gone up a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I'm using a lot less time to produce
more yields.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the whole idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the whole idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I mean, I think we're in
agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty much agreeance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, I don't deny the microbe factor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here's where there is a moral,
it's more, maybe it's an ethical dilemma.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not 100% sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been an organic guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've liked organics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have found that the yield, I could get
higher yields with using the salt
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers and all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to me, a plant doesn't really care
whether it's organic food or non-organic
[SPEAKER_01]: food.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to differ with you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, well, where is the difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you show that to me on a chemical
test?
[SPEAKER_00]: I could show it in you a terpene test.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could show you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a terpene test, I've done essential
oils for a long time, for my whole life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I teach at this school in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cabrillo College?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's College of Botanical Healing
Arts.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the only essential oil school in
California that you can go to and sit down
[SPEAKER_01]: anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've had access to this GCMS machine
and I've seen multiple years of data that
[SPEAKER_01]: correlates an organic crop, a conventional
crop, and a hand-picked crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is all not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But consistently, throughout the years,
the conventional farms have put out a more
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse terpene profile than the organic
farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mainly, I think, because the
deliverance of nutrients is as great as
[SPEAKER_01]: the microbe web can be, it's not always
giving the plant what it wants every
[SPEAKER_01]: moment of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when conventional, you can do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're basically just giving them little
steroids all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're rinsing it right out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ethical dilemma I would generally
face would be denitrification of the soil,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, et cetera, you know,
water, pollution, runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you can mitigate those situations
with runoff trays into recollecting and
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of I mean, that is a responsible
part of the ethical punch, but there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: ethical backing in conventional farming in
my eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and here's to me where the dilemma
lies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you aren't producing something that
gives good runoff, clean runoff,
[SPEAKER_00]: then you should be runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should be runoff, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But generally, there's low runoff.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't necessarily need a high runoff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in conventional farming, you're
utilizing, if not double, even more times
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of water on our drained away
scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't necessarily found that to be the
100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to get you some big root soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just moments away from each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to hook you up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to teach me and I want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do I.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so anyways, I think the data to me
that I've what I've seen through the
[SPEAKER_01]: college has been that the conventional
farms did actually put out a better
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm not saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I would love to sit down with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is hard for me, because I would
like to say, oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: The organic is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm here to say the organic is
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The organic is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here saying that I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know he's not dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm just playing the devil's advocate
a little bit because I what I have seen is
[SPEAKER_01]: higher yields.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and so now if I have employees coming
in every day and my greenhouse is using a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain amount of amperage, and I'm
running heaters, and I'm doing all this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, employees are coming every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is a, you know,
sustainability, kind of like, what about
[SPEAKER_00]: the living organisms, the beneficials that
are that are destroyed by conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: farming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just talk about plant welfare.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's talk about plant welfare.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, this is a beta test I did on 100
plant outdoor with conventional and 100
[SPEAKER_00]: plant with my organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a what a story I tell all the time
is I this was about 10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nine years ago, I did two plant studies
and I always believed organics and I was
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing it back then you can probably
verify other than Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not many people were pushing any organic
movement is Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not many people back then were really
buying into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was 90% sure I was on the right
path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then all of a sudden, I wanted to prove it
to myself because I'm a hydro I'm a store
[SPEAKER_00]: owner garden garden center.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't call it hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a garden soil king garden center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on those two patches, I crew like I
grew conventional farming and then organic
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: At first going into about July,
this conventional plants were bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're about 20% bigger than my organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started telling myself, maybe I'm
fucking wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I miss this boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I'm selling me a ticket that I can't
buy into anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I found out is that it started
getting the end of July, into August,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm having root problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having diseases root.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having plant diseases.
[SPEAKER_00]: The winds are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are falling over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm staking the hell out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're spindly, same genetics as this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: These ones are steady the race,
steady the race, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Harvest comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably lost, you know, a good 10% of
these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: These plants are still running the gamut
running strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: This finishes a quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: This finish at CB at best.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got about we've figured out 17% more
yield on the organic than we ever did on a
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional farming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the product was sought after more
powder mildew everything and what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: I've come to realize is that your plant
needs its own biological system and needs
[SPEAKER_00]: his own system to ward off and fight
diseases to pest everything that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you eliminate that structure,
starting with a healthy soil, you
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate the plant putting off its own
pheromones for when certain bugs come and
[SPEAKER_00]: attack on the out on the outdoor,
not so much indoor because a controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, you know, and you start you
start messing with its own a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, then all of a sudden you run
into more issues, diseases, different
[SPEAKER_00]: problems coming on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think you can also keep a plant
happy in many different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's more like, yeah,
the organic and for long season,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a bigger buffer because you're
slowly breaking down all these nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're creating the life for all the
microbes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, micro eyes and all of that to be
happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I almost think it's almost more
challenging to be the conventional guy,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you have to really know it is
you're mixing more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then all of a sudden, now my plants not
happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're so natural.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so it's kind of like an
anecdotal study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I get one that says here's a we're
manipulating it instead of letting its
[SPEAKER_00]: biology, biology manipulate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When a plant needs something that goes and
talks to the biology, I need this.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it can't really the communication
between us and that plant on the
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional is a different aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really got to be on your game.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a hug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
