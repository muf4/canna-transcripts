[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Vincenzo Di Marzo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the research director of the National
Research Council.
[SPEAKER_02]: And currently I'm actually a Canada
Excellence Research Chair in Quebec City
[SPEAKER_02]: in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been working on the endocannabinoid
system since basically its discovery at
[SPEAKER_02]: the beginning of the 1990s.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been working on the biochemistry,
chemistry, pharmacology, development of
[SPEAKER_02]: new tools, analytical tools,
pharmacological tools to investigate the
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And more recently, I've become interested
in investigating the expansion of the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system into a larger
chemical signaling system, which we define
[SPEAKER_02]: as the endocannabinoidome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the relationship between the
endocannabinoidome and the microbiome,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is what I do in Quebec City at
Universit√© Laval.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're listening to the Curious About
Cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, this is Jason Wilson with
the Curious About Cannabis podcast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much for tuning in once again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today I am beyond delighted to connect
with somebody I've been wanting to talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: for many years since I started studying
cannabis and cannabinoid science.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with Dr. Vincenzo Di Marzo,
who if you haven't heard of him by the
[SPEAKER_00]: time you finish listening to most of my
podcast episodes, you will definitely have
[SPEAKER_00]: heard of him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks so much, Dr. Di Marzo for being
willing to come on the podcast today and
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to me about cannabinoid science.
[SPEAKER_02]: My pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for inviting me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of my first questions in the
beginning of your book, The
[SPEAKER_00]: Endocannabinoidome, in your dedications,
one thing that you admit is you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: obsession about endocannabinoids and
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my first question to you is,
why are you so obsessed with cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I would say more than cannabinoids,
I'm obsessed with the endogenous
[SPEAKER_02]: counterparts of the cannabinoids,
which are the endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, since the beginning,
when we started investigating this
[SPEAKER_02]: chemical signaling system, we were
intrigued and fascinated by its
[SPEAKER_02]: involvement in basically all physiological
aspects of mammalian life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also understood that,
in fact, this is a system so deeply
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in physiology that becomes also
deeply involved in pathology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seemed to be quite complicated to
study, but then it became even more
[SPEAKER_02]: complicated when we could see that this
system was not as simple as we thought at
[SPEAKER_02]: the beginning, but it was easily to be
expanded into a much bigger signaling
[SPEAKER_02]: systems, which probably we will end up
discovering controls all aspects of human
[SPEAKER_02]: physiology and pathology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other reason why I became so
interested in this system is because there
[SPEAKER_02]: is a lot of space for chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a chemist to start with, and there is
a lot of chemical variability and chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: diversity in not only the cannabis plant,
but also in the endogenous signals that we
[SPEAKER_02]: discovered starting from studies on THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the more we studied it, the more
complicated it looked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I really like complicated things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like things that can explain in a
mechanistic way things from the
[SPEAKER_02]: functioning of signals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like things that can explain in a single
cell up to the behavior of a complex
[SPEAKER_02]: organism like laboratory animals and
humans.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I still think that we've probably done
less than 10% or 15%.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one lifetime will not be enough to
study it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that just gives plenty of work
to the future generations, something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been on my mind a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was emailing Rafael Machulam just a
couple of days ago and asking him about,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, what he hopes that people
take away from the work that himself and
[SPEAKER_00]: you and other people like Roger Pertwee
and others who are really kind of at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning of a lot of the stuff where it
hopes to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were talking a little bit about the
future generations of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists that are coming on board with
new opportunities to study cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: that is much more difficult back through
the 60s, the 90s or so, when we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a lot of this grounding
established.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really exciting time to see what
the future, the subsequent lifetimes
[SPEAKER_00]: unveil that we won't be around to see.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was very lucky to start in this field
when the pioneers of this field like Raffi
[SPEAKER_02]: Machulam and Roger Pertwee and Alin Allit
were really still very, very active in
[SPEAKER_02]: this field.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still active, of course,
but obviously those were the times when
[SPEAKER_02]: they were making themselves the major
discoveries in this field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this also explains my excitement of
being there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been very lucky because when I
think about my involvement in this field,
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought I was in the right place at the
right time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I owe a lot of what we did in my group
to the work of Raffi and Roger and Alin
[SPEAKER_02]: Allit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talking about your start in doing some
of this research, how did you start to get
[SPEAKER_00]: clued into... Obviously you were involved
in foundational research that
[SPEAKER_00]: characterized the concept of the entourage
effect, as well as your paper in 1998 that
[SPEAKER_00]: described for the first time what the
endocannabinoid system does and that sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when did you start to... When did the
idea of the endocannabinoid system start
[SPEAKER_00]: to expand for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: When did you start to think about... It
seems like there was a perceptual shift in
[SPEAKER_00]: how we saw fatty acids and all these other
components of the body once we started
[SPEAKER_00]: studying these cannabinoid receptors and
how the vanilloid receptors are part of
[SPEAKER_00]: all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when did that start to really expand
for you where you realized this is
[SPEAKER_00]: something way bigger than just CB1,
CB2, anandamide, 2AG, all of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, that's a difficult question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously, the realization of the
importance of the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_02]: came, I would say, between, in my case,
at least 1995 and 2000 because at those
[SPEAKER_02]: times, we actually developed analytical
methods to measure the endocannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: anandamide and 2AG in biological fluids
and tissues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were very, very lucky to
collaborate with tens, I would say even
[SPEAKER_02]: probably hundreds of scientists all over
the world who would provide us with
[SPEAKER_02]: samples from patients with various
disorders or from animal models of
[SPEAKER_02]: disorders.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we basically started analyzing tissues
and blood like meds all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we realized that this system was very
easily perturbed by several different,
[SPEAKER_02]: not only pathological conditions,
but also changes in the equilibrium,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the physiological equilibrium,
even physiological changes would change
[SPEAKER_02]: the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I and others came to the conviction
that this system is a pro-meostatic system
[SPEAKER_02]: present in all cells and tissues.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially if you expand the system
beyond CB1 and CB2, you will find
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoids like anandamide and 2AG
in all tissues, in all tissues from,
[SPEAKER_02]: not only from mammals, but also from
higher vertebrates and in some cases also
[SPEAKER_02]: from vertebrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we noticed that we started working also
in some very primitive forms of life like
[SPEAKER_02]: a hydra or some mollusks or echinoderms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we could see that the endocannabinoids
were there even though the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: receptors, as we know, as we knew them,
CB1 and CB2 were not there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wondered why do we make these
molecules?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also realized that the amounts of
these molecules were subject to be altered
[SPEAKER_02]: by the diet and by the intake of some
particular fatty acids in the diet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wondered how come that there is such
an important system and this system can be
[SPEAKER_02]: changed by something as simple as eating
one oil rather than another.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were really intrigued and we thought
that this maybe was really the response of
[SPEAKER_02]: the organism, if not the only one,
but one of the most important responses of
[SPEAKER_02]: the organism to all forms of going far
from the equilibrium, from the
[SPEAKER_02]: homeostasis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this system would be activated to
bring back homeostasis in cells and also
[SPEAKER_02]: at the organism.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we realized that several forms of
stressful conditions would also alter this
[SPEAKER_02]: system in a way that this system could
change the output of other chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: signals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in those years we came to the
hypothesis and it was still a hypothesis
[SPEAKER_02]: that has been since then, I would say,
largely proven that this system is a
[SPEAKER_02]: system made of local chemical signals
because the endocannabinoids cannot really
[SPEAKER_02]: travel from one organ to the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they act where they are produced,
produced and triggered by stressful,
[SPEAKER_02]: even kind of benign forms of stress,
subtle perturbation of the status of the
[SPEAKER_02]: cell, but also environmental stress,
like physical exercise, diet changes in
[SPEAKER_02]: the light and dark cycles in order to
re-tune the output of other chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: signals.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in turn, since this system was present
in different parts of the organism,
[SPEAKER_02]: the system was also itself being
controlled by many other chemical signals.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like we made a comparison it's
like an orchestra, it's like the director
[SPEAKER_02]: of the orchestra, which is also directed
by the musicians of the orchestra.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was quite an intriguing hypothesis
that we're still investigating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, now with the discovery of
the endocannabinoidome, this is becoming
[SPEAKER_02]: more difficult to prove.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for those listening that maybe don't
have such a technical background on
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry, or cannabinoid science,
how would you describe the concept of the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoidome to somebody?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so basically, you know, with the
word ohm, now we make new words containing
[SPEAKER_02]: the prefix, the suffix ohm, to identify a
very large system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the genome, we have the
metabolome, we have the proteome,
[SPEAKER_02]: and so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the endocannabinoidome came in a way
from, you mentioned before the study that
[SPEAKER_02]: Raffi Meshulam, in which we collaborated
on the entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So basically, what Raffi perceived is
that, and what we were measuring,
[SPEAKER_02]: in fact, when we were measuring
endocannabinoids, is that these two
[SPEAKER_02]: molecules, an underminer 2HG, were
accompanied by a plethora of other
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these compounds, these metabolites
were chemically and biochemically similar,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning that an underminer 2HG belongs to
two different families of metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are the N-acyletanolamines and
the monoacylglycerols, some of which were
[SPEAKER_02]: already known, in fact, even one or two
decades, or even longer than that,
[SPEAKER_02]: before the endocannabinoids were
discovered.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nobody knew really how these molecules
were acting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Raffi, in a very imaginative way that
this is really his main feature,
[SPEAKER_02]: his creativity and imagination,
thought, well, these are accompanying
[SPEAKER_02]: molecules that are there to protect,
to make the two big actors look even more
[SPEAKER_02]: important than they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an entourage, or when politicians
go around and they take with them a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: accompanying people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's certainly part of the picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we started realizing that these
compounds, in fact, do have molecules,
[SPEAKER_02]: do have targets of their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the endocannabinoidome, if you wish,
is a kind of evolution of the entourage
[SPEAKER_02]: effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Molecules like the N-acyletanolamines or
the monoacylglycerols started being
[SPEAKER_02]: investigated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Receptors were being found.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this created, of course, excitement,
but also complications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the pharmacologists and the drug
developers, the therapeutic drug
[SPEAKER_02]: developers, were thinking, okay,
we can manipulate the levels of the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Since they are so strongly involved in
pathology, we can manipulate the levels of
[SPEAKER_02]: the endocannabinoids, of anandamide and
2-HG, in order to make more of these
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds where they're needed,
or to reduce the amount where they're
[SPEAKER_02]: produced in an excessive manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can do that by manipulating the
degradation of the biosynthesis of
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when it was found that,
and we found, we and many others,
[SPEAKER_02]: that anandamide has the same biochemical
pathways as other N-acyletanolamines,
[SPEAKER_02]: which have different receptors from the
cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: This created a strong complication.
[SPEAKER_02]: We cannot really manipulate the levels of
anandamide in this way without
[SPEAKER_02]: manipulating the levels of the other
previously known as entourage compounds,
[SPEAKER_02]: but having an identity and the mechanism
of action independent from the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoids of their own.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the endocannabinoidome is basically the
bigger system, including not only
[SPEAKER_02]: anandamide and 2-HG and their main
receptors, which are CB1, CB2,
[SPEAKER_02]: but also some of the other receptors for
anandamide and 2-HG, because these are two
[SPEAKER_02]: very promiscuous molecules, unlike THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one major difference between the
endocannabinoids and the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids, or at least between the
endocannabinoids and THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it was found that, in fact,
even the biosynthesis and degradation of
[SPEAKER_02]: these two compounds could not be only
mediated by one or two enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a redundancy of biosynthetic and
degrading enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes the degrading enzymes were
not degrading enzymes, because they were
[SPEAKER_02]: simply converting anandamide and 2-HG into
molecules which had different receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this may seem strange, but not to
people like me who have investigated
[SPEAKER_02]: bioactive lipids all their life.
[SPEAKER_02]: All bioactive lipids are transformed into
something different and come from
[SPEAKER_02]: something different with a different
biological activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there is the congeners of
anandamide and 2-HG, what we called
[SPEAKER_02]: previously the entourage compounds,
which have their own receptors,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though they share with the
endocannabinoids the same biosynthetical
[SPEAKER_02]: pathways.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then finally, there were other
molecules which have different biochemical
[SPEAKER_02]: pathways as the endocannabinoids,
but are nevertheless, they're not
[SPEAKER_02]: congeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not like cousins.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not like brothers and sisters,
but they're cousins.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have other enacyl amides.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, when we collaborated with the
other groups, we found that in fact,
[SPEAKER_02]: in particular with the group of Michael
Walker, the late Michael Walker,
[SPEAKER_02]: we found that many compounds, many amino
acids could make amides with fatty acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this could create an almost incredible
number of new combinations between the 10
[SPEAKER_02]: or 15 fatty acids and 20 amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just imagine all the permutations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these compounds actually exist as
the group of other brands show as also
[SPEAKER_02]: recently investigated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's really, we're talking now
about a huge number of chemical mediators.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the endocannabinoids, they're
congeners, they're analogs, which may or
[SPEAKER_02]: may not have similar biochemical pathways,
normally have different receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about the several other
targets that anandamide and 2-HG have
[SPEAKER_02]: beyond CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about other enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're talking about something about
more than 250 chemical mediators,
[SPEAKER_02]: more than 50 enzymes and receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these receptors were actually
known previously, like the trip channels
[SPEAKER_02]: or the PPARs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the interesting thing is that,
of course, when the endocannabinoid system
[SPEAKER_02]: became so big, then the next question was,
okay, THC is the only out of 100 and more
[SPEAKER_02]: plant cannabinoid that interacts with the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about maybe if we don't look only at
the endocannabinoid system, but we look at
[SPEAKER_02]: the expanded endocannabinoid system,
at this endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe the other cannabinoids will interact
with the endocannabinoid dome,
[SPEAKER_02]: even though they don't interact with the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is true to a large extent for things
like cannabidiol or cannabigerol,
[SPEAKER_02]: the other minor, not so minor anymore
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, in the case of cannabidiol,
even the endocannabinoid dome is not
[SPEAKER_02]: sufficient to explain its pharmacology
because it has been suggested to interact
[SPEAKER_02]: also with receptors and proteins outside
the endocannabinoid dome, not just outside
[SPEAKER_02]: the endocannabinoid system, but even
outside the endocannabinoid dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think the endocannabinoid dome is a
complex concept, which, however,
[SPEAKER_02]: has the merit of explaining the mechanism
of action of a much higher number of plant
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids than the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's definitely a very tangled web
that you can't... So many things are
[SPEAKER_00]: interconnected that it is tricky to
manipulate one piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw... Was it their research?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't remember what year it was now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was research, I think in France,
where they tried to do, I think it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: FAH inhibitory study and ran into some
problems there, unexpected consequences
[SPEAKER_00]: and things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, even though in that particular case,
the problem was not due to the fact that
[SPEAKER_02]: by inhibiting the degradation of an
undermide, they were also inhibiting the
[SPEAKER_02]: degradation of other fatty acid amides.
[SPEAKER_02]: They basically were hitting with this new
chemical, they were hitting a completely
[SPEAKER_02]: different set of proteins and enzymes for
which there is less redundancy in the
[SPEAKER_02]: brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you get rid of that enzyme,
you have serious problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunately, when you inhibit FAH,
you have much less side effects because as
[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned, for the degradation of the
endocannabinoids, there are many enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a system so strongly and deeply
involved in mammalian and animal
[SPEAKER_02]: physiology that it's not enough to kick
out one of the enzymes of the receptors to
[SPEAKER_02]: see major problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one thing that's come up in several
discussions I've had both with Rafael
[SPEAKER_00]: Machulam and another colleague of yours,
Ethan Russo, was how do we, I guess taking
[SPEAKER_00]: this to a practical level, because what
physicians are interested in is,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, this is all interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see it's connected to all of these
aspects of physiology, but how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: measure it when these compounds are so
kind of ephemeral?
[SPEAKER_00]: They get built when they're needed and
then they get broken down quickly and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know that in the past, there have been
like spinal taps and stuff like that to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to see what endocannabinoids are
circulating at the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you speak at all to the challenges
to trying to characterize the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system or the
endocannabinoid dome in a human being?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're perfectly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a system that undergoes, the levels
of these mediators undergo changes by the
[SPEAKER_02]: hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: As I said, they're affected by whether or
not you eat food or what kind of food you
[SPEAKER_02]: eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like with all the other homes,
the real picture of the system can only be
[SPEAKER_02]: taken at a certain timeframe thanks to the
very sophisticated new machines that have
[SPEAKER_02]: been really have characterized the more
recent years of scientific development.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, the means by which we can
look into the cell, into the biological
[SPEAKER_02]: fluids have become very sophisticated and
very sensitive and very specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can now measure the levels of
anandamide and we can distinguish
[SPEAKER_02]: anandamide, which is a very minor
compound.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, Rafi Meshulam always jokes about
that, that he could only discover
[SPEAKER_02]: anandamide because he was probably using a
pig brain that had been laying in the
[SPEAKER_02]: slaughterhouse for hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this was later shown to be a process
that increases the levels of anandamide in
[SPEAKER_02]: the dishes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at that time, when he discovered
anandamide, there were no mass
[SPEAKER_02]: spectrometers sensitive enough to measure
picomolar or femtomolar amounts of these
[SPEAKER_02]: compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we can distinguish anandamide from its
brother, which has 20 carbon atoms,
[SPEAKER_02]: but only three double bonds instead of
four.
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe that difference is enough for
that compound to hit another receptor
[SPEAKER_02]: rather than just CB1 and CB2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clearly we have these days the
possibility of measuring with high
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitivity, high specificity,
high rapidity as well, these compounds in
[SPEAKER_02]: all tissues.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can measure the expression of the
enzymes that make these compounds even at
[SPEAKER_02]: the single cell level.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can measure the proteins that are made
by the RNA through the RNAs of the various
[SPEAKER_02]: proteins and enzymes and receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can have a real time, almost real
time picture of what's happening in a
[SPEAKER_02]: given tissue or a given biological fluid
in a given animal which is undergoing a
[SPEAKER_02]: physiological or pathological condition.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and then of course, all these data
these days, these are also the days of big
[SPEAKER_02]: data, of artificial intelligence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all this data can be put together.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is the new approaches of the systems
biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the networks can be made sense of.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is a lot of space for
mathematics, not just for analytical
[SPEAKER_02]: chemistry and molecular biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we can have a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the same time, we have very
sophisticated ways to modify, if not one
[SPEAKER_02]: single mediator of the endocannabinidome,
because that would be very difficult.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least one single receptor in a
single cell for those endocannabinidome
[SPEAKER_02]: mediators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by modifying that and then controlling
like in an on and off situation,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can then understand what the
endocannabinidome mediators and the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system is doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been done to a large extent in
the brain because that's where all the
[SPEAKER_02]: research started.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's now being done also in peripheral
organs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is where we really appreciate the
importance of the endocannabinoidome and
[SPEAKER_02]: the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not brain systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really pleiotropic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing a lot of things in a lot of
places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's difficult to understand because,
of course, you have lots of molecules
[SPEAKER_02]: being produced and degraded at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we must imagine that if these
molecules are doing something important
[SPEAKER_02]: and we have evidence that they are,
they must have a way of coordinating
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves and being coordinated by other
mediators, by other systems
[SPEAKER_02]: physiologically and pathologically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And since all of this activity is so
localized, if let's say five, 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: down the road, if some of these analytical
technologies become more accessible to
[SPEAKER_00]: hospitals and things worldwide,
would someone essentially have to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: biopsy on a particular set of tissues or a
particular organ, that sort of thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to get some sense of what's going
on with endocannabinoids or receptors and
[SPEAKER_00]: that sort of thing since they're not being
circulated?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that really the only way to kind of do
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, this is why we still need
the animal studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of the reasons why we've been
working on less invasive and more
[SPEAKER_02]: ethically valid systems like invertebrates
or zebrafish.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, you cannot do
without the animal studies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also because there is genetic
manipulations that you can do only in
[SPEAKER_02]: animals, fortunately, at least for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, we've done lots of studies
with biopsies.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we look at the blood, of course,
we get very interesting information from
[SPEAKER_02]: the blood, from the plasma, from the CSF,
now also from the saliva, from the feces.
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously, we don't really know what
we measure comes from.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, we can make correlations,
we can make hypotheses, but we cannot
[SPEAKER_02]: really have a mechanistic link between
what we see and the pathology or the
[SPEAKER_02]: physiological situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Biopsies offer a better way, but then you
have to be very, of course, you cannot
[SPEAKER_02]: always take biopsies from humans,
certainly not from the prey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been trying to convince students
to do that, but I haven't managed.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you have to be careful even with
biopsies because they need to be taken in
[SPEAKER_02]: the right way, kept and stored in the
right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are less invasive ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is imaging techniques that are
emerging, like PET techniques to image
[SPEAKER_02]: receptors, enzymes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now you see that for the endocannabinoid
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really raising the possibility
of doing studies in vivo, in real time,
[SPEAKER_02]: also in human beings, in human volunteers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see, honestly, no limits.
[SPEAKER_02]: If not the technological limits of the
time, which are probably going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: surpassed tomorrow or the day after
tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing we need is the realization
that this is an important topic to
[SPEAKER_02]: analyze, because when you have hundreds of
mediators coming more or less from the
[SPEAKER_02]: same pathway or having to do with the same
pathway, which originates from the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system, but simply because
that was the one we discovered first.
[SPEAKER_02]: But eating it differently, completely
different targets, then when you realize
[SPEAKER_02]: that this is important, then you will find
a way of addressing the experimental
[SPEAKER_02]: problems and challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a matter of having the right
questions and you can get answers,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least partial answers.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we said at the beginning, a lifetime
would probably not be sufficient to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand what all these mediators are
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how do they interact with each other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the most important things in
the scientific process is finding better
[SPEAKER_00]: questions to ask than you necessarily
started out with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And always having the right hypothesis,
because I'm very much, even though with
[SPEAKER_02]: the omics, you go fishing a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still a believer in the
hypothesis-driven research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nice to have an hypothesis and
then, of course, if you're lucky,
[SPEAKER_02]: you can get an answer to your hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if the answer is negative,
the secret is not getting too attached to
[SPEAKER_02]: your hypothesis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
Exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being more interested in just trying to
understand what's actually going on.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have a focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I wanted to make sure to talk to
you about, because I know it's a focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of your research right now,
which is the connection between the
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid dome and the gut
microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, once again, something that
when I spoke with Ethan, he kind of teased
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of some of the work that's
going on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But can you speak a little bit to... I
mean, obviously, research these days is
[SPEAKER_00]: showing how the gut microbiome,
all the gut flora affects so many
[SPEAKER_00]: different things, and how the immune
system and psychology and all these other
[SPEAKER_00]: things are interconnected with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is your research focusing on,
and what are you currently learning about
[SPEAKER_00]: those connections between the
endocannabinoid dome and the gut
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiome?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is, as I said at the beginning,
I like difficult things.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was given the opportunity four years ago
to start on a new project.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I must say, I was immediately
attracted to it, because the gut
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiome, I saw it a little bit like the
endocannabinoid dome, because it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: really an external part to our body.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that has been selected
through generations, passed on
[SPEAKER_02]: genetically, but not only genetically.
[SPEAKER_02]: From mothers to children.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's there to play an important
function, has been conserved.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not been fought by the immune system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's clearly something that we need,
and all animals that have microbiota need
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ideally, it's a wonderful symbiotic
relationship with the other organ.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is several more cells, microbial
cells in our body than our own eukaryotic
[SPEAKER_02]: cells.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clearly, this offers the opportunity,
if you think of it, of expanding a lot the
[SPEAKER_02]: potentiality of our own body.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is thousands of genes more than the
ones we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of more proteins and more molecules.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, what the gut microbiota
does to help us, first of all,
[SPEAKER_02]: it does it to help itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, in the process, they produce
molecules that can be useful to our own
[SPEAKER_02]: functions by reinforcing our own
molecules, our own signals, but also by
[SPEAKER_02]: creating something that we don't have.
[SPEAKER_02]: The experience of the endocannabinoid dome
told me that you never enough chemical
[SPEAKER_02]: signals to deal with the complexity of
life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And especially when it comes to dealing
with the environment and the environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having a few thousands genes more,
actually quite more than a few thousands
[SPEAKER_02]: more, definitely helped us and many other
animals to survive and to better respond
[SPEAKER_02]: to the changing environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our own bodies itself, an environment for
these microbes who live in completely
[SPEAKER_02]: different conditions, like for us would be
living in the North Pole or on the
[SPEAKER_02]: equator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you start seeing all these papers
on the gut microbiota and the gut
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiome again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, the difference between the world has
to do with the fact that the microbiota
[SPEAKER_02]: are the microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The microbiome is the microbes,
is their genes, is their proteins,
[SPEAKER_02]: is their small molecules, and so on and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bit like the endocannabinoid dome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So beyond the names, what I saw and what
everybody can see is that the gut
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiome is involved, is potentially
involved, not just in controlling the
[SPEAKER_02]: function of our gut, helping us with
metabolizing things, but also in behavior,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the immune system and in most of our
functions.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little bit like the endocannabinoid
system and the endocannabinoid dome,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you think of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it was really... Patrice Caney,
in a nice paper that was published,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, before 2010, who put the two
things together, the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system, the gut microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patrice Caney is a scientist, a brilliant
scientist in Belgium, and he showed that
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the effects of intestinal
dysbiosis, the perturbation of the gut
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiome, because like all things,
like the endocannabinoid system,
[SPEAKER_02]: also the gut microbiome is perturbed,
and the perturbation, known as dysbiosis,
[SPEAKER_02]: produces some of its effects, its negative
effects on metabolism through the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system, through the CB1
receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he was really a pioneer in this field.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that time, I looked at the paper,
it was a very interesting, very nice
[SPEAKER_02]: paper, it published a few more.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I was given the opportunity to
work on a more or less similar subject,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I honestly didn't want to lose the
opportunity also, because it came with
[SPEAKER_02]: very nice funding, which we don't always
have in Italy, we almost never have in
[SPEAKER_02]: Italy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I took this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's very complicated, because I'm
not...
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiologist, and the microbiota is very
complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Although it's not there by chance,
there are rules, but every person has a
[SPEAKER_02]: different microbiota.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, you know, every person has a
different profile of endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: mediator.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, maybe, you know, there are
things that these two systems do together
[SPEAKER_02]: in collaboration, or one to the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there were many, many evidences that
there would be a triangle between the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoidome, the gun microbiome,
and mammalian physiology and pathology.
[SPEAKER_02]: So initially, we were still focusing on
the metabolic, on obesity and metabolic
[SPEAKER_02]: disorders, which are obviously the first
place to look for when you're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about the gun microbiome, but also when
you're talking about the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we're doing now is trying to
prove that these two systems communicate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, there are things that are
relatively easy things that we could do,
[SPEAKER_02]: for example, use animals which don't have
a microbiota at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were raised in sterile conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we went to look at their
endocannabinoid system, their
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoidome, and it's completely
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this could be due to many,
I mean, that doesn't really create a
[SPEAKER_02]: cause-effect relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then when we reinstated the gut
microbiome in these germ-free animals,
[SPEAKER_02]: in these germ-free mice, it took only one
week to see almost, at least in the gut,
[SPEAKER_02]: almost exactly the same situation as the
conventionally raised mice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really the evidence we were
looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the first experiment we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was really the experiment we did to
say, okay, we stop here or we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go farther.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's worth moving forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are other things you can do
like knocking down enzymes of the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoid system specifically in
different parts of the body or in the gut
[SPEAKER_02]: and see if the endocannabinoid system is
modified.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, we find changes, sorry,
if the gut microbiome is modified and we
[SPEAKER_02]: found changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's a complicated field because like
with the endocannabinoidome, almost
[SPEAKER_02]: everything can change the gut microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there is still no exact definition of
what is a healthy or a pathological gut
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiome, exactly like the
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And possibly also many other endogenous
systems that we have.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are many experiments we're doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We find very interesting correlations in
human studies following interventions
[SPEAKER_02]: between changes in the endocannabinoidome
and changes in the gut microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: We find that if we modify the gut
microbiome with probiotics or prebiotics
[SPEAKER_02]: or antibiotics, we see strong changes in
the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're now investigating whether the
changes we see in the endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: system when we modify the gut microbiome
are partly responsible for the effects of
[SPEAKER_02]: the modification.
[SPEAKER_02]: of the gut microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the other way around, we try to see if
when we change the endocannabinoidome in a
[SPEAKER_02]: specific manner, the changes we see in the
gut microbiome participate in the effects
[SPEAKER_02]: of the changes of the endocannabinoidome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can do that using exactly the same
tools we were mentioning before,
[SPEAKER_02]: plus more omics technologies like
metagenomics to investigate the
[SPEAKER_02]: composition of the gut microbiome and the
proteomics to investigate that proteome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And eventually we will have to ask to
mathematicians to look for algorithms that
[SPEAKER_02]: explain the discorrelations we find.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are mechanistic ways to look at
the relationship between these two worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the crosstalk is super interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would imagine, too, going back to
something you mentioned very early on
[SPEAKER_00]: about the diet and that we have certain
requirements to have precursors for
[SPEAKER_00]: different things that our body needs to
either construct the enzymes necessary to
[SPEAKER_00]: build up and break down endocannabinoids
or receptors or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I imagine in just a simple manner,
the microbiome would be involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: influencing how some of those precursor,
those building blocks that we get from our
[SPEAKER_00]: foods are actually made available to the
body to even use for some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: biosynthetic pathways.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is such a large biodiversity in the
gut microbiome that obviously you can
[SPEAKER_02]: imagine these bugs to do a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were discovered because we could see
how some of these microorganisms help us
[SPEAKER_02]: processing stuff that we're not able to
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: What came out after that was that in the
process of processing this, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: complex fibers, which we cannot process
because we don't have the enzyme,
[SPEAKER_02]: this microorganism, this bacteria make
molecules like the short chain fatty acids
[SPEAKER_02]: that are strongly active both on the gut,
but also on the brain because they can
[SPEAKER_02]: travel in the bloodstream and reach the
brain or act on the peripheral nervous
[SPEAKER_02]: system and influence the behavior as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clearly there are many, many
possibilities that the microbiome can
[SPEAKER_02]: modify the endocannabinoidome.
[SPEAKER_02]: The microorganisms make enzymes that are
similar to the enzymes that degrade the
[SPEAKER_02]: endocannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, some of the commensal bacteria,
they also make endocannabinoid-like
[SPEAKER_02]: mediators.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they make compounds, mediators that are
very similar to the sisters and cousins of
[SPEAKER_02]: an undermied and to a gene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were shown to act on the same
receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the chemical differences between these
molecules when they're made by the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbes are not such to prevent them from
interacting with the same receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is really a lot of possibilities
for cross talk.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, as you mentioned,
even though we're perfectly capable of
[SPEAKER_02]: processing most fatty acids, there are
fatty acids that we cannot make like the
[SPEAKER_02]: polyunsaturated omega-3 and omega-6 fatty
acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for that, we rely on the diet and these
fatty acids can change the function of the
[SPEAKER_02]: microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish
oil, for example, we knew already that
[SPEAKER_02]: when you supplement them in the diet,
they can change the endocannabinoidome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we know that they can also change the
gut microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the changes we see in one or
the other are probably due to the fact
[SPEAKER_02]: that they're changing the other rather
than the former, so the latter rather than
[SPEAKER_02]: the former.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is really difficult here is to find
models to study this interaction because
[SPEAKER_02]: we cannot really do it in an in vivo
setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're developing in vitro systems,
for example, the organoids where we can
[SPEAKER_02]: keep pieces of gut alive for several
months.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're now trying to find a way of
inoculating them with gut bacteria without
[SPEAKER_02]: killing them because normally organoids
are grown in antibiotics.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, it's a bit challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at least we can do this in an indirect
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can take the media of the bacteria
and see the effects that they have on the
[SPEAKER_02]: organoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can also do experiments on the
microbiome outside the organism using the
[SPEAKER_02]: so-called simulator of the human
intestinal microbiome ecosystem or SHIME.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have a SHIME in Quebec where we
basically instate a real human microbiome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is several flasks, each of them
mimicking the conditions you find in the
[SPEAKER_02]: stomach, in the duodenum, in the helium.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the colon.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you put the fecal sample of a human
being in this system, after a couple of
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks, the bugs will start populating the
different parts of the SHIME in a way
[SPEAKER_02]: similar to what they do in a human
gastrointestinal system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at that point, when we have this
SHIME, we can give it foods, we can give
[SPEAKER_02]: it fish oil, for example, we can give it
polyphenols, we can give it many,
[SPEAKER_02]: many dietary stuff and see what happens
independently of the host.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can find a way of introducing
the host cells in this SHIME.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is more complicated, but people
are working on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are very strong groups in the
Netherlands who are working in simulating
[SPEAKER_02]: the microbiome and the host interactions
on a chip, for example, or in very small
[SPEAKER_02]: systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once again, technology is just waiting
for us to ask the right questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that is so fascinating to learn
about how that research is done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been something I've wondered for a
while, exactly how you start to piece all
[SPEAKER_00]: of that out, because it is so complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sounds like you and I both share an
interest in complex systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that I definitely like as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like puzzles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of this is very, very
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to be sensitive to your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're creeping over the hour here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got one last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that I think people
misunderstand about the entourage effect
[SPEAKER_00]: is that in the research that was
originally published that you were an
[SPEAKER_00]: author on that first described this effect
is you were looking at 2AG and you noticed
[SPEAKER_00]: that there were these other compounds that
didn't seem to have much activity of their
[SPEAKER_00]: own on these receptors, but when they were
present with 2AG, you got unique effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it fair to say that the concept of the
entourage effect has been a little
[SPEAKER_00]: manipulated in popular culture to sort of
take on a meaning that is different than
[SPEAKER_00]: what was originally intended?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And both Rafi and I wondered sometimes
whether or not the entourage idea had not
[SPEAKER_02]: been kind of misinterpreted or
misunderstood in many cases, because it
[SPEAKER_02]: has been applied to cannabis and to the
pharmacology of cannabis, which is
[SPEAKER_02]: something that for a pharmacologist has
really no meaning, because you cannot
[SPEAKER_02]: speak about the pharmacology of a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can speak of the pharmacology of the
components, of the chemical components of
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even that is quite difficult to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clearly, the entourage effect,
as we conceived, it was
[SPEAKER_02]: born to explain why anandamide and 2AG,
2AG in particular, was accompanied in
[SPEAKER_02]: tissues, in blood, in whatever we analyze
it, by congeners, by other monocyclic
[SPEAKER_02]: cells, which at that time were thought to
have no receptor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there were orphan of receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we wonder why would the cell make 2AG
together with these compounds or
[SPEAKER_02]: anandamide together with its congeners if
these congeners have no biological action?
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be a waste of a biochemical
machinery.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, and he said,
OK, maybe they are doing something to the
[SPEAKER_02]: main actor of the scene.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I thought that something could be to
retard their degradation, because,
[SPEAKER_02]: as I mentioned, both the
N-acyletanolamides and the monocyclic
[SPEAKER_02]: cells can be degraded by the same
enzymatic pathways as anandamide and 2AG.
[SPEAKER_02]: So clearly, they can compete for their
degradation by this enzyme.
[SPEAKER_02]: And through these means, they can enhance
their, they can prolong their lifespan and
[SPEAKER_02]: then enhance their activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is what we found.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is what we demonstrated in that
paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we, you know, the concept went on
forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since for some of these compounds,
it was really difficult at the beginning
[SPEAKER_02]: to find a receptor, we carried out other
different kind of experiment, for example,
[SPEAKER_02]: whether these compounds could act as
allosteric modulators of the receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in fact, we found that one of them,
palmitoyletanolamide, later on we showed
[SPEAKER_02]: would enhance the activity of anandamide
at 3B1 channels.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these were really the early times of
endocannabinoid research.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then many groups, including the group
of Daniele Piumelli and others,
[SPEAKER_02]: showed that, in fact, these congeners were
not inactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had their own receptors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these receptors, in some cases,
did things quite different from the CB1
[SPEAKER_02]: and CB2, and in some cases, things even
opposite.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the entourage effect was kind of
crushed by this idea, because if 2AG acts
[SPEAKER_02]: on CB1, and by acting on CB1, stimulates
food intake, stimulates fat accumulation,
[SPEAKER_02]: and its congener act on another receptor
known as GPI119, which is doing exactly
[SPEAKER_02]: the opposite, there is no more entourage
effect at the organismal level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that was really something to be
interpreted for the particular historical
[SPEAKER_02]: situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's still valid in some
cells, for example, because in all cells,
[SPEAKER_02]: these compounds are produced together with
their congeners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not necessarily the receptor of these
congeners are there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when they're not there, maybe,
and when CB1 and CB2 receptors are there,
[SPEAKER_02]: maybe they're actually acting as entourage
compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: The situation in the plant where it has
been proposed that some terpenoids could
[SPEAKER_02]: enhance the activity of THC or CBD,
or that other phytocannabinoids could
[SPEAKER_02]: enhance the activity of THC, is completely
different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know if there is an entourage
effect in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know whether it explains anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: If there is one.
[SPEAKER_02]: But clearly it's different from what we
did, what we conceived in the 1990s with
[SPEAKER_02]: Rafi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's a really big thing that
a lot of people listening to this are
[SPEAKER_00]: unaware of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly because, I mean, a lot of casual,
you know, lay people that are interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis, a lot of them aren't going to
the original research papers and reading
[SPEAKER_00]: the technical details on how these things
came about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to point out because a lot
of times what I teach is that we now know
[SPEAKER_00]: enough to realize how much we don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of times in the industry,
a lot of claims are made that we know a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more than we actually do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the entourage effect as it has
been used today is something different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's basically stating another potential
truth is that the effect of the sums of
[SPEAKER_02]: the effect, the effect of the single
components together is stronger than the
[SPEAKER_02]: sums of the effects taken along.
[SPEAKER_02]: This could be true, but it's not the
entourage effect that Rafi and I thought
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: The entourage effect is something that
comes together with the main actor and is
[SPEAKER_02]: protecting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a real entourage effect, if you think
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: From being degraded, it's announcing its
activity, its visibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the entourage, the synergistic effect
that you find in some plant preparations,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's probably, I'm not saying it's not
true, but it's different from what we
[SPEAKER_02]: found.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's probably due to different
components acting on different receptors
[SPEAKER_02]: in a synergistic manner rather than in an
additive or counteractive manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way I always describe the entourage
effect, because I'm always kind of a hyper
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical person anyway, but I always say
that the entourage effect was initially
[SPEAKER_00]: conceived to describe an effect that has
components that generally you couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: identify their effects by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in together, they had unique
effects, which is slightly different than
[SPEAKER_00]: this sort of herbalism synergy kind of
concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's really great to clarify.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, before any more hurricanes come your
way and knock us out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's enough for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Off recording, we were talking about how
the storms everywhere are just getting so
[SPEAKER_00]: bad, and we've been struggling to finish
the interview because of thunderstorms
[SPEAKER_00]: coming through.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can put things together,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll edit it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one will know the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Dr. Demarzo, thanks so much for being
willing to spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I took up about 30 minutes more of
your time than we planned.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was not our fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really, really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to be following your work as
things continue for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was nice speaking to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very, very nice questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad our paths could cross.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you mind if in the future I reach
out to you again sometime, maybe next year
[SPEAKER_00]: or so?
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope to be able to tell you something
interesting regarding the interaction with
[SPEAKER_02]: the microbiome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: If something comes up that gets you
excited, feel free to email me because I
[SPEAKER_00]: get, you know, I'm excited about all this
stuff too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks so much for sharing your
insights with our listeners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it easy and have a great rest of your
day and week.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
