[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to show you around the side of
my house here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a blue mat system in this little
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use this greenhouse for a lot of like
kind of test projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole thing starts right here with a
blue mat pressure reducer and then we jump
[SPEAKER_00]: up to this half inch poly tubing and then
that actually kind of snakes along and
[SPEAKER_00]: into this greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It stops at various places and this is
watered with the blue mat, all these mint
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically that water line comes in here
and there's a bunch of veggies in here
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some raised beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These raised beds are all controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come off of this line here and
there's a blue mat here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see that which is connected to a
little header so this water line comes
[SPEAKER_00]: through here into the blue mat,
into this header and then this is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: our manifold beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's that header line.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is connected to four pieces of blue
soak and this is mostly wood chips in
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bunch of potting soil on top but
the main thing is there's wood chips in
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom and they're heavily inoculated
with the Feria rugosa annulata,
[SPEAKER_00]: the garden giant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get a lot of mushroom production out
of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: We probably pulled 30 to 40 pounds of
mushrooms per bed out of this last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways you can still see that water line
coming through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again these are all on blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're slightly buried under some mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see some tape coming up here but
this whole thing is just on autopilot.
[SPEAKER_00]: From here this water line continues on
into the rest of the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just a few things out here right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The waters are mulberry trees and the line
actually snakes all the way around here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see there's that line right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an eight millimeter line.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's connected to all these blue mats.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these tomatoes and mint plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even all these petunias.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all connected to blue mats as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the hibiscus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got some more production oriented
greenhouses across the way over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple of 30 foot greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna show you also the blue mat
classics.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just look like this and these are
what we use for house plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically you just stick this in the soil
and then you put one end of this tube in a
[SPEAKER_00]: bucket of water and it siphons the water
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have your blue mat in there siphoning
water from this bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great for smaller plants or
seedlings, rooting clones, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a line, an additional line that
comes in.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has used this for nursery
production but coming off this line we
[SPEAKER_00]: have more blue mats so I can individually
water five gallon pots in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of our blue mat moisture
sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that reading at?
[SPEAKER_00]: 99, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right where you'd want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just part of the garden space here
at my home in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
