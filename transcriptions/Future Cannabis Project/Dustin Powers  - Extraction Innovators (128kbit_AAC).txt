[SPEAKER_01]: He's One of the biggest Proponents of open
sourcing he's created a huge forum and
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, he's actually a gang leader.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called the good life gang and It's
just a way to Open up different networking
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put on different networking events
and different different cities we've done
[SPEAKER_01]: Extraction mostly extraction but some
cultivation as well and starting move like
[SPEAKER_01]: towards other parts of the yeah,
and like Hemp is becoming a big focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff as well, but it started from
this dude going around And like paying
[SPEAKER_00]: consultants to teach teach him something
and getting the SOP for that specific
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and then and then he just Loaded up
his website is a treasure trove of kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: the history of how people have been
extracting and All these other people just
[SPEAKER_00]: upload there as like, you know,
he was doing he was doing his own
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction he was you know, he was just a
He he was a great market kind of guy Like
[SPEAKER_00]: us and he worked he worked for he worked
at skunk farms for a little while like so
[SPEAKER_00]: there there was a connection there of this
mentality from my gray wolf of Open,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know this dedication open source and
then like Dustin came out of that school
[SPEAKER_00]: of thought is for a little bit of
influence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and he He's actually completely
changed The like you the website that he
[SPEAKER_01]: produced with Is something that now it is
the resource for all all the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: extractors all the big names and also now
Lots of large-scale CBD companies and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know big Chinese China Manufacturers of
equipment are all just getting in there
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean there's advertisement going on
personally, but it's not an advertised
[SPEAKER_01]: website.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's not Taking money off of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just this just treasure trove of
people just talking about ideas unedited
[SPEAKER_01]: unedited and Like sure he catches Plenty
of flack for the things that he puts out
[SPEAKER_01]: and he tries to promote businesses as he
knows that they're legitimate and if
[SPEAKER_01]: things don't work out He has to take the
brunt of those things and by putting
[SPEAKER_01]: himself out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just it's been a noble thing and how
he how he Has given this information to so
[SPEAKER_01]: many people and Like has to take a beating
from time to time Give me something that
[SPEAKER_03]: you came across on that site in the past
month that you forwarded to him We were
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe Delta 10 yeah Delta 10 stuff Delta
10 THC there's now a huge thread regarding
[SPEAKER_01]: that and when we had fun little for a
little layman's background, so So
[SPEAKER_00]: depending specifically Everybody's
different and I'll have their own special
[SPEAKER_00]: ways of effect But depending on where or
how the Different pieces of the molecule
[SPEAKER_00]: are laid out you you know the difference
between THC Delta 9 and THC a is THC a has
[SPEAKER_00]: a carbolic acid molecule on its tail and
the box will group carboxyl group and and
[SPEAKER_01]: Another thing there's Delta 8 THC which
has gotten really popular with the water
[SPEAKER_01]: clear trend and People would you know they
would?
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw a bunch of carbon and some acids and
stuff into their boiling flask and then
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd start distilling it and it's coming
out beautiful water clear they Sent test
[SPEAKER_01]: results there they sent tests in the labs,
and then it's you know like very low
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of Delta 9 THC Eventually we
started they got standards for Delta 8 THC
[SPEAKER_01]: then started quantifying that there's more
THC in this that there is but then there's
[SPEAKER_01]: still a little missing piece that Like
you'd see you know 60 to 70 80 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids and this water clear stuff
that you know is all cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of isomers and stereo
isomers of THC and these are things that
[SPEAKER_01]: happen through through the reactions that
happen through heating and the presence of
[SPEAKER_01]: acids and bases and Given the different
different environmental things or what was
[SPEAKER_01]: sprayed on those those that can actually
be a big indicator in what's happening in
[SPEAKER_01]: the reactions as well, so So there's all
that distillation method where like you
[SPEAKER_00]: put stuff in a pot it boils at different
temperatures and all that well throw a
[SPEAKER_00]: catalyst in that pot that you don't know
is there like you know people spray put
[SPEAKER_00]: sulfur on their plants or people you know
certain things get sprayed on plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: when you Concentrate that thing in a hot
flask under vacuum or fires and fire
[SPEAKER_00]: retardant Yeah, there's a whole bunch of
ways you can do that, but but to go back
[SPEAKER_00]: to Delta 10 Delta 10 is simply an unknown
type of THC that until recently was It is
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's unique Yes in different income in
different ways they affect all three of
[SPEAKER_00]: those can affect a single person
completely You You You You You You
