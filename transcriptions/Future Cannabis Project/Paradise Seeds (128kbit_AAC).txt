[SPEAKER_00]: Future Cannabis Project, welcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Arjun from Paradise Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coming live to you from the
Spannabis Expo in Barcelona, 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who are not aware of who
Paradise Seeds are, well actually we've
[SPEAKER_00]: been here for a little while.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been here for 25 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're actually celebrating our 25th
anniversary this year here at Spannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's a great celebration indeed
because we have entered a few of our
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties in the Spannabis Champions Cup
and we've actually taken second prize with
[SPEAKER_00]: our LA Amnesia last night during the award
ceremony.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really, really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the three varieties that we brought
out together with Tommy Chong and Chong's
[SPEAKER_00]: Choice with the finest seed collection of
Paradise Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brings us now to about 37 different
strains in our catalogue here.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's seven different outer flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got a few CBD rich strains in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a whole big variety of
different things that are nice for
[SPEAKER_00]: different types of growers, indoor and
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There goes a little package that I wanted
to show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's our catalogue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you grab the catalogue here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show me this package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me show you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because we found out yesterday that
there's fake packaging going around as
[SPEAKER_00]: well for Paradise Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now this is of course the evident thing
that happens whenever you're successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: People start copying your stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in Russia actually, these Russian
gangsters, they've copied our seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: the package doesn't even look anything
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very easy to spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing that's on that package is
actually the logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the correct thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the rest, the package is gray and
it's square.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really looks very strange.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the original packaging by
Paradise Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the way it should look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you zoom into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show you the background of it as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The back of it should look like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a little barcode as well,
you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we've got three, five and 10 packs in
our collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll very soon add one and 50 packs to
that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll have a lot more choice in the
number of seeds that you'll find in the
[SPEAKER_00]: packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, so very exciting year for us
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBD strains today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are very, very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today in our portfolio, we have two
strains that are CBD rich, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: also still THC rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means they have a one to one ratio
THC-CBD, which is very interesting from a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicinal perspective, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are currently in the test phase
just before releasing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hopefully we will be releasing very
soon CBD strains that are high in CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But low in THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be between 0.2 up to 0.6% of
THC in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there'll be a high quantity of CBD in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're very close to releasing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So stay tuned for that for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very difficult question,
my man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like asking a child, you know,
a mother, what's their favorite child,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit depending on the weed,
you know, also.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got good sativa, you got bad indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to smoke weed anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's for me a sativa in the morning and an
indica during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll do it the other way around as
well, if it just comes like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just like to smoke and enjoy good
quality weed that is clean weed,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is preferably organically grown,
you know, that is a white ash,
[SPEAKER_00]: that is a pure, nice flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, that is more important than
the indica sativa, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also very fond of hybrids,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hybrids?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you going to tell us about the
background?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, man, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 150 kilograms of white widow,
paradise seeds white widow, being grown in
[SPEAKER_00]: a secret location, obviously, in the north
of Africa, in this case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is actually a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already, but we were really, really
excited to see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, well, it's now the background of our
photo booth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can stand there with our photo
booth and then take a picture,
[SPEAKER_00]: a souvenir picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you say all are the bad packages,
but which is the good one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me show you these packages.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the good package, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there's one other version of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Chong's Choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we bought three varieties to market
last year with Tommy Chong and Chong's
[SPEAKER_00]: Choice and a pure indica, 90% indica with
the blue kush berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did a hybrid with the
Mendocino skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did a very strong sativa with the
LA amnesia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is the one that actually won the
cup last night at the Spanavis Champions
[SPEAKER_00]: Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So come get your Chong's Choice seeds at
Paradise Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: These look a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the package here with obviously with
Tommy Chong on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got a little extra surprise for
everybody buying our seeds right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get a free extra seed celebration seed
from us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the first seed that we actually
ever brought to market 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is because of our celebration,
our anniversary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to give everybody who buys a pack
of our seeds one of these for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is actually one of the most
expensive strains in our catalog that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're giving away now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are a little bit smaller
packages, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see the regular packages are like
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the promo pack is a smaller one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with every big one, you got one small
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a real good deal, I think,
for you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, why don't we do something
extra?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't I give you some of these?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can give away to your
viewers, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do a little raffle.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the people who like the video.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pick three winners and you can get
some Paradise Seeds if you're at all up
[SPEAKER_00]: for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they let you take you back to the
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just pack them in your luggage.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it would be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
