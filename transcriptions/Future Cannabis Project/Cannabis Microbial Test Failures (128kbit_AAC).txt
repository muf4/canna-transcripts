[SPEAKER_00]: There's a fight on this one in terms of
interpretation of what is microbial
[SPEAKER_00]: problems and so microbial is a living
organisms Fungus and bacteria that live on
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface of basically everything now
some of these things are deadly like E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coli So things like E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coli which we test for in cannabis we want
to see none But what we're having problems
[SPEAKER_00]: with is having yeast issues and yeast is
something that is present And it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: present if you're using enzymatics because
enzymatics are using yeast to do the work
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for a lot of people who used
enzymatics it invalidated the cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people like me who use compost
tea It has ability to invalidate your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and so what we're trying to
understand is how does one Take a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: other agricultural industries that use
organic methodologies and find safe
[SPEAKER_00]: working levels for these things and so the
state of California standards are actually
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty good and they're pretty reasonable
and What you have is you had new standards
[SPEAKER_00]: get brought in they call them the Berkeley
standards and those standards are based
[SPEAKER_00]: more on a conceptual purity and what it
does is it basically renders probably 95%
[SPEAKER_00]: of the sun-grown market red-eye of
existence and There's this belief that
[SPEAKER_00]: these this yeast must be it must be
terrible for you But it's on every single
[SPEAKER_00]: piece of organic fruit vegetable Herb that
you buy so you've been consuming tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: it your entire existence with never any
issues and So what you're having is you're
[SPEAKER_00]: having companies that are looking to
generate more testing requirements to
[SPEAKER_00]: benefit the companies versus individuals
trying to create standards that make sense
[SPEAKER_00]: for production models and I think the
California will actually do a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: job with this I think they're going to
take a look at this and realize that you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't put a Zero living tissue count where
there's nothing on the plant from an
[SPEAKER_00]: outside plant grown in the Sun and It
favors an organic model or it favors an
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor model heavily because we can
completely control everything But the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem is does that mean that that's
really real does one need to have
[SPEAKER_00]: Sterility on a product is any of my other
agricultural products sterile No,
[SPEAKER_00]: so the only thing we're talking about
sterility on is cannabis And so it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really hold suit and hold suit that
somebody's going to make money on a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard And I think that that's really
how you have to look at this it's such an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue that When we did the Golden Tarp
this year we changed the microbials to
[SPEAKER_00]: where it reflects the California not the
Berkeley standards And we said listen.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the things that we're going to
work with where numbers that make sense If
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a toxic component like you call I
know it's not allowed but on some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeasts and molds that are prohibiting
organic cultivators from getting their
[SPEAKER_00]: products And it's it's impossible to
concede that that's not healthy product so
[SPEAKER_00]: at the Golden Tarp what we did is we
changed the requirements So that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: able to really focus on that sungrown
sector and once we start to have some
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals who can interpret Organic
methodologies correctly and explain it to
[SPEAKER_00]: the people who are regulating cannabis
correctly when we'll have this settled But
[SPEAKER_00]: in the meantime, it's pretty difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've done You know here at the
nursery was I went through a tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: number of plants that are really tough
They let me grow them dry, which means no
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal sprays no composty sprays,
and I really love using compost He's on
[SPEAKER_00]: plants because it just really boosts up
the health of the plant overall But
[SPEAKER_00]: because of some of these standards I
dropped it way back I pulled out certain
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars out of the library that I know
just come up hotter and It's because if
[SPEAKER_00]: the if the Berkeley standard is used it
baked it almost it wipes out the you know
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire crop and so these things just
don't make any sense because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: reflect reality and That has to be
addressed and I think that the California
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators will and I think that They'll
do a pretty good job I don't see the
[SPEAKER_00]: situation like of the states in the same
way where they want to favor a buffered
[SPEAKER_00]: into a model because California has
electrical problems that are just out of
[SPEAKER_00]: control meaning no grid capacity and Who
if in on anywhere in the world if you
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't grow it outside?
[SPEAKER_00]: California I mean if you can't grow it
here where you're gonna grow so you have
[SPEAKER_00]: this incredible opportunity to grow
efficiently effectively agriculturally
[SPEAKER_00]: soundly Once we start to reign in the
requirements for testing Do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think that?
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be a good idea for some of these
people who are using compost sprays and
[SPEAKER_01]: such to wash their cannabis would that
improve their ability to pass some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these testing standards and then of course
Keep super clean trim environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know I mean a lot of your a lot
of your A lot of your yeast and mold is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of the dirt so basically you
can keep the dust down at your property
[SPEAKER_00]: that helps a lot and The Oh in terms of
washing washing yeah washing possibility
[SPEAKER_00]: of washing not with water With with the
hydrogen peroxide solution we can use an
[SPEAKER_00]: h2o2 solution And it's basically going to
be like a it's gonna peel some of that
[SPEAKER_00]: surface fungal off and it can take plants
that wouldn't have passed to make them
[SPEAKER_00]: pass But the idea that you're and and
wetting cannabis before you harvest it
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's good to clean It off a lot of
times, but they have to harvest an entire
[SPEAKER_00]: entire crop and wash every flower It's
just the amount of washing you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: here is ungodly and I'm like, wait a
minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's it's for people The strategy
that we've explained this year a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people was let's get into cultivars that
don't require the buffer Let's get into
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars that don't require a lot of the
microbial assisters meaning things that
[SPEAKER_00]: you would add to help you work with
pathogenic pressure and so It limited the
[SPEAKER_00]: number of choices in the library to be
used for the cultivators that understood
[SPEAKER_00]: what they were doing They found stuff that
didn't need any assistance and I did the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing Now I had one plant that I ran
as a test and it came up too hot for
[SPEAKER_00]: Berkeley So it would be able to move under
the California but not the Berkeley
[SPEAKER_00]: standards and so that's one that depending
on if you're trying to push it through a
[SPEAKER_00]: store that uses the Berkeley then it would
invalidate it so I have to be able to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of catalog what does what when and where
And then it lets me know can you use the
[SPEAKER_00]: tool appropriately?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so once we get this reined in
reasonably it'll open up a tremendous
[SPEAKER_00]: number of cultivars again for usage and it
will allow us to really get these
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically driven systems up to spec to
where they belong because you have to have
[SPEAKER_00]: the biology on the surface epidurally and
in the root zone and if you can do this it
[SPEAKER_00]: works in concert to a degree that's
unbelievable and That just has to be seen
[SPEAKER_00]: as not harmful an organically driven Apple
Is pretty healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see why I'm so afraid of it and
then with cannabis it should be the same
[SPEAKER_00]: But because it's cannabis it's looked at
as something very different And so
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis being the single most
agriculturally regulated product in human
[SPEAKER_00]: history Who knows but what we know is that
I think California is going to really look
[SPEAKER_00]: at these standards and reign them into
Reality because they don't make any sense
[SPEAKER_01]: right now So you think that the not just
the Berkeley standards, but the California
[SPEAKER_00]: standards need to be adjusted California's
actually Not too bad California is not too
[SPEAKER_00]: bad where they're saying in chloroforms on
E.
[SPEAKER_00]: Coli's all these things that you do not
want to have in your products zero But
[SPEAKER_00]: then on yeast and molds it's an allowable
and I want to say it comes up to like
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe four to five percent of the total
weight by volume you know total weight of
[SPEAKER_00]: the product can't exceed this so much and
count and These are standards used from
[SPEAKER_00]: other organic I say certification
industries or agencies for food production
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're taking data from where?
[SPEAKER_00]: See that's the problem with a lot of
cannabis has never been any studies on it
[SPEAKER_00]: in a way that lets us use any kind of
pesticides so the FDA EPA none of these
[SPEAKER_00]: people will certify anything so nothing
could ever be tested or used and determine
[SPEAKER_00]: hey this is something that used here this
way is a Safe for human consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really have any of that
assistance and so the problem with a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of this is trying to take information from
one industry interpret it and apply it to
[SPEAKER_00]: another and Depending on who's teaching
you this information are they trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: teach you are they trying?
[SPEAKER_00]: To push an agenda and I just think that
the state of California's numbers really
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't too bad and that with a little bit
of adjustment into reality It'll be an
[SPEAKER_01]: accurate system and a safe one So if a
farmer has cannabis that does test
[SPEAKER_01]: positive for mold or mildew or yeast What
are their options?
[SPEAKER_00]: Concentrate yeah, you can go concentrate
the crude Distillates things that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do an extract down where you can
peel a lot of that out I mean if it's too
[SPEAKER_00]: covered in mold no, but If it's if it's
just yeast and mold and stuff yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can blow it and that those will come
out in the extraction process
You You You You You
