[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachian, it's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sam, we're going to start with you
because you had some thoughts on
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachian and you're growing a native
soil in Lake County.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you could have the Lake County
Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's talk Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess, first of all, some of you guys
have probably heard me talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been on a lot of panels with Frenchy
and, you know, Justin and a few other
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my main things about Appalachians
is like, if you look at the French system
[SPEAKER_01]: and you look at United States system,
the French system is about an insane
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's also, you know, it attempts to
tell the consumer what is a good product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's about cultural preservation on
methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that methodology is kind of hindered
on zero change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the marketplace, it's reasoning is
to attempt to tell the consumer what is
[SPEAKER_01]: good and what is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: The United States system is kind of goes
along with, you know, in the United States
[SPEAKER_01]: culture and laissez-faire capitalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it lets the consumer decide what is
good quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that comes, you know,
a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you have a lot of people
saying, hey, we want like a French system
[SPEAKER_01]: for cultural preservation, yet we want to
call our, we want to say that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: terroir and we're, you know, we're rocking
in, in, you know, happy frog soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, those things are autonomous to
what terroir is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd argue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then with, with the United States
great, you know, with the great
[SPEAKER_01]: viticulture areas, that if you use
Roundup, you can't claim an app.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't, you shouldn't be able to claim
an Appalachian or a terroir because
[SPEAKER_01]: Roundup kills the microbiome of the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, I, I'm not saying the
United States system is perfect or better
[SPEAKER_01]: or, or, you know, but I also don't think
that what a lot of these, a lot of people
[SPEAKER_01]: are trying to instill in the California
Appalachian system for, for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they want to say, oh,
well, you know, we've, we've worked with
[SPEAKER_01]: the soil for 20 years and it's
regenerative and such.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, yeah, but it's still not
native soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still not native soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I might might kind of to thesis
points of California cannabis Appalachians
[SPEAKER_01]: are 100% native soil, less than 2% by
volume inputs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've written comments to CFA about
this when they were just doing their,
[SPEAKER_01]: their thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also that there can be no,
no covering between you and you and the
[SPEAKER_01]: sun, if you actually want to be,
to actually declare yourself an
[SPEAKER_01]: Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, another thing is like,
I just don't think that unfortunately
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers care about it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to matter in 10 or 20 years for
sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now there's such a select few
people that actually care about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume Frenchie would agree with what
you just said, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does he disagree with any of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I always feel like his, when his,
you know, veins start popping,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's when people are calling something
Appalachian that isn't what the French
[SPEAKER_00]: definition of Appalachian is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I guess he's like, well,
they're, they're sort of, it's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, I think a little bit more on like,
you have to, um, they want to have extreme
[SPEAKER_01]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, sorry, who, who, who's they the
French?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, no, there's, there's people in the
cannabis community that they want to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, you can't grow long Valley Cush
outside of Laytonville and call it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and call it, uh, you know,
the, and use that destination of the name
[SPEAKER_01]: or, you know, they want to use different
strain, uh, uh, issues like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's also a lot of folks,
I mean, I've argued with someone in San
[SPEAKER_01]: Francisco about how their different
warehouses of indoor had different
[SPEAKER_01]: appellations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like someone legitimately tried to argue
that point to me because of, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was just kind of like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so there's just a lot of folks
that I think the biggest one to me that
[SPEAKER_01]: most of the cannabis, where I differ than
most of the cannabis community is soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you can't, I don't think you'd be
able to use any import soil whatsoever and
[SPEAKER_01]: still call yourself an appellation or,
you know, or even necessarily designate a
[SPEAKER_01]: county of origin without having native
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also has to be in the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: The terroir also encompasses so much more
than just the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also encompasses the people and the
culture and the practices of the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that are cultivating it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that often gets lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not taking away anything from what
you're saying, but if you want to get down
[SPEAKER_02]: to like the argument about like the,
the warehouses in San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a culture behind that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a culture in that there are people
behind that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they definitely influence because plug
and play and take some growers from
[SPEAKER_02]: Sacramento and put them into the same
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to change the outcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are arguments to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's one of the most important
aspects of, of an Appalachia or terroir is
[SPEAKER_02]: the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the relationship between the people
that are cultivating and the plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: helps to define, to define.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not talking about land race here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not talking about plants in the
wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about plants that,
that, that, that under a, under a,
under a, under a,
[SPEAKER_02]: under a, under a terroir.
So that's one of the most important
aspects of the terroir.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you want to go back to the French
definition, Appalachia, one of my issues
[SPEAKER_02]: with them is a lot of that stuff was said
in the 1700s, they're like, okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're in this section of soil now
you're a grand crew.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're over here, you're such and
such.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that takes away from the terroir of
the people that are building the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I, when I got my property,
it was all clay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I built huge, huge buildings.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did permaculture practices, I did chop
and drop, and I turned a lot of my clay
[SPEAKER_02]: into loam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so is it native soil?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's natively built soil, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I can do that in five years,
how is it that in 300 years, everybody who
[SPEAKER_02]: was still grand crew back then is a grand
crew right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of a map that was defined way back
then.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something I don't want to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because who developed those maps?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like the large landowners,
the kings and the queens, oligarchy of
[SPEAKER_01]: that time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess the one thing that I'd say we
disagree on is the fact that the culture
[SPEAKER_01]: side of it of people, you can either
classify terroir through science,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you can classify it through a cultural
aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that in order to
designate your own AVA in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States, you have to prove scientifically
that the climate and the soil and
[SPEAKER_01]: everything around it leads to a different
outcome in the end product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the issues with the cultural
side of it is that, yeah, there's
[SPEAKER_01]: methodologies of such that could lead you
to a different outcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you take a person out of it and
it's not replicatable in the same place,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it wouldn't really have terroir in
that location.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's just an entire humanistic aspect
of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that you can break down the
culture to a scientific level.
[SPEAKER_02]: The methodology and the practices of the
people that are working has a very
[SPEAKER_02]: scientifically describable and measurable
effect and impact on the plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I could see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think back to your statement earlier
about soil building, that's a very
[SPEAKER_01]: different level of soil building than,
say, adding 10% perlite to your native
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's my problem that I have.
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 years ago, we got a truckload of
ancient forest, and that's what we started
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's a very different thing than
actually going through bio-dynamic
[SPEAKER_01]: methodologies on your own property with
everything from your property.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very different aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one thing about, for instance,
I guess, Mike, we were talking a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier about just the regulatory burden
and the regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I don't like about what a lot of
people in the cannabis industry are
[SPEAKER_01]: advocating for with Appalachians is
essentially a whole entire other
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory framework that you have to
operate within to try to get some market
[SPEAKER_01]: viability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is where I'm kind of like,
wait, I got to do all these set of rules
[SPEAKER_01]: and all these set of rules, and now I'm
supposed to do all those set of rules that
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't necessarily agree with all of
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a hard sell for me when
people are asking for an extremely high
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory burden just to claim an
Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to get the organic
certification and the Appalachian
[SPEAKER_00]: designation, you got a lot of regulatory
hurdles to jump through.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the record, I'm doing both of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do both of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to go through the hoops to do
it because I believe in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, I hope that it's not
so cumbersome that it makes it a really
[SPEAKER_01]: hard business decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope it's an easier business decision
and an easier sell to my partners.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think one thing that's really important
not to get lost here in this part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: conversation is the fact that regulation
is actually leading to the death of
[SPEAKER_02]: Appalachians that had already existed
before there was any ABA or any board to
[SPEAKER_02]: dictate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm seeing that right here in Santa
Cruz County.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the traditional growing areas where
the culture has existed, where the blue
[SPEAKER_02]: dream has come from, where all these other
old blixer holy weed and a lot of other
[SPEAKER_02]: old strains were founded and based are
being eradicated by conditioners permits
[SPEAKER_02]: and zoning regulations that don't align
with health and safety or cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to do with other agendas.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's the silent killer of the
existing Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can only speak firsthand about Santa
Cruz County because that's where I live.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hate to keep bringing it back to
Santa Cruz County, but that's my frame of
[SPEAKER_02]: reference.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that there's growers in
Calaveras and growers in Nevada County and
[SPEAKER_02]: Yuba who are all experiencing different
forms of barriers and they have the
[SPEAKER_02]: tragedy, the tragedy for us to lose these
heritage terroirs to things like F1
[SPEAKER_02]: permits.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whatever you call them, the tragedy is
losing them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, gentlemen, on that, we just passed
420.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got a five year old who I promised to go
rollerblading with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will wrap on the Appalachian
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate your time and your stories
and have a great weekend.
