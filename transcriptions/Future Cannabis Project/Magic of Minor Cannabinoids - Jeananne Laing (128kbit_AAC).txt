[SPEAKER_03]: What I'm gonna do is hopefully inspire you
to start experimenting with the minor
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids Because we don't know what we
don't know And there's so much to learn
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's so much Combinations we talk
about the entourage effect right and we
[SPEAKER_03]: always think about the entourage effect as
THC and the terpenes or CBD and the
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes or THC and CBD and the terpenes
But that's just a tiny tiny little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's over a hundred Probably a lot more
than that right now, but I'll stick with a
[SPEAKER_03]: hundred Cannabinoids that have been
identified so far in the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_03]: the one thing I'd like to Because I'm a
herbalist at heart and all plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like to play favorites,
but currently this part of my career I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: playing a favorite, but I like to think of
cannabis as the gateway herb because It's
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant that has been studied the most
for its medicinal properties Honestly,
[SPEAKER_03]: no other plant has been studied as much as
cannabis has Now a lot of that studying
[SPEAKER_03]: the clinical studies that happen through
the 80s and the 90s in the early 2000s The
[SPEAKER_03]: only way in North America that you could
legally study cannabis was to prove how
[SPEAKER_03]: dangerous it was So all of these clinical
studies happened to try and prove how
[SPEAKER_03]: dangerous cannabis was And it wasn't and
so all of that studies are sitting on a
[SPEAKER_03]: shelf somewhere Which is kind of fun to
think about but during all those studies
[SPEAKER_03]: People were going like wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't dangerous at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at this guy's he doesn't have so much
pain This person doesn't have so much
[SPEAKER_03]: nausea.
[SPEAKER_03]: This guy's not so anxious anymore,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're starting to get these little
hints at like wait a minute Somebody's
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to pull the wool over our eyes
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So We all know that cannabinoids just a
little review cannabinoids in the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: itself are in an acidic form so THC a
tetrahydrocannabinol Sorry
[SPEAKER_03]: tetrahydrocannabidolic acid Cannabidot
cannabidiolic acid I make my students
[SPEAKER_03]: learn how to say all these But even before
we get to the THC in the CBD we have
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabigerol CBG Actually, we have
cannabigerolic acid CBG a That's the mama
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid or in not so folksy terms a
little more Scientific terms you could
[SPEAKER_03]: call it the stem cell or the the original
cannabinoid as the plant starts to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: and Just as those flowers are starting to
take form We have cannabigerol very
[SPEAKER_03]: briefly shows up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cannabigerolic acid very briefly shows
up and then the CBG CBG a technically will
[SPEAKER_03]: Morph if you will through the work of
enzymes into whatever the genetics of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant are so if it's a high THC plant That
THC starts out as CBG a right if it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: high CBD a plant that CBD first at one
point was CBG so We could harvest those
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers early Really early, but if you're
a grower, you're going like don't harvest
[SPEAKER_03]: it at the wrong time But we could also
create genetics that Manipulates the
[SPEAKER_03]: enzymes so that those enzymes stop the CBD
For morphing into something else.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we can have high CBG plants,
right and With that CBG Wow, is that ever
[SPEAKER_03]: a great cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have our our raw cannabinoids The
acidic form and then we have what's been
[SPEAKER_03]: called up until recently the Activated
form so THC CBD and you get your activated
[SPEAKER_03]: form by heating up the cannabis And that
knocks off Chemically knocks off the
[SPEAKER_03]: acidic molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then we're left with what has up until
now be called activated But we're starting
[SPEAKER_03]: to understand that CBD a is pretty darn
special THC a is pretty darn special.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have to heat our plants up but
what we can do is we can start to have
[SPEAKER_03]: combinations of acidic and heat it acidic
and activated together I will start to see
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna give you a few stats here of how
Some of the things that we're starting to
[SPEAKER_03]: learn about the acidic form of plants Plus
some of those minor cannabinoids and if
[SPEAKER_03]: you're a breeder a cultivator and you like
to play around with genetics See if you
[SPEAKER_03]: can start playing around like read up on I
don't know how to I don't know how to tell
[SPEAKER_03]: you how to do that I'm not a grower but
see if you start playing around with some
[SPEAKER_03]: of those minor cannabinoids and Move them
up so that we can get other strains I know
[SPEAKER_03]: there is a there's a little bit of CBG
starting to show up in the retail market
[SPEAKER_03]: and there's a little bit of CBC kind of by
chromine starting to show up, but I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about that one in a minute So phyto
cannabinoids we have four types of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you guys knew that we have
phyto cannabinoids from the plant We have
[SPEAKER_03]: endo cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the cannabinoids that our body
makes we have synthetic cannabinoids That
[SPEAKER_03]: was the only thing that you could legally
study in the United States for decades
[SPEAKER_03]: synthetic cannabinoids They're made in the
lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: They mimic the ones that we find in the
plant however, they're super potent and so
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the studies that we have about THC
especially from the 80s and 90s that
[SPEAKER_03]: research was done with synthetic
cannabinoids which is can be dangerous
[SPEAKER_03]: because it is so Concentrated and so if
you see a study that says THC is dangerous
[SPEAKER_03]: it caused psychotic breaks It might have
even caused death.
[SPEAKER_03]: It could have caused high anxiety Not that
the plant THC doesn't do some of those
[SPEAKER_03]: things doesn't cause death But it can do
induce and anxiety and those kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: things but look at the study go dig into
the study and if it if the Material that
[SPEAKER_03]: they were using was HU 2 1 2 that's
synthetic THC, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have to look into the study and see
what kind of THC were they using was it
[SPEAKER_03]: from a plant or was it from a laboratory?
[SPEAKER_03]: now we have a new kind of Cannabinoid
that's going to be coming out on the
[SPEAKER_03]: market if it's not out already probably
start out in California So where they're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing some research and it's called
biosynthetic cannabinoids Biosynthetic
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids are grown in the same way
that probiotics are grown You know the
[SPEAKER_03]: probiotics that you buy at your health
food store.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're grown usually on yeast and then
Once they're grown the the yeast is
[SPEAKER_03]: extracted.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're just left with the probiotics So
there are companies that are starting to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow biosynthetic cannabinoids Don't feel
threatened if you're a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's room for it all but one of the
things about the biosynthetic is It's not
[SPEAKER_03]: in a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a little bit more natural,
but we're going to be able to target those
[SPEAKER_03]: really teeny tiny Cannabinoids well not
that the cannabinoids are teeny tiny,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're in teeny tiny amounts and That
would be really hard to change your
[SPEAKER_03]: genetics of your plants It would take a
long time to change your genetics or your
[SPEAKER_03]: plants to kind of bump up some of those
really minor cannabinoids So let's watch
[SPEAKER_03]: for those coming in through the
biosynthetic growers It's it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: industrial, but I think it will have a
place But we can also start looking for
[SPEAKER_03]: those and maybe combine them with our
plant cannabinoids right so that so all of
[SPEAKER_03]: a sudden the possibilities of Combination
of products out there just becomes
[SPEAKER_03]: infinite, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: What else did I want to say I've got my
notes here just so I don't forget One
[SPEAKER_03]: other thing I want to go back to phyto
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the cannabinoids phyto means just of a
plant So our phyto cannabinoids we have
[SPEAKER_03]: never looked at our other plant medicine
to see if our plant medicine contains
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids We know about four or five of
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So echinacea a great immunity herb does
have cannabinoid like activity Spelanthes
[SPEAKER_03]: which is great for mouth health Heliscaran
liver wart and there's a few more out
[SPEAKER_03]: there But remember what I said a few
minutes ago about cannabis is kind of the
[SPEAKER_03]: gateway herb It's because all of a sudden
is like hey if this plant this cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: plant has all of these cannabinoids What
about all of the other?
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal plants that we've been using for
centuries for millennia What how are how
[SPEAKER_03]: do they actually work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they work with this endocannabinoid
system that we have in our body?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably, but we've never looked for it
before so that's pretty exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's gonna spur on a lot of really
good research Okay Chemical definition of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis is it belongs to the turpenoid
family So all cannabinoids are terpenes,
[SPEAKER_03]: but not all terpenes are cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so it's just as the Cannabinoids are
a subclass of the turpenoid family And so
[SPEAKER_03]: that's why they're pretty close together.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we tell if something's a terpene or
cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still a little bit up for debate But
it seems to be how it interacts with our
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid system just how it
interacts with our body and Things change
[SPEAKER_03]: even in the five years that I've been
studying things have changed Karyophylline
[SPEAKER_03]: or karyophylline, however, you want to say
that there's still a debate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that a terpene or is that a cannabinoid
because it does kind of interact with the
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid system doesn't so we may
see Karyophylline may get reclassified as
[SPEAKER_03]: a cannabinoid just like Pluto.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it a planet not a planet, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all we're just still trying to
figure all that stuff out Okay,
[SPEAKER_03]: so If a cannabinoid is a part of the
terpene family That's kind of the chemical
[SPEAKER_03]: makeup.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what about what's a medicinal
definition of a cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_03]: What makes a cannabinoid medicinal?
[SPEAKER_03]: That means it right now it interacts with
the CB1 and CB2 receptors and or CB2
[SPEAKER_03]: receptors within the body So it interacts
with our endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in early days We've only known about
the endocannabinoid system in our body
[SPEAKER_03]: since the 90s late 80s the 90s not very
long But we're learning that there's the
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid system isn't just this
individual system within the body that has
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid receptor 1 and cannabinoid
receptor 2 so aptly names That these
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids interact with all of the
different receptors within our body and
[SPEAKER_03]: within our brain So there's so much we
need to learn and how we I guarantee that
[SPEAKER_03]: the definition of the endocannabinoid
system ten years from now will be quite
[SPEAKER_03]: different than what it is today because
we're just learning things so one thing we
[SPEAKER_03]: got to do as cannabis people is we have to
be willing to to allow our minds to be
[SPEAKER_03]: changed because the definitions are going
to change we're just like think about You
[SPEAKER_03]: know when they first started realizing
that the earth didn't rotate around the
[SPEAKER_03]: Sun right those kinds of things or That
you know some of the early knowledge that
[SPEAKER_03]: we now know as fact.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where we are right now So a hundred
years from now they're gonna look back on
[SPEAKER_03]: this time era and go like oh, that's what
they thought About cannabis like oh they
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't know anything did they right,
but we're here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're now and we're laying the groundwork
for future generations Okay, so when the
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoids or when cannabinoids of
any kind whether it's supplemental
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids or ones that our body makes
ourselves interacts with the different
[SPEAKER_03]: receptors we get a physiological response
in the body, so you can think of You know
[SPEAKER_03]: sometimes THC might make you really
sleepy, so it's sedative and in some cases
[SPEAKER_03]: depending on what doctor you talk to and
What response you're looking for that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sedation could be a side effect or it
could be the desired effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you're taking it So again if
somebody says you know this is a side
[SPEAKER_03]: effect of using cannabis it says well
Sedation is only a side effect if you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want to be asleep at that time But
sedation is a desired effect if that's why
[SPEAKER_03]: you're using The cannabis medicinally is
to help you sleep right so we always have
[SPEAKER_03]: to put everything in context Okay time
here Let's start go back to cannabigerolic
[SPEAKER_03]: acid or cannabigerol CBG I said a few
minutes ago That's the first cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: very briefly in the growing cannabis plant
just as the flowers are just starting to
[SPEAKER_03]: form so long before they're mature You're
gonna get cannabigerolic acid which is
[SPEAKER_03]: going to come in the mama cannabinoid
c-a-n-n-a-b-i-g-e-r-o-l and Then if you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to go the acid one.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's put an IC on the end and then acid
yeah So we know that in clinical studies
[SPEAKER_03]: CBG helps increase the appetite Which is
great unless you're sitting there eating a
[SPEAKER_03]: bag Of Doritos and you can't stop till you
get to the bottom But when we're looking
[SPEAKER_03]: at medicinally there's a lot of health
issues out there where people are so
[SPEAKER_03]: nauseous or they're so weak that they
can't get nourishing food into their body
[SPEAKER_03]: and so what these studies have shown in
people with HIV AIDS or Cancer situations
[SPEAKER_03]: or other issues where the body becomes
really depleted and it becomes This
[SPEAKER_03]: vicious cycle because they don't have the
strength to eat, but without eating they
[SPEAKER_03]: can't gain strength and heal So if we have
some agents that can help people to eat
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they can help they have at least a
chance of their body healing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So cannabigerolic acid and cannabigerol so
both the activated and the raw form We got
[SPEAKER_03]: to find a better word than activated
because they're both active in the body.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for now, we'll use that There's a lot
of clinical studies That show
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabigerolic acid and cannabigerol CBG
help increase appetite Now if you look at
[SPEAKER_03]: studies down in the states where they
don't have socialized health care people
[SPEAKER_03]: pay for being in hospital those studies
actually show Less hospital costs.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's an outcome of the study We think of
like who cares about the hospital costs
[SPEAKER_03]: like we we help each other here in Canada,
right with with our taxes You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe I don't need to go to the hospital,
but maybe somebody else does and I'm happy
[SPEAKER_03]: that It's there for them, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So Down in the States, you'll see some of
these some of these Clinical studies come
[SPEAKER_03]: in with like much reduced hospital costs,
which is really great for them But also we
[SPEAKER_03]: can increase food intake and therefore
increase weight I have a Just a little
[SPEAKER_03]: case study of a client that I had a few
years ago a young fellow he was Probably
[SPEAKER_03]: mid teens at the time And for a whole
school year, he hadn't been eating because
[SPEAKER_03]: he was so nauseous and a few years earlier
His older brother had had a lot of health
[SPEAKER_03]: issues So this young fellow didn't want to
bother his parents with his nausea and
[SPEAKER_03]: vomiting and not and not being able to eat
so he He basically was trying to ride it
[SPEAKER_03]: out for himself for a whole school year he
kept losing weight and losing weight and
[SPEAKER_03]: losing weight to the point where He had to
tell his parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he went to his parents course first
thing parents did take him to emergency
[SPEAKER_03]: And and get him checked out And then the
second thing that they did was call up me
[SPEAKER_03]: and say he had found a street pot To help
him with his appetite and it was hit and
[SPEAKER_03]: miss because you know when we used to buy
it in parking lot at 7-eleven You never
[SPEAKER_03]: really knew what you were getting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes his little baggie work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it didn't to help him stimulate
His appetite so he What I did and this is
[SPEAKER_03]: this is you guys use this if somebody
says, you know I have a friend of a friend
[SPEAKER_03]: needs to stimulate appetite take three or
four flower Different flowers and bring it
[SPEAKER_03]: to the person and let them smell it See,
which one do you think is gonna stimulate
[SPEAKER_03]: your appetite?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you what stimulates my
appetite, but what stimulates your
[SPEAKER_03]: appetite might be completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let them choose so we did that we got
him set up with a dry herb vaporizer and
[SPEAKER_03]: Became part of the family dinner is that
he would sit down and use his dry herb
[SPEAKER_03]: vaporizer I have a few hits on that get
his appetite and the family would have
[SPEAKER_03]: their meal together as it turned out he
had a tumor on his adrenal on one of his
[SPEAKER_03]: adrenals and It was cancerous and it was
it was causing You know whatever the it
[SPEAKER_03]: was killing the appetite basically Causing
nausea.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he wasn't he wasn't didn't get hungry
at all But he had lost so much weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had left it too long that the doctor
said this is major surgery You need to put
[SPEAKER_03]: on 40 pounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a tall kid You need to put on 40
pounds before you can withstand the
[SPEAKER_03]: surgery and So through the help of our
plant friend, he was able to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They gave him three months You know three
months you need put on 40 pounds Imagine
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to put on 40 pounds in three months
Crazy, right, but he did it through the
[SPEAKER_03]: help of cannabis And just finding the
right strain for himself So he had the
[SPEAKER_03]: surgery happy to say he's mid 20s at this
point out working having a great time love
[SPEAKER_03]: and life So yay to cannabis saved another
one Okay, I got sidetracked back to CBG
[SPEAKER_03]: CBG also enhances the actions of the other
cannabinoids so if we're taking it with
[SPEAKER_03]: You know THC or CBD some of the major
cannabinoid or two major cannabinoids if
[SPEAKER_03]: you will if we add a little CBG in there,
you may get a better effect From your THC
[SPEAKER_03]: and CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's another reason to kind of
experiment with adding your chemical acid
[SPEAKER_03]: or chemical in there Here's a super
interesting one they've done some
[SPEAKER_03]: experiment with children With autistic
spectrum, especially nonverbal and I've
[SPEAKER_03]: got some I am gonna give you a few stats
here They used a one-to-one so half CBG a
[SPEAKER_03]: acidic form half CBG activated form The
range is pretty pretty big range.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from 2 to 20 milligrams a day,
which in the grand scheme of things isn't
[SPEAKER_03]: that much I'm not sure what form it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think probably a liquid form and some of
the nonverbal Actually, we're able to
[SPEAKER_03]: start to make some noise and maybe not
fully speak But we're able to you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there was some hope there with that CBG
right and on a one-to-one so half acidic
[SPEAKER_03]: half the activated or heated form When we
add CBG to CBD So CBD of course is great
[SPEAKER_03]: for seizure disorders and is becoming very
well accepted especially for children and
[SPEAKER_03]: pediatrics with seizure disorders We need
high amounts of that CBD though.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for seizure disorders We're looking at
somewhere between three to six hundred
[SPEAKER_03]: milligrams per dose To help manage
seizures doesn't always work But you could
[SPEAKER_03]: pulse it with the seizure medication the
pharmaceutical seizure medication so we
[SPEAKER_03]: can pulse it So when the pharmaceutical
stops working we can do the CBD High high
[SPEAKER_03]: doses though when the CBD stops working we
go back to the pharmaceutical right so we
[SPEAKER_03]: can pulse them like that But add some CBG
in some early studies are showing that hey
[SPEAKER_03]: this actually makes CBD a little more
effective And we may find that even adding
[SPEAKER_03]: CBG in with your pharmaceuticals
anti-seizure meds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's more effective We don't know
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: We haven't it's not that it it doesn't
it's just that we haven't figured it out
[SPEAKER_03]: yet We haven't looked so many things we
haven't looked at Anxiety ADHD OCD 40
[SPEAKER_03]: milligrams this was one study they use 40
milligrams in so 40 milligrams a day So in
[SPEAKER_03]: two doses, so 20 in the morning 20 in the
afternoon And this is just CBG not CBGA
[SPEAKER_03]: Helped for people with anxiety or ADD or
OCD, which I I can I know ADD It can ruin
[SPEAKER_03]: your day, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I'm gonna get done today and
then ADD kicks in and squirrel squirrel
[SPEAKER_03]: squirrel the end of the day is like I only
got one thing done So seem to help that 40
[SPEAKER_03]: milligrams a day, but it does did in the
participants in that study did have sleep
[SPEAKER_03]: disturbances They didn't have a great
sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, you know, we have to choose our
battles here It could be similar for brain
[SPEAKER_03]: inflammation Which we know this horrible
kovat that we've just come through three
[SPEAKER_03]: years with it causes a lot of brain
inflammation So does a lot of other
[SPEAKER_03]: parasitic activities other viral activity
people who have Lyme disease the
[SPEAKER_03]: coinfections from that cause a lot of
brain fog and stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this CBG could help with that And
here's a really interesting one if they've
[SPEAKER_03]: done a clinical study with CBG with
linalool the turpin linaloo and limonene
[SPEAKER_03]: and They're finding that it may help with
staph infection.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of those We're starting to get to
what they're calling post antibiotic age
[SPEAKER_03]: where they think that possibly our
Antibiotics well, they are some of our
[SPEAKER_03]: antibiotics already is starting to become
less effective than they used to be But we
[SPEAKER_03]: could come to a place where our
antibiotics pharmaceutical antibiotics are
[SPEAKER_03]: working So there is a lot of really active
activity at looking at our plant medicine
[SPEAKER_03]: to see what's going to replace our
antibiotics you know if we get to that
[SPEAKER_03]: place and CBG plus linalool plus limonene
May be pretty good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Go make a salve a first-aid salve Add in
your CBG some of your limonene some
[SPEAKER_03]: linalool so some lavender and some citrus
and some CBG high CBG plant That could
[SPEAKER_03]: make a pretty fantastic first aid
first-aid salve or ointment or something
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay better speed up a little bit here
Cannabic chromine or cannabic chromine
[SPEAKER_03]: chrominic acid This is the second
cannabinoid that forms in the flower
[SPEAKER_03]: before it reaches its whatever its
genetics are this is even more brief less
[SPEAKER_03]: brief no more brief and happens for a
smaller amount of time than the CBG does
[SPEAKER_03]: so CBG forms first and then enzymes kick
in and it quickly morphs into CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabicromine and then I'm sorry CBC
cannabicromine and then cannabicromine
[SPEAKER_03]: then morphs into whatever the genetics of
the plant are so there are some people
[SPEAKER_03]: again some breeders cultivators out there
that are pushing up the CBC so getting
[SPEAKER_03]: some usable amounts from it so you don't
have to harvest your plants so early but
[SPEAKER_03]: again figure out that timing this is I
have a somebody in the legacy market who
[SPEAKER_03]: has a fantastic CBD product out there both
a tincture and a cream I can't I've never
[SPEAKER_03]: seen anything that does such a good job as
a CBC stuff like this is my favorite
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid at this point if you if I can
have favorites the skin healing properties
[SPEAKER_03]: of this CBC is phenomenal so persistent
chronic what they call refractive so it
[SPEAKER_03]: means that it's resistant to any kind of
treatment Xeban psoriasis takes care of it
[SPEAKER_03]: diabetic like diabetic source that you can
get on the periphery especially like on on
[SPEAKER_03]: feet and stuff like that he's had this
friend of mine is has had people who have
[SPEAKER_03]: been on antibiotics and and you know oral
antibiotics topical antibiotics all kinds
[SPEAKER_03]: of things nothing was touching these
diabetic source three weeks on this cream
[SPEAKER_03]: healed up and so now this person this
patient of his whenever they see something
[SPEAKER_03]: something's coming up just takes care of
it so it doesn't get out of control right
[SPEAKER_03]: this same stuff somebody had a got a
motorcycle burn on their leg and again
[SPEAKER_03]: same thing doctors were flipping through
all the antibiotics all of the creams
[SPEAKER_03]: herbal creams everything finally got to my
friend Bill and tried this CBC stuff clear
[SPEAKER_03]: it up in less than a week less than a week
it cleared this stuff up so CBC play
[SPEAKER_03]: around with CBC it's fantastic also is not
too bad for pain I also know someone who
[SPEAKER_03]: had some eye surgery done and the the
stuff that the doctors had given them was
[SPEAKER_03]: it was okay but they started using the CBC
cream on just on their eyes now it is a
[SPEAKER_03]: very clean products got some olive oil and
some like extra virgin organic olive oil
[SPEAKER_03]: and some a little bit of beeswax in there
and then the CBC so it was very safe to
[SPEAKER_03]: put on the eye so they were putting on the
eye at night and so the eye surgery was
[SPEAKER_03]: healing up their eyesight started to
improve like what the hell nobody can
[SPEAKER_03]: prove did that do that or was that from
the eye surgery but it wasn't expected
[SPEAKER_03]: from the eye surgery the eye surgery was
for something completely different so it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like wait a minute so you know if you got
some of that cream and your eyes are you
[SPEAKER_03]: know need a little bit of help then give
it a try put it on at night it's a little
[SPEAKER_03]: goopy but put it on at night so we don't
know maybe okay CBD a so good old CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabidiol and kind of cannabidiol diolic
acid if we use the raw stuff the the
[SPEAKER_03]: unheated the acidic form we can get a
better management of neuropathic pain than
[SPEAKER_03]: the heated form so make your tinctures
with the raw stuff you don't have to
[SPEAKER_03]: decarb it or maybe you decarb half and you
don't decarb the other half gout 200
[SPEAKER_03]: milligrams which is a fairly high dose
twice daily for four days a limited gout
[SPEAKER_03]: in this one fellow that's pretty cool
because gout is pretty painful and it
[SPEAKER_03]: reoccurs if you know I had a client once a
little aside and he would get gout every
[SPEAKER_03]: couple months it would be so painful and
you know one of my first questions is well
[SPEAKER_03]: what's your diet like this is ah pizza and
beer well how often do you have pizza and
[SPEAKER_03]: beer maybe three or four times a week and
then I try and have salads the other day
[SPEAKER_03]: okay so if you want to get rid of your
gout you got to get rid of your pizza and
[SPEAKER_03]: beer it's like nah not getting rid of my
pizza and beer it's like okay well I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna be treating you freak out so you're
a good moneymaker asthma CBD plus CBD a so
[SPEAKER_03]: add your activated form and your acidic
form you're gonna get better asthmatic and
[SPEAKER_03]: the inflammatory effects CBD a is five to
seven times more available in the body
[SPEAKER_03]: that means it gets into the bloodstream
five to seven times more effectively than
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD does that's pretty good if we add CBD
a with THC and CBG we get much better
[SPEAKER_03]: anti-inflammatory action in the gut right
if we want to improve our digestion and
[SPEAKER_03]: improve our health we want to get the
inflammation out of our gut CBDA THC is
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna help with the pain lower dose of THC
and some CBG in there might have some
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty good you know clean up some gut
health seizure matter management so we
[SPEAKER_03]: were talking earlier about CBD is kind of
becoming a standard for seizure especially
[SPEAKER_03]: pediatric seizure it's the only
cannabinoid right now that is accepted for
[SPEAKER_03]: pediatrics for pediatric use so they have
found that one-tenth of the dose of CBDA
[SPEAKER_03]: is needed for the equivalent anti-seizure
activity of CBD by itself holy crap that's
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty amazing gets better pain management
CBDA versus CBD you need one one hundredth
[SPEAKER_03]: of a dose of CBDA versus CBD there's one
that's even better anti-emetic so that
[SPEAKER_03]: means stopping vomiting anti-emetic ten
thousandths of a dose so meaning only you
[SPEAKER_03]: only need minute doses just micro dosing
of CBDA versus how much you might need of
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD now having said that we know that THC
is a much better anti-emetic than CBD is
[SPEAKER_03]: but there's a lot of people that can't
tolerate the psychoactivity or the the
[SPEAKER_03]: impairment from THC than CBD so we do need
a lot more CBD for anti anti-emetic then
[SPEAKER_03]: if anyone came to me and said you know how
do I stop vomiting I'd go with CBD and
[SPEAKER_03]: inhaled CBD not not eating it inhaled it's
gonna quickly quench that but for someone
[SPEAKER_03]: who can't tolerate THC CBDA might might
work yeah anytime I'm working with
[SPEAKER_03]: anti-emetic or nausea I want to I want a
quick action so I'm gonna inhale I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: suggest they inhale it yeah appetite
stimuli yeah yeah any kind of inhalation
[SPEAKER_03]: method is gonna get and even you know the
vape pens we got some really clean vape
[SPEAKER_03]: pen they cartridges out on the market now
so yeah even that but my favorite is the
[SPEAKER_03]: dry hair vaporizer because it's the
cleanest but it's kind of a pain in the
[SPEAKER_03]: butt right it's not quick a vape pen is
super quick okay moving on because I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna run out of time here tetra
tetrahydrocannabidolic acid THC a so
[SPEAKER_03]: that's the unheated and people like ah you
gotta decarb you know for some things you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to decarb but maybe you don't
experiment get out there experiment try it
[SPEAKER_03]: especially if you're a grower and you have
lots you have lots to play around with try
[SPEAKER_03]: it not decarbing and see what happens of
course you can't smoke it and not decarb
[SPEAKER_03]: because smoking decarbs instantly right so
but that's when you're making your
[SPEAKER_03]: tinctures and you're you're you know
cooking it or putting it into food that's
[SPEAKER_03]: not gonna get heated very high we get
better nausea and vomiting the only
[SPEAKER_03]: problem with that as we were just talking
about is when you're nauseous you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to eat anything right so it gets a
little hard taking an oral product to
[SPEAKER_03]: quench nausea and vomiting unless it's
something chronic that you have throughout
[SPEAKER_03]: the day right effective at reducing
symptoms of irritable bowel and other
[SPEAKER_03]: gastrointestinal issues and there is some
early clinical studies that show that if
[SPEAKER_03]: we add a THC a with a THC so an acidic
with a decarb form a heated form together
[SPEAKER_03]: in a one-to-one formula we're gonna get
way better pain management than just THC
[SPEAKER_03]: by itself and also if for those people as
I was talking about earlier who either
[SPEAKER_03]: can't tolerate THC the impairment from THC
or they don't like it and I've had a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of patients that until I've figured some
of the stuff out that say like well your
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine really worked your cannabis
medicine really worked but I don't like
[SPEAKER_03]: being stoned it's just it's too
disorienting for me so so then they push
[SPEAKER_03]: it away they don't want to try it right
and then that's really sad to me because
[SPEAKER_03]: then they try and go to pharmaceuticals
and might not be as effective and get
[SPEAKER_03]: other side effects and stuff like that so
if we have equal amounts THC a and THC
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe we can reduce the likelihood of
impairment and help people be people be
[SPEAKER_03]: more comfortable and still have their
effective pain medication okay then I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: going to talk about the varine
cannabinoids so
[SPEAKER_03]: that's my tongue twister for the day so
we've seen the THC V THC VA CBD V CBD VA
[SPEAKER_03]: so of course the acidic is the raw one
that's what we find in the plant itself
[SPEAKER_03]: they're just a slightly different form
they have a different chemically a
[SPEAKER_03]: different tail on the end of them the
varine ones versus the non varine ones if
[SPEAKER_03]: you will and so that will have a slightly
different reaction within the body so this
[SPEAKER_03]: is where we can start to really fine-tune
like even a year ago or two years ago when
[SPEAKER_03]: I would give this lecture is like okay
terpenes are how we fine-tune our cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: plant sure they work great but let's start
fine-tuning with our cannabinoids and we
[SPEAKER_03]: can really get down to some nitty-gritty
so I was just having a conversation this
[SPEAKER_03]: morning about you know people always ask
well what's the best strain for this and
[SPEAKER_03]: what's the best cultivar for that I was
like I don't know what's the best diet
[SPEAKER_03]: right because I'm a nutritionist as well
so people ask me what's the best diet well
[SPEAKER_03]: there's 800 sorry there's 8 billion people
on this planet I think there's 8 billion
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect diets there's 8 billion people on
this planet there's 8 billion perfect pain
[SPEAKER_03]: medications and we now have the ability to
fine-tune it so if something doesn't work
[SPEAKER_03]: let's tweak it a little bit we can tweak
dosage we can tweak ratios we can tweak
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoids we can add and then we have
all the terpenes so can you see the it's
[SPEAKER_03]: an infinite possibility right there's an
infinite number of remedies that we can
[SPEAKER_03]: get from this plant and then we start
adding in all of our forest friends all of
[SPEAKER_03]: our other plants in there it's like we
have lifetimes of research that we can do
[SPEAKER_03]: on this stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: so we don't have a lot of research on the
varins yet but there is I work with a
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid researcher out of the UK you
can look up her her Google Scholar page
[SPEAKER_03]: she has tons of papers and studies that
she's contributed to and her her name is
[SPEAKER_03]: Saoirse O'Sullivan
[SPEAKER_03]: she's out of the UK and if you look up her
Google Scholar or her LinkedIn you'll have
[SPEAKER_03]: access she's really generous with some of
the stuff that she's put out there so
[SPEAKER_03]: varins like some of these other minor
cannabinoids are found in very minute
[SPEAKER_03]: amounts but again if you're a cultivar and
you know how to work with genetics it's
[SPEAKER_03]: all that part's all magic to me but you
know see if you can bump some of that
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff up the varins not a lot of research
yet but any research that has been done in
[SPEAKER_03]: the varins has just been done in the last
ten years so when you think of the grand
[SPEAKER_03]: scheme of things that's like a day we've
had a day's worth of research if that
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe an hour's worth of research in the
variance there's so much we don't know we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know what we don't know and there's
so much to learn about that and then we
[SPEAKER_03]: have CBN so CBN is cannabinol it doesn't
you get a small amount of it in the
[SPEAKER_03]: growing plant but basically it's a
degradation of THC and we know that CBN is
[SPEAKER_03]: probably the most sedative of all the
cannabinoids it's wonderful for sleep
[SPEAKER_03]: helps you fall asleep helps you stay
asleep so I threw that one in there I know
[SPEAKER_03]: people who don't like being stoned but
they love getting a good night's sleep so
[SPEAKER_03]: they purposely take their cannabis their
flower grind it up and put it in the Sun
[SPEAKER_03]: which you go it's like no I want the CBN
you want to change it into CBN so it's
[SPEAKER_03]: famous for sedation but there's some
people that find it works really well with
[SPEAKER_03]: for pain meds and so can we take a little
add a little bit of CBN maybe for your
[SPEAKER_03]: pain medication at the end of the day
where you want to get a little bit sleepy
[SPEAKER_03]: so maybe you have pain meds first thing in
the morning you have a certain blend for
[SPEAKER_03]: first thing in the morning you have a
certain blend for middle of the afternoon
[SPEAKER_03]: and you have a certain blend for the night
time right so we can start to play with
[SPEAKER_03]: some of these combinations CBN also is it
can be an appetite stimulant so increased
[SPEAKER_03]: food intake as well and so that's why I
have lots of people that say I smoke my
[SPEAKER_03]: big fat doobie eat my bag of Doritos and
then I'm ready for bed well that's the CBN
[SPEAKER_03]: kicking in making you hungry and then
making you go to sleep which isn't a bad
[SPEAKER_03]: thing I would just replace the Doritos for
something a little bit better but okay
[SPEAKER_03]: there is also a whole study of
cannabinoids in combination with
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceuticals out there so let's not
throw away our pharmaceuticals because we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't want to go back to only living till
we're 40 years old let's also not rely
[SPEAKER_03]: completely on our pharmaceuticals because
they have a lot of collateral damage in
[SPEAKER_03]: the body usually it's the liver that takes
the biggest hit from pharmaceuticals but
[SPEAKER_03]: how can we pair these up and so there's a
lot of research out there that is showing
[SPEAKER_03]: especially in cancer treatment that if we
add cannabis in to certain types of
[SPEAKER_03]: chemotherapy that we can actually lower
the amount of chemotherapy that's required
[SPEAKER_03]: to be effective how great is that because
chemotherapy has some major major side
[SPEAKER_03]: effects right it mostly works kills cancer
yeah but it also kills a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: other things in the body so we have to
kind of maybe we can find a balance there
[SPEAKER_03]: so some of the studies are showing when we
combine pharmaceuticals with cannabis we
[SPEAKER_03]: get fewer side effects we get less
frequent flare-ups for people who have
[SPEAKER_03]: chronic disease where they can you know
get a flare-up of that chronic disease we
[SPEAKER_03]: can increase quality of life so fewer side
effects that cause you know difficult
[SPEAKER_03]: issues and then reduce healthcare costs
right okay I'm going to I always this idea
[SPEAKER_03]: about oncology and cannabis how many have
heard that cannabis cures all cancer we've
[SPEAKER_03]: all heard that right we've all heard it
the memes are going around Facebook all
[SPEAKER_03]: the time sure it's true do you know where
that came from a laboratory what's that in
[SPEAKER_03]: vitro in vitro means in glass in a
laboratory so yes cannabis has cured all
[SPEAKER_03]: cancer lines in a petri dish with large
amounts of cannabinoids directly touching
[SPEAKER_03]: the cancer cells over long periods of time
that's where that Facebook meme came from
[SPEAKER_03]: so yeah it's technically true does that
translate into the human body not at all
[SPEAKER_03]: not at all maybe not even a rat body right
but it does give us hope that maybe at
[SPEAKER_03]: some point we can figure these things out
and so there are some you know some
[SPEAKER_03]: clinical research going on where they're
they're they're injecting cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_03]: directly into a term of tumor when they
can get to it I mean you know if it's in
[SPEAKER_03]: the middle of the brain that's a little
hard to get to right but but they're
[SPEAKER_03]: working on it right so where can I get
cannabis can help in oncology is it can
[SPEAKER_03]: help lessen side effects it can make the
traditional traditional that the current
[SPEAKER_03]: cancer treatment more tolerable it can
help with pain maybe better than the
[SPEAKER_03]: opiates or maybe in combination here
there's another thing I didn't even
[SPEAKER_03]: include in here when you take THC with
opiates like with you can with codeine or
[SPEAKER_03]: with morphine you can actually reduce the
amount of opiates that you use by up to
[SPEAKER_03]: 10% which is huge because opiates are so
addictive but they're very effective at
[SPEAKER_03]: pain meds but if we can reduce the amount
of opiates that we use we use opiates and
[SPEAKER_03]: THC in conjunction with each other at the
same time we can actually take fewer
[SPEAKER_03]: opiates okay so back to using cannabis
with our current day oncology treatment
[SPEAKER_03]: irritable bowel symptoms we can help
people sleep better they can have a better
[SPEAKER_03]: appetite so that they have the strength to
fight to heal and fight that off but then
[SPEAKER_03]: things like anxiety we can help them with
anxiety thank God I've never had a cancer
[SPEAKER_03]: diagnosis I can only imagine how anxiety
inducing that is right it's not only
[SPEAKER_03]: stressful for the patient but it's
stressful for the people around them so we
[SPEAKER_03]: can use cannabis CBD is my favorite for
anti-anxiety can help bring down anxiety
[SPEAKER_03]: can also help with acceptance this is
where I am in life you know you can try
[SPEAKER_03]: and run but your shadows coming with you
so it can help with acceptance as so that
[SPEAKER_03]: you can move forward you can't usually
move forward with your life until you
[SPEAKER_03]: accept where you are and it can help with
courage as well can give us some courage
[SPEAKER_03]: so here's here's my challenge to you guys
go out and experiment when you're
[SPEAKER_03]: experimenting keep good notes because you
think you're gonna remember but you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: remember that's my biggest problem I say
oh I'll always remember this and then you
[SPEAKER_03]: get on to the two or three things later is
like what was that what combination what
[SPEAKER_03]: was that ratio how much did I take so keep
good notes share experiment try different
[SPEAKER_03]: combinations there's no rules anymore
cannabis does not have to be decarbed high
[SPEAKER_03]: THC for it to be medicinally effective
maybe that's super fun and there's a time
[SPEAKER_03]: and a place for that absolutely but if
we're trying to treat disease with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis there's no rules we can use the
acidic form we can use the the decarbed
[SPEAKER_03]: form the heated form we can combine we can
add other plant medicine we can add
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes we can do combinations of all
these things just mix it up yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: experiment keep notes send me send me your
results good or bad right share them with
[SPEAKER_03]: your friends grow grow like every season
grow an extra plant and harvest it early
[SPEAKER_03]: see if you can catch some of that CBG or
that CB CBC out of it and then combine
[SPEAKER_03]: that with your fully mature you know
harvested at just the right time plant
[SPEAKER_03]: also you know just because I'm a mom and a
grandma start logo slow you know THCV is
[SPEAKER_03]: more impairing than THC but it doesn't
last as long so just keep that in mind but
[SPEAKER_03]: all the other minor cannabinoids you're
not gonna get that psychoactivity from
[SPEAKER_03]: them so we can be fairly careful but high
CBD as you know we think it's pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: innocent but it will kill your appetite
and if you're taking high amounts of CBD
[SPEAKER_03]: which for some people say oh good I'm
gonna lose weight yeah but if that goes on
[SPEAKER_03]: for too long you're gonna lose too much
weight and then you're gonna be
[SPEAKER_03]: malnourished right so CBD can also bring
your blood pressure down too low it can
[SPEAKER_03]: interfere with sleep for some people for
some people can make them sleep all the
[SPEAKER_03]: time right so we always have to treat the
plant with respect at the same way that we
[SPEAKER_03]: treat our bodies with respect right so go
out there experiment let me know how
[SPEAKER_03]: you're doing get some little at-home test
kits so for your your home grows you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have to go spend a thousand dollars to
find out what cannabinoids are in there
[SPEAKER_03]: there's some really great test kits out
there now so you know what you're working
[SPEAKER_03]: with and I think that's all yeah I got a
few minutes for questions any questions
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoids we produce them
throughout our nervous system yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely well I don't know about relaxed
at all times because then you might check
[SPEAKER_03]: out and not be very productive with your
life not that we all have to be super
[SPEAKER_03]: productive but you want to be able to get
on with you but you know how there is some
[SPEAKER_03]: experiments on how we can take care of our
endocannabinoid system this is one way
[SPEAKER_03]: being in community sharing with other
people playing together is actually what
[SPEAKER_03]: the clinical study was when people play
together whether that's sports or dancing
[SPEAKER_03]: or chatting and sharing common goals your
endocannabinoid system gets bumped up
[SPEAKER_03]: singing singing increases your
endocannabinoid production so that you can
[SPEAKER_03]: measure it in your blood amazing right
bodywork massage acupuncture acute like
[SPEAKER_03]: osteopathic sex right that all bumps up
your endocannabinoid system if it's good
[SPEAKER_03]: right it's got to be caring running
running will bump up your endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: system eating well alcohol kills your
endocannabinoid system and it kills your
[SPEAKER_03]: immune well how it kills your immune
system if you've ever been on a weekend
[SPEAKER_03]: bender with alcohol and then on Monday
morning and maybe it's Tuesday you start
[SPEAKER_03]: to get sick it's because the alcohol
killed your immune system and so now it's
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna take a few weeks to build that back
up so minimize the alcohol that will keep
[SPEAKER_03]: your endocannabinoid system in better
shape there's one other one there has
[SPEAKER_03]: there have been some clinical studies on
people who had difficult childhoods
[SPEAKER_03]: whether that was through abuse or neglect
those kinds of things they do find that
[SPEAKER_03]: the endocannabinoid system isn't as strong
as someone who had a very nurturing
[SPEAKER_03]: childhood so that's for those people we
need to really take care of our
[SPEAKER_03]: endocannabinoid system because it's
already at a you know maybe not working
[SPEAKER_03]: it's already has some a bit of damage now
that doesn't mean that that can't damage
[SPEAKER_03]: can't be repaired because we've seen
people have had very difficult childhoods
[SPEAKER_03]: become really you know very productive and
happy adults so but just keep that in mind
[SPEAKER_03]: might just be a little bit more work yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah you can you can get a THC hangover
for sure that can happen it's just it's
[SPEAKER_03]: lingering in the body it's it's your liver
is still trying to clear it out that's why
[SPEAKER_03]: you kind of get that haziness
[SPEAKER_03]: it's all about fun have some fun sleep in
dance sing go swimming play with your
[SPEAKER_03]: buddies yeah we're doing research here
yeah that's right any other questions all
[SPEAKER_03]: right I have oh yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah so some of that stuff we got to go
look for it because there's there's a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: happening out there right now that's
taking up all the chatter right so the
[SPEAKER_03]: question was where's the research we
haven't now that it's legal where's the
[SPEAKER_03]: research it can take from concept of you
know we should research this to it making
[SPEAKER_03]: to you to your doctor's office 20 years so
we're just getting ramped up when you do
[SPEAKER_03]: clinical research there's what's called
the what's what's the primary endpoint
[SPEAKER_03]: which means what is the purpose of doing
the research what are we trying to prove
[SPEAKER_03]: here and that statement has to be exactly
what you're trying to prove and so
[SPEAKER_03]: professor O'Sullivan who I mentioned
earlier she she says that sometimes it can
[SPEAKER_03]: take two years for them to decide on what
is our primary endpoint how are we wording
[SPEAKER_03]: this because if you don't word word the
primary endpoint properly for for your
[SPEAKER_03]: clinical study and you don't hit that
endpoint that means the clinical study has
[SPEAKER_03]: failed even though you might have learned
a whole bunch of stuff right so the
[SPEAKER_03]: research is out there go look up professor
O'Sullivan there's there's can't think of
[SPEAKER_03]: the name of it right now but there's a
whole worldwide endocannabinoid research
[SPEAKER_03]: association out there there's a lot of
work going on out there we just don't hear
[SPEAKER_03]: about it so you got to go look for it an
interesting one down in Brazil in 20 late
[SPEAKER_03]: 2020 if you guys remember what happened in
2020 2020 was our first year of kovat and
[SPEAKER_03]: Brazil did not do a great job of public
health measures so they were they were one
[SPEAKER_03]: of the countries that had the most people
dying in it they were one of the top ten
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody in a teaching hospital down in in
Brazil I can't remember what city was in
[SPEAKER_03]: decided we should this is a great time to
do some clinical studies and they took
[SPEAKER_03]: frontline health care workers and they had
some of them just you know because they
[SPEAKER_03]: were frantic our health care workers took
the brunt of that in 2020 was brutal and
[SPEAKER_03]: so they had them you know they divided
them out however many were in this
[SPEAKER_03]: clinical study they divided them out half
of them just did their own thing and they
[SPEAKER_03]: were they got counseling when they needed
counseling and and you know time off when
[SPEAKER_03]: they needed time off and then the other
group they gave CBD to and I can't quite
[SPEAKER_03]: remember the amounts of CBD I'm looking at
one of my students over there if you
[SPEAKER_03]: remember it doesn't matter but they gave
them CBD on a daily basis and they wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: to see if that helped with the anxiety of
being a frontline worker in a hospital
[SPEAKER_03]: where they're used to having you know one
person die a month and now they're having
[SPEAKER_03]: 15 people die a day on them and and yeah
their anxiety was way down like it and so
[SPEAKER_03]: those little experiments unless you went
looking for it you would never find it
[SPEAKER_03]: right because it doesn't make frontline
news you know one little hospital in one
[SPEAKER_03]: little city in one little country during
all of that other clutter that was going
[SPEAKER_03]: on out there so it's out there the studies
are out there you just got to go looking
[SPEAKER_03]: for them and also studies researchers will
only put money into something if there's
[SPEAKER_03]: anecdotal and case study evidence so
that's why I say with you guys keep your
[SPEAKER_03]: notes because those are your case studies
and we don't have to be medical
[SPEAKER_03]: professionals to have case studies we just
have to have good notes and we can compile
[SPEAKER_03]: those notes and then other people can read
them and if there's enough people saying
[SPEAKER_03]: hey I took CBG and CBC I'm just making
this up I don't know when I last time you
[SPEAKER_03]: know when I felt like I got COVID because
I know I was exposed exposed and you know
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get very sick so hey you try this
when you feel like you got exposed to
[SPEAKER_03]: COVID and then you try it and you try it
and you try it and then we'll compare
[SPEAKER_03]: notes and maybe only one out of ten of us
kind of got sick where the last time that
[SPEAKER_03]: happened nine out of ten of us got really
sick right so those that's once we get
[SPEAKER_03]: those kind of anecdotal things coming out
then the researchers go hmm maybe we
[SPEAKER_03]: should look into this a little bit more
maybe we should add some money to this so
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no end of studies out there and it
is ramping up believe it or not that was a
[SPEAKER_03]: long answer where we at for time I'm over
time so I will be I have a little booth
[SPEAKER_03]: over there and if anybody wants has more
questions come see me over there I'll be
[SPEAKER_03]: over there for the weekend and I'm also
doing a plant walk on Sunday Sunday
[SPEAKER_03]: morning same time okay thanks so much guys
[SPEAKER_01]: so we're just gonna break
