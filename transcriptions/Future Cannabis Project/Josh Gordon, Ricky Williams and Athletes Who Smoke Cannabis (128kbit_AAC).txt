[SPEAKER_01]: Josh Gordon got spent 10 times or
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ricky Williams took a year off to go on
sabbatical to smoke, and he knew something
[SPEAKER_01]: we didn't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, okay, my body is getting beat
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to go fix it and repair it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't realize the benefits of it
until I myself started partaking in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I realized that, you know,
staying calm, being able to sleep,
[SPEAKER_01]: being able to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sometimes when you're nervous or
you're frustrated or injured, you're
[SPEAKER_01]: depressed or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have the same eating habits and
you eat bad or you're impulsively eating.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, like when you get the munchies,
I know if you've had munchies,
[SPEAKER_01]: you eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure I have healthy food in my house,
but you know, I'm eating properly and
[SPEAKER_01]: eating more than I would if I was stressed
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious to find out what they do in
the NFL if you are caught smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: You hit a little bit on it with Gordon,
but what do they do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the protocols and what are the
protocols in place to protect the player?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that all go down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you get fined.
[SPEAKER_01]: First offense, you get fined, then they
put you in the substance abuse program.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to pee in a cup every week,
probably like three times a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen people go through it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They hate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the worst.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, you get fined.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then second offense, you get a
four-game suspension.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get put into the program and
you have to, you know, meet with the
[SPEAKER_01]: psychologist and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then third offense, I think it's an
eight-game suspension and a fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could possibly get conduct
detrimental.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it escalates each time you do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, Josh Gordon was continually
getting in trouble for smoking weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, he was just always ready to
play every game.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was there and ready to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that cannabis was a huge part
of his ability to be relaxed and
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he just, he moved effortlessly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I swear to God, it's because of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I mean, he just, they don't
really want to get rid of you because you
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke weed, but they have their rules that
they have in place that they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: adhere to, which is kind of, to me,
it shows that they want to allow it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they can't allow it because of the
back pressure they get from the general
[SPEAKER_01]: public, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they'll prescribe opioids really
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can that be changed or how do you see
that changing in the future?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's just got to have the NFL
players union has to rally together behind
[SPEAKER_01]: the people who have the lawsuits against
NFL for the damage has been done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's walking evidence of people in
the community now that are former players
[SPEAKER_01]: that are walking around with pain,
that have problems with their body because
[SPEAKER_01]: of all the opiates they've taken and all
the stuff they put in their body.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I was a time where I was playing a
game and it was a really good year.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were 14 and two, but we were just
playing at a high level and I was putting
[SPEAKER_01]: DMSO and ketoprofen on my body.
[SPEAKER_01]: And DMSO is not clear about the FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not good for your body.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the side effects are
probably in another 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have another leg growing out of my body.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, but whatever it took to be
on the field, that's what everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: mentality is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't lose my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll do whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you got this, I'll take it,
give it to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to feel better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to, I want to be able to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And players are not going to stand up for
themselves because they're so focused on
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to survive that they're not focused
on what the body's, what the damage is
[SPEAKER_01]: being done and the long-term effects of
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the alumni has to jump back in
and say, you know what, look at my body.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm 55 years old and people are dying from
heart attacks and they don't know why,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's because of all the stuff they put
in their body.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are going, having dementia at 60,
Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a high prevalence of people who have
brain issues and they're just now sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: rolling out packages to help with that
disability plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of lawsuits still
against the NFL because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that they would just look at
the books and say, if we start allowing
[SPEAKER_01]: people to take CBD, start allowing people
to use cannabis, there's a lot of money
[SPEAKER_01]: that saves us in the long run.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, from a business perspective,
I would just look at the brass tacks of
[SPEAKER_01]: the numbers and just say, you know what,
it's probably more profitable for us to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say, oh, well, you know,
they're smoking weed and they're promoting
[SPEAKER_01]: weed and it's promoting it to the kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll say, well, what about all the beer
commercials you have out here?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about all the damn cores like you
pass down in the stadium?
[SPEAKER_01]: They see daddy drink all the time and
daddy gets mad and starts yelling at
[SPEAKER_01]: mommy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't see daddy smoke weed and go
and yell at mommy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not being an advocate on that fashion,
but I mean, just from plain and simple,
[SPEAKER_01]: just looking at what's going on,
I think they just need to step up and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what, this is the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's fix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's just going to come from the
community, the people who are actually
[SPEAKER_01]: living it, like living in the pain that
are using it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to use a proper language when
they're speaking and sort of convince
[SPEAKER_01]: people that this is the right way to go.
