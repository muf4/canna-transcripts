[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're running a European-wide
research called the 420 Pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are collecting consumer data and these
data we're going to use to convince
[SPEAKER_00]: governments to make better regulations,
better laws, which suits the needs of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how are you planning to do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: The strategy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we used to do this in the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a research done with 9,000 people
and that data has been used to convince
[SPEAKER_00]: the Dutch government to finally regulate
the growing in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as you probably know, for 40 years we
have the coffee shops in the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can buy wheat, but it was not allowed
to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now legislation is coming through,
which makes also the growing possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: partly thanks to the data that we have
provided.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of things going on in
Europe on the regulation side,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we are also collecting now throughout
Europe the same data to use that to
[SPEAKER_00]: convince European governments to regulate
the recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can fill out the questionnaire at
420Pull.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
