[SPEAKER_01]: Always an honor and a privilege to be here
with Congressman Dana Rohrbacher.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dana, why don't you tell us a little bit
about what you've been doing to support
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry over the years and what your
outlook is for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am an optimist because we started just
10 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, we didn't have the Rohrbacher
FAR Amendment and now it's Rohrbacher
[SPEAKER_00]: Blumenauer.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have that and our government was
able to run a roughshod over anything what
[SPEAKER_00]: local people wanted to do when it came to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well now, with Rohrbacher FAR,
we've managed to get a majority vote on
[SPEAKER_00]: this twice now through the United States
Congress and it is currently law.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have the DEA coming in when it
comes to medical marijuana and superseding
[SPEAKER_00]: the state law.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the people who are dealing with medical
marijuana, at least that part of it,
[SPEAKER_00]: are safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: From being arrested by the federal
authorities and having all of their
[SPEAKER_00]: property confiscated, now at least we have
that kind of protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the future, I think in the next
election cycle, I think we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: come to a tipping point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the turning point on this issue
and we will see that not just the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Justice, but all the
departments and agencies of the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: government will leave it up to the states
because President Trump has made that
[SPEAKER_00]: promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love him or hate him, he keeps his
promises and that's to legalize medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana and personal use by leaving that
up to the states.
[SPEAKER_01]: As our biggest champion in the Republican
caucus, just looking at worst case
[SPEAKER_01]: scenario, if you don't win your
re-election in November, what are the
[SPEAKER_01]: prospects for the Rohrbacher protection?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the first thing that will happen if
I lose the election is I'm going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: surfing and drink tequila for at least
three or four months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, however, I'm in a really tough
race.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do believe I'll be on top when it comes
because I believe in freedom and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: my constituents believe in freedom.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, if I do lose, it'll be a lot
tougher in Congress because they have
[SPEAKER_00]: grown used to someone who's acceptable to
the conservative Republicans mobilizing
[SPEAKER_00]: those votes and we need those votes to
accomplish our goal, which is to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal government out of this issue and
leave it to the states and local
[SPEAKER_00]: government.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be a lot harder if I'm not
around, but I am predicting that I will
[SPEAKER_00]: win and I'm predicting that once that
happens, President Trump will then,
[SPEAKER_00]: he will keep his word.
[SPEAKER_00]: He will support legislation that leaves
this issue up to the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: He made that pledge during the campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love him or hate him, he keeps his word
about trying to initiate what he promised
[SPEAKER_00]: he'd do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm optimistic that should I be
elected, and I think I can be and will be,
[SPEAKER_00]: that we will be able to have some great
steps forward and there'll be no going
[SPEAKER_00]: back after this next congressional
session.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, and what about, this is an
America first administration and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: that we both agree that part of the
America first policy should also be
[SPEAKER_01]: putting America's cannabis industry first.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recently just acquired cannabis for
research from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, Canada legalized marijuana last
week and I have some concerns that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: falling behind in the global market.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think this administration is
going to do to help make America's
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry great again?
[SPEAKER_00]: How about making America's farmers great
again by letting them grow cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact is that cannabis will affect
American agriculture in so many ways that
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't even know now.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, cannabis isn't just for
smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is also for paper, for cloth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis can be used for so many things
and our farmers, which now we end up
[SPEAKER_00]: having to pay not to grow certain crops,
they will be able to grow cannabis for
[SPEAKER_00]: rope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why should we buy hemp for rope from
anybody else in the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been giving over a billion and a
half dollars to Canada every year so we
[SPEAKER_00]: can buy hemp from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: How ridiculous is that our farmers should
be getting that money?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, there's something else that will
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the cannabis industry will be
revolutionizing agriculture in the sense
[SPEAKER_00]: that they are now turning old buildings
into manufacturing facilities for food.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can see cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've put all of the scientific
knowledge and engineering to grow cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside these old warehouses, what they're
learning from that will be put to use
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board to help them grow
vegetables and other types of fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis industry is not only going to
be revolutionized in what it can do and
[SPEAKER_00]: just cannabis, but also for the other
crops that they are teaching.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are now revolutionizing the
production of other crops in America.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little personal question here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know you're back to surfing,
which is excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that you also are the only member
of Congress who has come out as a consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis through non-psychoactive,
topical cannabis applications.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any connection there?
[SPEAKER_00]: I will have to tell you, I had both of
these shoulders replaced because 30 years
[SPEAKER_00]: of heavy surfing and I surfed all the
cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't even move these arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so painful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was speaking before somebody had
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, what you need to do is rub some
of this cannabis salve on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I can't tell you whether or not
the cannabis was what it was, but I can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell you right now, after shoulder
replacements, there it is, both arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all metal now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm going to be a surfer again,
I'm going to keep these arms operating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet you're not the only member of
Congress that uses medical cannabis or
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you heard anything down there in the
gym or in the congressional locker room
[SPEAKER_01]: about other members of Congress?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there are people who've had
suffering just like anyplace else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Older people have things that they suffer
under.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there are some people everywhere
who are utilizing cannabis to take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: their maladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need to name any names.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I better not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have put cannabis salve on my arms when
I had horrible pain because all the
[SPEAKER_00]: cartilage had been worn away because I'm a
surfer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was suffering with this horrible pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I put cannabis salve on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually admitted that before a group of
people, and it sort of made national news.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, what's wrong with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is wrong with anybody putting a salve
that's based on cannabis on their arm to
[SPEAKER_00]: alleviate their pain?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got no problems with admitting that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's absolutely legal here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that Canada has legalized cannabis
nationally, in your view, has the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government or Congress, are they taking
any lessons from that that might be
[SPEAKER_01]: applied toward legalizing here in the
United States?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's important, of course,
for our farmers to be able to compete with
[SPEAKER_00]: these farmers up in Canada who are now
producing what is a cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hey, I want those billions of dollars
to come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the Canadians, but I want that
money here to our own farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But however, there's another lesson when
you come to other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: By outlying cannabis here, we have
financed the drug cartels in Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who are growing cannabis in
Mexico are not like the folks up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are people who are gangsters,
just like we had to deal with gangsters
[SPEAKER_00]: when we had prohibition of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make sure that we legalize
cannabis here and make sure honest
[SPEAKER_00]: business people and honest farmers are
engaged in this new enterprise rather than
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on what the drug cartels of
Mexico, and we're financing those drug
[SPEAKER_00]: cartels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could correct that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll help Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll help us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that the industry has not been
mobilizing people to go see their personal
[SPEAKER_00]: congressmen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, they've made a much broader
effort to try to affect Congress as a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by going and doing the work necessary
to find out who's constituents,
[SPEAKER_00]: who are the constituents of those people
standing in the way, I think we could have
[SPEAKER_00]: been a lot more effective on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are the veterans from so-and-so's
district?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are the people who have children or
seniors or senior citizens groups from one
[SPEAKER_00]: specific congressman's district who is a
no vote now?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to do that, and I would hope
that the industry is gonna be much more
[SPEAKER_00]: grassroots.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the word, grassroots, when it comes
to getting this job done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tell people in the industry that every
day, that just having the conversations
[SPEAKER_01]: with elected officials at all levels,
not just Congress, even at the city
[SPEAKER_01]: council and state house, makes such a
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's so important that the industry
also understand that we haven't won this
[SPEAKER_01]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not time to sit back and rest on our
laurels.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you gotta win it one elected official
at a time, not as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
