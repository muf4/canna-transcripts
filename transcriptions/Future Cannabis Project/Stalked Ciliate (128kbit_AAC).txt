[SPEAKER_00]: Who's he gonna eat next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like he's eating all those little teeny
tiny bugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he wants a bigger bug.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wants bigger prey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see if someone comes by.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, did you see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That thing that just went flying by?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it was too fast and too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did he miss it?
[SPEAKER_00]: He missed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that one will come.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that one's kind of doing its own
thing over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that one might be dead because it
hasn't really... It's not quite as active
[SPEAKER_00]: with its whiskers as this guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is that one dead?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
I don't know.
I don't know.
