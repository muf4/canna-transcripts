[SPEAKER_01]: wanted to write things down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was a ledger of all of your
then and still from the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government's federally illegal activity,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very sense of concern.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was a lot of I believe the person
that I'm working with and therefore a
[SPEAKER_01]: handshake deal was enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those days were great and still from
those relationships you can then have
[SPEAKER_01]: meaningful contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we take shape and start to legalize
and normalize and want to be a major
[SPEAKER_01]: commodities player across the board,
we have to look at what same and similar
[SPEAKER_01]: industries are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's what the most important aspect is of
growing your business, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we look at same and similar heavily
regulated industries, pharma, food,
[SPEAKER_01]: alcohol, tobacco, they all are heavily
ensconced in both compliance and most
[SPEAKER_01]: importantly contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's contracts throughout the supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we're looking at that,
we need to make sure that at all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different intervals as the product or as
the flower turns into product that turns
[SPEAKER_01]: into where it's ultimately sold,
you have different pivot points and
[SPEAKER_01]: different concerns and different protocols
that you want to have in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: When is the best time to work on an
agreement?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's when everybody's happy and excited to
get to the task of doing the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's not great to discuss what terms
you want to have is when you have an
[SPEAKER_01]: issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we want to plan for the worst case
scenario under the best case
[SPEAKER_01]: circumstances.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that happens at the outset.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, that being said, since we have a
history of not engaging in contractual
[SPEAKER_01]: obligations or agreements, those first
conversations will be difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a good amount of evidence to
suggest why these are so important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about the first recalls that have
been rolling out from the BCC where the
[SPEAKER_01]: products needed to be recalled because the
test came back, the certificate of
[SPEAKER_01]: analysis was incorrect and then uploaded
later to the BCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whose responsibility is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the retailer's responsibility,
the distributor's responsibility,
[SPEAKER_01]: the manufacturer's responsibility?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it go all the way back up to the
cultivator of the raw source material?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where along that supply chain is it your
responsibility?
[SPEAKER_01]: And does everybody along that supply chain
have insurance?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have not contracted for that,
if there is not evidence to suggest that
[SPEAKER_01]: these types of claims would be covered by
the insurance that is along the supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain, those different actors,
then at the end of the day, it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be everybody's responsibility or it's
going to devolve into litigation in the
[SPEAKER_01]: courts, which are not favorable to
cannabis claims at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we want to look at a specific example,
we can look at testing lab agreements with
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: First and foremost, it is interesting of
note that the testing lab is the only
[SPEAKER_01]: license type along the cannabis supply
chain that is not currently required to
[SPEAKER_01]: carry insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is not currently required to place a
surety bond with the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when they take in your batch samples
currently, according to the BCC,
[SPEAKER_01]: it cannot be released until the test is
performed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, if that testing lab all of a
sudden has too wide of a discrepancy in
[SPEAKER_01]: their COAs and the BCC says stop,
you can no longer take in product or you
[SPEAKER_01]: can no longer process certificate of
analysis, what are you supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's say you have a million dollars of
product waiting in a distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: warehouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll pause for a second, but just note,
is it your distribution warehouse or is it
[SPEAKER_01]: a third party distribution warehouse that
you're now taking up space in because a
[SPEAKER_01]: testing lab is not allowed to continue to
process your testing to release it to go
[SPEAKER_01]: to market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whose responsibility is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're talking about highly sensitive
equipment that may take weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: if not months, to fix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is your product?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it can't be released because you can't
have a secondary test until the first test
[SPEAKER_01]: comes back and you can't force a negative
test when you're not allowed to issue any
[SPEAKER_01]: other test.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product's sitting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: According to the BCC currently,
and this is important to note so that if
[SPEAKER_01]: we have these 15 days of comments and this
has not been addressed by the BCC,
[SPEAKER_01]: it should be an outcry to the regulatory
regulators that this cannot stand because
[SPEAKER_01]: this is an issue that really in the real
world can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to paraphrase, you give it to lab A,
it's stuck at lab A until lab A can clear
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, when you look at it from the
regulator's point of view, they want to
[SPEAKER_01]: prevent lab shopping, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to prevent the fact that you
could go to a different lab until you pass
[SPEAKER_01]: muster.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if the BCC is the one that shuts
them down because they can't issue the
[SPEAKER_01]: test, there should be two bifurcated
scales.
[SPEAKER_01]: There should be the ability to take those
samples and under custody chain of
[SPEAKER_01]: control, either send them to a different
lab that's owned by the same lab A,
[SPEAKER_01]: so lab A1, if they have multiple labs
throughout the state or to a separate lab
[SPEAKER_01]: entirely or to cancel the test entirely,
take new batch samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: And whose responsibility is the batch
sample?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it going to be that lab A that couldn't
fulfill their obligations or is it the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivator that's now responsible for a
second set of batch tests?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have an agreement,
I can promise you that lab A is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: walk away saying this is no longer my
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell me what you would be counseling a
cultivator in Santa Cruz or Monterey
[SPEAKER_00]: County to what clauses would you have them
put in a contract with what other party,
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lab, with a distributor,
with whoever?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you need to have it with your
distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have your own distribution
vertically integrated business or if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a cultivator that's just moving
products up along the supply chain,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to want to have in-house R&D.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll talk about why that's so important
to have that baseline test if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: moving product throughout the supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in this particular instance,
you're going to want to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: your distributor has an agreement with the
testing lab A for intervals of time and
[SPEAKER_01]: what those look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you can clear a product and that
testing lab and that distributor have an
[SPEAKER_01]: agreement that in an instance that they
cannot fulfill their obligations,
[SPEAKER_01]: whose responsibility is it and what
remediation there can be, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: light of knowing what these current issues
are with the way that the BCC is
[SPEAKER_01]: interpreting their regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to go back to if you're a cultivator
and you're just moving product throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the supply chain between a cultivator and
a manufacturer and you don't have to use
[SPEAKER_01]: them, a distributor technically,
there's no QA, QC that's required.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to think about what happens if I
use a transport distribution only
[SPEAKER_01]: licensee.
[SPEAKER_01]: That licensee is not allowed to take
custody and control of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that at some point either the
manufacturer has to carry the
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility all the way through to it
gets to the manufacturer or the
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturer takes over responsibility at
the time that it gets picked up from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivator and arrives at the
manufacturing facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that middleman, that transport
only licensee is now invested with the
[SPEAKER_01]: right to take on the custody of the
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means if you don't test the product
when it's flower, what if it gets into the
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution transport only cargo area and
it gets contaminated and then it gets to
[SPEAKER_01]: the manufacturer, the manufacturer turns
it into a manufactured good and then
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever that contaminant is concentrates
together and all of a sudden tests dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where, who is responsible?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's no evidence, if there's no
issuance of a certificate that says this
[SPEAKER_01]: was tested, it was clean, it was put into
here, that was my responsibility,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's coverage, there's insurance that
ensures me to get the product to the
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturer and then the manufacturer's
liability sets in and I'm absolved of
[SPEAKER_01]: liability as the cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't have these things
buttoned up, there's no way to know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're in a he said, she said
issue, you're going to court, the court's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna ask, do you have an agreement?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna have a purchase order.
[SPEAKER_01]: Purchase order isn't gonna go into the
devil of the details of what the recall
[SPEAKER_01]: procedures are, what the remediation
procedures are, who's responsibility was
[SPEAKER_01]: it, at what point in time of the supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all things that really need to
be discussed and are going to be unique
[SPEAKER_01]: between the parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can generate a suite of templative
agreements, which is what I'm hoping that
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll see as an industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's practice and pleading agreements
all over the place and other same or
[SPEAKER_01]: similar industries that we can borrow
from, terms of service, disclaimers,
[SPEAKER_01]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we work through that, you'll be
able to then just start to tinker with the
[SPEAKER_01]: specific terms that have to deal with your
specific transaction between two parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does this kind of flow through to party A
and party B's insurance carrier as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you don't have a clause that
says who's liable, both insurance,
[SPEAKER_00]: like the insurance companies are all about
not paying out, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're gonna be like, well,
it doesn't say that you're liable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why do I need to pay out?
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you sort of say that this also sort
of dominoes into your each respective
[SPEAKER_00]: party's insurance carriers and claims and
things like that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're gonna want to have as an
attachment to these documents,
[SPEAKER_01]: the insurance carriers, making sure that
the insurance is going to cover these
[SPEAKER_01]: types of risks and making sure they know
that you're transporting cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that seems weird in today's world,
but we're still seeing people not exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: be on the up and up.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a wellness company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna want to have as an exhibit
their state and local licensing and what
[SPEAKER_01]: those requirements are so that you're not
as the end consumer is the end retailer
[SPEAKER_01]: taking in product that you can't actually
sell because the license was expired.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's all of these things that you
need to be aware of and they can be
[SPEAKER_01]: documented through this agreement process,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to have child resistant packaging
that meets the Poison Prevention Act of
[SPEAKER_01]: 1970.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are procuring packaged material,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're at the actual package that
you're gonna put the product in,
[SPEAKER_01]: does that company certify?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it have some sort of certification
that they can provide you with that would
[SPEAKER_01]: go into that agreement that says all of
the packaging is child resistant and meets
[SPEAKER_01]: the 1970 Poison Prevention Act so that if
somebody calls you out on it, you can say,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, I've contracted for I looked at and if
there is an issue where it does not meet
[SPEAKER_01]: that requirement, you have that company on
the hook.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've made that agreement that promise
with you that you can take to court.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so you're gonna want as the
manufacturing entity when you enter into
[SPEAKER_01]: an agreement with the packing source
material provider, whether that be in
[SPEAKER_01]: China or somewhere domestically,
that they understand what your needs are,
[SPEAKER_01]: what your requirements are, that it must
be child resistant and it must meet this
[SPEAKER_01]: agreement with the 1970 Poison Prevention
Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are certifications.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are actually supposed to have that
certification readily available if DPH
[SPEAKER_01]: were to ask for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What so we've touched on cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just that was sort of a manufacturing
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We touched on labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you seeing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Distributors?
[SPEAKER_00]: What clauses do you see distributors
wanting to put into contracts on both
[SPEAKER_00]: sides of the?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, one when they're dealing with
retailers and two when they're dealing
[SPEAKER_00]: with with maybe the manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, distributors in that instance are
looking for a final form product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you are the same distributor that
also holds a manufacturing license.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're producing final form product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're taking it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to look for the testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're going to call
distributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: With manufacturers are basically looking
at terms of service when you are looking
[SPEAKER_01]: at recall procedures, what that's going to
look like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the product has to be recalled because
there's some issue that they've now taken
[SPEAKER_01]: in and it either is discovered through
testing that there's a problem or there's
[SPEAKER_01]: a leakage in the cart that all of a sudden
they're going to have to recall it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have mechanisms in place for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the time frames?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the responsibilities?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's going to have to deal with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: A distributor is really specifically going
to want to know how they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: engage with the provider of that product
with the manufacturer of that product from
[SPEAKER_01]: retail to from from a distributor to
retailer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're really going to want to box out
again how that distributor is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with that same situation in a recall.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they going to have the back stock?
[SPEAKER_01]: How quickly are they going to be able to
get it to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why?
[SPEAKER_01]: Under what circumstances is a recall
triggered for them?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to want to look at from a
retailer's point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making sure that that distributor has good
testing agreements in place in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: fulfill orders since we're looking to
likely have a secondary level extinction
[SPEAKER_01]: event with bare bones products on the
shelves when phase three testing comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making sure that the labs of which we know
there may be one to two that are currently
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you dealing with one of the
distributors that has access to one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: labs that may be able to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that scenario, the retailer would
say, we'd like to carry products that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're distributing, but can you show us
which lab you're working with so we can
[SPEAKER_00]: have comfort?
[SPEAKER_01]: They can ask for that when you're doing
contract negotiations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The the door is wide open for you to ask
these critical questions, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time that they become issues,
you're not asking questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're demanding answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're demanding action.
[SPEAKER_01]: And wouldn't it be better?
[SPEAKER_01]: Wouldn't you feel more comfortable as
you're marching ever closer to the first
[SPEAKER_01]: of the year and the onboarding of metric
and the onboarding of phase three testing
[SPEAKER_01]: and any new requirements that come out
that you have a course of action if things
[SPEAKER_01]: go south, if the inevitable occurs,
if a COA comes back dirty, if there is
[SPEAKER_01]: product lost in transit, if there is CHP
pulls you over and then takes in an entire
[SPEAKER_01]: shipment of product and puts it in to a
detention facility that isn't human
[SPEAKER_01]: controlled and potentially loses an entire
crop of product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whose responsibility is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It has happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will continue to happen while we have
this federal overlay of illegality.
[SPEAKER_01]: These issues are still going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're not talking about them now,
you're likely causing yourself harm in the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are tough conversations.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sitting here saying they're easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not sitting here saying that every
operator is ready, willing and excited to
[SPEAKER_01]: engage in this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's arduous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's continually shifting.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're not investing in yourself
and your business and putting in place
[SPEAKER_01]: practices and agreements that deal with
these complex issues, when they become
[SPEAKER_01]: issues, nobody's in the best head space to
address them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're scrambling to survive their own
livelihood.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're scrambling to make sure that the
people that they took the product from,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it's a distributor, they're able to pay
when those trigger points for payment are
[SPEAKER_01]: done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're different for everyone along
the supply chain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: A distributor is going to want to do COD,
care on delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to want to make sure that
they collect that excise tax right up
[SPEAKER_01]: front.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm representing a retailer,
I may not want to pay that excise tax
[SPEAKER_01]: right up front.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's important to also have your own
representation, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The time has come where people are going
to start to need general counsel in-house,
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's all of these things in flux.
[SPEAKER_01]: Note in the BCC regulations, it says every
contract you have should be on file at
[SPEAKER_01]: your facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're anticipating you having contracts
by that sheer statement alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the times of a handshake deal are over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's time to embrace having contracts and
learning what needs to be in them and
[SPEAKER_01]: working collaboratively together.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the beginning, that'll be easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more finite these contracts get,
the power players are going to be in a
[SPEAKER_01]: position to push the contract terms that
they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're in a scenario where the market
customers are experiencing a defect in the
[SPEAKER_01]: product, there is leakage in the vape
cart, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's systemic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are coming in to all of the
different retailers across, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: the state, really, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we have statewide distribution,
and that's what every manufacturer brand
[SPEAKER_01]: is after.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got statewide distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got a leaky vape cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are coming into the dispensaries in
droves, angry, saying, my product is
[SPEAKER_01]: defective.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're calling the BCC with their,
you know, enforcement line, and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: something that needs to be done,
correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so we've got this scenario in a
contract list environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's say there's potential harm in
the leakage, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's contaminating with the filament in
the vape cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could potentially harm somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're looking at, somebody's looking
to sue over product's liability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the more normalized we get,
the more product's liability you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the second that you can get into
federal court where there are trouble
[SPEAKER_01]: damages in this area and negligence starts
to apply, that's a whole nother bag of
[SPEAKER_01]: worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: But so if you have no contract,
that one person or that class actions of
[SPEAKER_01]: persons can go after everybody along that
supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because everybody had a hand in that
product getting to where it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to build in indemnifications
and places where you, the operator,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending along where you are in the
supply chain, says I'm no longer
[SPEAKER_01]: responsible or somebody else is
responsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you backtrack it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're a retailer and you're dealing
with a distributor, what are the recall
[SPEAKER_01]: procedures?
[SPEAKER_01]: I noticed that this is happening,
that there is a recall out.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are bringing in the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to destroy that product in
accordance with my waste management
[SPEAKER_01]: procedures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where does that cost come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Am I assessing that to the distributor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what's in my agreement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the distributor should have an
agreement with the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that instance, the distributor goes
to the manufacturer and says, you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: cover this cost and we have to get product
to these shelves or you no longer are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have that shelf space,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a systemic issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the manufacturer goes back to who
they purchased that vape cart from before
[SPEAKER_01]: they put the oil in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say, this is not what I contract
for.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a major defect.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a fundamental flaw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have now caused a series of chain
reactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're responsible, liable,
and you need to cover that cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see if there are specific
provisions along that supply chain,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll know what to do from your vertical.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next vertical will be their
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the distributor may be in a situation
where they have to pay out and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: go to the manufacturer to get their
payment.
[SPEAKER_01]: The manufacturer goes to somebody else.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now there may be lawsuits anywhere along
that continuum, but wherever you are,
[SPEAKER_01]: retailer to distributor, distributor to
manufacturer, manufacturer to supplier of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cart itself, of the device,
those are insulated agreements.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're protecting where you are along
that supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being cognizant that the person before you
may not have done that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A hot potato liability is generally how
the law works, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where along that supply chain is there a
protection?
[SPEAKER_01]: And where is my liability cut off by an
intervening cause of somebody else?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, that will happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it happened with Lulz when they
took it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lulz was a testing issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the COA changed after 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the testing lab in that instance,
I believe, reissued the COA, which went to
[SPEAKER_01]: the BCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they were acting as their own
distributor, which I believe in that
[SPEAKER_01]: instance, they were, I can't say for
certain.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you were your own distributor and
you had a cultivation license and you were
[SPEAKER_01]: doing pre-rolls and the tests came back,
you would want to have a provision that
[SPEAKER_01]: puts that testing lab on the hook.
[SPEAKER_01]: That if they change their mind,
if they change that COA after 24 hours
[SPEAKER_01]: after issuance, really after the point at
which it goes to the BCC and that product
[SPEAKER_01]: has been cleared to market, that they then
would be responsible for any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: monetary costs associated with a change in
the COA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the issue there was you approved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We then released it to dispensaries up and
down the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had you dinged us at that initial point,
we would not have put in 100 dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: and then had to have it all blow up in our
face.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Had reputational issues, had issues that
were monetarily where those retailers may
[SPEAKER_01]: not use you again.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lost a market share.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's bad from a public optics perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: These issues are much larger than that
very small issue to begin with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: They balloon out and in a space where we
have pure saturation of new products and
[SPEAKER_01]: new brands coming in every day,
a recall of that sort of magnitude or the
[SPEAKER_01]: inability to get your product to market
because it is held back waiting for a
[SPEAKER_01]: testing lab that's been put on ice by the
BCC for some issue with their technical
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment, you could lose that market
share without really the ability to gain
[SPEAKER_01]: it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not talking about small things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about the arrows that could
take out your business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're asking you to put words down on
paper that articulate responsibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you peel back this idea that
the lawyers are trying to get in and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're trying to make more money,
um, during this tumultuous, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: wave of regulation, they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're putting contractual terms on paper
that ensure that all the parties are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: what they said they were going to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you strip it away to that bare
basic necessity, it's just taking the
[SPEAKER_01]: terms and the agreements that you've said
that you would do and putting them down on
[SPEAKER_01]: writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can look no further than back to July
1, where retailers were left holding the
[SPEAKER_01]: bag with manufactured product that didn't
meet the requirements on July 1 that
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't switched out as they were promised
with no recourse.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was because nobody put down the,
I promise I will come on the 29th or the
[SPEAKER_01]: 30th or the 31st and change out that
product into an agreement that was signed,
[SPEAKER_01]: executed in writing that you could take to
court.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hooray for agreements.
Thank you.
