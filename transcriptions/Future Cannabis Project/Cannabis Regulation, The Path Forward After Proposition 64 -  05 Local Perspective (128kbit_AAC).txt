[SPEAKER_04]: Our local perspective, we have Tim
Cromartie, Legislative Representative for
[SPEAKER_04]: the League of California Cities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cara Martinson, California State
Association of Counties.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chief Ron Lawrence, Chief of Police for
Citrus Heights Police Department.
[SPEAKER_04]: Captain Jerry Alejandre, San Joaquin
County Sheriff's Office.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you all for joining us this morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: The League, as you know, was very active
in helping craft and shepherd the Medical
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabis Regulation and Safety Act.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have a set of priorities with
regard to the passage of Proposition 64
[SPEAKER_05]: and the reconciliation.
[SPEAKER_05]: First, we think it is essential to
establish a means of verifying local
[SPEAKER_05]: compliance prior to the issuance of a
state license.
[SPEAKER_05]: The medical act was very clear on this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Local approval was absolutely required
prior to applying for a state license.
[SPEAKER_05]: Prop 64, on the other hand, expressly
states that applicants are not required to
[SPEAKER_05]: submit evidence of local approval with a
state application.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is, however, another provision
saying that state license cannot be issued
[SPEAKER_05]: if it's in violation of local ordinances.
[SPEAKER_05]: So even with that provision, the way it's
written, state agencies are going to be in
[SPEAKER_05]: the unfortunate position of having to
chase after individual local jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_05]: to get their licenses and then
unfortunately interpret them unless
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a change in the law.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have helped develop language that we
think would meaningfully restore a means
[SPEAKER_05]: of verifying local compliance to avoid
problems with licenses being issued when
[SPEAKER_05]: they're not in concert with what the local
regulatory structure is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Second, we would ask the legislature to
bear in mind the likely federal reaction
[SPEAKER_05]: in crafting various parts of the
regulatory structure, reconciling Prop 64
[SPEAKER_05]: with the medical act.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do know from the coal memo and other
sources from the Department of Justice
[SPEAKER_05]: that two of the federal litmus tests are
diversion and inversion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Inversion helping to facilitate the mixing
of illegal unregulated product with legal
[SPEAKER_05]: regulated product and export outside
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Small Growers Association has stated
publicly that currently California
[SPEAKER_05]: consumes only 30% of what it produces.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the other 70% is already going out of
state.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there is an issue with respect to
likely federal intervention just on the
[SPEAKER_05]: amount of product that's being generated.
[SPEAKER_05]: In that regard, we would urge caution in
approving type five licenses which allow
[SPEAKER_05]: for unlimited cultivation in five years
without some further restrictions.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, a certification by the
Department of Food and Ag that there is
[SPEAKER_05]: some supply side problem with the current
amount of cultivation underway in
[SPEAKER_05]: California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Colorado is being sued on this basis alone
by neighboring states right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Something to bear in mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: We would respectfully urge caution in
deciding upon how products will be
[SPEAKER_05]: distributed in California.
[SPEAKER_05]: Distribution, whether it is vertical
integration or mandatory third party
[SPEAKER_05]: distribution should have sufficient
regulatory components and controls in
[SPEAKER_05]: place to ensure compliance both with state
law as well as to facilitate federal
[SPEAKER_05]: enforcement for any violations.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that we think would be
helpful would be uniform required
[SPEAKER_05]: electronic manifests.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, cities have no interest in
crafting local regulations, particularly
[SPEAKER_05]: in regard to cities that have embraced
this change in law and are looking at it
[SPEAKER_05]: as a potential source of revenue to
replace state subsidies such as the loss
[SPEAKER_05]: of redevelopment in enterprise zones.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have no interest in crafting local
regulations, engaging in planning and
[SPEAKER_05]: zoning activities to allow these
facilities, affirmatively permitting them,
[SPEAKER_05]: and finally developing a local tax
structure only to have the federal
[SPEAKER_05]: government sweep in and shut it all down.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we would urge caution in how this is
all arranged in the future in regard to
[SPEAKER_05]: any reconciliation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Finally, a note on the tax rate.
[SPEAKER_05]: The tax rate is there's a state excise tax
of 15%.
[SPEAKER_05]: The league opposed similar legislation
last year, Senate Bill 987, simply because
[SPEAKER_05]: we thought it was too high.
[SPEAKER_05]: 10% would be a little more reasonable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we opposed that for two reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: One, we are concerned about the
stimulation of black market activity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And second, we were bearing in mind the
cumulative tax rate and the fact that
[SPEAKER_05]: local governments may want to add on their
own local taxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And 15% certainly seem to crowd that out,
the possibility for those additional local
[SPEAKER_05]: tax measures.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, in educating our members about this
change in law, we have urged that they
[SPEAKER_05]: look at local existing local tax measures
to see if there are any revenue streams
[SPEAKER_05]: that can be established that are marijuana
related before they rush to enact some new
[SPEAKER_05]: form of local tax.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having said that, the 15% tax rate in the
long term is probably going to need to be
[SPEAKER_05]: lowered.
[SPEAKER_05]: That concludes my remarks.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kara Martinson with the California State
Association of Counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having us come speak
to you today and provide some feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really do appreciate the
conversation and some of the comments that
[SPEAKER_00]: were made by previous panels because I
think they highlight some of the issues
[SPEAKER_00]: that the league and CSAC are continuing to
focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were very involved in the development
of the MCRSA and were able to provide some
[SPEAKER_00]: early and initial input into Prop 64 and
that local control piece was extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: important to local governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while we recognize that it's difficult
to manage 58 counties in 480 some cities,
[SPEAKER_00]: different regulatory programs,
we thought that that was necessary for
[SPEAKER_00]: jurisdictions to be able to reflect the
will of their community.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is a lot happening at the local
level and I think we can tell by where
[SPEAKER_00]: Prop 64 passed about two-thirds of
California counties voted in favor of
[SPEAKER_00]: Proposition 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we do think that will be somewhat
reflective of how cannabis is regulated at
[SPEAKER_00]: the local level with that local control
piece in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned, there's a lot of activity
happening right now within the city and
[SPEAKER_00]: county level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just as a snapshot, I believe there were
53 local city and county ballot measures
[SPEAKER_00]: on the November 2016 ballot related to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: 39 of those successful and out of those
there were seven county tax measures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to what the Prop 64 already
sets into statute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So folks at the local level are thinking
about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're working with the regulatory
agencies that were up here and I would
[SPEAKER_00]: like to thank them for their outreach to
us and being available to answer our
[SPEAKER_00]: questions because that coordination is
going to be extremely important in order
[SPEAKER_00]: for the state to meet its statutory
obligations.
[SPEAKER_00]: The obligation of issuing licenses January
1, 2018, local governments are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have to have their programs in place as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a vested interest in seeing
this state be successful and have them
[SPEAKER_00]: achieve their goals so that we are able to
do that as well at the local level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do have a concern related to timing
because of the urgency and drafts still
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and that we haven't seen yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would encourage the agencies to
continue to outreach to us because there
[SPEAKER_00]: are a number of counties out there that
are ahead of the curve that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: working on medical marijuana, have
developed their own track and trace
[SPEAKER_00]: programs that have developed their own
licensing schemes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we feel that we have a lot of expertise
in this area in some jurisdictions and can
[SPEAKER_00]: offer comments and input into that
regulatory process.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition, some of the other fellow
panelists have made comments and I won't
[SPEAKER_00]: reiterate but there are many differences
between the MCRSA and Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the local licensing piece,
we've heard a lot about the role of the ad
[SPEAKER_00]: commissioners and the role of
environmental health directors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're very interested to see what
those draft regulations look like and if
[SPEAKER_00]: they contemplate a role for our department
heads in any type of state regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: scheme.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be very important to coordinate
with us, obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also very concerned about
enforcement at the local level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who takes care of that and what that
piece looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure some of my colleagues on the
law enforcement side will touch on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, I do think the revenue
collection and the banking component of
[SPEAKER_00]: this conversation is extremely important
and probably one of our most challenging
[SPEAKER_00]: issues, if I do say so myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: CSAC and my boss, Matt Kate, sits on the
Treasurer's Banking Working Group.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are committed to working with all
those entities involved to develop an
[SPEAKER_00]: interim solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's fair to say that there is an
extreme amount of uncertainty at the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we wait for clarity and guidance,
we are also working on implementing our
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need to be thinking about how we
deal with that cash situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my understanding that there are only
two BOE districts that accept cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And likewise, at the county level with the
Treasurer's, tax collectors at the
[SPEAKER_00]: counter, they're not equipped to deal with
the amount of cash that we'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting if there is also a local tax
measure in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're working with folks at the level,
talking to folks at the state level,
[SPEAKER_00]: and trying to develop some creative
solutions to that challenging and nuanced
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, thank you for having me here
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Happy to answer any questions and look
forward to the continued partnership.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, and thank you for your
testimony.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad to hear the departments are
working well with both entities.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I don't know, captain or chief?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you will, whoever would like to begin
first, chief?
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning, Chairman Salas and members
of this critically important joint
[SPEAKER_02]: oversight hearing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for including the perspectives
of local law enforcement on this panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name's Ron Lawrence.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the police chief for the city of
Citrus Heights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm also the third vice president for the
California Police Chiefs Association,
[SPEAKER_02]: of whom I'm here talking on behalf of
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: As a statewide association, the California
police chiefs find ourselves in the
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting situation of supporting the
medical marijuana legislation signed by
[SPEAKER_02]: Governor Brown in 2015, and we strongly
opposed Proposition 64 for a wide variety
[SPEAKER_02]: of reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: We now join many of the stakeholders here
today in working together to balance the
[SPEAKER_02]: often conflicting interests behind the
MCRSA and the AUMA to develop one
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory structure for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: In doing so, California police chiefs will
continue to advocate for absolute local
[SPEAKER_02]: control, dual state and local licensing,
limits on vertical integration,
[SPEAKER_02]: and cross-licensing and thorough
background checks for licensees.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, in ushering into the commercial
structure of marijuana through ballot
[SPEAKER_02]: initiative brings a new set of problems as
police chiefs have challenges and issues
[SPEAKER_02]: facing us, and we look forward to working
with you and all the stakeholders at
[SPEAKER_02]: getting them addressed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to stick with five fundamental
overarching concerns that the police
[SPEAKER_02]: chiefs have, and I'm going to keep them in
very brief summary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: First and foremost is for us to protect
local control.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each of our communities is vastly and
wildly unique and different with different
[SPEAKER_02]: sets of expectations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our policy makers at the local level,
the city councils, and our board of
[SPEAKER_02]: supervisors must have the latitude and the
agility to craft policy and ordinances
[SPEAKER_02]: that best suit the needs and expectation
of our local communities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, the commercial system is one
based on increased use and sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is critical that stakeholders work
together to deter, identify, and
[SPEAKER_02]: successfully prosecute marijuana impaired
drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number three, advertising and branding are
sure to come with the newly established
[SPEAKER_02]: for-profit industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We urge all of us to prevent our history
with the tobacco industry and its impact
[SPEAKER_02]: on our youth from repeating itself to
ensure that Joe cannabis or marijuana man
[SPEAKER_02]: don't crop up and become common fixtures
in our society.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're very supportive of the regulations
surrounding proper packaging of edibles
[SPEAKER_02]: and the non-advertising to our youth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number four, state and local law
enforcement entities in our criminal
[SPEAKER_02]: justice system need to work across
jurisdictional boundaries to ensure that
[SPEAKER_02]: our legal justice system is not exploited
to embolden the black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number five and lastly, we cannot ignore
the inflexible nature of a ballot
[SPEAKER_02]: initiative.
[SPEAKER_02]: As new challenges and needs present
themselves, we will be hard pressed to
[SPEAKER_02]: identify solutions that do not conflict
with the language in Proposition 64.
[SPEAKER_02]: This will require all of us to have
creative thinking, all of us leaders and
[SPEAKER_02]: stakeholders, who cannot be deterred from
solving real problems as a result of the
[SPEAKER_02]: initiative's stringent amendment language.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mr. Chairman, on behalf of the California
Police Chiefs Association, we look forward
[SPEAKER_02]: to working with you and all the
stakeholders on moving this forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, and thank you for that
perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go ahead and move to Captain,
if you will, please.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good morning, Captain Jarrell Ahundrey,
San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office,
[SPEAKER_07]: also representing the Cal State Sheriff's
Association.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mr. Chair, Madam Chair, thank you,
and subcommittee, thank you very much for
[SPEAKER_07]: this opportunity to speak.
[SPEAKER_07]: As Chief Lawrence just eloquently put,
that we agree with what the Cal State
[SPEAKER_07]: Chiefs of Police Association agree with,
and the sentiments on their concerns on
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm kind of here as more of a boots on the
ground, I work a task force that deals
[SPEAKER_07]: with narcotics and stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so the goals are looking, we're
developing policy procedures now to follow
[SPEAKER_07]: the new laws as written to provide best
service to the community while upholding
[SPEAKER_07]: the law of the state, and the public
safety is number one.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was fortunate enough to go to Colorado
during July to meet with the Colorado
[SPEAKER_07]: Chiefs of Police and other leagues of
supporting and supportive, to understand
[SPEAKER_07]: what the impact had occurred in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: From what we've learned from that,
and we believe, we anticipate increase in
[SPEAKER_07]: the marijuana activity in several areas,
including the black market.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's still rampant there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Drug driving is a concern.
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, vehicle accidents, the rise
that occurred from this.
[SPEAKER_07]: Marijuana use in and near schools and
parks.
[SPEAKER_07]: Increase in emergency room visits to the
toxicity, overdoses, and psychotic
[SPEAKER_07]: episodes that will come for this.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're kind of at right now, we have
unknown as to where the licensing
[SPEAKER_07]: regulation agencies are going to be as we
learned in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_07]: One key component they did is law
enforcement was tied directly with the
[SPEAKER_07]: regulatory agency.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they created a task force, as you
would, to work with them because you can
[SPEAKER_07]: be dealing with a dangerous commodity in
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's a concern.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we look forward to developing a
relationship with the regulatory board in
[SPEAKER_07]: the states and with local things.
[SPEAKER_07]: Another concern will be, they talked about
the pesticides found in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Currently, going to, as we do,
is we eradicate marijuana cultivation
[SPEAKER_07]: sites right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: As we go to these sites, we are finding
common household pesticides in there you
[SPEAKER_07]: can purchase at Home Depot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's obviously going to be a concern
for the regulatory agencies and who,
[SPEAKER_07]: while they'll deal with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: As you know, cigarette smoking is banned
in different areas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just like the smoky of marijuana is banned
in areas.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, that is a hard road to enforce,
as you see, because with the new vaporized
[SPEAKER_07]: cigarettes, you're really not sure what
people are smoking.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's going to be an interesting
challenge with law enforcement to work on
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just in general, and just to give you a
rough idea, is my county in the last five
[SPEAKER_07]: years.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the last five years, we have eradicated
illegal, cultivation grows 650,000 plants.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is involving 525 cases.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was in the last five years on
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the hopeful of this is that we move
forward and the different areas work
[SPEAKER_07]: together.
[SPEAKER_07]: The other thing is with these regulatory
commissions, with the Department of
[SPEAKER_07]: Justice, years back we had the Bureau of
Narcotics Enforcement as a regulatory arm
[SPEAKER_07]: with them.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would probably be very helpful in
having a creation of that again to help
[SPEAKER_07]: work with these bureaus in the dealing
with these issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: ATF or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you for your testimony.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we just get the questions right
where we left off with public safety.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm just curious to see what you guys
are doing locally.
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned some of the things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you mentioned perhaps from the
previous panel we talked about the
[SPEAKER_04]: advisory committee.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I would imagine you guys would want
to play a part in the advisory committee.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know when you said you went to Colorado
as a task force, but here in California we
[SPEAKER_04]: have that advisory committee.
[SPEAKER_04]: So hopefully we can see if we can connect
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would imagine law enforcement would want
to be a part of the advisory committee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just given the amount of questions I
always get back home, I would imagine you
[SPEAKER_04]: get the same questions as well throughout
the entire state and throughout your
[SPEAKER_04]: associations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Question centers around for the local land
use and for our law enforcement
[SPEAKER_06]: professionals.
[SPEAKER_06]: How we ensure that we don't have a mild
distribution of marijuana related
[SPEAKER_06]: activities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me speak specifically to what I'm
concerned about.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the area of Los Angeles that I
represent, known as South Los Angeles,
[SPEAKER_06]: we have too many liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_06]: So much so that we have a moratorium on
new on and off site liquor licensing that
[SPEAKER_06]: we have substantial conditions as a part
of getting a new license or renewing
[SPEAKER_06]: license or even the transfer of a license.
[SPEAKER_06]: That process includes our local planning
department and the state alcohol beverage
[SPEAKER_06]: control commission.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's effectively a moratorium on
the issuance of new licenses.
[SPEAKER_06]: Despite that, we still have concentrations
of liquor in South Los Angeles that are
[SPEAKER_06]: disproportionately high to the population.
[SPEAKER_06]: It will require eventually that we change
state law.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we prevent marijuana businesses,
particularly the retail customer facing
[SPEAKER_06]: businesses, that's the great concern that
I have as an urban legislator,
[SPEAKER_06]: from being over concentrated in certain
communities?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let me, if they don't mind,
I'll go first on this.
[SPEAKER_07]: In the business of Colorado, that is a
strong concern and problem they actually
[SPEAKER_07]: do have with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The concentration in the lower economic
areas, in urban areas of the cities is
[SPEAKER_07]: where the highly concentrated areas of
these are.
[SPEAKER_07]: So with local bands, the ability of the
local bands and the regulations on that,
[SPEAKER_07]: they can probably start specifying
specific areas of how many per area to
[SPEAKER_07]: grow, which was the opportunity we will
need to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just jump in really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kara Martinson with California State
Association of Counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an excellent point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was really sort of the
genesis of our local control argument
[SPEAKER_00]: within specifically Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's extremely important for local
jurisdictions to decide, A, do they want
[SPEAKER_00]: to regulate or do they want to ban?
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to make that decision from the
will of the community, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what that local land use and
zoning looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a process that a lot of folks
are going through now at the local level,
[SPEAKER_00]: identifying sensitive use areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, we don't want these facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are next to schools or children or
other areas.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that is all- But in some instances,
we don't want these facilities,
[SPEAKER_06]: honestly, near anybody.
[SPEAKER_06]: And not in any substantial concentration.
[SPEAKER_06]: So my question would be, is there a
deficiency in the Adult Medical Use Act,
[SPEAKER_06]: Prop 64, that might invite state
legislation that says, per capita,
[SPEAKER_06]: you don't have more than X amount of
dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it 1,000 people?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it in relation to a physical place?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're talking about sensitive use?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's my concern, that Western
Avenue, Crenshaw Boulevard, Pico and
[SPEAKER_06]: Olympic are going to be concentrated by
more and more nuisance businesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I could respond, most of these- Is this
on?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the retail businesses are going to
be located within municipalities.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is where local control comes in.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is critically important and we tell,
the league is going around doing trainings
[SPEAKER_05]: to various cities for Prop 64,
as we did for the medical act.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we tell them that if you are
interested in controlling this problem,
[SPEAKER_05]: it is absolutely critical.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we very often point to the city of
Oakland, because the problem, you're
[SPEAKER_05]: absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem with liquor stores,
we don't want repeated on with respect to
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been criticism about the number of
liquor stores and over concentration,
[SPEAKER_05]: there is an over concentration statute in
the code governing the establishment of
[SPEAKER_05]: liquor licensees, which to the best of my
knowledge has rarely ever been enforced.
[SPEAKER_05]: Basically, it says a license shall not be
issued if there are concerns about over
[SPEAKER_05]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_05]: That statute has been copied into both the
medical act and Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the real solution is for locals to be
strategic about how they allow these
[SPEAKER_05]: businesses into their communities if
they're going to allow them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we urge cities to take a page from
city of Oakland.
[SPEAKER_05]: What they did, they were very strategic
about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They adopted a per capita formula for how
many dispensaries they would ultimately
[SPEAKER_05]: have.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you do that, one per 35,000
residents or what have you, you will never
[SPEAKER_05]: have an explosion of businesses that
outgrows your ability to regulate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: The other thing we caution cities is
whether it's a numerical cap or the per
[SPEAKER_05]: capita formula, it is important to set
some kind of a cap because you do not
[SPEAKER_05]: want, bearing in mind that this is still
an all cash business, you're going to have
[SPEAKER_05]: to do audits for a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're going to want to have a handle on
the amount of traffic, the amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: product that's being moved, the amount of
revenue that's being generated.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have a local tax in place,
you are also going to want to know if the
[SPEAKER_05]: city is getting its fair share of the
revenue based on the total volume of
[SPEAKER_05]: traffic.
[SPEAKER_05]: You will know none of that unless you have
an audit protocol that is set up to audit
[SPEAKER_05]: 100% of the businesses in your
jurisdiction on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the problems they had in Denver,
Colorado is they were passing out permits
[SPEAKER_05]: like hotcakes in the Denver metropolitan
area, and the scope of the businesses and
[SPEAKER_05]: the traffic quickly outgrew the ability to
audit it, and the feds had to come in and
[SPEAKER_05]: do a sting operation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we caution folks to be very cautious,
be strategic.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want a tax measure, put it on the
local ballot, make sure it's Prop 218
[SPEAKER_05]: compliant, but have a formula for the
number of businesses you will ultimately
[SPEAKER_05]: have in your jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the answer to the question.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a question of local control.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I represent three municipalities,
a portion of the city of Englewood,
[SPEAKER_06]: the entirety of the city of Culver City,
and almost 300,000 people in the city of
[SPEAKER_06]: Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_06]: In the city of Los Angeles, there are five
council districts that text the assembly
[SPEAKER_06]: district that I have the privilege to
represent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Each of those council districts are driven
by land use decisions primarily connected
[SPEAKER_06]: to the local representative at the time
and place.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if a local representative is interested
in seeing many of these permits issued
[SPEAKER_06]: because of local control, and we've ceded
that authority to them, and they leave
[SPEAKER_06]: office, and like liquor stores,
we live with an over concentration.
[SPEAKER_06]: If that statute was copied into the Adult
Medical Use Act, that we have a fatal
[SPEAKER_06]: flaws with respect to over concentration
issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because in areas, it is easy to see.
[SPEAKER_06]: It doesn't even take critical analysis to
see the concentration of liquor.
[SPEAKER_06]: And before our proposition D locally,
which significantly reduced dispensaries
[SPEAKER_06]: in particular, we had an over
concentration all throughout South Los
[SPEAKER_06]: Angeles.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for the committee chairs, and I know
that the local government committee chairs
[SPEAKER_06]: here, this is something that I will be
working on very closely with each of you
[SPEAKER_06]: today.
[SPEAKER_06]: To the extent that you care to,
because I'm afraid that my area and areas
[SPEAKER_06]: adjacent in South Los Angeles are going to
bear the brunt of the retail interaction
[SPEAKER_06]: with marijuana users and dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they are nuisance businesses and you
cannot adequately accommodate cleaning
[SPEAKER_06]: them up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it is different in Los Angeles than
anywhere else.
[SPEAKER_06]: The challenges and having cash businesses
is about the biggest nuisance that anyone
[SPEAKER_06]: who lives in my area or has been there for
any period of time can understand.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's the perspective of this
legislator who represents a quarter
[SPEAKER_06]: roughly of South Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Mr. Ridley-Thomas.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we heard local control is a
big factor of it, and from our public
[SPEAKER_04]: safety also that local control.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know from us was we're working with
the associations, but also with our locals
[SPEAKER_04]: as well, making sure that they have the
proper ordinances in place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ms. Cabrera brought up a good point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you want to state it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have a question about who's going to
keep track of all the local jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_01]: so that we know what it is that they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm with you on this one, but the
regulatory structure for alcohol is really
[SPEAKER_01]: different than what is in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have to rely on our locals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the only way we can do that is if we
know what it is that they've passed and we
[SPEAKER_01]: know what it is that they're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from my perspective in my
jurisdiction, one of the mayors just ended
[SPEAKER_01]: up being recalled because of the vote of
the council.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the public is paying a lot of attention
and they're getting very engaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they want to know, they want to have
some control over this and they weren't
[SPEAKER_01]: happy with their elected.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is there somebody that will be keeping
track of all of the different decisions
[SPEAKER_01]: that the locals make?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's change, can change the,
I'm assuming it's going to be a website or
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of a page where you can get that
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is, and I really appreciate your
comments, because the police chiefs
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely share your concern with over
saturation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there is a model today.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ABC, for example, the regulatory
agency that oversees liquor licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before a business can go to a local
community, that local city council and
[SPEAKER_02]: that police chief gets that information
from ABC.
[SPEAKER_02]: And ABC and the local have to agree on the
number of licenses in their community and
[SPEAKER_02]: to ensure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That there's not any over saturation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now they're responsible to make sure that
they deny them if there is an over
[SPEAKER_02]: saturation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is that checks and balances with
liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope that our regulatory act going
forward with marijuana will include a
[SPEAKER_02]: similar model for those communities that
allow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, unfortunately what happened is that
before that process with the locals was
[SPEAKER_01]: involved, ABC could award as many licenses
as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So many of our communities are really
challenged because we already have over
[SPEAKER_01]: concentration and it wasn't until the
public necessity condition was placed on
[SPEAKER_01]: local governments that it gave local
governments the opportunity to have that
[SPEAKER_01]: dialogue and to discuss it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm really looking globally as to
whether anybody is going to be keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: data on what the different, the 58
counties and the 400 and however many
[SPEAKER_01]: cities that we have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that we can look at it to see what it
is that has been done within the state of
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just for our own purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's an excellent point.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think in addition to our associations
that are working to do that, there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: need I think for an entity at the state
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is an advisory committee as it was
stated that's required by 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the local licensing piece isn't clear
in 64 as it is in the MCRSA.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're waiting to see what those draft
regulations look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously the state cannot issue a license
that's in conflict with the local
[SPEAKER_00]: ordinance but how they find that out and
who keeps that information and what that
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like is extremely important as we
move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: But CSAC and the league I know are
committed to working on this issue and we
[SPEAKER_00]: do have ideas about how we can fill that
void.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think what we're trying to do is
make sure we don't all collect this
[SPEAKER_04]: information and keep it within our own
association when obviously there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: bigger need to share that information with
everyone and perhaps Ms. Ajax will help
[SPEAKER_04]: coordinate some of that when she's
drafting the regulations to see who's
[SPEAKER_04]: doing what.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that we'd have to ensure at the state
level that we're not in conflict with the
[SPEAKER_04]: locals as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so Mr. Wood has an additional
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well actually just more of a comment and
obviously as we wait to see how this plays
[SPEAKER_03]: out with, or certainly MCRSA had a very
different vision than Prop 64 around local
[SPEAKER_03]: control, some of those issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'll see how this plays out and so as
someone who worked on that, I have a
[SPEAKER_03]: vested interest in that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would just like to comment too that,
and I appreciate my colleague and the
[SPEAKER_03]: challenges they're obviously having in Los
Angeles and in some of his neighborhoods.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, there are other jurisdictions,
cities, and counties who have taken a
[SPEAKER_03]: different approaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who have seen that while some of the
businesses may be nuisances in your
[SPEAKER_03]: neighborhoods, they've actually been good
corporate citizens and cooperative with
[SPEAKER_03]: jurisdictions in other areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's not all bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of folks that are actually
good corporate citizens and play well with
[SPEAKER_03]: their communities and are actually
embraced by their communities for what
[SPEAKER_03]: they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how we marry that all together and make
it work.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I would agree that I don't think
anybody wants to see an over concentration
[SPEAKER_03]: of anything in the liquor laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: I represent a city that has 25 tasting
rooms downtown for wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And while everybody talks about over
concentration and the ABC regulations,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's never come into play.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's never been an issue and there'll be
another one or two that are probably
[SPEAKER_03]: approved this year because that's the
nature of the beast.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how we approach this is going to be
very interesting going forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this issue was raised in the
last panel on this panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: So obviously there's a lot of interest
from the legislature and making sure how
[SPEAKER_04]: this is all rolled out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But appreciate all of your comments and
thank you for answering questions.
Thank you.
