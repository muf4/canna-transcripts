[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so Mr. Toad just sent a whole
bunch of seed packs down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got some more here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized that he sent a bone
clone shipper.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I realized that there's actually
a clone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it was just an empty one,
but I realized that there's actually a
[SPEAKER_00]: clone inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this came down from NorCal to SoCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how well it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, look through there and tell me,
am I on camera?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is the outer seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a rugged device.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gemma is my camera woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gemma, you want to pack some more seeds
later today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so what do you think's inside here?
[SPEAKER_00]: A plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: How did you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you told me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this plant just traveled in the
mail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it's still alive?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Get on the other side.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to watch to make sure we can see
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, two, one, go.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cute little baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is still alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the name of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, but it's probably cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it cherry?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's called cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are we going to put it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Eventually we'll put it outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's shocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to put it right over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is the camera facing the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a happy Gemma.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you stop sticking your finger in my
butt?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you hold this?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, hey, can you hold this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And aim it at the plant right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to take this collar off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's lift it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some tape here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some scotch tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no fingernails.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take the scotch tape off.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's our camera?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we being steady with the camera?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, that's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It made it the whole way and then I
snapped it in half.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's nice and moist underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long did it take to get here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, well, that's moist.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: See those little lights in there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you see the lights?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me see.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those lights give it just a little bit
of light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're going to stick it there for
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to bring it outside,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: To the garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to hold it?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's our lesson for today,
everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's our lesson for today.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
