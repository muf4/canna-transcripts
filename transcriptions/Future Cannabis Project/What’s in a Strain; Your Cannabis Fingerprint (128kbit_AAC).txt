[SPEAKER_05]: Hello everyone, thank you so much for
coming to hear our little discussion and
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let Dr. Andrea start with telling her
a little bit or telling you a little bit
[SPEAKER_05]: about her story then we'll kind of hear a
little bit about mine and then you'll be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to notice the difference of where
we're coming from but also talking about
[SPEAKER_05]: one particular topic.
[SPEAKER_07]: We agree on a lot of fundamental issues
that are germane to the topic today which
[SPEAKER_07]: is understanding sort of the cannabis
strain fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_07]: So even though I sort of in the more
biomedical background I believe that truly
[SPEAKER_07]: understanding cannabis as medicine starts
with the plant and so in my role at GB
[SPEAKER_07]: Sciences we have been dedicated to
creating standardized raw materials that
[SPEAKER_07]: we provide to customers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have operations in both Nevada and in
Louisiana where we hold licenses to
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivate, produce oils and make finished
products for sale in those markets and so
[SPEAKER_07]: when I'm talking to you today I'm wearing
two hats.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm wearing the hat of we're part of the
industry, we're part of the supply chain
[SPEAKER_07]: of cannabis materials that go to the
patients in medical markets as well as to
[SPEAKER_07]: the folks in adult use markets like Nevada
but at the same time at GB Sciences we've
[SPEAKER_07]: also taken the position that it's not
enough to just create standardized
[SPEAKER_07]: products that we also wanted to verify
safety and potential effectiveness through
[SPEAKER_07]: our research and so to that end we have
sponsored research with nine different
[SPEAKER_07]: universities where we're trying to get at
the cannabis plant is full of lots of
[SPEAKER_07]: different compounds and anyone who tells
you cannabis is one thing is missing the
[SPEAKER_07]: point, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're trying to get at this great
mystery of how do you align strains with
[SPEAKER_07]: particular diseases or particular symptoms
that we need to treat and the only way to
[SPEAKER_07]: do that is in controlled trials but those
take many formats in different just
[SPEAKER_07]: jurisdictions so that's kind of a
complicated thing but today what we're
[SPEAKER_07]: here to talk about is strains and the
chemical components of strains which we're
[SPEAKER_07]: calling a fingerprint but do you know that
we're coming at this both from a place,
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm coming at this from both a place of we
grow as well as we do research so it has a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit of a different, I have a
different perspective on it than Pepper
[SPEAKER_07]: but I think we agree on a lot of the
essential things so Pepper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you very well said.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm coming from the angle of I am a
naturopathic holistic practitioner in
[SPEAKER_05]: Humboldt County so most of the patients I
have or clients that I have or students
[SPEAKER_05]: that I have in the cannabis program for
the Cannabis Holistic Institute are coming
[SPEAKER_05]: in with multiple different disease,
this ailment discomfort and we are trying
[SPEAKER_05]: to put them in the last eight years in
combination to a particular strain or
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivar that's going to be helpful for
that particular ailment.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been lucky enough to be doing that
for the last eight years.
[SPEAKER_05]: The thing that kind of guided me in that
direction was because I had my own
[SPEAKER_05]: discomfort within my body and just to name
a few in the last seven years that I've
[SPEAKER_05]: been working with physically just my own
personal stories include PTSD,
[SPEAKER_05]: anxiety, cancer, tumor, endometriosis,
reproductive issues, I mean it's a slew of
[SPEAKER_05]: them.
[SPEAKER_05]: God chose the right person because then I
was in Humboldt County running around on
[SPEAKER_05]: farms asking for particular strains or
cultivars from friends of mine that I knew
[SPEAKER_05]: grew organic and I mostly focused on doing
non-psychoactive CBD so that's what kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of got me into what I'm doing now and
educating people around the world and
[SPEAKER_05]: working with patients and clients and
students around the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm coming from more of Humboldt County
organic farmer boutique strains growing
[SPEAKER_05]: that industry and cannabis culture in that
way because most of those people I've been
[SPEAKER_05]: working with for so very long and giving
them a platform to speak on their
[SPEAKER_05]: particular expertise that may have gotten
lost in the shuffle without some kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: program to really have speakers allowed to
talk with their best at so anyways that's
[SPEAKER_05]: what we're gonna do and now we're gonna
talk about what's in a strain the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_05]: In Humboldt County and I'm sure many of
you have understood that it is about this
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not just particularly about the
strain or the cultivar it's about the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole cannabinoid system and which
particular ones do what with what
[SPEAKER_05]: particular body systems so that's kind of
how I started working with different
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids I was working with CBD THC a
raw form plant form so on so on and then
[SPEAKER_05]: it's about connecting those two with your
body structures so today we're going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: talking about the cannabis active
ingredients and do you want to take it for
[SPEAKER_07]: a second yeah I do want to add anything
that you want yeah I want to add a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit to the idea of strains so I know that
strain aims are very near and dear to the
[SPEAKER_07]: breeders out there that have worked to
perfect their favorite ones and the ones
[SPEAKER_07]: that this is fun but one of the things
that we're going to advocate for as a part
[SPEAKER_07]: as part of this industry is that strain
names so there's a reliance on strain
[SPEAKER_07]: names from regulators from our marketing
campaigns that I think does patients a
[SPEAKER_07]: disservice because strain names do not
always capture the active ingredients that
[SPEAKER_07]: are in the plant and ultimately it will be
the active ingredients and I don't mean
[SPEAKER_07]: single active ingredients I mean the whole
collection out of the potential 480 active
[SPEAKER_07]: ingredients in a cannabis strain that
energy yeah yeah so we need to keep track
[SPEAKER_07]: of that and patients it's hard because
humans want things to be simple right it's
[SPEAKER_07]: like part of human nature but cannabis as
a plant part of its power is it it isn't
[SPEAKER_07]: simple so we have got to we've got to find
a way to communicate the complexity of
[SPEAKER_07]: active ingredients in plant-based products
with our consumers with patients in a way
[SPEAKER_07]: that they can understand okay so and that
is the big divide we've got to get across
[SPEAKER_07]: because right now what they're relying on
when they go into dispensary is a
[SPEAKER_07]: well-meaning bud tender who's going to
tell them about into couch and sativa
[SPEAKER_07]: right and you know in some other like lore
right but one of the things that we that
[SPEAKER_07]: we try to do is we're data-driven I'm a
scientist right so we did two studies one
[SPEAKER_07]: of the studies we did in 2014 in
California in conjunction with a third
[SPEAKER_07]: part a third-party testing lab and what we
were asking the question of we took over
[SPEAKER_07]: 20,000 strain profiles that you know the
potency analysis of the cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_07]: terpenes and we put it through a program
where you're looking for clusters that
[SPEAKER_07]: will define something called a chemo bar
or a chemical variation okay so remember
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis isn't one thing there are certain
cannabis strains that fall into these
[SPEAKER_07]: different chemical variations in 2014 in
California when we did it there were 25
[SPEAKER_07]: chemo bars we did the same thing in Nevada
which is the state that our primary
[SPEAKER_07]: location is in and we tested we've also
partnered with a third-party independent
[SPEAKER_07]: testing lab there and there we're looking
at I believe don't quote me on this
[SPEAKER_07]: something like 40,000 so sorry something
like 4,000 strain records and we published
[SPEAKER_07]: the second study the one in Nevada in the
journal called cannabis and cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_07]: research back in May and what it showed
was during the medical only period in
[SPEAKER_07]: Nevada there were 396 different strain
names but when you did the chemical
[SPEAKER_07]: variation analysis there were three and
90% of all the samples tested were in a
[SPEAKER_07]: single chemical variation that was high
THC and almost and very little in the way
[SPEAKER_07]: of minor cannabinoids and terpenes okay we
did this we took the same samples we sent
[SPEAKER_07]: them off to have genetic analysis done
because you know it's possible that
[SPEAKER_07]: because in Nevada you have to grow in a
greenhouse and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: convergence and how we grow we were trying
to give people the benefit of doubt that
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe the chemicals were aligned because
we were growing under the same conditions
[SPEAKER_07]: but on the genetic level there were 396
strain names correlated with 12 genetic
[SPEAKER_07]: variations and blue dream which is an
incredibly popular strain name was present
[SPEAKER_07]: in all 12 genetics so I think that if in a
system where we rely on strain names to
[SPEAKER_07]: sell things to patients who are looking
for the same results strain names are
[SPEAKER_07]: doing them a disservice because if you're
in Nevada during that medical only period
[SPEAKER_07]: and you picked up blue dream off the shelf
somewhere you had a 1 in 12 chance that it
[SPEAKER_07]: was the same thing as you got last time
you bought it so anyway okay this is where
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to come from because where I'm
at in Humboldt County we are I mean
[SPEAKER_05]: pridefully so you ask anyone that's
growing pot in the Humboldt County we are
[SPEAKER_05]: organic we're biodynamic we're focused we
are proud of our strains we are proud of
[SPEAKER_05]: our cultivars or variety of cannabis we
know what we're doing or they know what
[SPEAKER_05]: they're doing I don't grow any longer but
they know what they're doing and they've
[SPEAKER_05]: been doing it for generations and
generations now as a naturopath when a
[SPEAKER_05]: client comes to me asking for something I
love the idea of saying okay you need this
[SPEAKER_05]: this this this and this fingerprint this
particular cannabinoid system like
[SPEAKER_05]: combination but you give that to the
average client you give that to the
[SPEAKER_05]: average person they're not going to know
what to do with that so to break it down I
[SPEAKER_05]: get what you're saying and I get where
we're going but for the average person not
[SPEAKER_05]: even in this room they don't know what
they're doing and they're going to have to
[SPEAKER_05]: find a direction strain name is the best
thing we can do right now now testing
[SPEAKER_05]: those making sure that those plants are
truly that before the dispensary gets that
[SPEAKER_05]: that's a whole nother topic right and
that's what we want to happen but we have
[SPEAKER_05]: to trust our growers that's another reason
why we go organic and we know our farmers
[SPEAKER_05]: that we're getting our cannabis from and
boutique straining is for me being from
[SPEAKER_05]: Humboldt County that's the way we're
pushing it that's what we're seeing and
[SPEAKER_05]: we're seeing it happen all the time and
it's phenomenal and I think that's what
[SPEAKER_07]: really gives this panel of the two of us
sort of a difference in perspective
[SPEAKER_07]: because I don't think we disagree yeah
you're coming from in Nevada you know it's
[SPEAKER_07]: a commodity okay we're fully into adult
use and you know I can't swear and we grow
[SPEAKER_07]: ourselves and we're really proud of our
Jenny Kush thank you very much
[SPEAKER_07]: but that said I still can imagine I can
imagine something different than what we
[SPEAKER_07]: have right now I can imagine a way to
break down the complexity of the active
[SPEAKER_07]: ingredients into a way that there's a
simple pattern recognition that patients
[SPEAKER_05]: can help yeah I definitely agree with you
on that for certain for certain it's going
[SPEAKER_05]: to take a shift yeah for people to
recognize we need to talk about the minor
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids and that's what we're
starting to really educate at least in my
[SPEAKER_05]: field particular clients who are needing
things say for their nervous system which
[SPEAKER_05]: of those particular minor cannabinoids
work best from that and then we can refer
[SPEAKER_05]: them off to strain dosage use whether
they're gonna be juicing when they're
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna non psychoactive tincture whether
they're gonna do a concentrate then we
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of do that but right now it's just
like piecing that all together at least
[SPEAKER_05]: from where I'm standing because I'm doing
it as a private practice yeah so so to so
[SPEAKER_07]: to our first point about the cannabis
active ingredients I think right now
[SPEAKER_07]: because there's been the most research on
THC and CBD that's where people feel the
[SPEAKER_07]: most comfort and where I think people can
understand the significance better so
[SPEAKER_07]: right now there is a reliance on
information about THC and CBD and I think
[SPEAKER_07]: that's appropriate given where we are in
our research but this is where I see the
[SPEAKER_07]: future and the future will include
information about minor cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_07]: terpenes and I'm going to give you a
little just a little case study why that's
[SPEAKER_07]: important okay so a study that I was not
involved in but that I heard at can med
[SPEAKER_07]: two years ago there was a trial happening
in Israel where they had patients they
[SPEAKER_07]: were all children who had epilepsy and
they were being given whole plant extract
[SPEAKER_07]: from a cannabis strain that naturally had
a 20 to 1 CBD to THC ratio and because
[SPEAKER_07]: they didn't want to be reliant on a single
farmer they gave two farmers the original
[SPEAKER_07]: strain and they told the farmers we're
going to test this and if the THC to CBD
[SPEAKER_07]: ratios aren't the same when you hand over
the products we won't accept it that will
[SPEAKER_07]: be our quality control step so everything
was going good the first first part of the
[SPEAKER_07]: trial there the children were having fewer
episodes there was no huge behavioral
[SPEAKER_07]: problems or adverse events but then
something happened midway through and
[SPEAKER_07]: there was suddenly a huge amount like one
part of the patients were suddenly having
[SPEAKER_07]: an increased amount of behavioral events
like just really dramatic like punching
[SPEAKER_07]: people and just really off the rails to
the point where they ended up shutting
[SPEAKER_07]: this to trial down and when they did the
backwards analysis they found that all of
[SPEAKER_07]: the samples that were provided to the to
the children had that right ratio of 20 to
[SPEAKER_07]: 1 but when they did a deeper analysis and
they looked at the profiles of ingredients
[SPEAKER_07]: beyond THC and CBD in one farmers crop it
was equal to what was in the original
[SPEAKER_07]: strain and one there was completely
different profile of minor cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_07]: and terpenes and so most people would have
said well why would that matter and
[SPEAKER_07]: clearly I don't think this farmer was
trying to hurt children right but it's
[SPEAKER_07]: much like if you're babysitting for
someone's goldfish and they die you go to
[SPEAKER_07]: the store and you look for the closest
match of goldfish that you can find unless
[SPEAKER_07]: you're a better human being than me and
you have children and they found something
[SPEAKER_07]: that matched I matched you know they
couldn't tell from it from looking at the
[SPEAKER_07]: TV the CBD to THC ratio that it was any
different but you better believe when they
[SPEAKER_07]: did the profiles beyond that they were
incredibly different so what that shows is
[SPEAKER_07]: that while it's important that we're
monitoring the THC and CBD down the road
[SPEAKER_07]: as our understanding becomes more complete
those other compounds are incredibly
[SPEAKER_07]: important in whole plant extracts and I it
is my belief and I think we share this
[SPEAKER_07]: that whole plant medicine has potentially
greater clinical value than these
[SPEAKER_07]: individualized compounds but we got to be
careful it's a double-edged sword more
[SPEAKER_07]: molecules can mean potentially better
effects or unexpected effects so I think I
[SPEAKER_05]: think thank you for all that I think that
cannabis itself what we need to remember
[SPEAKER_05]: is that it creates homeostasis in the body
which then allows the body systems to
[SPEAKER_05]: regulate and heal themselves so whether
you're getting it across the board I don't
[SPEAKER_05]: think it's gonna I mean obviously and into
where you're at but I think that's the
[SPEAKER_05]: most important part is to focus on
cannabis as a whole plant and getting it
[SPEAKER_05]: in that direction I think and I can go off
on tangents about that but that's not in
[SPEAKER_05]: our topics today so let's get back on
we're gonna talk about terpene and why
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes are so important and the terpene
can of canopy which is so very important
[SPEAKER_05]: for patients and clients and all of us to
recognize it's not just about the
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabinoids it's also about the terpene
that are in that particular plant so for
[SPEAKER_05]: example you know if you have particular
terpenes a particular cat cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_05]: those two together well I can isolate and
be best for a particular body system
[SPEAKER_05]: that's direction I'm going specifically
and of course they're gonna be good for
[SPEAKER_05]: everything but if you're really dialing it
in if you're really needling in a haystack
[SPEAKER_05]: like I've been doing for the last eight
years those are the kind of things that
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm looking for in a cannabis strain or
variety or cultivar and so back to the
[SPEAKER_07]: what I was talking about before where we
did the the data analysis to try to define
[SPEAKER_07]: like the chemical variations for the study
that we did in California those 25
[SPEAKER_07]: different chemovars that we identified
were all distinguished based on a major
[SPEAKER_07]: and a minor terpene the CBD and THC levels
were actually sort of insignificant to the
[SPEAKER_07]: analysis and that even holds true in the
in the Nevada analysis we did that the
[SPEAKER_07]: differences that we're gonna see in
between the different strains are really
[SPEAKER_07]: in the terpenes and I believe that's also
true from a clinical side and it also is
[SPEAKER_07]: what naturally so for people who love
whole plant in the raw form those terpenes
[SPEAKER_07]: are also what adds to your enjoyment right
so I think terpenes are an undervalued
[SPEAKER_07]: resource that we have in cannabis and it's
something that we are also looking at on
[SPEAKER_07]: the research side so one of the things
that was known for a long time is that
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabinoids have interactions in your
body with receptors well in our research
[SPEAKER_07]: we found that it seems true for terpenes
we've identified specific terpenes and the
[SPEAKER_07]: specific receptors in our bodies where
they're interacting so they have just as
[SPEAKER_07]: much greater potential for being real
effective medicines as as the other
[SPEAKER_07]: components in the plant that we've that
we've been studying more extensively over
[SPEAKER_05]: time yeah and cannabis farmers in Humboldt
County and around the world I'm sure but
[SPEAKER_05]: like we geek out on that stuff right there
we've been doing it for generations and
[SPEAKER_05]: generations of finding this particular
plant that is this particular you know
[SPEAKER_05]: minor cannabinoid with this particular
terpene and this works for this I mean
[SPEAKER_05]: they are like intense up there it's really
it's really great to be a part of that
[SPEAKER_05]: community okay so let's talk we had this
discussion about sativa and indica and how
[SPEAKER_05]: to you know currently this has been like
the hot button thing for for a while now
[SPEAKER_05]: most people think either sativa or indica
now about five years or more there was so
[SPEAKER_05]: much hybriding happening that it didn't
really make that much sense and so a big
[SPEAKER_05]: huge like a huge group of people are
staying away from sativa indica but those
[SPEAKER_05]: people who are coming you know from the
very ground up this consumers that have
[SPEAKER_05]: never used cannabis or have been afraid to
use cannabis this is the terminology this
[SPEAKER_05]: is the language that they're using even
though we're trying to stay away from that
[SPEAKER_05]: and explain to them it is more about the
cannabis fingerprint than anything else
[SPEAKER_05]: the the main consumer this is what they're
looking for they're going into the Spencer
[SPEAKER_05]: II and saying I want something that's
indica dominant well where are we going
[SPEAKER_05]: from that now that's an issue so it's more
about really educating people you're
[SPEAKER_07]: shaking your head what do you got so and
so so adding to that so I've had the
[SPEAKER_07]: opportunity to go to these conferences
including one by the International
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabinoid Research Society which is the
longest-running cannabis research you know
[SPEAKER_07]: geek fest that you could think of and and
but the cool thing about going is that
[SPEAKER_07]: these are these I got to hear botanists
who've been studying cannabis for like 45
[SPEAKER_07]: years talk about indica and sativa and
they've done a lot of genetic analysis and
[SPEAKER_07]: so because they're hearing feedback like
you know patients get told indica in the
[SPEAKER_07]: couch and things like that they know that
that's out there they decided to go ahead
[SPEAKER_07]: and try to address that using science so I
just saw a talk recently where they they
[SPEAKER_07]: were looking at samples from the United
States Canada and across the world and
[SPEAKER_07]: they were trying to say is indica sativa a
real phenotype can you actually use that
[SPEAKER_07]: as a way to recommend to patients and
unfortunately what they found that from
[SPEAKER_07]: genetic level most of the things were such
specifically in the United States are
[SPEAKER_07]: mostly hybrid so it's really hard to lean
on those those old paradigms about indica
[SPEAKER_07]: and sativa but I think that there is
something that we can take away from the
[SPEAKER_07]: indica sativa myth which is I think that
indica and sativa are sort of correlating
[SPEAKER_07]: with profiles of terpenes so I think that
if we can certainly just reimagine that
[SPEAKER_07]: there's still some truth to it it's just
that rather than ascribing it to the word
[SPEAKER_07]: sativa or indica it's really about the
profile of terpenes because I think that
[SPEAKER_07]: there's almost a one-to-one correlation
there yeah I definitely agree with you on
[SPEAKER_05]: that absolutely now it's about educating
the student yes the client yes the
[SPEAKER_05]: community that you're in on looking for a
particular terpene that works with your
[SPEAKER_05]: body system right linalool being in
lavender which is calming and relaxing
[SPEAKER_05]: you're gonna look for a fruity purpley
yummy cannabis that you smell that has
[SPEAKER_05]: that same entire like terpene profile it's
gonna do the same thing for you so it's
[SPEAKER_05]: about educating people on a much much
deeper level than just like hey let me
[SPEAKER_05]: grab that one jar that says indica which
from what you're saying might not be so
[SPEAKER_05]: let's move on I there is something I want
to talk with you about about hemp and
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis this is happening a lot in our
communities it's been happening for a very
[SPEAKER_05]: long time with the explosion of CBD that
we started to see a few years ago it's
[SPEAKER_05]: really interesting whenever I talked to
patients and I talked to clients and I
[SPEAKER_05]: talked to students I talked to people
around the world on what they believe that
[SPEAKER_05]: is can you from your perspective of being
a grower and focusing in that direction in
[SPEAKER_05]: science more clinical I want that
described very clearly for our audience
[SPEAKER_07]: okay so I'm sure that for a lot of people
what I'm gonna say is not new but we'll
[SPEAKER_07]: just get it out there so we have a
platform a common sort of place to start
[SPEAKER_07]: talking from so hemp and cannabis are the
same plant scientifically it was the
[SPEAKER_07]: government who created two buckets for
them right and it's based on an artificial
[SPEAKER_07]: designation of the level of THC makes one
hemp and one cannabis but they're the same
[SPEAKER_07]: thing but that said this that doesn't mean
there's not phenotypic differences much
[SPEAKER_07]: like among dogs and varieties of dogs you
have your large dogs your small dogs
[SPEAKER_07]: working dogs and lap dogs and you know all
everything in between cannabis is the same
[SPEAKER_07]: so breeders of industrial hemp have over
time move the properties of industrial
[SPEAKER_07]: hemp so that they have long fibers and so
that they are good at what they're
[SPEAKER_07]: supposed to do which is be building
materials and such right but that's where
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm at because the consumers are looking
at CBD based products from that type of
[SPEAKER_07]: hemp exactly whereas in general cannabis
has been used more medically we'll say and
[SPEAKER_07]: as a product for consumption so therefore
the properties that the breeders were
[SPEAKER_07]: looking for were different they were
looking for higher production of oil and
[SPEAKER_07]: things that you know higher THC levels
let's just be real and so there's been a
[SPEAKER_07]: drift between what is classically called
industrial hemp and classically called
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis but they're still the same plant
and they will still breed right so that
[SPEAKER_07]: shows you that they're the same but that
said what we're finding is that in the
[SPEAKER_07]: world there are pockets of germplasm or
people who still have in plant
[SPEAKER_07]: repositories ancient strains of cannabis
and that are sort of not as differentiated
[SPEAKER_07]: and there are people in the world like the
Colorado Hemp Project that people who are
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to really nurture cannabis strains
that have THC below that limit that makes
[SPEAKER_07]: them makes them have but that are still
good producers of oil and but these are
[SPEAKER_07]: really isolated people in the world in
general if you're talking about stuff you
[SPEAKER_07]: order off the internet it could be
industrial hemp from China or it could be
[SPEAKER_07]: you know and so what I think most of the
people who order these products don't
[SPEAKER_07]: understand is that CBD within the industry
is more controlled than out there in the
[SPEAKER_05]: marketplace so absolutely and I see people
come to me all the time with convenience
[SPEAKER_05]: store CBD and it drives me absolutely nuts
as I travel around the country yeah the
[SPEAKER_05]: thing is they're getting the best they can
get and I kind of say what's like a raw
[SPEAKER_05]: food desert if you're in the middle of the
country and all you can have is a salad
[SPEAKER_05]: from fast food restaurant at least it's a
salad but let me educate you let me sit
[SPEAKER_05]: with you for 20 minutes and tell you why
that's not the right thing for your body
[SPEAKER_05]: system and so that's where I get super
passionate that's why I threw it in there
[SPEAKER_05]: real quick yeah okay so let's talk about
the entourage effect we had this
[SPEAKER_05]: discussion the other day and we were on
this topic for a very long period of time
[SPEAKER_05]: this is the hot button word a lot of
people as I'm interviewing them or
[SPEAKER_05]: speaking with them I also do a podcast and
so I interview people this is the word
[SPEAKER_05]: that they're using and we had this great
conversation about it's not just about THC
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like the entourage effect makes you
think that there's one shiny star and
[SPEAKER_05]: everything else is just surrounding it
right yeah okay but do you had a great
[SPEAKER_05]: story that I'd love for you to share with
me again if you'd like sure yeah so one of
[SPEAKER_07]: the things that we've done in our basic
research is we've been trying to take the
[SPEAKER_07]: complexity of whole plants and then
through the use of things that are more
[SPEAKER_07]: common to the pharmaceutical industry
they're called high throughput screening
[SPEAKER_07]: and medical models and animal testing and
such like that we've been trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: determine what what assortment of
ingredients from a from a whole plant
[SPEAKER_07]: extract do you absolutely need to be able
to have high clinical value and what we're
[SPEAKER_07]: finding is that single ingredients barely
move the needle when it comes to clinical
[SPEAKER_07]: effectiveness the power of whole plant
medicine comes in the combinations of
[SPEAKER_07]: compounds that are in those plants when
when we start our analysis and when we
[SPEAKER_07]: start to look at the readouts of if we
measure the ingredients separately most of
[SPEAKER_07]: them don't have any signal at all so we
realize that if we didn't have access to
[SPEAKER_07]: the whole plants we never would have found
the right mixtures and so but what we're
[SPEAKER_07]: finding is in most of the pet so we've
also filed patents on these and that we're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing them for specific conditions like
Parkinson's disease Alzheimer's disease
[SPEAKER_07]: neuropathic pain cardiovascular diseases
but what one of the common themes in our
[SPEAKER_07]: research seems to be that THC isn't always
the star and in fact in all of those
[SPEAKER_07]: conditions that I just mentioned THC isn't
a part of the formulation that we ended up
[SPEAKER_07]: with when we did a screen CBD is important
in some but about 25% so what we're seeing
[SPEAKER_07]: in this is really early research is that
the next wave of cannabis medicines is
[SPEAKER_07]: really going to leverage minor cannabis
and terpenes a whole lot more and
[SPEAKER_07]: specifically in mixtures and nobody there
haven't been any big pharma companies that
[SPEAKER_07]: have stepped up and say you know what I'm
going to go to the FDA with something that
[SPEAKER_07]: has nine ingredients but we are we've got
a pharmaceutical composition that we're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to try to take the FDA next year
it's got nine active ingredients and so
[SPEAKER_07]: but what we can what we're trying to show
is that the power of this kind of medicine
[SPEAKER_07]: is in the combination and we've done a lot
of like the geeky science stuff to show
[SPEAKER_07]: you need all of those ingredients and
that's what you should take away from
[SPEAKER_07]: whole plant medicine it's not just that it
has THC or CBD is that it has the whole
[SPEAKER_07]: assortment and that molecular synergy
molecular synergy so we've tried to not
[SPEAKER_07]: call it entourage effect we try to call it
molecular synergy these molecules work
[SPEAKER_07]: better together than they do apart and
that's the power of whole plant medicine
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah it's fair yeah okay I think that we
are about wrapped up and you had a couple
[SPEAKER_05]: okay well we can continue to go if there's
any questions that you may have we'll take
[SPEAKER_05]: a few Q&A can we go right into Q&A all
right let's go into Q&A oh yep go ahead is
[SPEAKER_07]: that if we could if we could encourage
people to do one thing is try to find ways
[SPEAKER_07]: to label beyond CBD and THC I know it's
going to be hard but I've done different
[SPEAKER_07]: states I've been talking with people who
are either using color coding or there's
[SPEAKER_07]: lots of different tricks that we can use
to help break down the complexity so that
[SPEAKER_07]: when patients go to a dispensary they can
get the same thing every time right that's
[SPEAKER_07]: super important for maintaining their
health and so but none of this is going to
[SPEAKER_07]: happen without patient education and money
has to come from somewhere so we need to
[SPEAKER_07]: we need to as an industry be putting
rolling back into patient education and
[SPEAKER_04]: basic research thank you yeah does it
affect so does the delivery method of okay
[SPEAKER_04]: so what would you talk to me tell me but
well that was it does the terpene is the
[SPEAKER_04]: delivery system of cannabis and the
terpene the the the effect on the body of
[SPEAKER_04]: the terpene absolutely what would be in
your opinion like three of the best
[SPEAKER_04]: delivery methods for chirping to get your
by system it would depend on and make an
[SPEAKER_05]: effect okay it would depend on the
particular body system that you were
[SPEAKER_05]: wanting work with so let's narrow that
down saying like the nervous system for
[SPEAKER_05]: example if you're doing it for the nervous
system the best delivery method would
[SPEAKER_05]: possibly be depending on the person the
age I mean there's a lot of things that go
[SPEAKER_05]: into that you have to dial it in but once
you do that then you look at possibly
[SPEAKER_05]: tinctures tinctures are going to be the
easiest way to get that into the body
[SPEAKER_05]: system the digestive system works
completely different though if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing an edible and it breaks down in your
intestines that's a completely different
[SPEAKER_05]: thing we've all had that happen we've had
the brownie and then you know three hours
[SPEAKER_05]: later and then four hours later
sublinguals great sublinguals great I work
[SPEAKER_05]: mostly with non psychoactive cannabis and
so getting those particular the body
[SPEAKER_05]: system or the the way that the dosage
method that I suggest for most people are
[SPEAKER_05]: sublinguals tinctures and topicals but it
depends on what particular body system is
[SPEAKER_07]: needing that medicine right so from the
producer side there's some challenges with
[SPEAKER_07]: terpenes terpenes as a as chemicals are
lighter and so when you're trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: prepare cannabis based products so they
just naturally go into the air right so no
[SPEAKER_07]: so there is a no so there is a real
challenge to prepare cannabis based
[SPEAKER_07]: products so if you have whole plant if
you're talking about flower then this is
[SPEAKER_07]: less of a problem right what will matter
there is how it was cured because you can
[SPEAKER_07]: use a lot of terpenes depending upon how
that that raw plant material is cured and
[SPEAKER_07]: processed before it gets into the bag or
jar right but for terpenes when it comes
[SPEAKER_07]: to extraction different extraction methods
usually the terpenes end up in a different
[SPEAKER_07]: fraction or different part of the equation
from the cannabinoids so it's yeah so
[SPEAKER_07]: that's where some people are getting
creative with like the juicing and stuff
[SPEAKER_07]: so that so you know taking a raw plant and
juicing probably is going to give you the
[SPEAKER_07]: most natural blend of the terpenes that
were in the original plant however you
[SPEAKER_07]: know if you want a more convenience of
some of these other methods what producers
[SPEAKER_07]: have to do is you have to then add them
back usually because in an extraction
[SPEAKER_07]: method usually like said they end up in
different places so in the final product
[SPEAKER_07]: you have to add them back and then as with
respect to their absorption into the body
[SPEAKER_07]: that's challenging too because like I said
mercy one of the most common terpenes out
[SPEAKER_07]: there is the smallest and the most likely
to end up in the air right so yeah in our
[SPEAKER_07]: some of the trials that we're doing we're
showing that has and other people know
[SPEAKER_07]: this too is that it has a high potential
for pain relief but how do you actually
[SPEAKER_07]: get it into the product that you're trying
to take and how do you how do you not lose
[SPEAKER_07]: that the the terpenes yeah yeah so one of
the things that we're doing but this is
[SPEAKER_07]: still experimental is we're doing
something called creating nanoparticles
[SPEAKER_07]: nanoparticles make them heavier they
cannot blow and they increase the
[SPEAKER_07]: bioavailability but like I said these are
sort of next-gen type stuff but one of the
[SPEAKER_07]: things to be careful of right now with the
stuff you're consuming if you want to make
[SPEAKER_07]: sure this there's terpenes in there is as
figure out how they processed it the thing
[SPEAKER_07]: that's closest to fresh and raw is going
to be the closest to the real terpene
[SPEAKER_05]: profile yeah and read labels we touched on
a little bit but I think that we're really
[SPEAKER_05]: pushing getting everything tested know
what is in your product know what's in
[SPEAKER_05]: your product because there's so many times
I go and I ask someone to go into the
[SPEAKER_05]: Spencer your eye going myself and I look
at the label and it just says this
[SPEAKER_05]: percentage TSE this percentage CBD and I
said what plant did this come from what is
[SPEAKER_05]: the terpene profile what's the cannabis
fingerprint it's not on there so how can
[SPEAKER_05]: this be good for this particular ailment
that I'm trying to you know get down to
[SPEAKER_07]: the and one of the things that's true so
we're at we're advocates as producers in
[SPEAKER_07]: producing single strain whole plant
extracts but those are super rare okay and
[SPEAKER_07]: so you know so there's got to be also
feedback to the people who are creating
[SPEAKER_07]: the products and to the whole system has
to understand that there is a demand for
[SPEAKER_07]: that because right now the kinds of things
that people ask for in dispensaries are
[SPEAKER_07]: usually pretty straightforward but if
we're ever going to get beyond where we
[SPEAKER_07]: are today into the sort of the next gen of
what cannabis medicine can be it's not
[SPEAKER_07]: just on our side we can make these
products but if nobody buys them and if we
[SPEAKER_07]: haven't educated people to understand why
they need to buy them we'll never get out
[SPEAKER_07]: of this phase well to the next phase where
cannabis medicines are considered of
[SPEAKER_07]: course we're using cannabis for this
that's where we need to be it's coming
[SPEAKER_01]: we're just educating which is an education
I have a question of alkaline water and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis a combination of how alkaline
water can open up and give more oxygen to
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant to consume I want to know if you
guys have any studies or heard anything
[SPEAKER_07]: about that I'll let you as the grower I
have been approached by a vendor who
[SPEAKER_07]: provides alkaline water but I have not
seen studies that support claims I'm just
[SPEAKER_07]: saying I don't have any evidence to
evaluate or I would tell you from a
[SPEAKER_05]: logical perspective I would imagine it
would be really healing because it's very
[SPEAKER_05]: healing to the human body yes right but I
there is no studies that I know of yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: thank you for that question just I've been
hearing about flavonoids is that a
[SPEAKER_03]: different term is that something else I
just read that it's better than aspirin or
[SPEAKER_07]: something we read that too and very
exciting yeah so we're big we're big
[SPEAKER_07]: advocates of learning all the compounds of
the plant that are potentially active so
[SPEAKER_07]: when I when I quoted there's a study that
showed that there's over 480 compounds in
[SPEAKER_07]: the cannabis plant that could be potential
drugs because they have bioactivity and so
[SPEAKER_07]: there's the cannabinoids there's the
terpenes but there's also the flavonoids
[SPEAKER_07]: and there's other compounds too that are
that are in that gomish so but here's the
[SPEAKER_07]: thing the studies are so early yet but I
think that's gonna be one of the more
[SPEAKER_07]: active areas of research and to that GB is
actually sponsored a trial where we're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing in with the University of Athens in
Greece where we're doing something called
[SPEAKER_07]: metabolomic analysis where we're looking
where we've defined that these plant
[SPEAKER_07]: strains seem to be good at this and we're
looking at not just the cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_07]: terpenes that are in there but what are
the other compounds that we don't normally
[SPEAKER_07]: measure that could potentially have
clinical value so I think you're right
[SPEAKER_07]: that is going to be some brand-new drug
categories which will be pretty awesome
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Small Howard did you did you say that
myrcine as a as a turp as a terpene is
[SPEAKER_07]: good for pain relief today that is what
we've our work is still in pre-clinical
[SPEAKER_07]: meaning we've done cell base and we're
doing animal trials right now but the
[SPEAKER_07]: other thing that we found is that we were
able to demonstrate that myrcine and a
[SPEAKER_07]: couple of the other terpenes binds
directly to receptors in the human body
[SPEAKER_07]: that regulate pain so it's not just we put
some stuff in there and it seems to work
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm we're looking at the molecular
mechanism and then we've also used
[SPEAKER_07]: nanoparticles to help because mercy was so
hard to deal with we put we put these
[SPEAKER_07]: compounds into nanoparticles so it's
easier to orally dose them without them
[SPEAKER_02]: floating into the air so my question was I
just wanted to make sure I heard you
[SPEAKER_02]: correctly because you know it's on the
prop 65 list right no that it is yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: there are two marijuana smoke and myrcine
are the two things in cannabis that that's
[SPEAKER_02]: why we have to put the prop 65 warnings
and so I was just wondering if you knew
[SPEAKER_07]: why I don't but that's something I want to
look into and write a letter that's
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting yeah we have time from one
more question yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: I great talk dr. Nathan Schramm here I I'm
in the sunscreen business as one of my
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses and we we make a sunscreen
that's mineral-based but on nano is a big
[SPEAKER_00]: no-no in sunscreen and the European Union
is is regulating it heavily because nano
[SPEAKER_00]: you know passes through cell member
membranes we don't know where it ends up
[SPEAKER_00]: even in the environment for in terms of
like zinc oxide and titanium dioxide which
[SPEAKER_00]: are in sunscreens it can deposit into the
coral reefs and be damaging I'm wondering
[SPEAKER_00]: if if any of you have concerns about nano
and cannabis and terpenes so let me
[SPEAKER_07]: address that so certainly something we've
considered because at the end of day we
[SPEAKER_07]: want to be helping people right but like
many fields nano means that nano
[SPEAKER_07]: technology covers a huge variety of
technology if there's nano in medicine
[SPEAKER_07]: there's nano in paint there's nano in
building materials there's so nano is
[SPEAKER_07]: touches a lot of our lives that we don't
even know and so there are both
[SPEAKER_07]: responsible molecules that you can use in
building nano that have already been
[SPEAKER_07]: tested like extensively and then there's
ones where they're showing either
[SPEAKER_07]: bioaccumulation or potential toxicity so
we are very cognizant of that and we're
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to steer away from things that
don't already have a safety profile that's
[SPEAKER_07]: established but but you're right that the
nano because people don't understand the
[SPEAKER_07]: whole breadth of the field is a hot button
but on the other hand what the thing that
[SPEAKER_07]: made me a believer in nano is that at the
University of Sevilla they published a
[SPEAKER_07]: study where they had taken a derivative of
THC called CB 13 and put it in a time
[SPEAKER_07]: release nano particle and they orally dose
with a single oral dose to a rodent in a
[SPEAKER_07]: neuropathic pain model one dose gave 11
days worth of relief to in that mouse
[SPEAKER_07]: model whereas the same compound without
the nano gave eight hours I'm not saying
[SPEAKER_07]: eight hours is some is horrible but what
if we could extend the therapeutic window
[SPEAKER_07]: of cannabinoids in a way that was
controlled that's just for me that was the
[SPEAKER_07]: future so but I see every advance also has
potential pitfalls so it's good that
[SPEAKER_05]: people keep on that no thank you guys so
much have a wonderful time at your event a
[SPEAKER_05]: great weekend
