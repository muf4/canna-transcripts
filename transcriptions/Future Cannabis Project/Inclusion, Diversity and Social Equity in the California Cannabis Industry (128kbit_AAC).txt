[SPEAKER_01]: So today we're going to be speaking about
inclusion, diversity and social equity and
[SPEAKER_01]: what that comes in and how that plays.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I will now let my panelists start the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so right off the bat, we're just
going to keep this very laid back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to keep it conversational.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this has been an emerging topic,
you know, that we've been trying to take
[SPEAKER_03]: on, you know, at CCIA, you know,
I know LA has been trying to take the song
[SPEAKER_03]: for social equity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just want to make sure it's a part
of the conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kat, I don't know if you wanted to kind of
talk about what's going on in LA today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I am very excited today, August 1st at
noon, which is about less than 30 minutes
[SPEAKER_06]: away.
[SPEAKER_06]: The city of Los Angeles will begin to
accept applications for phase two of our
[SPEAKER_06]: priority processing.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a huge effort that the city is
undertaking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Specifically because prior to the first of
this year, the city of Los Angeles
[SPEAKER_06]: expressly prohibited commercial cannabis
activity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's really within the last two years
that the city of Los Angeles has began to
[SPEAKER_06]: consider and articulate what a reasonable
and responsible regulatory framework would
[SPEAKER_06]: look like.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm very excited about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that with our first phase of
priority processing, we moved a bunch of
[SPEAKER_06]: our existing medical marijuana market,
our cannabis market through.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is really a whole new era for the
city in this new phase that's going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: launched.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because one of our council members has
described the situation in the city of Los
[SPEAKER_06]: Angeles as us having a cannabis immaculate
conception issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where historically, we knew and collected
taxes from a bunch of retailers,
[SPEAKER_06]: but never had a real understanding of the
supply chain.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that that's very important for
the city.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even this city's undertaking is going
to be very important for the state.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that for better or for worse,
when a lot of everyday Angelenos,
[SPEAKER_06]: Californians, community members,
when they think of cannabis and when they
[SPEAKER_06]: think of cannabis businesses, they think
of people selling cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: They think of direct sales to consumers.
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, because we have existed
in an era of prohibition where we've
[SPEAKER_06]: lacked regulations, we have a market where
consumers, law enforcement, everyday
[SPEAKER_06]: community members haven't been able to
ascertain who is a good operator from,
[SPEAKER_06]: who is a illegitimate operator who may not
have the community member's best interests
[SPEAKER_06]: at mind.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so for me, part of the reason why I'm
excited about this new phase of licensing
[SPEAKER_06]: within the city is that I know that there
are good operators here in the city who
[SPEAKER_06]: have been waiting for this moment to come
out from underground to say, I am a person
[SPEAKER_06]: who is a proud cannabis business owner.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm here to do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to make sure that we're protecting
and promoting public health and safety,
[SPEAKER_06]: that we have strong youth prevention
efforts in mind, that we value diversity,
[SPEAKER_06]: inclusion, equity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is exciting, particularly because
I think that historically, and this
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation is shifting very rapidly,
both at the federal, state, and local
[SPEAKER_06]: level.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we've been so unreasonable that we
haven't even been able to have very,
[SPEAKER_06]: very basic conversations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that there are very
complicated conversations that we have to
[SPEAKER_06]: have, whether it be from the industry side
or regulatory side, a health conversation,
[SPEAKER_06]: a law enforcement side.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that together, this industry,
regulators, the state of California has
[SPEAKER_06]: decided that there are very basic
principles that we can all get behind.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's part of the effort that the
city of Los Angeles has been trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: move forward and that we see.
[SPEAKER_06]: Moving forward across the state of
California with these regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I imagine that we're still very much in
moments of transition.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't want folks to feel as though,
even when these final regulations get
[SPEAKER_06]: adopted, that it's over.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a process.
[SPEAKER_06]: People are, industries, dynamics change
overnight.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what's important is that, I think it's
also important to recognize that we're
[SPEAKER_06]: pouring concrete right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we want to make sure that as we pour
this concrete, that is going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: absolutely foundational.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not only to what happens in the city of
Los Angeles, but what happens in the state
[SPEAKER_06]: of California, what happens in the United
States, and as other countries around the
[SPEAKER_06]: world are looking at the state of
California, that we can say that we work
[SPEAKER_06]: together to at least take care of those
basic issues, those basic items.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, again, a little bit anxious.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're 22 minutes away.
[SPEAKER_06]: From going live and I'm not at the office.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm excited to join folks today.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important to let folks know
what we value, what our priorities are,
[SPEAKER_06]: and that we're going through this process
with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I sit up and read regulations on a regular
basis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like sometimes I look like a crazy
person.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, those large post-it boards that
you can hang on your wall.
[SPEAKER_06]: I used to have them all over my living
room with regular regulations sketched
[SPEAKER_06]: out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've now moved them to the office.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have a whole conference room of
sorts that has all of these complicated
[SPEAKER_06]: and challenging exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we're all going through this process
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just to say, I'm excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm excited to be a part of this
transition.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that it's going to be easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I'm excited because I think it will be
absolutely worth it.
[SPEAKER_03]: After my experience doing campaigns,
I've realized really when you go to war
[SPEAKER_03]: and you fight alongside people,
there's a bond that never really fades or
[SPEAKER_03]: goes away.
[SPEAKER_03]: My hope is that that bond is created with
the entire cannabis industry and that we
[SPEAKER_03]: start to recognize that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're seeing folks working
together better than we have in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, I do think it's important
to recognize that we are all in this
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all fighting through this together,
trying to get the best understanding that
[SPEAKER_03]: we can of the situation of regulations and
all those unintended issues that we do
[SPEAKER_03]: still need to address that shouldn't go to
the wayside, like equity, diversity,
[SPEAKER_03]: and inclusion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just a little bit about me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I lived in Humboldt County for over 10
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: While living there, I became very familiar
with the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as necessarily cannabis as being a
smoked product only, but seen as an
[SPEAKER_03]: economic driver for families, seeing it
really help a struggling economy.
[SPEAKER_03]: When fishing left, when the timber
industry left, it provided a lot of jobs
[SPEAKER_03]: and provided a lot of stability for the
community the whole way through.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I do have a relationship with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: During that time, I also ran a coffee
shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my coffee shop, I consider it liberal
church.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got me very politically involved.
[SPEAKER_03]: I allowed city council members and county
supervisors, anyone running for office to
[SPEAKER_03]: use the coffee shop for meet and greets.
[SPEAKER_03]: I really wanted constituents to be able to
talk to their elected officials and really
[SPEAKER_03]: get a better understanding of kind of who
they really were.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, hold them to task a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Force them to answer your questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which then for me evolved into doing
political work, working on campaigns,
[SPEAKER_03]: and working for the last two pro tems of
the Senate.
[SPEAKER_03]: In that process at the state capitol in
2015, they started to take on medical
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: After 19 years of it being legalized in
the state of California.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Sacramento at that time, it was not
encouraged to get involved in cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hard to find lobbyists.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hard to find anyone who was
politically engaged in the rule making
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it was more of a burden than
something that they were taking on.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when I jumped ship.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, having a background, knowing
families and many friends involved in the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry up north made me want to try to
help and do the best that I could for
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've also always believed that cannabis
should never have been criminalized in the
[SPEAKER_03]: first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've always believed any day we go on
further criminalizing cannabis is wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that time, that's when Prop 64 was
being done.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been such an interesting experience
for me over the course of the last two
[SPEAKER_06]: years to participate and lead parts of
this conversation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm extremely appreciative of this
position I've had and the perspective that
[SPEAKER_06]: I've had particularly coming from a
non-profit organization that focused on
[SPEAKER_06]: all types of drug policies and really
seeing myself as a community organizer and
[SPEAKER_06]: somewhat of an agitator to be able to
transition into this role.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in full transparency, I got involved
in cannabis policy conversations because I
[SPEAKER_06]: was very much disturbed by the ways that I
understood cannabis, cannabis businesses,
[SPEAKER_06]: and cannabis laws in particular to impact
communities that meant a whole lot to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I first kind of came into this
awakening while I was in law school.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was my last year of law school at
the Ohio State University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Make sure that it's- We are both Ohio
folks that have landed here in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, strangely.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I was in Columbus, Ohio and I was in
law school.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was my last year of law school and I
was also doing my master's program at the
[SPEAKER_06]: same time and I was taking this advanced
family law class and I was taking a class
[SPEAKER_06]: called marijuana law and policy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was also taking this class called
Lawyering and Social Movements.
[SPEAKER_06]: And really involving myself in all of this
coursework while at the same time the
[SPEAKER_06]: state of Ohio was considering to legalize
they were trying to be the first state to
[SPEAKER_06]: do both medical and adult use at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now there are many reasons why that may
have not been successful in Ohio but
[SPEAKER_06]: nevertheless during my time in law school
I had come across a woman professor and
[SPEAKER_06]: scholar by the name of Michelle Alexander.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I had an opportunity- Michelle
Alexander was actually a professor at the
[SPEAKER_06]: Moritz College of Law at Ohio State
University where I was attending.
[SPEAKER_06]: But unfortunately she had been- was going
around and touring about a book that she
[SPEAKER_06]: had written, The New Jim Crow.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in this book, The New Jim Crow,
she had described- and this one phrase I
[SPEAKER_06]: want to articulate it specifically because
this is the one phrase that really drove
[SPEAKER_06]: me into getting involved in cannabis
policy.
[SPEAKER_06]: She said that nothing has contributed more
to the systematic mass incarceration of
[SPEAKER_06]: people of color in the United States than
the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that was such a profound statement to
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I did a little bit more exploring and
particularly looking into some of the work
[SPEAKER_06]: that the Drug Policy Alliance was doing at
the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I found out that not only was this
statement true but that 50% of all drug
[SPEAKER_06]: arrests- over 50% of all drug arrests were
for marijuana specifically.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that 80% of all marijuana arrests were
specifically for possession alone.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I recognized the harm that the
enforcement of cannabis policies had had
[SPEAKER_06]: on black and brown communities and also
was very cognizant of the fact that this
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation was shifting very quickly and
felt very much as though I needed to get
[SPEAKER_06]: involved in this conversation because I
saw that cannabis regulation and legal
[SPEAKER_06]: ization was inevitable.
[SPEAKER_06]: But getting it right wasn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that it was going to take some bold
and radical statements and actions and by
[SPEAKER_06]: no means is this anything new.
[SPEAKER_06]: There have been organizers in the space in
communities that have been articulating
[SPEAKER_06]: these harms for decades.
[SPEAKER_06]: But all of a sudden there was interest
convergence with folks who had some money
[SPEAKER_06]: and with capitalism and with other things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we really- I for the first time
started to see groups that historically
[SPEAKER_06]: would not communicate with one another get
in the same room and say how are we going
[SPEAKER_06]: to figure out how to make this happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so at the time I had an opportunity to
meet Lynn Lyman who was the state director
[SPEAKER_06]: of the California Drug Policy Alliance.
[SPEAKER_06]: I flew out to New York where they were
having a conference and I had a
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation with her and she said I want
to fly you out here to serve as the
[SPEAKER_06]: campaign coordinator for California's
responsible marijuana reform.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I quickly packed up my bags and said
I'm going to leave Ohio so that we can
[SPEAKER_06]: figure out how to get this right because I
understood that even though my original
[SPEAKER_06]: intention was to impact what was directly
happening in my community in Ohio I
[SPEAKER_06]: understood that if we could figure it out
in California it was immediately going to
[SPEAKER_06]: get back to Ohio.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I was just telling Leslie who's here
with me.
[SPEAKER_06]: Leslie is our communications or community
relations manager and director.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was telling her that when I moved out to
California I drove out here and I had a
[SPEAKER_06]: three day drive with one of my best
friends.
[SPEAKER_06]: We drove from Ohio to Kansas City,
Missouri and from Kansas City,
[SPEAKER_06]: Missouri to Denver.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stopped at a spot in Denver on the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: After Denver we stopped in Vegas and when
I got to Vegas my car got broken into and
[SPEAKER_06]: everything got stolen out of the back seat
of my car and of course I'm moving across
[SPEAKER_06]: the country so literally everything got
taken at the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it was time for me to start over in a
sense in my mind and it was time for me to
[SPEAKER_06]: insert myself into a conversation that
meant a lot to me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know that there was going to be a steep
learning curve but I moved out here in
[SPEAKER_06]: July of 2016 and immediately joined this
campaign and what was so important to me
[SPEAKER_06]: and of course there were a lot of opinions
about Proposition 64 but for me and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: still been the case that this was the most
social justice centered initiative that we
[SPEAKER_06]: had seen and it's my opinion that was it
enough?
[SPEAKER_06]: Probably not and we need to make sure that
we're asking for more every single time
[SPEAKER_06]: but this was a conversation that needed to
move forward and I see the same thing
[SPEAKER_06]: happening right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in a place where things need to move
forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things that should have moved forward
years ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things that should have never been so
backwards in the first place and so I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: excited again.
[SPEAKER_06]: What time is it?
[SPEAKER_06]: 11 49.
[SPEAKER_06]: 11 minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excited that I've had an opportunity to
join this conversation here in the state
[SPEAKER_06]: of California and connect with so many
different stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's such an enormous conversation for us
to have but I would implore folks to not
[SPEAKER_06]: be discouraged by the challenges but to
recognize that they are extremely
[SPEAKER_06]: impactful and the time that we spend on
the front end of this is really going to
[SPEAKER_06]: make a difference in ways that we're not
even going to be able to materialize I
[SPEAKER_06]: think in our lifetime and so that's how I
got involved in cannabis policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I found one of the more challenging
aspects of Prop 64 was just first off
[SPEAKER_03]: acknowledging that you know the war on
drugs really targeted black and brown
[SPEAKER_03]: members of our communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Getting that acknowledgement from the
cannabis community seemed very difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like one of the largest groups to
push back on us were a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivators in Northern California which
tends to be you know for the most part a
[SPEAKER_03]: very white culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So even getting acknowledgement that
decriminalizing cannabis is an issue now
[SPEAKER_03]: for black and brown members of the
community and that Prop 64 no matter what
[SPEAKER_03]: else it said was going to give more social
justice relief to these communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you feel the same way?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah I mean it was an interesting
conversation again because we were part of
[SPEAKER_06]: a campaign and organizing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're figuring out you know who are your
proponents?
[SPEAKER_06]: Who can you work with to move this
conversation forward?
[SPEAKER_06]: And through this work you know there were
industry folks who wanted to see this
[SPEAKER_06]: happen and there were community members
and social justice organizations that
[SPEAKER_06]: wanted to see this happen and you had to
get folks in the room to figure out what
[SPEAKER_06]: the sweet spot was and there are a lot of
different stakeholders and perspectives
[SPEAKER_06]: and so everyone doesn't have the same
experience but what I think was important
[SPEAKER_06]: was that there had already been this
acknowledgement that this harm existed and
[SPEAKER_06]: that this harm was caused by cannabis
policies and for me the question has
[SPEAKER_06]: always been well what are you going to do
about it?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because I feel very much as though it's
not enough for community members for a
[SPEAKER_06]: society to acknowledge a harm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Acknowledgement is not enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's one of the first steps in order to
kind of rectify situations but we needed
[SPEAKER_06]: to figure out what we were going to be
able to have that was tangible to
[SPEAKER_06]: communities and I think again that Prop 64
put something or some of those components
[SPEAKER_06]: in place.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for example Proposition 64 was a huge
decriminalization effort so cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: activities that may have previously been
felonies have either been reduced in their
[SPEAKER_06]: penalties or have been made completely
legal.
[SPEAKER_06]: Part of what's so enormous about the
decriminalization of Proposition 64 is
[SPEAKER_06]: that it was completely retroactive and so
not only do these new penalties,
[SPEAKER_06]: do the reduction in these penalties mean
that folks in the future aren't going to
[SPEAKER_06]: be subject to the same type of adverse
impacts but those folks who had suffered
[SPEAKER_06]: those adverse impacts previously due to
felony or misdemeanor cannabis arrests or
[SPEAKER_06]: convictions can now have the opportunity
to have their records completely reduced
[SPEAKER_06]: or expunged.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I do think that their efforts around
the state of California now to make that
[SPEAKER_06]: effort automatic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that there are strong reasons for
communities, industry alike to get behind
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We know that folks who have had past
cannabis arrests or convictions were
[SPEAKER_06]: criminalized and kind of placed in a
second class of our society saying you,
[SPEAKER_06]: because you do this, you're going to be
perfectly, it's going to be perfectly
[SPEAKER_06]: legal to discriminate against you in
housing and it's going to be perfectly
[SPEAKER_06]: legal to discriminate against you in
employment and education and when we see
[SPEAKER_06]: those things happening I think again I
don't know about you but there's something
[SPEAKER_06]: inside of me that implores me to try and
figure out how we fix that and go beyond
[SPEAKER_06]: acknowledging it and so I think that we
had to have very complicated conversations
[SPEAKER_06]: but also want to share that I think that
it's been a challenging conversation for
[SPEAKER_06]: minority communities and community members
to have in their own communities.
[SPEAKER_06]: I spent a lot of time in black and brown
communities during the campaign having a
[SPEAKER_06]: very difficult conversation with community
members around cannabis and past cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: experiences and the criminalization of
cannabis and it's so disheartening and
[SPEAKER_06]: unfortunate that because of the way that
this environment has existed around
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis criminalization community members
almost buy into their own oppression in a
[SPEAKER_06]: sense and criminalize themselves because
of the rhetoric that they have been fed
[SPEAKER_06]: for years and it's important to know that
this rhetoric and this association with
[SPEAKER_06]: minority communities and their particular
criminalization is that it was a part of
[SPEAKER_06]: the blueprint for cannabis prohibition
from the beginning and that was something
[SPEAKER_06]: that I had learned very early on I just
recently purchased this book it's called
[SPEAKER_06]: The Protectors and it was written about a
guy named Harry Anslinger and Harry
[SPEAKER_06]: Anslinger really came into position on the
heels of the end of alcohol prohibition
[SPEAKER_06]: and he found himself placed in this
organization where they were they were
[SPEAKER_06]: almost not needed anymore alcohol
prohibition had ended and then you come
[SPEAKER_06]: into a position where you're supposed to
run this organization he needed something
[SPEAKER_06]: to do and unfortunately he chose to spend
his time really framing this cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: criminalization as a black and brown or
black and white issue and so we see from
[SPEAKER_06]: the the very beginning Harry Anslinger who
again was the head of the Federal Bureau
[SPEAKER_06]: of Narcotics the present-day Drug
Enforcement Administration really framed
[SPEAKER_06]: this conversation around saying that when
certain people do this activity that's one
[SPEAKER_06]: thing but when other people do the same
activity we're going to call it criminal
[SPEAKER_06]: and we're going to enforce against these
individuals and so to me really 80 years
[SPEAKER_06]: later it's no surprise that we have
created and proliferated a system where
[SPEAKER_06]: you know communities are
disproportionately impacted all we needed
[SPEAKER_06]: to do was go back to the beginning or go
back to the root and that's why I think
[SPEAKER_06]: sometimes it is appropriate when folks say
that what we're doing is radical because
[SPEAKER_06]: radical itself simply means getting to the
root and I think it's important for us as
[SPEAKER_06]: we consider future cannabis policies for
us to have a real understanding about
[SPEAKER_06]: where all of these policies originated
because we're bound to make the same
[SPEAKER_06]: mistakes over and over again I think that
again through Prop 64 in the campaign we
[SPEAKER_06]: had a good opportunity to frame that
conversation but again it's a process
[SPEAKER_06]: everything wasn't on the table in
Proposition 64 and there's a lot more on
[SPEAKER_06]: the table you know folks often ask
community members what do you have to lose
[SPEAKER_06]: community members have a lot to lose
cannabis consumers have a lot to lose
[SPEAKER_06]: patients medical patients have a lot to
lose and things are going to constantly be
[SPEAKER_06]: shifting and so if we don't have an
understanding of where we've been I don't
[SPEAKER_06]: think that we're going to even be able to
envision a sense of where we're going but
[SPEAKER_06]: those conversations started very early on
and I'm glad you brought up Harry
[SPEAKER_03]: Anslinger because that brings me to a
different point during his tenure is where
[SPEAKER_03]: we saw the bastardization of the term
black market this term started to gain
[SPEAKER_03]: more prominence during his tenure as he's
tried and successfully targeted black and
[SPEAKER_03]: brown members of our community it's
something that Kat and I have talked about
[SPEAKER_03]: before we've seen a resurgence in the use
of black market partnered with white
[SPEAKER_03]: market we have not been familiar with
these terms as you know really relating to
[SPEAKER_03]: anything other than race and our language
matters so you know just a little segue
[SPEAKER_03]: there you know we're trying to be very
conscious of the language that we use as
[SPEAKER_03]: we're building you know the foundation to
cannabis legalization in this country and
[SPEAKER_03]: eventually the world and we need to be
conscious of these terms and how we use
[SPEAKER_03]: them and what they're tied to so as
opposed to using black market white market
[SPEAKER_03]: I suggest unregulated regulated market
above ground market below ground market
[SPEAKER_03]: anything that takes away you know the
racial stigma that has now been attached
[SPEAKER_03]: to it I'm hearing it used more often you
know we have created a CCIA we have
[SPEAKER_03]: created a language matters piece that
we've been getting feedback on that I will
[SPEAKER_03]: be releasing but just as we're trying to
use cannabis now as opposed to marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: based on you know the connection and the
stereotyping of who's using and where it's
[SPEAKER_03]: coming from it's important you know and
these are emerging issues but I think
[SPEAKER_03]: before they get too much energy behind
them it's important to address you know
[SPEAKER_03]: the black market white market issue and I
don't know if you want to touch on that as
[SPEAKER_03]: well just want to say we're live so you
know I do want to touch on a few different
[SPEAKER_03]: things and one of the difficult
conversations that is now starting to
[SPEAKER_03]: happen in hearings at the Capitol and
around the state is what is equity as
[SPEAKER_03]: opposed to what is diversity and what is
inclusion as a member of the LGBT
[SPEAKER_03]: community and with you know the HIV crisis
that kind of brought medical cannabis to
[SPEAKER_03]: nationwide attention you know my
acknowledgement is that I'm looking for an
[SPEAKER_03]: industry that brings in my community which
I believe falls into diversity and
[SPEAKER_03]: inclusion and not necessarily equity but I
think it is a difficult conversation
[SPEAKER_03]: because I know we heard I think we were in
the same social justice I'm hearing at the
[SPEAKER_03]: Capitol where folks started to talk about
how you know white members of our
[SPEAKER_03]: community who have lived in cultivation
communities have also been targeted by
[SPEAKER_03]: camp and should they be included in equity
programs you know Native American
[SPEAKER_03]: communities are trying to work with the
state right now to figure out you know
[SPEAKER_03]: what their pathway is with their
sovereignty and you know working in the
[SPEAKER_03]: state market are they a part of equity how
do you see those terms differing from one
[SPEAKER_06]: another and how do they intersect this can
be a very complicated and complex
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation but it doesn't necessarily
need to be I think that we want to make
[SPEAKER_06]: sure that the industry itself is is
representative of all communities right
[SPEAKER_06]: but because of past criminalization we
have seen that the actual demographics and
[SPEAKER_06]: makeup of the industry is proportionally
disproportionately white and male and so I
[SPEAKER_06]: remember you know two three years ago when
we started to hear about operators in
[SPEAKER_06]: Colorado being licensed there was this
conversation around well why is this
[SPEAKER_06]: industry in particular disproportionately
white and male and why aren't there you
[SPEAKER_06]: know minorities participating in this
industry and again in order to have that
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation one would have to have an
understanding of the history of
[SPEAKER_06]: criminalization in these communities in
these communities whereas in other
[SPEAKER_06]: communities you may have been able to
start a cultivation operation without fear
[SPEAKER_06]: or the same type of fear of reprisal from
a law enforcement community these
[SPEAKER_06]: community members were being arrested for
possession and often of less than an ounce
[SPEAKER_06]: so if you if you can't even possess
something how are you going to try and
[SPEAKER_06]: formulate how you're going to start a
business or organizing get capital and you
[SPEAKER_06]: know you you can't move around you're
limited you're you're you're restricted
[SPEAKER_06]: and so I think that that conversation
needed needed to happen but this
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation around equity at least as
it's developed thus far here in the state
[SPEAKER_06]: of California namely with Oakland
Sacramento San Francisco and the city of
[SPEAKER_06]: Los Angeles considering or approving
various equity programs and we now know
[SPEAKER_06]: that the state of Massachusetts is moving
forward statewide with an equity program
[SPEAKER_06]: as well this conversation is really for me
a conversation around again the harm has
[SPEAKER_06]: been acknowledged what are we going to do
about it because across the board we're
[SPEAKER_06]: seeing that public opinion is changing
around cannabis and all you have to do is
[SPEAKER_06]: look to any you know bipartisan
nonpartisan you know political hopeful and
[SPEAKER_06]: they're going to use that rhetoric I see
so many elected officials articulating
[SPEAKER_06]: nowadays that the war on drugs has been
harmful to communities and that minority
[SPEAKER_06]: communities have been disproportionately
impacted but again if you are a community
[SPEAKER_06]: leader what does that mean to you what
does it mean to you that not only these
[SPEAKER_06]: impacts happened but that they were funded
by initiatives that folks put in place and
[SPEAKER_06]: so I think that this equity conversation
again as it's developed here in the state
[SPEAKER_06]: of California the intention here in the
city of Los Angeles is to go beyond that
[SPEAKER_06]: acknowledgement and to try and put into
place policies that will allow those
[SPEAKER_06]: communities who were denied economic
opportunities previously for minor
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis violations to have an opportunity
to have equitable access to economic
[SPEAKER_06]: opportunities as they exist on the
legitimate market and I think it's
[SPEAKER_06]: particularly important for these
communities because again we're going
[SPEAKER_06]: through this shift in time in a sense and
although there have been a recent call to
[SPEAKER_06]: decriminalize cannabis activity I don't
think that that shift in pattern is going
[SPEAKER_06]: to hold true forever and so while we have
an opportunity to have these communities
[SPEAKER_06]: who have been historically thought to
consume and sell cannabis at higher rates
[SPEAKER_06]: and the truth of the matter is that data
has shown over and over again that across
[SPEAKER_06]: the board people use and sell cannabis at
the same rate regardless of you know their
[SPEAKER_06]: race or ethnic background but again if
these are the community members that
[SPEAKER_06]: historically law enforcement are thinking
are using this activity and none of these
[SPEAKER_06]: individuals get licenses or work for
entities that have licenses then even as
[SPEAKER_06]: we draw this line between this new line
between what's legal activity and what is
[SPEAKER_06]: illegal activity people are going to be
categorically criminalized again because
[SPEAKER_06]: it is still a crime to engage in
commercial cannabis activity without a
[SPEAKER_06]: state license and local authorization so I
don't think that any of the equity
[SPEAKER_06]: programs as they exist are perfect I don't
think that any regulatory program is
[SPEAKER_06]: perfect I don't think that any licensing
scheme is perfect but I think that again
[SPEAKER_06]: we're at a point where we have to move
forward figure out what our values are do
[SPEAKER_06]: our best to make those things happen and
to constantly assess and analyze how
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis and cannabis policies are
impacting communities I don't think that
[SPEAKER_06]: for example we did a social equity
analysis back in October or September of
[SPEAKER_06]: last year we can't just do one social
equity analysis and assume that that's the
[SPEAKER_06]: end of the conversation there have been
decades of enforcement against communities
[SPEAKER_06]: thousands over 500,000 folks were arrested
for cannabis in the last decade
[SPEAKER_06]: and again some folks will see that and say
yeah but I care about those people and so
[SPEAKER_06]: my question is what can we do to fix it
and make sure that it doesn't happen again
[SPEAKER_03]: so then I have a two-part follow-up with
that how do you re-educate communities
[SPEAKER_03]: like Compton who have been directly
affected and as they went to a vote and
[SPEAKER_03]: their you know city leaders you know
really had a great field campaign you know
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of door-to-door knocking and they
decided that they did not want cannabis in
[SPEAKER_03]: their community based on the war on drugs
targeting you know their community members
[SPEAKER_03]: there's still a lot of you know emotion
behind that and they still blame cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: and then I'm wondering if you can kind of
give us an overview of LA's equity program
[SPEAKER_06]: sure you know I appreciate that prop 64
allowed local jurisdictions to have local
[SPEAKER_06]: control I do think that local control is
extremely important and I think that you
[SPEAKER_06]: know I think that originally there was
this expectation that many jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_06]: would remove their bans and regulate and
there's been a frustration from the
[SPEAKER_06]: industry to you know open it up and figure
out what's going on but this is a very
[SPEAKER_06]: complicated conversation for for folks and
I think that there's a lot of education
[SPEAKER_06]: that's necessary there's historic
education that's necessary about what
[SPEAKER_06]: enforcement has looked like there's a real
need to have a honest conversation about
[SPEAKER_06]: health in cannabis and what I'd like what
I'd like to see happen in for the industry
[SPEAKER_06]: to participate in specifically is that
it's difficult for me often to sit in
[SPEAKER_06]: rooms with health officials and health
officials are saying lots of inaccurate
[SPEAKER_06]: information about campus right but it's
also not helpful to sit in industry spaces
[SPEAKER_06]: and for industry folks to say well
cannabis isn't harmful because that's not
[SPEAKER_06]: necessarily true and I think that you know
folks come into these conversations and
[SPEAKER_06]: they just want to say what they have to
say and not listen to what other folks
[SPEAKER_06]: have to say and you're not going to make
progress there and so I do think that
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a real need to have I don't know
if the you know if you all have a health
[SPEAKER_06]: committee or council but it would be great
to have some city and county and state
[SPEAKER_06]: health officials be a part of that
conversation and for you all to be invited
[SPEAKER_06]: to their conversations because it's almost
like there are two different cannabis is
[SPEAKER_03]: that people are talking about I would say
barrier has been huge right something that
[SPEAKER_03]: we learned you know over these years like
we do speak our own language and we expect
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone knows the terminology that we're
using and that's not necessarily true I
[SPEAKER_03]: remember one specific meeting where we got
half an hour in we were talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: different forms of extraction and safety
standards and they stopped us really can
[SPEAKER_03]: you just tell us like how many cycles are
in a year does it start with a start or a
[SPEAKER_03]: seed and we were just like wow we've been
talking over your head but then they also
[SPEAKER_03]: need to be educated about our language
about best practices but they need to
[SPEAKER_03]: educate us on the creation of good policy
and what that really looks like because I
[SPEAKER_03]: think that's foreign to many of us but
that language barrier in that educational
[SPEAKER_06]: lift has been huge yeah I feel like a
translator of sorts at some times and I'll
[SPEAKER_06]: sit in rooms and I appreciate that I I
have the ability to translate these
[SPEAKER_06]: conversations will say you know health
officials say well cannabis is as harmful
[SPEAKER_06]: as you know some other substance that's
clearly not that cannabis is clearly not
[SPEAKER_06]: as harmful as you know pull those folks
aside and say you know that that's not
[SPEAKER_06]: true we and I'm not a health official and
I don't you'll never hear me make any
[SPEAKER_06]: health related claims that's not my place
as a regulatory agency but at the same
[SPEAKER_06]: time I experience a real frustration in
folks not wanting to have a very just
[SPEAKER_06]: honest and realistic conversation
sometimes cannabis is going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: extremely helpful sometimes it's not I
don't think that we need to be so selfish
[SPEAKER_06]: in a sense and say that cannabis can only
be one thing and I think that the the
[SPEAKER_06]: industry has a huge responsibility in
leading that effort and so do city county
[SPEAKER_06]: and state health agencies but this is just
kind of one aspect of ways that folks need
[SPEAKER_06]: to be able to communicate with one another
industry operators have to change the type
[SPEAKER_06]: of interactions that they've had with
their neighbors and community members you
[SPEAKER_06]: know some community members really really
don't want to have you know exit bags and
[SPEAKER_06]: the caps on the ground if you can pick up
the trash in your community or just on
[SPEAKER_06]: your premises and that is the only
complaint that a community member has why
[SPEAKER_06]: wouldn't you take care of that immediately
very simple things if you're you know
[SPEAKER_06]: you're you're existing in a space where
people don't want there to be cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: consumption and I recognize that the we
really do need to figure out how we're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to take care of these conversations
about consumption but let's not go around
[SPEAKER_06]: blowing smoke in people's faces just be
reasonable be respectful and I I think
[SPEAKER_06]: that for so long there were these camps of
people who were either forward or against
[SPEAKER_06]: it and folks didn't want to communicate
and the reality is is that most community
[SPEAKER_06]: members exist somewhere in the middle we
have to recognize that I think that the
[SPEAKER_06]: folks in this room can be enthusiasts and
we're activists and are on one side of the
[SPEAKER_06]: spectrum of wanting to see change and
there are other folks who exist who are on
[SPEAKER_06]: the completely other end of the spectrum
but most folks exist somewhere in the
[SPEAKER_06]: middle and if they're just constantly
being fed misinformation they're not going
[SPEAKER_06]: to make any progress and I think that as a
as an industry you know folks have taken
[SPEAKER_06]: really really good effort at this point to
move the conversation forward but I'm very
[SPEAKER_06]: excited to see over the course of the next
year and over the course of the next
[SPEAKER_06]: several years how we again can take it
there are things that we're there are
[SPEAKER_06]: things that we're not going to agree on
and and and we just may be on the opposite
[SPEAKER_06]: ends of the table but there's so much that
we can figure out immediately again and
[SPEAKER_06]: that's what I'm interested in and figuring
out as quickly as possible and so can you
[SPEAKER_03]: give us a brief overview of LA's equity
program and then I'd also like to know
[SPEAKER_06]: what do you need to succeed sure so the
city of Los Angeles has developed a social
[SPEAKER_06]: equity program that was largely born out
of a social equity analysis that took
[SPEAKER_06]: place in the fall of last year this
analysis looked at arrest rates throughout
[SPEAKER_06]: the city and tried to identify various
characteristics and criteria of
[SPEAKER_06]: individuals who had experienced this past
cannabis criminalization so what they
[SPEAKER_06]: found was that you know there were certain
zip codes throughout the city that were
[SPEAKER_06]: disproportionately impacted that folks
were traditionally that could be low
[SPEAKER_06]: income that were disproportionately
impacted and also you know we're talking
[SPEAKER_06]: about communities that have been impacted
but folks who themselves have had
[SPEAKER_06]: nonviolent cannabis convictions
individually have been impacted so through
[SPEAKER_06]: one identifying who these individuals and
community members were who could
[SPEAKER_06]: potentially qualify the next step was to
figure out what what barriers exist for
[SPEAKER_06]: these particular community members should
they decide that they want to participate
[SPEAKER_06]: in the industry and I think that you know
folks in this room know exactly what those
[SPEAKER_06]: barriers are as they go through the
process of trying to get licenses either
[SPEAKER_06]: at the state or local level but part of
what we tried to do is to look at how our
[SPEAKER_06]: regulatory and licensing framework where
it was going to be set up and to try and
[SPEAKER_06]: figure out what were some things that we
could do and put in place to try and not
[SPEAKER_06]: you know I don't think that we were going
to be able to do everything that entities
[SPEAKER_06]: needed in order to move forward but how
could we give folks more equitable access
[SPEAKER_06]: to this industry and so it's really based
on what these community members may need
[SPEAKER_06]: within the city of Los Angeles we have a
framework that is can be generally
[SPEAKER_06]: described as first come first serve with
the various caps that have been put in
[SPEAKER_06]: place throughout the the city so just for
way of background for folks who aren't
[SPEAKER_06]: familiar the city of Los Angeles has 35
different community plans and what the
[SPEAKER_06]: city of Los Angeles has done is that
they've decided and limited the number of
[SPEAKER_06]: licenses for certain commercial cannabis
activities that can take place as a part
[SPEAKER_06]: of a particular community plan namely for
cultivation and retail activities
[SPEAKER_06]: manufacturing distribution testing these
aren't the type of activities that have
[SPEAKER_06]: limits within our our system but
cultivation retail do and so for example
[SPEAKER_06]: particular community plan may only allow
for 11 retail licenses where another
[SPEAKER_06]: community plan may allow for 22 or so
retail licenses but what the city of Los
[SPEAKER_06]: Angeles has done is that once these
community plan caps are met once we've
[SPEAKER_06]: issued licenses and these community plan
caps are met the department in the city
[SPEAKER_06]: will consider that particular community
plan to have undue concentration and once
[SPEAKER_06]: a particular community plan has undue
concentration the Department of Cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: Regulation can't process any additional
licenses unless City Council specifically
[SPEAKER_06]: approve that particular license to be
processed so just so folks know what the
[SPEAKER_06]: framework is now throughout the city with
these various community plan caps that
[SPEAKER_06]: means that we have an unlimited number of
distribution licenses that can be issued
[SPEAKER_06]: an unlimited number of testing licenses
that can be issued a unlimited number of
[SPEAKER_06]: at least non-volatile manual manufacturing
facilities that can be used but for
[SPEAKER_06]: cultivation and retail folks are going to
have to after this these community plan
[SPEAKER_06]: caps are met to go through this PCN
process so again priority in our system is
[SPEAKER_06]: extremely important because after a
certain cap is met the decision becomes
[SPEAKER_06]: completely discretionary to City Council
so one of the things that we've built our
[SPEAKER_06]: program around within the social equity
program is priority processing so the way
[SPEAKER_06]: that the priority processing is set up in
the city generally we have two phases of
[SPEAKER_06]: priority processing and then the
processing of general applications in
[SPEAKER_06]: which we give priority to social equity
applicants so our phase one that we
[SPEAKER_06]: started back in January that's considered
phase one of priority processing phase two
[SPEAKER_06]: which started about 19 minutes ago that's
phase two of the priority processing now
[SPEAKER_06]: when we get to the processing of annual
applications the City Council has said
[SPEAKER_06]: that the type of processing that they want
social equity applicants to get is as
[SPEAKER_06]: follows for retail activity the department
is to process applications on a two to one
[SPEAKER_06]: ratio meaning that we would process two
social equity applications for every one
[SPEAKER_06]: general application that's for retail
activity for non-retail activity we are to
[SPEAKER_06]: process applications on a one to one ratio
so for every one retail application that
[SPEAKER_06]: we process a general application we
process we can process one social equity
[SPEAKER_06]: application so priority processing
although it may not you know sound as as
[SPEAKER_06]: helpful it's actually very helpful within
our system the other type of benefits that
[SPEAKER_06]: the social equity program imagined were
business licensing and compliance
[SPEAKER_06]: assistance and the ordinances also
reference that a fee deferral program may
[SPEAKER_06]: be available at a later date and that
folks may have access to an industry
[SPEAKER_06]: investment fund now I'll put the industry
investment fund in the fee waivers to the
[SPEAKER_06]: side for a moment because those are kind
of pending policies and we haven't been
[SPEAKER_06]: able to fully implement the policies that
are existing right now but over the course
[SPEAKER_06]: of the next several months the Department
of Cannabis Regulation is going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: developing and implementing what this
business licensing and compliance
[SPEAKER_06]: assistance looks like and so you know
we're I think that we're going to be very
[SPEAKER_06]: open to feedback from community members
and to potential social equity applicants
[SPEAKER_06]: so that we make sure that we're building
out of a program that is complementary to
[SPEAKER_06]: folks needs and of course because we're
dealing in a evolving landscape those
[SPEAKER_06]: those needs might change but over the
course of the of the next several months I
[SPEAKER_06]: think that you'll start to see at least
intentions to to go out and do educational
[SPEAKER_06]: efforts I know that we've put out a
workshop last week in the valley we hosted
[SPEAKER_06]: a workshop on our next phase of licensing
but there's a lot of work to do to get
[SPEAKER_06]: this social equity program off the ground
in its most basic iteration it is a
[SPEAKER_06]: business development program and I don't
know if folks in the room have
[SPEAKER_06]: participated in launching business
development programs but this is a extra
[SPEAKER_06]: tricky case because businesses cannabis
businesses are going through something
[SPEAKER_06]: that's very very unique as many folks in
this room know the landscape is changing
[SPEAKER_06]: we're operating under emergency
regulations there are jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_06]: opening up on a regular basis folks are
form shopping there are conversations
[SPEAKER_06]: around land and building and all of these
still lacking banking yeah very very very
[SPEAKER_06]: simple things that other businesses don't
have to go through and so I think it's
[SPEAKER_06]: going to require us to be very intentional
to be flexible but part of the the issue
[SPEAKER_06]: is that there really needs to be an
elevation of the conversation because I
[SPEAKER_06]: don't think that folks who you know again
we're a very unique group in that you know
[SPEAKER_06]: we're invested we're active in this
advocacy most folks have no idea what what
[SPEAKER_06]: this process looks like and is going on so
I don't think that folks really understand
[SPEAKER_06]: the extent of the challenges that this
industry is facing or the resources that
[SPEAKER_06]: are necessary or what happens when you
don't have access to those resources and
[SPEAKER_06]: so you know I encourage folks to organize
and make sure that you know folks are
[SPEAKER_06]: moving the conversation along but I know
that as a regulator we're trying to figure
[SPEAKER_03]: it out ourselves and how do we help you
how do we help you succeed in this process
[SPEAKER_03]: because like many states many countries
are paying attention to what's happening
[SPEAKER_03]: in California I think a lot of folks are
paying attention to what's happening with
[SPEAKER_03]: the social equity program in Los Angeles
and it'll probably be a model that will be
[SPEAKER_03]: implemented throughout our state as well
as many other states so how do we help you
[SPEAKER_03]: make this process successful and educate
you know not only the industry but
[SPEAKER_06]: consumers as well absolutely so I really
see myself as a again a translator of
[SPEAKER_06]: sorts and in a canary of sorts and I so
these are the ways that you can help me
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a ton of education that's
necessary across the board whether it be
[SPEAKER_06]: industry operators cannabis consumers and
patients or community members who are
[SPEAKER_06]: concerned about cannabis businesses in
their community each of these different
[SPEAKER_06]: groups have their own interests have may
have their own values or concerns but if
[SPEAKER_06]: we're not sharing information with one
another about what our needs are what our
[SPEAKER_06]: concerns are the environment that we are
currently in and the environment that we'd
[SPEAKER_06]: like to see ourselves in if we can't have
that conversation we're not going to get
[SPEAKER_06]: to action so I think one of one of the
first things that we can do together the
[SPEAKER_06]: industry and regulators is to make sure
that there are open lines of communication
[SPEAKER_06]: to share information and to you know not
necessarily assume that everyone knows
[SPEAKER_06]: anything and don't hold it against someone
for not knowing something community
[SPEAKER_06]: members law enforcement health officials
alike in order for us to get this done we
[SPEAKER_06]: all need to make some changes and so I
don't think that anyone has it all figured
[SPEAKER_06]: out so I think that we need to figure it
out and work together to make that happen
[SPEAKER_06]: in addition that's that's the the
translator piece the canary piece is also
[SPEAKER_06]: it's that again when you have information
once you have been educated in the sense
[SPEAKER_06]: and you recognize that something is awry
or something is wrong please don't sit
[SPEAKER_06]: stagnant with that feeling if you are
experiencing harm if you're aware of
[SPEAKER_06]: community members and individual
experiencing harm there's a saying that
[SPEAKER_06]: the personal is political you're not alone
in this there are again hundreds of
[SPEAKER_06]: thousands of people who have been arrested
hundreds of thousand people who have been
[SPEAKER_06]: denied education educational opportunities
for the industry itself I think that you
[SPEAKER_06]: all have a huge responsibility to
consumers they need real information the
[SPEAKER_06]: ability to make informed decisions about
things that they're going to be putting
[SPEAKER_06]: into their bodies they also need to have a
real understanding of the social impacts
[SPEAKER_06]: that still exist with consuming or
associating with cannabis people can still
[SPEAKER_06]: lose their jobs for drug tests you can
still be denied you get pulled over you
[SPEAKER_06]: could potentially lose your your license
people public housing is going smoke-free
[SPEAKER_06]: so we can imagine that for low-income
communities particularly you know whether
[SPEAKER_06]: or not they're even if it is a a medical
condition this is going to
[SPEAKER_06]: disproportionately impact people who are
using your product because they're using
[SPEAKER_06]: your product again what does it mean to
you and I think that if collectively we
[SPEAKER_06]: can figure out how to have these shared
values and to take care of industry to
[SPEAKER_06]: take care of community to take care of
consumers again many complicated
[SPEAKER_06]: conversations that will struggle and I'll
sit across the room from folks and look
[SPEAKER_06]: folks in the eye and say I don't agree
that will happen but I think these areas
[SPEAKER_06]: are the things that we owe it to ourselves
if you're a industry operator and you're
[SPEAKER_06]: in this for the long haul you owe it to
the legacy of your operation and whoever
[SPEAKER_06]: you plan to hand this off to to make sure
that you're on the right side that's
[SPEAKER_03]: something you know we all need to keep in
mind you know I continually tell fellows
[SPEAKER_03]: and younger you know political folks from
the capital like if you're interested in
[SPEAKER_03]: public safety and public health come into
cannabis if you're interested in social
[SPEAKER_03]: equity come into cannabis there is so much
happening within this industry right now
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's why it's so dynamic but it's
also the foundation that's being built and
[SPEAKER_03]: there is a lot of responsibility we do
have in educating folks again you know
[SPEAKER_03]: within the industry CCIA we've probably
given over a hundred tours of commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities I know Kat's been on a few of
those opening people's eyes up and being
[SPEAKER_03]: able to talk to operators is key I always
say coming out of the closet you know I
[SPEAKER_03]: come out of the closet all the time as a
cannabis consumer you know I exercise in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis shirts the cultural shift that we
need to make happen is real you know
[SPEAKER_03]: talking about going into meetings and
having people closed off with their
[SPEAKER_03]: assumptions of what cannabis is and who we
are as a community is real I've walked out
[SPEAKER_03]: of county supervisor meetings you know
when stats were thrown out about this
[SPEAKER_03]: being a gateway drug and when I asked what
survey what study that came from said well
[SPEAKER_03]: it's just a feeling well we're moving past
that this industry is legitimizing it is
[SPEAKER_03]: professionalizing we need to honor the
diversity and inclusion and equity that
[SPEAKER_03]: created this industry and make sure that's
reflective you know within our community
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole way through so I know you need
to start checking messages and I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: honor your time so happy to take any a few
questions before we let go of Kat I was
[SPEAKER_00]: very curious about your talking about
having a framework for language did you
[SPEAKER_00]: work with Kat's department to help develop
that language but more importantly when is
[SPEAKER_03]: that going to be available we actually
worked we have a diversity and inclusion
[SPEAKER_03]: committee at CCIA so what we did is one we
started with educating ourselves on the
[SPEAKER_03]: issues we brought on Hood Incubator that
could educate us on you know the the
[SPEAKER_03]: troubles they've had with their equity
program to talk about the war on drugs to
[SPEAKER_03]: talk about you know issues that I might
not see that they're dealing with on a
[SPEAKER_03]: regular basis even you know one of the the
program issues that I found from putting
[SPEAKER_03]: incubator is once they do get folks
through the process and they're able to
[SPEAKER_03]: get a grant what do they do with that
check you're giving somebody a check that
[SPEAKER_03]: can't get a bank account you know to get
them off the ground all of these just
[SPEAKER_03]: little you know different issues we
brought on minorities for medical
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana they could help educate us as
well you know we've continued to do that
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to make sure that our messaging is
sensitive and is not creating further
[SPEAKER_03]: stigma in any way shape or form so we'll
be releasing that soon yeah again language
[SPEAKER_03]: does matter the whole black white market
thing I think is something we need to
[SPEAKER_03]: address right quick before it gains
momentum so yeah that is something that we
[SPEAKER_03]: have done you know as an association
[SPEAKER_02]: speaking back to the language situation
when can we start seeing this be
[SPEAKER_02]: translated into our regulations and laws
where we strike the racially motivated
[SPEAKER_02]: work marijuana from our terminology so
that we can start addressing this as we
[SPEAKER_02]: did in the 30s and prior as cannabis and
I'm very happy to see as much as we've
[SPEAKER_02]: changed but part of this social equity
program is there any way under also
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding it has not really anything
to do with that if we can start making
[SPEAKER_02]: sure that we don't utilize that term
anymore I imagine you know when folks get
[SPEAKER_06]: organized amazing things happen right and
so I can imagine you know the industry
[SPEAKER_06]: community members approaching a legislator
and saying we want to adopt state
[SPEAKER_06]: legislation statewide legislation that
would strike black market and replace with
[SPEAKER_06]: unregulated market or or in the future in
future communications and any type of
[SPEAKER_06]: thing that's going to be an official
publication in a talking point that are
[SPEAKER_06]: going to come from someone's public
relations office that we're not going to
[SPEAKER_06]: use that term I would be very excited to
see something like that I think internally
[SPEAKER_06]: within the city of Los Angeles and again
you say this and then you might catch
[SPEAKER_06]: yourself saying black market right and so
it's a process to purge the word from our
[SPEAKER_06]: vocabulary but within the city of Los
Angeles and within my department I've let
[SPEAKER_06]: my staff know you know there are a couple
of phrases that I think that we need to to
[SPEAKER_06]: change and so I think that part of what we
want to do is to first internally make
[SPEAKER_06]: sure that we're cleaning up our language
lead by example and then when other folks
[SPEAKER_06]: start to adopt that language again that
impact doesn't just carry throughout the
[SPEAKER_06]: state but it gets back to Ohio right and I
would say it is happening at the state
[SPEAKER_03]: level you know as much as we started to
bring that up to them that's why it's now
[SPEAKER_03]: the Bureau of Cannabis Control you know
they've started to get that we've started
[SPEAKER_03]: to bring out the black market white market
issue we're starting to see progress in
[SPEAKER_03]: bill language and but it does take us
bringing it up they're not going to do it
[SPEAKER_03]: on their own you know we have to educate
them on why it's an issue and what the
[SPEAKER_05]: solution is yeah I'm an attorney and I've
had some well a strong personal passion
[SPEAKER_05]: and some work experience in economic
development in low-income communities and
[SPEAKER_05]: so my concern for maybe tier one and tier
two social equity applicants is that
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially some of these business owners
have never run a business and cannabis is
[SPEAKER_05]: a highly regulated business it's going to
require a lot of administrative knowledge
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of dodging the eyes crossing the
keys tax law advising accounting advising
[SPEAKER_05]: business formation advising that people
can't go to the SBA and say I'm starting a
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis business can you help me so is
the DCR planning workshops of the SBA
[SPEAKER_05]: nature for social equity applicants and
when do those start coming online right so
[SPEAKER_06]: it sounds like you said you have a
background in doing some of that that work
[SPEAKER_06]: and so again we pass these policies back
in December of last year part of the
[SPEAKER_06]: complication and challenges that the city
hasn't dedicated any specific funding
[SPEAKER_06]: towards the the program and you can
imagine even if you were to to get one of
[SPEAKER_06]: these SBAs to you know even do what they
normally do for cannabis business and
[SPEAKER_06]: there are conversations about whether or
not they can even use their regular
[SPEAKER_06]: services for cannabis businesses because
they receive federal funding but we're
[SPEAKER_06]: it's our intention to build that type of
program and be able to implement that type
[SPEAKER_06]: of program the challenge is is that this
is not a program that's born overnight and
[SPEAKER_06]: people need resources and information now
so I think in the interim you will see me
[SPEAKER_06]: and my staff out in the community sharing
information and trying to provide
[SPEAKER_06]: education but I want to be very
transparent in saying that you know it's
[SPEAKER_06]: not my subject matter expertise to
implement or to specifically develop a
[SPEAKER_06]: business development program so we're
going to have to bring on that capacity
[SPEAKER_06]: and again that capacity is going to need
to be funded so I think that there are
[SPEAKER_06]: still very basic issues that the city of
Los Angeles is trying to work out you know
[SPEAKER_06]: it's my intention and full transparency to
not begin phase three until those things
[SPEAKER_06]: are up and running now that's going to
cause some complications for folks but I
[SPEAKER_06]: think that in order for us to make good on
our promise that's what it's going to take
[SPEAKER_06]: absolutely and and I think that there are
going to be some upcoming efforts to do
[SPEAKER_06]: just that so let me share share some of
those with you one I would invite folks to
[SPEAKER_06]: come to the next cannabis regulation
Commission meeting that's going to be on
[SPEAKER_06]: the 9th it's going to be in Deaton
auditorium and so it's not going to be in
[SPEAKER_06]: in City Hall council chambers again but we
have the information on our website at
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.lacity.org so I would implore
folks to come to the cannabis regulation
[SPEAKER_06]: Commission meeting it's going to be these
are our new members who have been
[SPEAKER_06]: appointed we've had one meeting at this
point steep learning curve for the
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis industry but they need to know
that this is a concern and then similarly
[SPEAKER_06]: folks may have seen that yesterday the
city of Los Angeles officially rescinded
[SPEAKER_06]: what was originally the cannabis
reinvestment act and so there was supposed
[SPEAKER_06]: to be an initiative that was put on the
ballot this November to create some new
[SPEAKER_06]: tax provisions that could have funded a
number of different cannabis programs
[SPEAKER_06]: could have developed funding for the
social equity program for a number of
[SPEAKER_06]: reasons that I agree with the cannabis
reinvestment act was rescinded and instead
[SPEAKER_06]: there was an instruction given to various
departments the cannabis Department of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis regulation included to report
back on programming costs and so very soon
[SPEAKER_06]: the Department of cannabis regulation is
going to be submitting a interim budget
[SPEAKER_06]: request for three things namely we're
going to submit an interim budget request
[SPEAKER_06]: for a public education and outreach
campaign staff training and for the
[SPEAKER_06]: development of a social equity program and
as a part of those budget requests will
[SPEAKER_06]: also put together recommendations on the
city's budget policy for both our
[SPEAKER_06]: regulatory program and enforcement but I
would definitely encourage folks to stay
[SPEAKER_06]: involved here and then also folks should
be aware that you know it's not just the
[SPEAKER_06]: city of Los Angeles that needs to move on
this issue I'd love to see the industry
[SPEAKER_06]: independently move on this issue I'd love
to see the state of California join in an
[SPEAKER_06]: effort to move on this issue we do know
that there's still pending legislation and
[SPEAKER_06]: money that could be developed at the state
level and diverted to local equity
[SPEAKER_06]: programs and so again this is a part of
this conversation that's still evolving
[SPEAKER_03]: Final question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Yvette.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been interesting and I have to say
that it's been an eye-opening experience
[SPEAKER_06]: to again transition from being a community
organizer agitator to being a regular
[SPEAKER_06]: regulator and a general manager so
similarly you know when I talk to
[SPEAKER_06]: principals I'm talking to the police chief
I'm talking to the fire chief I'm talking
[SPEAKER_06]: to the city attorney and having all of
these these conversations about how we
[SPEAKER_06]: move this conversation forward I think
that LAPD doesn't want to be generally out
[SPEAKER_06]: there banging out hammers they recognize
that it's not you know politically
[SPEAKER_06]: appealing to go on a bunch of raids that's
not as exciting as it may have been in the
[SPEAKER_06]: early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not as sexy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah it's not as sexy as it was in the
early 2000s but at the same time community
[SPEAKER_06]: members are very much concerned about
dispensaries primarily dispensaries in
[SPEAKER_06]: their community and you know for what I
imagine is for a local government it must
[SPEAKER_06]: be very frustrating to have this kind of
constantly escape your grasp community
[SPEAKER_06]: members come up to you and say you know
what are you doing about this dispensary
[SPEAKER_06]: that's in my neighborhood I personally
complain five times a week I've been doing
[SPEAKER_06]: this for the last two years you shut them
down they they opened up next door and now
[SPEAKER_06]: they're expanding you know that that has
to be very frustrating for law enforcement
[SPEAKER_06]: and so while at the same time I personally
experienced that no LAPD does not want to
[SPEAKER_06]: go and do a bunch of raids and
particularly it's the same people it's
[SPEAKER_06]: their gang and narcotics unit and so these
are people who are dealing with things
[SPEAKER_06]: that are much more problematic than
cannabis and at the same time if a
[SPEAKER_06]: community member has a real issue that
issue should be able to be addressed and
[SPEAKER_06]: so I think that part of what the city of
Los Angeles has been doing and what the
[SPEAKER_06]: department has been doing we have been
facilitating a conversation about
[SPEAKER_06]: enforcement in the city where on a regular
basis I have calls with the head of the
[SPEAKER_06]: gang and narcotics unit every Tuesday we
meet on a regular basis with the city
[SPEAKER_06]: attorney's marijuana enforcement unit fire
department building and safety who would
[SPEAKER_06]: normally go in for code compliance and
we're having a real and transparent
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation around you know everything
we've been doing in the past it's not
[SPEAKER_06]: necessarily working you know we're playing
this game of whack-a-mole so so how do we
[SPEAKER_06]: figure out something that's going to be
sustainable because a lot of times when
[SPEAKER_06]: we're when we're making this arrest we're
also arresting primarily employees and so
[SPEAKER_06]: you know my recommendation has been with
there really does need to be one this
[SPEAKER_06]: educational effort so that folks know very
clearly what's legal and what's illegal
[SPEAKER_06]: activity and namely that what I'm and it's
frustrating for folks it's still new for
[SPEAKER_06]: folks but the truth of the matter is if
you want to engage in operated business
[SPEAKER_06]: you need a state license and local
authorization period and I know that a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of people particularly folks who haven't
been licensed yet that that puts a sour
[SPEAKER_06]: taste in your mouth but that's where we
are and I think that that type of
[SPEAKER_06]: educational effort is necessary at the
same time I think we've got to figure out
[SPEAKER_06]: a more permanent enforcement strategy my
recommendation again has been we need to
[SPEAKER_06]: target business owners and we need to
target property owners and and again
[SPEAKER_06]: property owners have kind of held the key
across the board there are people who are
[SPEAKER_06]: looking for legitimate spaces in the city
and they can't find legitimate spaces
[SPEAKER_06]: because all of the legal shops are using
are using those locations and so again
[SPEAKER_06]: what can be very complicated conversations
and at the same time I still I see a real
[SPEAKER_06]: effort being made by the city attorney's
office by LAPD to make a change in
[SPEAKER_06]: institutionally that is progress in itself
and and so I think we're over the course
[SPEAKER_06]: of the next several months particularly as
we report back to counsel on and in
[SPEAKER_06]: enforcement strategy on various costs
you'll see this conversation being
[SPEAKER_06]: elevated but I don't think it's a one size
fit all I don't think that it means just
[SPEAKER_06]: throwing more money at the at law
enforcement I think that if particularly
[SPEAKER_06]: if we have an opportunity to reframe what
enforcement looks like for cannabis I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: very excited about that conversation
because that's a very important
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation for us to have you know I
want to make sure that once we if we flip
[SPEAKER_06]: that switch and say that we've made a
change I want to make sure that that
[SPEAKER_06]: change means that we don't see the same
disparities that we saw prior to
[SPEAKER_06]: proposition 64 so again I think we still
have a lot to figure out but I'm two weeks
[SPEAKER_06]: away from having served a year with the
city of Los Angeles and there has been
[SPEAKER_06]: considerable progress made so I'm excited
about that thank you to cat
[SPEAKER_03]: many challenges in this process but it's
good to have you know cities and
[SPEAKER_03]: regulators that are working with the
industry to solve some of these challenges
[SPEAKER_06]: absolutely and I appreciate everyone's
time normally I come to these events and I
[SPEAKER_06]: have a trail of folks that want to
communicate afterwards I will leave my
[SPEAKER_06]: cards but I have to immediately leave I'm
very concerned I've been away from the
[SPEAKER_06]: office for about two hours and we went
live 45 minutes ago so I've got to get
[SPEAKER_06]: back to home base but thank you thank you
