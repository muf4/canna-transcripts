[SPEAKER_01]: We did the Willie Nelson transaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We led the series A on Willie.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually were working very closely with
the Grateful Dead and the Garcia Band
[SPEAKER_01]: estate as well at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were looking really seriously at,
do we bring a Grateful Dead cannabis brand
[SPEAKER_01]: to market?
[SPEAKER_01]: And right when Marley was being done by
Privateer and right around the same time
[SPEAKER_01]: that you were watching Snoop work with
Casa Verde.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone was thinking about the
standpoint of, do you need a marquee sort
[SPEAKER_01]: of endorser to do it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing I kept hearing that was
consistent across everyone is,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, the advertising equivalency of
having these people out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: having the name out there, because if
there's restrictions on advertising and
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing, can you make up for those
restrictions by actually having a Willie
[SPEAKER_01]: Nelson at every single tour stop wearing a
Willie's Reserve hat or having Snoop Dogg
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about the fact he's got some deal
with Live Well in Colorado and that that
[SPEAKER_01]: was going to drive business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, you look at the wine
industry and while you might have a
[SPEAKER_01]: Coppola wine, it's not Coppola's name that
drives the other sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the underlying product itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think with cannabis, I think right
now what's becoming hot are specific
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics are still hot and then it's
specific growers that are putting those
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics out.
[SPEAKER_00]: What made Willie Nelson's likeness
compelling to you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I voted against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the only person on the investment
committee that said no.
