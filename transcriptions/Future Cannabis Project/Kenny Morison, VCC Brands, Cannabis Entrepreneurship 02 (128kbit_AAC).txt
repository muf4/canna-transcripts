[SPEAKER_00]: If I compare myself to other food
companies that make food without the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis component, what's the difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, I've been saying the only
thing that's illegitimate about my
[SPEAKER_00]: business is the way that I'm treated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because as we were talking about creating
the highest quality product I can,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of our first goals was to produce it
in a commercial kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because back in 2008, it was pretty much
being made at home by someone stuck in
[SPEAKER_00]: their backpack, delivered to the store,
coming out of a backpack in a home
[SPEAKER_00]: kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we wanted to kind of elevate the
expectations and the norms of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a key way to do that was to produce the
products in a commercial kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could convey that they're made in
the most responsible, safe way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue with that is LA County Health
Department does not allow cannabis to be
[SPEAKER_00]: infused into products in a
health-inspected kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: By law,
[SPEAKER_00]: by definition of infusing cannabis oils
into food products, you're adulterating
[SPEAKER_00]: food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm basically, at this stage of the
game, I'm a professional food adulterator,
[SPEAKER_00]: according to LA County.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I trust that's going to change soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And technology and society are quite often
a couple steps ahead of laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you look at what Airbnb is
doing or what Uber is doing, these are
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that are breaking the law
because they've created a new technology
[SPEAKER_00]: or a new platform that just isn't being
compromised.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not contemplated by local laws yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: In San Francisco County, they also don't
want you using a health-inspected kitchen,
[SPEAKER_00]: a commercial kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want you using a home kitchen
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have a rule where they suggest you're
using some kitchen in the middle ground
[SPEAKER_00]: area, like a semi-commercial kitchen at a
retirement home, or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what their local department of
health is suggesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know companies up there are using
commercial kitchens as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're using commercial kitchens,
but they're always sort of looking over
[SPEAKER_01]: their shoulder?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who would be the ones to affect the policy
changes to catch up with where the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry wants to be or is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Howard Zinn said that democracy is
not only a counting up of laws,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a counting up of actions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way we affect change is by doing
what we do and popularizing or normalizing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're furthering the discussion by
starting the discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the discussion is capturing the
attention of a lot of people right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the laws are going to change real
short, real quickly here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something I've been dealing with
since 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's Assembly Bill 266,
which is looking like it has a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: momentum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be passed by the
legislature and signed by the governor in
[SPEAKER_00]: September.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is July, August.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in August now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's next month.
[SPEAKER_02]: And tell me what Legislation 266 is about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically says that the Board of
Equalization will be in charge of
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It says the Department of Health will be
in charge of testing and food safety,
[SPEAKER_00]: manufactured products, infused product
safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says that the Department of
Agriculture will be in charge of the
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture component overseeing safety in
cannabis cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you think those three organizations
are currently educated and equipped to
[SPEAKER_01]: take on those responsibilities?
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're not educated, they're not
equipped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not educated yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they'll be mandated to get educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so hopefully it happens quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the cultivation side of things,
really what needs to just happen is people
[SPEAKER_00]: need to stop viewing cannabis through a
stigmatized lens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because agriculture is agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of suggestions that cannabis
be subject to a whole different set of
[SPEAKER_00]: rules than any other plant or food product
that's grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tomatoes, any food product you can think
of, you're given a license based on the
[SPEAKER_00]: square footage or the size of your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the cannabis world, they're still
in this prohibition mindset of wanting to
[SPEAKER_00]: do it based on a plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually been changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Assembly Bill 266 no longer contemplates
the size of your grow by plant count.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a while there it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just because federal law over
99 plants, certain mandatory minimums kick
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for enforcement, plant count is a
really simple, easy way to judge the size
[SPEAKER_00]: of a grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Agricultural enforcement is not based on
more or less than 99 tomato plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the cultivation side of things,
it just needs to be viewed as just another
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the manufacturing side of things,
there's going to be a lot more of a
[SPEAKER_00]: learning curve for the regulatory
oversight body.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have to learn a little
bit about THC and a little bit about
[SPEAKER_00]: chemistry and how THCA is decarboxylated
into THC and potency and the different
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that are in the plant and
what they do and which ones are
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactive and which ones aren't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have to learn about
viable testing methods versus ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't work so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be more of a learning
curve for that.
Thank you.
Thank you.
