[SPEAKER_01]: Brian Chaplin, founder of Medicine Box,
we make mindful medicine through the
[SPEAKER_01]: wisdom of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our product is a tincture that's a sleep
elixir by the name of equanimity.
[SPEAKER_01]: My definition of equanimity is remaining
cool, calm, collected when a person,
[SPEAKER_01]: place, or thing is triggering me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone has a different
representation of what equanimity means to
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the scientific world, we hear
homeostasis or equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_01]: This particular product that we make is
blended with chamomile, lemon balm,
[SPEAKER_01]: catnip, skullcap, mucic, which is a
vitamin B6, and tryptophan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So tryptophan converts your serotonin
while you sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we blend that with a specific
cultivar that's grown out of Nevada
[SPEAKER_01]: County, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a local co-op.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Nevada County, Sierra Sungrown Co-op,
they have 45,000 square feet of canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Nevada County, the maximum square
footage of canopy is 10,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all very craft, boutique, artisanal
farmers, born and raised.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of Medicine Box's values is
collaboration with our community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are providing them with our specific
genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We provide the genetics as the brand to
the co-op.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those genetics have been passed down
through the wisdom of cannabis in Nevada
[SPEAKER_01]: County.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a specific cultivar that landed up on
the North San Juan Ridge around 1974.
[SPEAKER_01]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we use full spectrum extract and
we blend that with the other synergistic
[SPEAKER_01]: herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes a very, very potent sleep elixir.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the concoction was created just really
following the mission and that intuitive
[SPEAKER_01]: guidance of Medicine Box, which is
blending science with the practical wisdom
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I say practical wisdom, that's all
the anecdotal experience and the knowledge
[SPEAKER_01]: that's been passed down way before Prop
64, 40, 50, 60 years, thousands of years
[SPEAKER_01]: with indigenous cultures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that knowledge has been consistently
passed down and we all know experience
[SPEAKER_01]: turns into knowledge, knowledge turns into
wisdom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're blending the science and the
wisdom of cannabis with our cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: culture in California.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the amount of R&D that we've done has
been, it's been a couple years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought on a PhD plant scientist from
Israel to help formulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't just throwing a bunch of
herbs and some full spectrum cannabis in a
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mixing it up over grandma's stove.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was actual specific ratios and
combinations of the herbs and their
[SPEAKER_01]: absorption rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a lot of experiential data that
we've been handing out to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we know, there is no real blanket
umbrella approach to treating people or
[SPEAKER_01]: helping them sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone has a little bit of different
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I like to say, every body is different
and everybody is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there will be that variation on a
little bit of trial and error to figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out what dose properly works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it might take two, three times.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, back to that mission statement
is mindful medicine through the wisdom of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: A tincture would be sublingual.
[SPEAKER_01]: We prefer to use a sublingual as dose by
one dropper is 10 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 milligrams between five and 10
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of our consumers or patients
that have taken that find that between
[SPEAKER_01]: five and 10 milligrams is an optimal dose
for sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything under that between one and three
milligrams as a micro dose can really help
[SPEAKER_01]: calm the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're selling sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not really selling a tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're selling sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anxiety is a sleepless person's worst
nightmare, pun intended.
[SPEAKER_01]: They go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like standing in the beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: People riddled with anxiety, ruminate on
their thoughts when they lay in bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't get a good night's rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next day, they're filled with anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cognitive functions off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their homeostasis is off.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not in equanimity.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're in equanimity, we show up for
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We show up for our loved ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We show up for our business partners and
employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're really selling equanimity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm selling equanimity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, equanimity was my mentors.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a really good piece of culture
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: My mentor, Michael Hollister, God bless
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He passed away with cancer last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was 52 years in the cannabis industry
as a breeder and medicine maker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he passed down a lot of his wisdom to
me, which I was able to formulate and then
[SPEAKER_01]: take like Frodo Baggins and Tamordor,
right, and Tamordor with the industry as
[SPEAKER_01]: Mordor right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like Frodo Baggins and be able
to really blend the science with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I owe a lot to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of that wisdom of cannabis
that's been passed down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it helped me personally as the
founder.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a recovering alcoholic drug addict
that celebrated seven years of sobriety on
[SPEAKER_01]: the 9th of September.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my physician, prescribed me an SSRI
two years in, peaks and valleys,
[SPEAKER_01]: peaks and valleys, little SSRI by the name
Prozac.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know any better.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was on Prozac for about a year and a
half.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my mentor and I use this blend of
equanimity and another CBD, high CBD ratio
[SPEAKER_01]: blend that we'll be bringing to market
next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: In combination, to transition me off of
SSRIs.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD isolate versus whole plant,
completely different beasts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whole plant has a full spectrum blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Furthering the science behind this is this
massive trend CBD ghetto, right,
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from hemp with all this deceptive
marketing practices, full spectrum,
[SPEAKER_01]: isolate, full spectrum hemp, 300
milligrams of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: 300 milligrams of cannabinoids is plural.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD isolate is singular compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whole plant medicine, when I say whole
plant, we don't use a trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use the whole flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use the tops of sun, ground,
flower and soil, sun and water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use the tops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get the full spectrum range of
cannabinoids and terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is one particular genetic that has a
beautiful combination.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'll get into some combinations of
specific terpenes, mercine, linalool,
[SPEAKER_01]: visibolo, betacorapilene.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also has a nice ratio of CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBN in combination with THC is an
extremely effective sedative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two and a half to five milligrams of CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seep Hill Labs did a study.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's as effective as five to ten
milligrams of diazepine.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the rare cannabinoids have to be
in combination together for them to
[SPEAKER_01]: effectively work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's go back to the CBD isolate ghetto
versus the whole plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD just take CBD and all your problems
will go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD is an antagonist, which means it only
binds to your CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC is an agonist, which activates your
CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, the cannabinoid that commingles with
your synapses, your presynaptic and your
[SPEAKER_01]: postsynaptic, actually acts as a key and
unlocks your CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or in layman terms, it's the lubricant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to say a little bit of THC is the
lubricant to unlock that CB1 receptor so
[SPEAKER_01]: all the other cannabinoids and herbs and
terpene profile can come in and work its
[SPEAKER_01]: magic in your endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: CB1 receptor is your central nervous
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That helps regulate your sleep,
your mood, and bring you back into
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis or equanimity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to live my life in like Venn
diagrams a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's take a simple Venn diagram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the cannabis industry, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Over 20 billion by 2022.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the sleep industry right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's a crossover sleep industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 billion plus the same year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our product What supplies is the sleep
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sleep industry anywhere from mattresses,
apps on your phone, white noise makers,
[SPEAKER_01]: fans, bedding, curtains, noise makers,
herbal things, essential oils,
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sleep is an epidemic right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We live, lack of sleep is an epidemic
which translates into more anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: More anxiety translates into lack of
sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a vicious cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as an entrepreneur in the cannabis
space, there's too many pressures and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's too many people, places and things
that knock us off balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, the very thing that we're all
going for in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: we forget it's the very thing that can
help us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I'm all about,
being of service to others and helping
[SPEAKER_01]: people have a more holistic lifestyle
through practical wisdom.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if people are getting off their
Ambience and their Prozacs and their
[SPEAKER_01]: Zolofts and their Xanaxes at the same
time, we're winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all winning.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ambience is a hypnotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't get into that REM.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to get into your REM sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you dream, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we dream, we create.
[SPEAKER_01]: Google was created through a dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many great inventions are created from
dreaming and sleep?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sleep is something that people,
it's an afterthought, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like let's look through the lens of sleep
and wellness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what Medicine Box is doing with
this very niche product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of people that I know that
don't know how to sleep well are looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking for solutions,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to be on Ambience,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: My friend's grandmother is trying to get
off Ambience and is using this product to
[SPEAKER_01]: help with that, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to get back to the euphoria with
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: You asked about the euphoria.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm glad you asked about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, that's like the, let's use the
spoonful of sugar analogy again,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And not CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: But THC, if you just take THC alone,
or we know it as Distill-It, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You are going to get high, all right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't use Distill-It.
[SPEAKER_01]: Distill-It, you take everything out of
that to get the THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not about getting high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about getting well, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of euphoria, we don't need to
be scared about.
[SPEAKER_01]: People don't need to be scared about a
little bit of euphoria or that
[SPEAKER_01]: euphorophobia that's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't get you high.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not CBD versus THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's CBD in THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are friends, okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of THC in our product is
actually the highest concentration
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrated cannabinoid in this specific
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it works well with the CBD,
the CBG, and the CBN.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you're sleeping, again,
let's think about when we were children,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just all big kids, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Our mom or dad or someone or grandmother
or aunt, they would lullaby us to sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's THC do?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of THC gives you a little bit
of that euphoria that's a lullaby.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lullaby.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC is a little, let's not be scared of
euphoric feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, CBD is psychotropic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anything that changes your brain chemistry
is considered psychotropic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of that deceptive
marketing going on out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And CBD doesn't help you sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's being marketed and sold as sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD is more of a stimulating cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that does not help you sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's contradictory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So CBD, isolate, blend it with a little
lavender, and they can say it helps with
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: That to me is a very lackluster,
generic shit product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indica's help you sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the specific cultivar that we use is
an indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is bred from Afghan indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: That came from India in 1972.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sounds great.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the wisdom of cannabis right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the wisdom of cannabis also has open
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, these breeders, they worked these
seeds up and down the coast of California,
[SPEAKER_01]: up to British Columbia, down to Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like wines have specific
appellations, those specific, that
[SPEAKER_01]: land-raised genetic adapted to those
appellations, to those growing conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Grass Valley and Nevada County The
elevation that it's at, between 1,200 from
[SPEAKER_01]: the valley floor up to 3,000 feet,
the amount of sun exposure that we get,
[SPEAKER_01]: hot, hot, hot summers, mild, wet winters,
just like the Mediterranean climate,
[SPEAKER_01]: it grows specifically well there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we use a localized cultivar and a local
manufactured product that is distributed
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one ever said this was going to be easy
in getting medicine to people that don't
[SPEAKER_01]: even know they need medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been really rewarding.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been stressful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use my own product.
[SPEAKER_01]: The politics of Grass Valley, I have to
give a shout out to the Nevada County
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis Alliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was a former board member there.
[SPEAKER_01]: In 2016, there was a full on ban on
cannabis cultivation in that county,
[SPEAKER_01]: Measure W.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Nevada County Cannabis Alliance was
formed to overturn that ban.
[SPEAKER_01]: And within two years, we voted in a new
ordinance.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are now 11 licensed cultivators in
Nevada County, Nevada City, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: municipality of the Grand Canyon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greater County has a dispensary,
Elevation 2477.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're in that shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is... It doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good to see you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nevada City has adopted all license types
throughout the whole supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got two new supervisors, but we got a
new sheriff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keith Royal, that's been raining down his
propaganda and stigmatization.
[SPEAKER_01]: An anti-cannabis crusade against Nevada
County is finally out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a much more progressive female,
Shannon Moon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, Shannon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in North Lake Tahoe, but I own real
estate.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Nevada County, and our base of
operations is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Base of operations is in Nevada County.
[SPEAKER_01]: The source of inspiration is in Tahoe,
and I blend those together.
[SPEAKER_02]: How can people find your product?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you like what you hear, and there's a
local dispensary that you want us to be
[SPEAKER_01]: featured in, let's just do some
grassroots, good old cannabis culture
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can they find you?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find us.
[SPEAKER_01]: My Instagram is underscore Brian Chaplin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot of my personal lifestyle,
educational posts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our company is medicine underscore
box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Website, medicinebox.green.
[SPEAKER_01]: And keep an eye out by the end of the year
for a podcast that we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll be talking about a lot of this,
and whole list of practical wisdom,
[SPEAKER_01]: and holistic lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see adding more products on.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why we didn't go with
multiple products, I really wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: focus in and laser in on that niche.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we're selling sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not selling cannabis or a tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're selling sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is really that evolving medium
that weaves it all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And medicinebox, it's a binder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like cannabis is that thread that
pulls it all together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just the herbs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So medicinebox really is what's in your
box of medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you opened up your toolbox and dumped
it at your feet, what are those tools that
[SPEAKER_01]: you use to heal yourself or stay whole or
in equanimity day to day?
[SPEAKER_01]: My initial calling or the vision for
medicinebox was that the majority of human
[SPEAKER_01]: beings across the globe would replace the
traditional contents of their medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: cabinets with the cannabis health and
wellness supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or sit and meditate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do qigong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or walk in nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or be an advocate for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or recover from drugs, alcohol,
harmful relationships, physical,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a holistic lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the truth that we're really
trying to bring to the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, you can say cannabis helps you
sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, is it smoking a joint,
taking a bong hint, taking a dab,
[SPEAKER_01]: rubbing a topical, eating an edible?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the specific product that's really
going to make an effect on a wide range of
[SPEAKER_01]: people?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the product that we created.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've bootstrapped this whole venture.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll continue bootstrapping it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we finally, it's like you make it to
the next level, to the next level,
[SPEAKER_01]: to the next level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Celebrate those mini triumphs and get to
that big win.
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We finally have a fully licensed,
compliant product through a licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing facility in Nevada City.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a 5,000 unit run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Very attractive product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very attractive brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got brought on to a distributor in Santa
Rosa through a friend in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry and an associate that I built a
relationship with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, the alignment was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The mission, the values were there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very gravitated towards the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Signed us on after a 30 day negotiation.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: They represent 150 stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: Astronomical service fee for distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a pay to play.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you're going to get us into 10,
20% of those stores by the end of Q4.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to be in all of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two stores in six weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, inner turmoil and conflict with the
internal startup team and the Canadian
[SPEAKER_01]: food company that acquired them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I knew they had Canadian funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know the details of all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything's really warm and fuzzy and
chummy and we're negotiating.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a good, great job negotiating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doing our due diligence.
[SPEAKER_01]: 5,000 units.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was our proof of concept run.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have a full sales team.
[SPEAKER_01]: Full logistics.
[SPEAKER_01]: They carry several other internal brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a third party brand.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, as a third party brand, we kind of
just stood alone on the side street.
Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And Canadian company trying to run a
California cannabis company without giving
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves the proper time to understand
the principles and personalities of
[SPEAKER_01]: California cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can have some compassion,
but then my patience runs dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, what happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: Canadian company acquires and starts
pushing around the internal startup team.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happening over here?
[SPEAKER_01]: One year.
[SPEAKER_01]: One year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We say one year, but the fractionated
coconut oil acts as a preservative.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, but it can't sit for two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can't sit for two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: My brand can't sit for two years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to be making forward momentum and
evolving.
Okay?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, a lot of drama happened in inner
turmoil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Poor timing, but what did it do?
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of chaos bomb as an
entrepreneur to keep you on your toes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're pivoting and we're maneuvering.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you have an exclusive with them?
[SPEAKER_01]: We negotiated non-exclusivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what took 30 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you can go with another distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can go with another distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a lot of people, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's staying localized,
what I've learned through the process,
[SPEAKER_01]: is staying localized in your local
community as part of our value and teaming
[SPEAKER_01]: up together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still believe all cannabis is local.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It still is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But do you know if any of their other
brands are having the same problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's turbulence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like we sat on the runway
for 30 days negotiating, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We finally take off the runway and we get
this momentum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have experienced turbulence and we
haven't even hit cruising altitude yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, do you still deal with any,
do they keep the original people there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you still interact with them?
[SPEAKER_01]: The original person that brought me in was
their global brand manager and the CEO of
[SPEAKER_01]: the acquiring company fired him because he
was speaking up on behalf of the brand
[SPEAKER_01]: that he brought in on customer service.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, instead of sitting down...
[SPEAKER_02]: So, but this guy is the guy who sold his
company.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's working hard at leveling the
playing field with his startup team and
[SPEAKER_01]: the Canadians.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I've learned a lot through that
process, but what did it do?
[SPEAKER_01]: It toughened me up and it made me realize
that I can be in control of my own
[SPEAKER_01]: destiny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you seen that story replayed
elsewhere in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my best friends his vape,
his extract company, his distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: The distributors are trying to push out
the little guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a tactic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, let's annoy them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's shadow ban them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's not give them the customer service
representation that they deserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully they get so frustrated that
they just quit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not going to quit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not going to see me quit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you still with this distributor?
[SPEAKER_02]: I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take your destiny to your own hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or sit down.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all out on the table now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you doing at the show here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this like a part of that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we have representation in their
booth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm also here to network and do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been talking to some other
distributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll be by the time this comes out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think all the distributors came in and
realized, you know, let's get the
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's try to control the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make all the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't care about bringing on brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: In my opinion, Hall of Flowers is here to
showcase brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, brands will have all the
equity in the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Distributors need brands just as much as
brands need distributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And brands also need a healthy supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the retailers, you know, they're the
end of the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need brands too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wholeheartedly believe in my mind
and my heart that the retailers in five
[SPEAKER_01]: years will be the wellness dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's where people can go to get a high-end
value-based product like the one that we
[SPEAKER_01]: make.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flower concentrates that ocean marketplace
of commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be a clear contrast of those
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I'm hearing dispensaries that
have 1,200 SKUs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like Trader Joe's.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's Whole Foods.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so finding and aligning with
retail spaces that have the niche products
[SPEAKER_01]: in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yours is a niche.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure there's anything else out
there really quite like.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're probably in a lane by yourself,
in a sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in a lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always say stay in your lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Brian, you need to do a CBD product.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a different lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it the whole plant medicine lane or
the intuitive highway.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just follow my gut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes I think we might be a little
bit too far ahead of the oversaturated
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers and pre-rolls and vapes and
gummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're too far ahead, it could
[SPEAKER_02]: be a disaster.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think that's the situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, you've got your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all logistics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm very grateful for my associates
and my co-founder to stay back in Nevada
[SPEAKER_01]: County today to sit and have a two-hour
meeting with our manufacturing alliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm here doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you constantly manufacturing now?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did one run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to do another
10,000-unit run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's all about doing sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
