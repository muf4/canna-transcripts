[SPEAKER_00]: So Monique has a presentation now.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's going to talk about more of ways to
be involved in the state level as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we've got to try to get some
relief here for farmers that are being
[SPEAKER_00]: totally crushed by all the fees and the
market not being there, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: across the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with that, Monique, let's hear how
we can get more involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just a small-time farmer, and I
started getting involved in the local
[SPEAKER_02]: policy by going to the Board of Supervisor
meetings, watching Ron, watching Casey
[SPEAKER_02]: from my television screen at home,
watching YouTube, and was like,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to get out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got to speak to this, because this is
really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have been really engaged just as
my own.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I went to the last two state
meetings that happened in Sacramento for
[SPEAKER_02]: the Cannabis Advisory Committee and spoke
during the public comment period about the
[SPEAKER_02]: topics that were important to me and my
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm just going to hit some highlights.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have, I think, 10 subcommittees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the interest of time, I just picked
out Microbusiness and the Cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: Subcommittee and just give you guys an
overview of where we're at with that right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Cultivators Subcommittee made a
couple of recommendations that they want
[SPEAKER_02]: to see the Bureau of Cannabis Control
basically change in the current
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is hopefully the hopeful part of
our presentation today.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first two were the generator hour
meters.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to amend section 8306,
number D, to allow aftermarket
[SPEAKER_02]: non-resettable hour meters to be
installed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the comment from CDFA was that there's
no provision right now in the ordinance or
[SPEAKER_02]: in the regulation that prohibits that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they still wanted to get this put in,
because they feel like it's not clearly
defined.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not defined for the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that recommended motion passed through
the larger subcommittee.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one was to add the definition
of outdoor cultivation by allowing the use
[SPEAKER_02]: of light deprivation techniques.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was also passed, or that passed by
the whole committee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the other recommendations were
unfortunately in statute, so it has to be
[SPEAKER_02]: a legislative fix basically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so these ones, it's gonna be a
little bit more of a battle to get them
[SPEAKER_02]: fixed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll just hit them really quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one was composting and waste
definition and the ability to sell unused
[SPEAKER_02]: waste products that lack the cannibinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one, this one is really
important to me personally, because I do
[SPEAKER_02]: have a 2,500 square foot permit in
Mendocino County, but the state for this
[SPEAKER_02]: type of license only allows me 25 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they wanna add square footage of 2,500
and 5,000 to the specialty cottage and the
[SPEAKER_02]: cottage license types.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, 5,000's in already.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just not the 25?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then number three is to allow
cultivators to transport their product to
[SPEAKER_02]: nearby licensed processors without
obtaining additional licensure.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a really important one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ones that are gonna be in bold that
you're gonna see in a moment, these ones
[SPEAKER_02]: were taken out of the meeting in LA and
they wanted to, it was my understanding,
[SPEAKER_02]: to basically bring those ones forward in
that meeting, but the meeting went so long
[SPEAKER_02]: that they didn't even have enough time to
really talk about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, go back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other one is to allow cultivated
material to be transferred between A and M
[SPEAKER_02]: designation license types until the point
of sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a topic that was discussed in a
lot of the different subcommittees and a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of public comment was expressed about
how cultivators really shouldn't be the
[SPEAKER_02]: ones designating the crop as adult use or
medical use.
[SPEAKER_02]: We should wait till it goes to the retail
location for that to be designated,
[SPEAKER_02]: because the plant stays the same the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really at the end point that that
should be decided.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that got a lot of support.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next one is to create a
cultivation-based tax incentive for
[SPEAKER_02]: products being set aside for compassionate
use programs.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a really important topic and they
all agreed to move that one forward before
[SPEAKER_02]: the next meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number six was cultivators should be able
to batch per area at the time of harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: for track and trace purposes and that they
should not need to identify each harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: back to the individual plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number seven, the CAC make changes to the
lab testing system to address the burdens
[SPEAKER_02]: that may impede a path to legalization,
such as the loss of strains, high cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inefficient accuracy levels, lack of
protections to the cultivator,
[SPEAKER_02]: among others.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said that some of those items are in
statute and some of them aren't,
[SPEAKER_02]: so they have to kind of pick that apart a
little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number eight, consideration of issues
related to scale licensing tiers for
[SPEAKER_02]: nurseries, packaging of seeds and batch
count by bulk weight, established genetic
[SPEAKER_02]: repositories, providing flexibility to
develop genetic diversity, allowing
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators to transport propagated plant
material and seeds, removing the
[SPEAKER_02]: requirement for nurseries to designate
seed and or plant stock as A or M
[SPEAKER_02]: material, allowing cultivators to provide
nurseries with genetic stock, allowing
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators to provide other cultivators
with plant materials in an emergency,
[SPEAKER_02]: provided proper documentation for all of
the above.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just think it's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're really trying to work to fix these
problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because we're showing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're speaking to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number nine, create a mechanism for
cultivators to conduct self-transport
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution of their own product to a
centralized processing facility,
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturing facility, distributor or a
lab for pre-testing without the same
[SPEAKER_02]: requirements of the existing
transportation license, including BCC
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation sections 5044 and 5047,
which really pertain to cameras,
[SPEAKER_02]: by either amending the existing
transportation distribution license or
[SPEAKER_02]: creating a new license type.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one I'm really excited about and I
really hope we can work to figure this one
[SPEAKER_02]: out because as a cultivator, we need to
have, this is a bottleneck right now in my
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have to take our product to a
distribution facility and then a testing
[SPEAKER_02]: lab has to go to the distributor to test
the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a lot of movement
happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we have the ability to bring our
product to the testing lab, that's gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: alleviate some of that bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was also voted on by the larger
subcommittees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then micro business subcommittee
didn't even have a chance to speak at the
[SPEAKER_02]: LA meeting because they ran out of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that meeting went for seven hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they had a half hour lunch break.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't take any other breaks besides
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is gonna come up at the next
meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we'll go ahead and go through this.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are recommendations related to
regulatory changes that can be adopted.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first one is about security
requirements for micro businesses and that
[SPEAKER_02]: they should be determined by the local
jurisdiction and the regulations should
[SPEAKER_02]: not be unduly burdensome to small
businesses and micro businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a lot of discussion on this
topic and that what works in LA doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: work in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's put it up to the local
jurisdictions to decide how they wanna
[SPEAKER_02]: maneuver the security issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, clarification of micro
business that includes tiers based on
[SPEAKER_02]: gross receipts and the number of
employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fee schedule should be redefined to
include a ceiling that delineates when the
[SPEAKER_02]: business is no longer considered a micro
business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Incentives should be provided based on
equity for compassionate use and rural
[SPEAKER_02]: operators.
[SPEAKER_02]: On this one they were really talking about
at some point a micro business isn't a
[SPEAKER_02]: micro business anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like where are we gonna cap it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because people are gonna take advantage of
this license type and it's really designed
[SPEAKER_02]: for small farmers, small businesses to
kind of be a competitor against the larger
[SPEAKER_02]: corporations.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if large corporations are taking
advantage of that micro license type,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think this will be a good one if we
can get that to be amended.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then these are the recommendations
that do require statutory changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, micro business licensees
should be allowed to utilize farm stand
[SPEAKER_02]: sales as well as farm direct sales model
such as CSAs without a brick and mortar to
[SPEAKER_02]: satisfy retail component of the license.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, all micro business activities
should not have to take place on a single
[SPEAKER_02]: premise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number three, micro business licensees
should be allowed to conduct offsite
[SPEAKER_02]: processing as one of their qualifying
activities and use shared facilities for
[SPEAKER_02]: any of their activities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number four, recognizing that micro
businesses frequently cannot operate at
[SPEAKER_02]: one contiguous location in large part
because of local land use ordinances and
[SPEAKER_02]: that it can be cost prohibitive for micro
businesses to obtain multiple licenses and
[SPEAKER_02]: accessory license should be created to tie
premises together beyond the simple
[SPEAKER_02]: geographic location while ensuring that
the flow of the product maintains a single
[SPEAKER_02]: chain of custody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just think there's a lot of thought
going into these subcommittee meetings and
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of it too is the public getting up
and expressing the issues and the concerns
[SPEAKER_02]: and the people at least that I've
witnessed in these panels, they really are
[SPEAKER_02]: listening to us and this is what's coming
out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why isn't it working?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this is the next cannabis advisory
committee meeting is on May 17th in
[SPEAKER_02]: Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: They haven't announced the exact time or
the location yet, but this is important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go to this meeting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like really, it's amazing like to get up
and to speak during public comment and
[SPEAKER_02]: express what you're facing as a cultivator
or whatever business type you have within
[SPEAKER_02]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to hear from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these people are our voice right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So unless we tell them this is a problem,
this regulation doesn't work, then it's
[SPEAKER_02]: not going to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have this opportunity right now to
affect it and it's really empowering as an
[SPEAKER_02]: individual to just get up and speak and
have your voice be heard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hope that that's the takeaway for all
of us is that we continue to stay engaged
[SPEAKER_02]: because this is our livelihood.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our life and we're not going to
just give it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So stay engaged.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also make sure that you stay informed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like people, sometimes people see those
and they think that the rules have already
[SPEAKER_01]: changed and that's not how it works.
[SPEAKER_01]: So understanding how the regulatory and
the statutory scheme works and how the law
[SPEAKER_01]: changes, these advisory meetings are
critical towards establishing better
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if people show up at them and give
public comment, then the people who are
[SPEAKER_01]: listening to those are advising the
individuals making the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can't read what was just said,
although these are great ideas and these
[SPEAKER_01]: are things that the industry is hopefully
moving in and walk away thinking that
[SPEAKER_01]: those rules have already changed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
