[SPEAKER_00]: It is such an incredibly strange and
amazing evolutionary historical moment
[SPEAKER_00]: that we're in in terms of you know some of
the cannabis industry from my perspective
[SPEAKER_00]: is you took a culture of underground
activists and now you've put them in
[SPEAKER_00]: business casual clothing and turned them
into ninjas who have to play an insane
[SPEAKER_00]: high-stakes Tetris match with the
government and like state and local
[SPEAKER_00]: ordinances to preserve like the soul of
what they were trying to do you know like
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like this is the part I like to make
clear of like we're in this weird you know
[SPEAKER_00]: running match with like fucking target to
decide who gets to have this industry you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and and some of us are like I got to
get more hair gel and be corporate and
[SPEAKER_00]: let's fucking do this you know and and
it's in it's the biggest like
[SPEAKER_00]: philosophical quandary I have day by day
of how do we create the world we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: create with this industry like how do we
get to sit at the table how do we get to
[SPEAKER_00]: navigate the process how do we get to
participate in informed policy which is
[SPEAKER_00]: still being written and for God's sakes
please let it be written by us like please
[SPEAKER_00]: let it be written by the people who
suffered and built the industry not by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Yahoo's coming from pharma who are like
I've got this now thanks for warming my
[SPEAKER_00]: seat we're good let's do this you know
it's it's ethically insane and
[SPEAKER_00]: questionable that so many people are
excited about making money in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: while people are still in jail for
cannabis crimes it's insane that that John
[SPEAKER_00]: Bonner and the Republicans and Mitch
whatever the hell his name is and all the
[SPEAKER_00]: excited people about him for like let's
put CBD in malls you know that is insane
[SPEAKER_00]: to me while we are still struggling to get
our social equity applicants operational
[SPEAKER_00]: in Los Angeles it's it's completely insane
so as boring as it sounds to some people
[SPEAKER_00]: about compliance in these things like we
are your ninja team that is here to like
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep dart the agencies and keep them off
your ass
