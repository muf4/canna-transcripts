[SPEAKER_00]: All right gentlemen and ladies,
I'm going to try to unteach what you know
[SPEAKER_00]: about soil and give you a different
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of like to take you out of your
comfort zone, take you out of your body
[SPEAKER_00]: and mind for a minute here and try to get
you to look at things a little
[SPEAKER_00]: differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is psychical soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, yes there actually is a word
psychical and it's psychic and physical
[SPEAKER_00]: and in many ways you know I truly believe
that soil is something that's beyond our
[SPEAKER_00]: comprehension, supernatural, paranormal,
paramagnetic, spiritual, extrasensory,
[SPEAKER_00]: subliminal, subconscious, clairvoyant and
in order to take this to another level I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to talk about the definition of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I struggle a lot with this because you
know here we are in the 2020 and we say a
[SPEAKER_00]: sperm is alive and an egg is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that our perspective of life and
that definition needs to be revisited.
[SPEAKER_00]: We say viruses are not alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well viruses have been around since the
beginning and they have steered evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: When something gets out of whack the virus
sets in, calls the herd to some degree and
[SPEAKER_00]: then allows a rebirth to come out of the
chaos and so again I think that in this
[SPEAKER_00]: day and age we should be looking at
things, have a better perspective on what
[SPEAKER_00]: we define as life and what we define as
not alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the other pieces of the puzzle that
I really want to talk about is the fourth
[SPEAKER_00]: phase of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: For you out there please just write that
down in between sessions or tonight or
[SPEAKER_00]: tomorrow whenever.
[SPEAKER_00]: Google it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are people out there that are trying
to debunk this understanding or concept so
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want you to focus on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to focus on what was written
and what has been talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like when you take your shoes
off and you walk in the sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a connection there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sand just makes you feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same as rolling around in the grass in the
sunshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a connection to the earth through
the moisture, through the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it be a mist or a vapor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a connection there and in the
fourth phase of water they touch on
[SPEAKER_00]: structured water which I'm not a big fan
of that term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to think of it more as
understanding the water's ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: transfer information, millivolts,
EC electrical conductivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually reading a paper right now by
a gentleman.
[SPEAKER_00]: His first name slips me in but his last
name is Bali.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's actually taken it to a whole other
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like without a way to define it other
than it's the fifth level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of his work is kind of showing us
that inside a bacteria which is one
[SPEAKER_00]: micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't see it unless you have a
microscope so it's very small.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 3.3 billion water molecules in
that single cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way those water molecules line up
allows for information to be transferred
[SPEAKER_00]: from one part of the cell to the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of the direction that I want
you to start thinking about water as well
[SPEAKER_00]: and life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that these definitions really need
to be explored deeper and hopefully in the
[SPEAKER_00]: next few years we really start to pay
attention to some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Moving on, this has always been one of the
funnest questions I ask when I'm sitting
[SPEAKER_00]: around with a bunch of nerds or people
that are way smarter than me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, where does the soil stop and the
plant begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a conversation that's
beyond what most people stop to ponder
[SPEAKER_00]: about but it's an important question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can grow hydroponically which is
in water but we just talked about water
[SPEAKER_00]: and its properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you can sit there and say
that just because you're growing in water,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not connected to the soil or what I
want to call the aquatic food web which is
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar to the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get into that in more detail as we
go forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just stop for a second and ponder that
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where does one stop and the other begin?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a deep question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've stumped a lot of really brilliant
minds with that question and made them
[SPEAKER_00]: just sit back and go, wait a minute,
I never thought of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's an important question to ask
yourself, especially today as we move
[SPEAKER_00]: through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm trying to get you to think
outside the box of what you know and in
[SPEAKER_00]: hopes that I open your mind to some things
that perhaps you hadn't quite thought
[SPEAKER_00]: about yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the properties of soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil science says, and this is dogma,
that soil is defined by the particulate
[SPEAKER_00]: size and not the properties of the
particulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, that just makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sand, silt, and clay all have different
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've ever done a home textural test
where you've taken a handful of your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and you put it in a mason jar,
added a little bit of water and shook it
[SPEAKER_00]: up, you will see it settles out
differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sand settles first, clay second,
or excuse me, the silt second,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the clay last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then, of course, what's floating is your
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right away, the specific gravity of sand,
silt, and clay and organic matter are all
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to get into specifics on what
the properties of each one of these are.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will hopefully get you to start to
understand that they're critical
[SPEAKER_00]: components in growing plants of any kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another piece of the puzzle that is not
discussed or talked about often is soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: only 50% physical matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other 50% is air and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you get anaerobic and aerobic
conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the silt on the bottom of a creek or a
riverbed is anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You step in it and you pull your foot out
and you're covered with mud that smells
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the other end of the chart,
you have a desert where you have very
[SPEAKER_00]: little moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there is vapor trapped down lower
into the sand, but it's very aerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost oxidative.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost very difficult for that
moisture to hang around and be supportive
[SPEAKER_00]: of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, there are some plants that live in
deserts, but they're pretty scattered and
[SPEAKER_00]: not a lot of diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, soil is only 50% the physical
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other 50%, the water and the air or
gas exchange, are very, very important to
[SPEAKER_00]: support healthy plant life.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is sand?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's really three components to sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could either be silica or quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want you to think about that and look at
that molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: One part silica, two parts oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a bacteria in a soil system
that is mining silica for the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: remember the plant sends down exudates to
target specific bacteria to mine specific
[SPEAKER_00]: things to then make it available for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: As that bacterium pulls up the silica to
make it available for the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's releasing oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another key piece to understanding
how these components of soil are so
[SPEAKER_00]: important in providing the diversity that
you want in your soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had people say, we only need NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've learned that lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's way more nutrients than you need,
just NPK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I've heard people say, there's 17
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think that's narrow-minded.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that when you start to think about
the biological constituent that goes on,
[SPEAKER_00]: in many ways, a specific bacteria's main
purpose could be just to grow and die off
[SPEAKER_00]: and provide a substrate or a food source
for another bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe every part of the periodic table
is important for advanced life to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point in some time, all of these
minerals were being consumed or are
[SPEAKER_00]: continually being consumed just to support
the next level of advanced life or
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another part of sand can be calcium
carbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know how valuable calcium is in our
soil system for our plant health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it's basically fossilized corals and
shells.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got people saying, we can't get
calcium carbonate sand in the Midwest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: At some point in time, over the last
billions of years, everything has been
[SPEAKER_00]: underwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has had an ocean, a sea,
a shallow amount of water over the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: it that allowed some type of crustacean to
exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: All it takes is erosion and water movement
and some cases just wind to expose that
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think another great misnomer is the
understanding that the vast majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: soil on this planet, I believe it's about
80%, was moved through transportation or
[SPEAKER_00]: was formed through transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The wind, the water, the sun heating it up
and the water freezing and breaking it
[SPEAKER_00]: apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: All these things are part of the process
of forming soil and soil often took
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands if not millions of years to form
in the layers that it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other type is diatomaceous earth or
diatoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you who have heard me speak in
the past, I'm all about diatoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that they are in many ways the
missing link in our healthy soil system at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the great expansion of humanity,
all the rivers and creeks and lakes had
[SPEAKER_00]: herds, massive herds of animals running
through them, dragging up all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: aquatic food web including diatoms up onto
the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about migratory birds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are stories and pictures of the late
1800s where in the Carolinas, the sky
[SPEAKER_00]: darkened with the migration of these geese
and ducks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those migrated all over the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they took off and landed to eat grass,
all of the aquatic soil food web and
[SPEAKER_00]: diatoms were spread across the soil
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nowadays, we don't have those massive
herds or those massive migrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many ways, the diatoms and the other
parts of the aquatic food web are not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting up on the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: A quick little flashback, NASA did a study
in 2011 about the dust storms in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Sahara Desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they determined was that that dust
went all the way up into the upper
[SPEAKER_00]: atmosphere, floated across the ocean,
the Atlantic Ocean, and reformed into
[SPEAKER_00]: particulate that rained down on the Amazon
rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That study indicated that they believed it
was providing phosphorus for the Amazon
[SPEAKER_00]: rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another study that was done, I believe,
in 2017 where they took it a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: further and they realized that it was
really diatom shells as well as some
[SPEAKER_00]: silica sands.
[SPEAKER_00]: That were raining down on the Amazon
rainforest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the theory is it's more fertilizing
the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, these diatoms are very important in
the whole ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to touch on diatomaceous earth for
a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is where diatoms have been collected
or mined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, if you look at some of the
interesting satellite photography about
[SPEAKER_00]: the glaciers melting, you will see these
huge plumes of diatoms happening where
[SPEAKER_00]: that mineral rich water hits the ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: They plume out, they grow, they grow,
they grow until those minerals are
[SPEAKER_00]: depleted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They die off and they leave a huge layer
of diatomaceous earth on the sea floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then as the continents move and drift,
of course, billions of years, eventually
[SPEAKER_00]: those pockets of diatoms end up on the
surface of the earth instead of underneath
[SPEAKER_00]: deep water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, people use diatomaceous earth as an
insecticide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have pretty effective properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quick story, when I was young,
I got to tour a glass manufacturing plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: Foster Forbes Glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Hopedale, Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out back, there was this huge pile of
glass that had either screwed up and then
[SPEAKER_00]: dumped on the floor or bottles that
weren't quite manufactured correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would just throw them back.
[SPEAKER_00]: out in this giant pile and then pull from
that as they needed it to recycle it back
[SPEAKER_00]: into the glass production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We laughed about what torture it would be
if you were forced to climb up over the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of this mountain and down the other
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would be left of you?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's basically what diatomaceous earth
does to micro and macro arthropods.
[SPEAKER_00]: It basically cuts them up, shreds them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had people the past say, well,
I want to amend my soil with diatomaceous
[SPEAKER_00]: earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, I don't think that's a
great idea.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit is okay, but if you start
using a bunch of it, you are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: restrict the ability for that soil system,
the soil food web to function at its full
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, if a nematode brushes up
against one of those, it's going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: cut open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with some of these micro arthropods
that are beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to lose them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, everything in moderation,
a little bit is okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preferably get live diatoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will be talking about those at length
in the January session and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: wildcraft them and or grow them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that case, you're providing a living
animal into your soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the interesting thing about diatoms
are is they actually produce oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is their off gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put them down in your soil system,
you're feeding oxygen directly to the soil
[SPEAKER_00]: food web that's underground and will
consume that oxygen and release CO2 for
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you're assisting in the gaseous
exchange or gas exchange system that
[SPEAKER_00]: functions perfectly with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another interesting thing about diatoms is
they have a biogenetic bond, not a
[SPEAKER_00]: covalent, not an ionic.
[SPEAKER_00]: A biogenetic bond is easier to be broken
apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therefore, again, now you're mining silica
and other mineral and nutrients a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: easier than perhaps trying to digest a
grain of sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silt holds a negative charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here again, here's the dogma of soil
science.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sand does not hold a charge, but silt
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they defined by particulate size?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another interesting piece of understanding
why it's valuable to have a paramagnetic
[SPEAKER_00]: charge in the soil, think about how you
can attract nutrients and store nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: so that they're not mobile in the soil
profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a negative charge will help
tremendously in holding a cation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So positives and negatives attract,
the same positive and positives repel.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's holding a negative charge,
then it's going to be attracting a cation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get into the specifics of that in
another slide or two.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also another piece of this to think
about is that how do you form aggregates?
[SPEAKER_00]: And aggregates are the key piece to a
healthy soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aggregates are formed generally through
either a positive and negative charge
[SPEAKER_00]: helping to start attracting particulate
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the next level is what happens
with bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: They create a biofilm, which helps to bond
these particulates together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the fungi kingdom, it's
collomuline.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another form of natural glue that
will help bond things together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in understanding the physical
properties of soil and remembering that
[SPEAKER_00]: only 50% of that is physical and the other
50% is water and air, it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: important to have that aggregation so that
water can infiltrate and gas can exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aggregation is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And silt is a big piece of helping to form
aggregates, micro and macro, in your soil
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing to take into consideration
is silt is an organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just happens to be very fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what comes after silt would be humus
and then humates and then humic acids,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are a part of humate process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're, again, providing a very
valuable nutrient in your soil system when
[SPEAKER_00]: you do include silt as part of your soil
recipe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clay is one of my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will bounce back to when I was a kid.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to mine clay on the side of a hill
on a roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'd get this really white,
almost like anyone out there who's painted
[SPEAKER_00]: and used white paint.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put just a tiny drop of purple in
there, you get like a three dimensional
[SPEAKER_00]: white color.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so primary clay is white or this kind
of like interesting color of white,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just flat white.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has some depth to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And primary clay has very little minerals
or nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does have a charge.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's not as valuable as some of
these colored clays.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen blue clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen green clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen red clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen brown clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure you all have, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beauty of clay is that it's both
negatively and positively charged,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I will get into in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, backing up,
clay expands when it gets wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has a water holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also contracts when it dries out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that contraction can cause problems
and compaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you look at the center of the slide,
you'll see how the clay platelets stand up
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: The outside edge is positively charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the flat surface is negatively
charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So imagine if you took the piece to your
left and stacked it up on top of that
[SPEAKER_00]: other clay platelet that's upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you would form what I would call an
eye shape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of the interesting studies I've
been reading on is that that little
[SPEAKER_00]: C-shaped negatively charged or
paramagnetically charged area is
[SPEAKER_00]: attracting, guess what, cations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you stack these up on top of
themselves indefinitely, which is what you
[SPEAKER_00]: will have in a healthy soil system,
think of all of the potential nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: holding capacity clay provides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's not mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to wash away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as those root tips and root hairs hit
those areas, they can actually pull those
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're essentially plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been processed at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, clay helps in building
aggregation, which is the critical piece
[SPEAKER_00]: to that gas exchange, water infiltration,
water holding capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's talk a little bit more about the
clay platelet and CEC.
[SPEAKER_00]: CEC is the measurement of three primary
nutrients, calcium, magnesium,
[SPEAKER_00]: and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know a lot of cannabis growers in
the past were always, oh, Cal Mag,
[SPEAKER_00]: Cal Mag deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it really isn't Cal Mag deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Cal Mag and potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: If these are out of whack, you're not
going to have what would be considered a
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect healthy soil system as far as
these nutrients are concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of tests that you can do,
but this is one that has been,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the most part, overlooked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the saturated pace test.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now there's a hundred parking spots on a
piece of clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in an ideal situation, you have 75
parking spots filled with calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have 18 parking spots filled with
magnesium, and you have seven parking
[SPEAKER_00]: spots filled with potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: That equals a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the saturated pace test is
measuring for you is the understanding of
[SPEAKER_00]: how well your nutrients are balanced
within, or your cations are balanced
[SPEAKER_00]: within your soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So clay provides that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're building a soil system,
then to not include clay in my mind is a
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I understand a lot of people are
scared of clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Heavily clay soils are difficult to grow
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're nowhere near as hard to grow in as
sand is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trust me on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's issues with clay that if
they're compacted or dried out or heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: saturated, then they can erode.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can create anaerobic pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can collapse and compact and not
allow gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not saying use a ton of clay,
but there is a formula that I've come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll talk about it in a little bit
about how to use clay in your soil system
[SPEAKER_00]: without having these kinds of compaction
and water storage issues that can come
[SPEAKER_00]: into play if you have a very heavily
clayed soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the last of the four parts
fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sand, silt, clay, and organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are what make up all soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organic matter, we call it soil organic
matter, SOM, is critical in fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a source of all nutrients because all
plants pull different nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they break down, they make soil
organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you do not have a lot of soil
organic matter in your soil system,
[SPEAKER_00]: then your fertility is somewhat of an
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ironically, I'm bouncing around here a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But traditionally, it's considered to be a
very healthy fertile soil if you have 5%
[SPEAKER_00]: to 8% soil organic matter in your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And personally, I think that's low.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've done a lot of soil
engineering in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did push the limits a little too far
on one particular project.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was experimenting with some
architectural plants that should never
[SPEAKER_00]: have been planted together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was trying to balance it out so that
a swamp maple could be grown right around
[SPEAKER_00]: boxwoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I used a tremendous amount of soil
organic matter to hold that moisture in
[SPEAKER_00]: and lock it in around the roots of the
swamp maple, and then used a lot of sand
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of that to help drain the boxwoods
so that they didn't have root rot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I came up with after the fact,
we went back and looked at the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was very gummy and sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically what that is, is that's the
biology doing their job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it can become an issue in a situation
where if you overwater, you're going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this particular case, that's what
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tree started to suffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we went back in there, analyzed the
irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually removed a tremendous amount of
drip around the base of the tree and only
[SPEAKER_00]: had one small strip so that when the
watering came on, it was not putting as
[SPEAKER_00]: much water into that swamp maple's soil
profile to avoid that anaerobic condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is, again, there's a limit to
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to get into a position
where you have stepped over the boundaries
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going to cause yourself further
problems because you were in excess of
[SPEAKER_00]: something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the right, you can see what actually
soil organic matter is composed of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Carbon, which we all know is a very
important food source for microbes and
[SPEAKER_00]: also oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look at the percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty much carbon and oxygen with a
little bit of hydrogen, a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want you to flip these around and
look at nitrogen or carbon to nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called C to N ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an important other measurement for
maturity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will get into that in another
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also is the foundation of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has carbon and nitrogen to a
ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the middle, you have oxygen
and hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we all know when hydrogen and oxygen
get together, you have water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So essentially, soil organic matter is the
food source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has the carbon to nitrogen as well as
the oxygen to hydrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everything that you need to support
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I want you to start looking at
these constituents, these pieces of the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil system in a different light.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why things function so well when
they're not disturbed or not overused or
[SPEAKER_00]: abused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unfortunately, we have done horrible
damage to the surface of the earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: the living skin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can start to fix that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically, in cannabis growing,
cannabis production, you want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: these pieces in play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to be in just a
soilless medium anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we've all learned that there
are better ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just have to get out of our own way
and start thinking that there are better
[SPEAKER_00]: methods and techniques if we biomimic
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, copy what nature has
already shown us is extremely effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil horizons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I first introduced this about four years
ago at the conference that Daniel was
[SPEAKER_00]: referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I pretty much got laughed off the
stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Candice Gross didn't get this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think now, after four years,
Shango Lowes, I love him, has adopted a
[SPEAKER_00]: podcast on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of opened people's minds up
that, hey, maybe this is a better way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the people that I've worked with and
consulted and or explained this to who
[SPEAKER_00]: have used this technique have had great
success with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's prevented them from overwatering and
underwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taken the curve out of having
hydrophobic soils or anaerobic conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it really is, again, a better method to
growing a plant, especially a heavy eater
[SPEAKER_00]: like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the top of the screen, we have the O
horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that traditionally would be considered
a soilless medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's all just pure organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: The A horizon is the critical one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The A horizon helps to mitigate excess
moisture that is put on the organic matter
[SPEAKER_00]: and lets it drain down throughout the A
horizon where some of it's stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: And any excess is, again, allowed to
escape down into the E horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have the B horizon in here because I
wanted you to understand that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: many other horizons.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for the most part, on the right,
you will see OAE.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the ones that I really want to
focus on today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me explain a little bit more about
how this system works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditionally, in the early 1600s,
1500s, a lot of wealthy kings were
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to do amazing topiary where they
were growing these plants in pots and
[SPEAKER_00]: making incredible shapes and sculptures
out of these living plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the most important parts that
they did was to add a drainage layer at
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good old friend of mine who's since
passed, Wallace Gray, who actually did
[SPEAKER_00]: floral decorations for the Queen of
England.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had pictures of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they were like 12 feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were all wire and fresh flowers
that he would be assembling when the Queen
[SPEAKER_00]: had dignitaries coming into town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he used to talk about how he potted
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he would take his old spent clay pots
that were cracked or chipped, and he'd
[SPEAKER_00]: smash them up and put them in the bottom
of the pot, essentially creating an E
[SPEAKER_00]: horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think so this tech has been around
for a long time, but it has not been
[SPEAKER_00]: brought into mainstream, especially in
plant production here in the US for the
[SPEAKER_00]: most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the E horizon or that smashed up clay
allows an area to store water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I recommend people build an E
horizon, I tell them, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're in an 18 inch pot, you want
about a two to three inch E horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means you want to use rocks the
size two inches, no bigger, and put them
[SPEAKER_00]: into the layer, put them in the bottom of
the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: To between two and a half and three
inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I want you to take a course sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by course, I mean not super course,
but not super fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that white powdery stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That stuff is problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look toward a medium
particulate size.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be gray or amber or yellow or
taupe.
[SPEAKER_00]: That indicates a good mineral content,
like the calcium carbonate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you basically pour the water the sand
in there and water it and pack it down
[SPEAKER_00]: until you're at the right height.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, two and a half to three inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the next layer on top of that is the
A horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you can see on the bottom left,
you see 302A1E.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, your 18 inch deep pot,
you've used up two and a half to three
[SPEAKER_00]: inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your A horizon is going to be about
five inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is going to be a percentage of
50%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sand, 17% clay, 13% silt, 20% organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's still going to be providing you
quite a bit of fluffy soil that the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: can easily penetrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, that blend works
perfectly with wicking excess moisture or
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of moisture up out of the E horizon
and pushing it back up into the O horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have excess water on the O horizon,
the A horizon will wick it back down and
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of any excess into the E horizon
and store it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the critical piece of that sand being
used in the E horizon, it prevents fines
[SPEAKER_00]: from migrating down and creating an
anaerobic pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: If too much organic matter gets down into
that water, what happens is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria start to mine that organic matter
and they're chewing up oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore you're actually getting into
a situation where you're getting a low
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen water or low dissolved oxygen in
your water, which is problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sand actually is what we call a
sand filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if any of you have had fish or like a
pond outside, a water feature,
[SPEAKER_00]: generally you'll have some kind of
filtration system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of time it's what's called a
sand filter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it pulls what we call the turbidity or
suspended particles out of the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving you with a crystal clear water
source for your water feature or your fish
[SPEAKER_00]: tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that sand is a critical component to
preventing that organic matter from
[SPEAKER_00]: getting down in there and causing
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember, as the organic matter breaks
down, it turns into an organic acid,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is good because that acid does get
down into that water system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, suspends or slows down the
biological activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the past, when I was figuring out how
to deliver biology to people in a shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: stable manner, one of the things we did
was play around with what's called a pH
[SPEAKER_00]: suspension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's using very low pH or very high
pH different compounds to get that pH down
[SPEAKER_00]: low enough that you don't have a problem
with the organisms going anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So keeping that in mind, that organic acid
will help support or mitigate excess
[SPEAKER_00]: biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it's allowed to get down into
that soil profile because it's very small
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will help to maintain that
minimal biological life in the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we have the O horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The O horizon is what's considered or
typically you guys call your soilless
[SPEAKER_00]: medium or your super soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have three parts of that organic
matter at the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have explosive root growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have nutrient storing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have gas exchange out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, eventually what's going to happen is
this system will aggregate up and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: now you're on the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in order for you to get a positive
first run, this is kind of the way you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you just plant into potting
soil and we'll get into that in further
[SPEAKER_00]: detail and I'll explain the complications
with just doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So think about soil horizons as you move
forward in your life and you're starting
[SPEAKER_00]: to either add on more beds or you're
taking over facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to set up an indoor grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the things that you should be
thinking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micro and macro aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they are the function of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now know that the inside of a
aggregate is most likely positive or
[SPEAKER_00]: negatively charged and the outside is
opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that charge is gradated from the
outside to the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why is that important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, again, we know that magnets attract
things, those cations and anions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically, again, nutrient
storage capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also, if you look at the pictures,
you can see how there's little pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's air spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's pores for moisture or water to get
down into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I do consulting, a lot of times the
first thing I'll do is an infiltration
[SPEAKER_00]: test to see how well water can infiltrate
into your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it can't infiltrate in, then it washes
soil away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why aggregation is so
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really provides that next level of
function in a soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, soil is only 50% physical.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other 50% is its ability to hold
moisture and have gas exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the critical part that you need
to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, everything starts with a micro
aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, the outside is either
negatively or positively charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Two micro aggregates can come together
magnetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the biology sets up its glues,
whether it's the glomulin from the fungi
[SPEAKER_00]: or the biofilm from the bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now those two micro aggregates are
starting to form into a macro aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a combination of both the
paramagnetic charge as well as the biology
[SPEAKER_00]: that are really creating these aggregates
and then moving them into bigger and
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger components.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I've started using the word rye
or sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think everybody knows what this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone who's walked outside, picked a
weed, and there's this big clump or ball
[SPEAKER_00]: around the root base, well, essentially,
that is a rye or sheath.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can imagine that that's like a
vast city, an entire community of its own
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes and nutrients and minerals and
water storage capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, positive and negative charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to have a rye or sheath around your
cannabis plant is what you're looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the gate, so right as you start.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you continue to use these containers or
raised beds, these aggregates will
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to get bigger and bigger and
bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why I always say to people,
do not remove your root balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just cut your plant off at the surface of
the soil and leave it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see that how quickly that will
break down and turn back into organic
[SPEAKER_00]: matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you rip that root ball out,
you've totally disturbed the soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've wrecked all your aggregation and
you've damaged your biota.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, when you remove that out of there,
you've taken the vast majority of your
[SPEAKER_00]: rhizos, which is where all of your
advanced microbes live and do their work
[SPEAKER_00]: cycling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, always leave your root balls in
the ground and just plant next to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chances are they will disintegrate within
a few months, if not, by the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: next cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how can we form these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Back when I was just finishing up my work
with Elaine down at Rodeo, she introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: me to a gentleman named James Sotillo.
[SPEAKER_00]: James Sotillo worked on large parks and
both federal, state and town where they
[SPEAKER_00]: put in this engineered soil so that it
wouldn't compact, so that people could
[SPEAKER_00]: walk around the monuments or walk down the
paths or the parks and enjoy a nice stroll
[SPEAKER_00]: without either getting sunk in the mud or
without having no plants being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did what was called a 90-10 mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 90% sand, 10% organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the only problem was after a few years
of fertilizing it, so understand that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you use ammonia as a fertilizer,
the microbes will actually have to consume
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon first to metabolize the ammonia and
allow it to be plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're burning carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're burning organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're using nitrogen-based
fertilizers, you are doing something
[SPEAKER_00]: similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the microbes need excess water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water to break down that nitrogen and make
it plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're overwatering or you have to
use a tremendous amount of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And either way, what's happening to your
soil system is you're washing your fines
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're losing organic matter that way,
or they're getting chewed up by the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so after a number of years,
you basically now have few patches of
[SPEAKER_00]: grass, a lot of bare soil and a bunch of
weeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not aesthetically pleasing on
these multi-million dollar parks and
[SPEAKER_00]: tourist attractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his job was to try to figure out how to
get that biology back into play,
[SPEAKER_00]: saprophytic fungi, nematodes, protozoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And his problem was every time he used a
geo-tea brewer and every time he applied
[SPEAKER_00]: his tea, it just washed down the profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'd come back two weeks later,
do a soil test and see that there was none
[SPEAKER_00]: of the organisms that he had put in play
two weeks prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's when he and I started
talking about what I was doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was actually taking compost and
putting it in a washing machine,
[SPEAKER_00]: believe it or not, and stripping the
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the products that came out of that
was a highly concentrated biological humic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was supercharged magnetically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did is we applied this humic
acid pretty heavily.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was diluted maybe five parts water,
one part biological humic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right away, everything started to bond
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the particulate sand specifically was
starting to bond together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a little bit of clay that comes
through the process when I do the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: washing so that we were adding a little
bit of clay and we were adding a
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous amount of bacteria to start
building those micro-aggregates through
[SPEAKER_00]: their glues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two weeks later, he came back and the
top layer of that sand was now brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had started to bond together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now he could apply his GOT brew and the
organisms would stay intact and in play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he'd come back two weeks later.
[SPEAKER_00]: He'd do his biological test and sure as
shit, all of the players that he had
[SPEAKER_00]: installed were present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it took about six months, maybe eight
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that soil profile was down about
four to six inches.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grasses were all coming back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were not using the nitrogen sources
or the ammonia sources anymore,
[SPEAKER_00]: which prevented the killing of these
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lo and behold, the park was holding
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could have their movies and have
crowds of 10,000 people marching across it
[SPEAKER_00]: without any problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is how you form those aggregates
out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the situation as we just talked
about, it's better to actually use soil
[SPEAKER_00]: horizons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they could not rip up all the soil in
these parks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had no choice but to try to figure out
how to make it work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are in a situation where you
have heavy sand and you're trying to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, this would be a good trick for
you to get that aggregation process to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin very quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's not an end all be all because
you're trying to grow this plant at the
[SPEAKER_00]: first go round.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that situation, you'd probably have
to do both a hemic acid installation,
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically active hemic acid now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have to do that first and then a
cover crop to really start to push root
growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole idea is to get those
aggregates formed so that when you did do
[SPEAKER_00]: your first run, you didn't have any
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, CEC, cation exchange capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is another unit of measurement used
in soil testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about it briefly when we're
in the clay particulate, clay particle
[SPEAKER_00]: part of this conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want you to look down cations on the
left hand side of the picture at the
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look, calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Magnesium, potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, so those are those pieces that
are so important in soil fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's balanced correctly,
the only other piece you really have to be
[SPEAKER_00]: concerned about is your micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the right side, we see anions,
sulfur, which is very important,
[SPEAKER_00]: phosphorus, very important, nitrite and
nitrate are very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we do have some issues with fluoride
and chloride.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's really important that
you're making sure that those anion sites
[SPEAKER_00]: are the things you want and not the things
you don't want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same case with cations on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sodium is a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you notice, sodium is only single
charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have other other minerals and
nutrients down the bottom, calcium,
[SPEAKER_00]: magnesium, who are double positive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will actually push salt off of
that clay platelet if you flush it and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you add the appropriate levels of
calcium and magnesium.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you got to be careful not to
get things out of whack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flush it, try to get rid of as much
salt as possible, and then try to put down
[SPEAKER_00]: the best balance based on your saturated
paste test you can in hopes that those
[SPEAKER_00]: will repopulate in the correct amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So interesting understanding is that
higher pH will actually have a higher CEC,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is something that's always
fascinated me because in redox potential,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we will touch on in January,
you're looking for low pH, low EH,
[SPEAKER_00]: and high EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to think that fertility is
regulated in some degree by a higher pH is
[SPEAKER_00]: always complicated or confused me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just wanted to make you aware of
that, that chances are in a higher pH,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you're pushing sevens, you actually are
going to have a higher CEC, higher rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then obviously, the higher CEC,
the less fertilizers you need,
[SPEAKER_00]: the less amendments you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also goes true with how much can
be stored.
[SPEAKER_00]: So remember, we have 100 parking spots,
but if we have hundreds of thousands of
[SPEAKER_00]: those sites to park on, well, of course,
we're going to have a lot more fertility
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the measurement of CEC is important to
take into consideration when you're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil test, along with soil organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is that percentage?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, of course, your saturated paste
test and then your micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a handle on those four key
tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be way better off out of
the gate and also in amending so that your
[SPEAKER_00]: next go round.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we know for sure different cultivars
pull different nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're using the same cultivar over
and over and over again, then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely depleting one of the nutrient
pools.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is why it's so important that
you do soil testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chip's going to bang that home with you
guys later today that without knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going on in your soil, how can you
properly amend?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're either over amending or you're
under amending.
[SPEAKER_00]: And both of those cause issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I know a lot of you guys
complain about the cost of this,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what's the cost of having a failed
crop or a reduced yield in your crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's far greater than the cost of
a couple tests during either right before
[SPEAKER_00]: and then right after.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know how to amend it for the next
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, cations are positively charged,
anions are negatively charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something that you want to keep
in mind when you're again amending your
[SPEAKER_00]: clays or better yet organic matter,
which has both negative and positive
[SPEAKER_00]: charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, those rhizo sheaths, those micro
macro aggregates have both negative and
[SPEAKER_00]: positive charges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore they're holding both groups
of nutrients that you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Compost, I could do a whole week on this
one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try to keep it brief.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thermophilic, so basically thermophilic
compost means you're heating up compost
[SPEAKER_00]: and pretty much what you're left with is
just thermophytes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are the bacteria that consume or
decompose at an incredibly fast rate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That decomposition creates heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's called thermophilic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with thermophilic compost is
as soon as you get over 120 degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're losing mass amounts of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're losing all of your diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're losing your fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're protozoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so therefore if you're heating it up
to the regs, the state regs, which pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: much every state has them, generally
they're telling you that you need to be
[SPEAKER_00]: hit between 150 and 160 degrees 10 times
over 15 days or each state has a different
[SPEAKER_00]: program.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bottom line is they're kind of forcing
you to kill everything in that pile
[SPEAKER_00]: repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you're left with is basically
chemistry compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it still has value.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still has nutrients because that
organic matter is made up of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not plant available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need tremendous amount of biology
to start breaking that down and making it
[SPEAKER_00]: viable for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thermophilic compost has its issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same with green waste and the same
with food waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now green waste's particular issue is that
you tend to get a lot of pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, traditional landscaping,
which frustrates the daylights out of me,
[SPEAKER_00]: is probably one of the biggest polluters
on this planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Between the nitrogen they're using,
the gas powered equipment that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: using, of course, the roundup they're
using and or potentially other
[SPEAKER_00]: insecticides or herbicides.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's just a it's a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you take this stuff and you
compost it, you're not getting rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in many ways kind of concentrating
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I know they tell us that,
hey, you know, the half life of this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: is a lot less than it used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's like it's like making it's
like making a concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all you're doing is concentrating
everything more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do still use a little bit of green
waste compost or thermophilic when I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: making compost, because I want I want
those extra nutrients, but I limit the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount that I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you know, small or less is more
type philosophy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still want the diversity, but I just
don't want all of the problem at problems
[SPEAKER_00]: that come along with these types of
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food waste is really scary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have to really cook the hell
out of this stuff to get rid of all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had the pleasure and I'm sorry to say
I've actually worked with Merck
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmaceutical, the bad guys, the evil
empire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they had a campus back in New Jersey
where they wanted to be more sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: and they were taking their food waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And putting it in this rocket composter,
the rocket is the brand name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were having all kinds of problems
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a gentleman and a gentleman that I
know well had invited me down to really
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of figure out what the problem was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was their feedstocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their ratios were way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not have enough browns compared
to the amount of vegetables.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they didn't use meat in this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just use vegetables and fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the balances were way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were dumping because they were trying
to process too much too quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like 60%, 70% food waste and only
30%, 20% browns or carbon sources to start
[SPEAKER_00]: the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, they heated this thing up and
three days later it spat out this compost
[SPEAKER_00]: that was stinky, nasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just, it was a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to slow them down and let them
understand, well, look, you can't dump all
[SPEAKER_00]: this stuff at once.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either you need another rocket or you need
to slow down the process, which is gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: mean you gotta store this stuff in a
refrigerator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then try to catch up over the
weekends, which they didn't wanna do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They wanted to just dump it in there on
Monday through Friday when everybody was
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they did make some changes and it did
work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, this compost that came out of
that food waste was just horrible,
[SPEAKER_00]: nasty stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got them to start blending that with
the green waste that they produced on
[SPEAKER_00]: site.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, they were trying to have nothing
come on or off the property other than
[SPEAKER_00]: people and food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we were able to blend their green
waste with their food waste and let it
[SPEAKER_00]: compost out for about 60 days and it was
much better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it was not biologically active,
but it wasn't stinky and it was mature
[SPEAKER_00]: enough that it didn't kill plants because
the first stuff that they used from the
[SPEAKER_00]: food waste when they applied it to the
plants, the plants died.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's not a really good way to use
that stuff up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, those top three, they're usable,
but again, limit the amounts of that that
[SPEAKER_00]: you use understanding the problems that
come with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How to make biological compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has been the million dollar question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've showed people how to do this and they
still have problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna try to explain it in an
easier way for you to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically what you're doing is you're
collecting greens and browns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your browns are 66%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your greens are 33%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you thoroughly mix them together in a
manner that they are homogenous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you got to touch it off with
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you need a inoculant of some kind to
get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried some ferments that have worked
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: During Corona, I was locked down out here
in Oxnard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went down and I got some kelp off the
beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I filled a five gallon compact pound
bucket up about three quarters of the way
[SPEAKER_00]: full.
[SPEAKER_00]: Added water, put it out in the sun and let
it ferment for five days.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the end of the fifth day,
I had this big white foam on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't smell nasty, but it definitely
smelled funky, kind of musty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put it under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was stylin'.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had tons and tons of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also had some blue green algae,
which in concentration are bad,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in not concentrated, they're okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: A tremendous amount of green algae and
both the blue green algae and the green
[SPEAKER_00]: algae, if you look at them under a
microscope, they look very similar to
[SPEAKER_00]: flagellates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also had a bunch of different
diverse types of flagellates in there as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've used that to pour it on my
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you have to use a compost
thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get up to 115, you should be
turning it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you hit 120, you're losing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't wait till you hit 120 and then
flip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you get up to 115, flip it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that I mean open up your pile,
mix it thoroughly together, and then pile
[SPEAKER_00]: it back up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a big fan of a trick that Dr.
Lane taught me down at Rodale,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is to take a wire cage, wire stock
about three feet high, fencing material,
[SPEAKER_00]: and make a two-foot diameter or two-foot
radius.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, diameter across.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then use that to hold your materials
upright.
[SPEAKER_00]: I consider it as kind of like a
bioreactor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is in down, about a third
down, is we'll have a sphere of heat that
[SPEAKER_00]: is growing out those organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way you can find that sphere is
using a compost thermometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stab it down to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll see it's still cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stab the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you slide that thermometer down
into the depth, you'll find that sweet
[SPEAKER_00]: spot where the center of that bioreaction
is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I usually do is I waited two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature went up to 115.
[SPEAKER_00]: I flipped it, put it back together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Temperature went back up to about 110.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it started to drop down to about
80 after two weeks, or excuse me,
[SPEAKER_00]: after three and a half, four weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point, what I did was I opened it
back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I microscoped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a wonderful population of organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I took a five-gallon compound bucket
out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I added a five-gallon compound bucket
of greens back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: At this point, you don't need to add
browns unless you're trying to add an
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like an inoculant, like a forest duff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to caution you that if you are
going to go out and collect forest duff or
[SPEAKER_00]: forest inoculant, that you wildcraft
responsibly and spiritually.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go out there, you want to say a
prayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to set your intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to become part of that soil,
part of that whole ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And use your intuition to guide you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing you want to do is collect a
bunch of pathogens and throw that in your
[SPEAKER_00]: compost pile and then introduce that to
your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really have to have good
intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Karma's a bitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go out there with bad attitude and
about stripping and raping, she's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: bite you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to go out there and
harvest inoculant, whatever you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to take, you bring with you an equal
amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in this situation, when I'm going to go
collect inoculant, I always bring a
[SPEAKER_00]: five-gallon compound bucket of good
compost so that when I pull that duff
[SPEAKER_00]: back, I can spread that compost layer in,
kind of like a Band-Aid and Neosporin and
[SPEAKER_00]: a Band-Aid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing in the world you want to do
is leave that soil exposed because what
[SPEAKER_00]: you've done is you've created potential
erosion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've exposed all those organisms
that are right around the outside edges of
[SPEAKER_00]: that to air and sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's problematic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to kill them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really want to be conscious,
thoughtful, good intentions if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to do something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were interested in trying to get
a heavier F to B fungal to bacteria ratio
[SPEAKER_00]: in a bio reactor, that's what you would do
is you would get some more forest
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculant that, again, you knew was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: You saw healthy mushrooms, not parasitic
mushrooms, and you knew you were
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting appropriately.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can add that in there and let
it sit for a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, make sure you're monitoring your
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're getting to 115, flip it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you can just use greens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those greens will, again, start to
provide more nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that bio reactor will heat back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And two weeks later, you come back in,
you can pull more material out and add
[SPEAKER_00]: more material back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like sourdough bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: It never ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that you've inoculated that pile,
you can just keep adding those greens in
[SPEAKER_00]: and pulling material out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would recommend most people to send
their compost off to Soil Food Web,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's Soil Food Web New York or
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better yet, send it to Elaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Elaine has a lab in Oregon as well,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: But get an understanding of what you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the hardest part about making teas
and extracts is that if you don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: biology in there, then you're not going to
get any biology out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's always been the biggest issue
with compost teas and extracts is that
[SPEAKER_00]: people, oh, I make the best compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I make the best compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put it under my microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, no, you don't make the greatest
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make a good chemical compost,
but you're not making a biological
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I take that chemical compost and
I throw it in a brewer, what am I going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dirty water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to get organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a trick on how to make
biological compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I call them bioreactors or compost
bullets because they kind of look like a
[SPEAKER_00]: big bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best way that I found, which takes
time, is to use hugelkultur.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, I'll get an old rotten log.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to lay it down north to south.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of them, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I lay branches.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love tree tips.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do use some fallen branches that are
rotten and showing that mycelium on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I like the live ones as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those get stacked east-west.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically, I made a teepee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the length of it can be as long as you
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: The width of it should only be about eight
feet max.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the height should only be about four
or four and a half feet max.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now I've got this stick running
north-south and all these little branches
[SPEAKER_00]: running east-west.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've got my teepee.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I throw about three inches of hay over
the top of that so that the browns and
[SPEAKER_00]: greens that I'm going to put on top do not
fall down in and fill up that void.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking to maintain that void
underneath there, that tent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that little animals can crawl in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more importantly, as I'll explain,
that helps to create convection,
[SPEAKER_00]: to draw off the heat from the pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hugelkultur specifically is what's
called a static compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do not turn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you inappropriately mix your greens
and browns and that heats up, you're
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty much screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're going to have to pull the whole
thing apart and start over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't want to go there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where it's really important that
you do not add high nitrogen to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you do appropriately mix your greens
and browns because it is not cost
[SPEAKER_00]: effective to tear apart and turn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got my hay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to start mixing my greens
and browns.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to start throwing them on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm going to add a little bit of
thermophilic compost or a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: green compost as I move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm always looking for diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm not going out and just hitting an
oak tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want oak leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want maple leaves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some duff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want hedges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want grass clippings if they are not
been exposed to synthetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as diverse as I possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently did a compost building program
at a farm in Malibu, a Malibu fig farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did was I had these kids going
around picking every different kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: green and brown that they could possibly
collect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a game.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the purpose was again, we're looking
for diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more diversity you have,
the better that compost is going to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're piling up the greens and
browns.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can collect some filamentatious
algae from a creek nearby that you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: again, is not a super fun site or heavy,
heavy agricultural runoff and throw some
[SPEAKER_00]: of that in there or make a ferment and put
that, throw the ferment on top of this
[SPEAKER_00]: pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to be adding moisture while
you're building it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as you finish and you're up to
your eight foot wide, four and a half feet
[SPEAKER_00]: tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you want to throw on a whole bunch of
cover crop seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often would pick little shrubs or little
saplings out of the adjacent forest,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant them in there and then straw the
whole thing in and water it heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you come back six months later,
you're going to have miles of rhizosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have incredible amounts of
protozoa, nematodes, worms, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the reason we piled this on top
of those sticks and branches was so that
[SPEAKER_00]: we had good convection.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as that pile heated up on top of those
sticks, the heat would come out the top
[SPEAKER_00]: and cool air would come in from both sides
or all sides and help to mitigate the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of heat that was being stored in
that pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now those, those are some great
techniques for making biologically rich
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss, everybody that knows me knows
I'm just adamantly against peat moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, it's so detrimental to the
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They basically took thousands of years for
those peat bogs to form.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are an incredible water filtration
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why that peat does not
disintegrate is because again,
[SPEAKER_00]: the pH suspension.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat moss is always down around four or
five.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do not get a lot of biological
activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way thermophytes or a lot of
other decomposers can live there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how it's built, so as built up
over thousands of years is because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: not anything decomposing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peat bogs only cover 3% of the earth and
they provide an incredible amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: clean, fresh water to aquifers,
groundwater, streams, rivers, lakes,
[SPEAKER_00]: creeks around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us to be mining that material,
releasing the CO2 that happens when we rip
[SPEAKER_00]: up the mine, it's a triple negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you're moving this stuff all over
the place and creating a huge carbon
[SPEAKER_00]: footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please stop using peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand that it had its place in the
day, but we have new alternatives,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we're going to get into in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other problem with peat is all you
well know, it goes hydrophobic on the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside and it gets anaerobic on the
inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very difficult to really grow a
plant and hit full potential when there's
[SPEAKER_00]: areas that are anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, when you're pouring water
on top, you can't get the water to go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not help with your watering
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, it drives me nuts when people
say, oh, well, it's a more sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: peat bog.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's nothing sustainable about
mining peat and it's definitely not
[SPEAKER_00]: renewable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So please, again, I'm adamantly against
this stuff and I'm going to show you some
[SPEAKER_00]: other sources that we can work with to
replace peat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cocoa core, it has its issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody that's used it in the past,
generally most of it was coming or 99 plus
[SPEAKER_00]: percent was coming from the Far East.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the coconuts over there are grown
in brackish water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there tended to be a lot of salt
buildup in the core.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also there was hydrocarbons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they produced this stuff over
there in these giant yards where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: running bulldozers and tractors and
equipment over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're compacting it, they're smashing
the fibers together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're leaking gas, hydraulic fluid,
oil all in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're bagging it and pressing
it as hard as they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they use over 10 pounds of
pressure to compact this stuff and bag it
[SPEAKER_00]: so that they can ship it all over the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to increase their profit
margin by pressing as much as they
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly can into that bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Problem with that is they destroy the
fiber.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fiber itself has now been crushed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas peat, they don't press it like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why traditionally peat has been
a solid source of both nutrient storage
[SPEAKER_00]: capacity and water storage capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the past, core has gotten a really
bad name because of the processes in which
[SPEAKER_00]: they manufacture and ship it across the
world to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recently, I found a wonderful source of
Mexican core.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not grown in brackish water.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he only presses it to about two pounds
because he doesn't have to ship it across
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more importantly, he did studies on
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took the time to really look at the
fiber, understand how it structurally
[SPEAKER_00]: worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was inquisitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to know why this product did what
it did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's had amazing results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he dialed back his pressing to about
two pounds or less per square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you don't get as much by volume as
you break it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he hasn't destroyed the integrity of
the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing I really love about core
is that it has a wonderful source of
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it's not a potassium that is mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to worry about it
leaching out really quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's bound up pretty tight in the fiber
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the only way it can be released is with
bacterial decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, the plant wants more potassium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sends more exudates out for the
potassium mining bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bacteria grows out, mines more
material, lets it leak back to the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: either by being consumed by protozoa or by
releasing it in the biosphere or when they
[SPEAKER_00]: start to die off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's a wonderful source of
potassium, holds minerals and nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it breaks down really, really slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It definitely breaks down longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes longer to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then Pete Moss does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pit Moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met Mott Hadley back probably 10 years
ago at the Phipps Conservatory.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Phipps Conservatory is in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Phipps was a buddy and fellow
corporate raider along with Rockefeller
[SPEAKER_00]: and the steel business.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Pittsburgh.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they made tons of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Phipps decided he was going to build a
badass monument to himself and collect
[SPEAKER_00]: plants from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's quite spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the Phipps was doing what I want to
call more organic style classes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: back, teaching people about lawn care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they got some pushback because in the
conservatory side, they were mass
[SPEAKER_00]: producing plants for their displays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every three months, they would go in and
rip out all the existing plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: plant a bunch of new ones based on a
theme, spring, fall, Christmas,
[SPEAKER_00]: New Year's, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in doing that, they had to produce
a ton of plants very quickly so they could
[SPEAKER_00]: flip out the displays.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, they were using some
betticks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that pushback, they called Mott in
to provide a more sustainable plant matrix
[SPEAKER_00]: than Pete Moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they brought me in to provide them
with a high level of biology in hopes that
[SPEAKER_00]: we could have them reduce their synthetic
footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: The experiment ended in what I want to
call, in their mind, a failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: In mine, it was a lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's any such thing as a
failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happened was that the biology
just set up shop on the pit moss and did
[SPEAKER_00]: not have an association with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, in my mind, a wonderful soil
amendment, but not an ideal substrate to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow plants without fertilizer,
kind of like Pete Moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't add something to the Pete,
you're not going to get a wonderful plant
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's no nutrition in Pete.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the lesson we learned was that this
first round formula wasn't ideal for
[SPEAKER_00]: biologicals unless you were using this as
a soil amendment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wanted to give more organic matter
and homes for biology to set up shop,
[SPEAKER_00]: grow out, colonize, and then create those
aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So recently, I was on a podcast this
spring.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got hit up by a girl named Ashley
from Pit Moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always wondered what happened to Mott.
[SPEAKER_00]: He shark tanked, he made a bunch of money,
got a bunch of grants, and then he just
[SPEAKER_00]: disappeared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know what happened to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she's like, yeah, well, things didn't
work out with Mott.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the investor's taken over Pit Moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've hired Dr. Charles Bethke as our
soil chemist and formulation man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got a new CEO, Brian.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm here in charge of marketing and
sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, wow, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: What have you done?
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, we just spent three years
reformulating.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Send me out what you got and let me play
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the first test I did, side by sides,
were water only.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the products was a little bit
better than the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second one was biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I did the biologicals, and again,
what I did was I used this material and I
[SPEAKER_00]: used grass seed, something that would grow
quick that I could see plant reaction
with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the grower's grade was close second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cocoa complete was by far
outperformed the vast majority of their
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly why.
[SPEAKER_00]: My gut feeling is the potassium as well as
the structure of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The core adds to the grower's grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the grower's grade is just pretty
much ground up newspapers and cardboard
[SPEAKER_00]: boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a waste stream that definitely needs to
be utilized way better than it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, this product is sustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is regenerative because you're
eliminating waste material from getting
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it works wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here is a perfect example of a material
that you can use to stop using peat moss
[SPEAKER_00]: and stop the mining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, as soon as you stop buying
it, they're still going to mine it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just going to pile it up to a
point where all of a sudden it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting there and no one's buying it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sooner you stop using this,
the sooner they stop mining it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the nice thing about pit moss is
that it does break down slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it does provide that water storage
capacity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It provides a wonderful source of carbon
for the microbes to set up shop and mine
[SPEAKER_00]: and build those glues to form those macro
and microaggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soilless mediums and hydroponic soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've all kind of learned the
lesson of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: One third peat, one third aeration,
one third compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they work great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to add nutrients to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do have to top dress them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biggest problem with these systems is they
do go hydrophobic and they do go
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't think they're ever going to
form any kind of aggregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other piece, too, is that they
lose volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: As they break down and get in the
biological processes of breaking this down
[SPEAKER_00]: creates a tremendous amount of fines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those fines, as you water,
move through the soil system to the bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: And eventually you end up with a muddy
anaerobic layer at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the bottom of that pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we really need to rethink that
allowing that kind of surface area to go
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when the roots go down there
and they touch it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first they excrete their border
cells as a protection method.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now the root tip is even more
vulnerable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if that didn't work at holding the
anaerobes off, now the anaerobes can have
[SPEAKER_00]: direct access to melt that root tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how are you ever going to hit plant
potential if your roots are not
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning?
[SPEAKER_00]: At the top that they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the goal here is to
really try to figure out ways to give that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant everything it possibly can have to
express itself in its fullest way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, don't all humans want that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't all plants want that?
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to live its fullest life and to
its greatest potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I don't think these soilless medium
and hydroponic soil systems will ever
[SPEAKER_00]: provide that to a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we get into super soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that was a great advance over
the original one third, one third,
[SPEAKER_00]: one third.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yes, that's the base of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now they've added in a bunch of
organic solid nutrients or minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And letting the biology break.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of using a bottled nutrient,
which we all know, yes, you can get
[SPEAKER_00]: organic ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, you're contributing to a giant
carbon footprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're spending a lot of money that you
don't need to spend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do that without using.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow plants without using those
bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a great alternative to two
bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was that they provided the right
level of minerals, you know, oyster meals,
[SPEAKER_00]: crab shell, seaweed extract, you name it,
feather meal for nitrogen, blood meal,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, everything that the plant needed
for its cycle was put into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically you were biology or,
you know, compost, tea, compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: extract and water only.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the biology did the work for breaking
down those raw minerals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always been the biggest beef with
organic nutrient supplies is that people
[SPEAKER_00]: throw it on their lawn and say,
oh, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they add it to their pot and it doesn't
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if they don't have the biology to
break that down and make it plant
[SPEAKER_00]: available, then of course it's not going
to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to sit there in
suspension.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I think super soils really
took it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people understood that they needed,
still needed to get the biology in play,
[SPEAKER_00]: but everything was, was built into the
soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't have to use these liquid
nutrients, which were so expensive and it
[SPEAKER_00]: questionable at best because you never
really know what goes into the bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I'm a big proponent of like
Dragonfly Earth medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they're all about take what's on
your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you need a nutrient,
or a mineral, take it from your farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, if you have farm, if you don't,
if you're in the urban environment or
[SPEAKER_00]: suburban environment, yeah, now you got to
bring stuff in, but you really need to
[SPEAKER_00]: know your source of what you're bringing
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently worked with a gentleman in a
farm in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought in compost that was supposed to
be the best on the planet and blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he spread it on 60 acres or 30 acres
of land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It killed everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very immature compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was something that I didn't get
into above, and I should have,
[SPEAKER_00]: but well, actually we'll get into it in
the CDN ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll talk more about it then,
but I'm not going to spend a ton of time
[SPEAKER_00]: on super soils, but I think they were a
big advance in just traditional,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, soils mediums.
[SPEAKER_00]: CDN ratio, here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So top right corner, bacteria are 5.5
carbon to one nitrogen, fungi are 8.3
[SPEAKER_00]: carbon to fungi to nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here's, here's those ratios.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is why it's really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: So top right, you see organic examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see blood, fish and soy meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now go slide across the chart to the
left.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the ratio is five to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what that means is that the lower CDN
ratios, the more mobile they use the word
[SPEAKER_00]: mineralization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, mineralization is essentially
mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you pour blood meal or fish meal or
soybean meal on your soil, and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: water it, you're moving it through the
soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you overwater, you've washed it
right out of your soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's important to understand
these CDN ratios, because they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide you with short-term and long-term
sources of minerals and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sweet spot in the middle, you see
mineralization, you see immobilization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, obviously immobilization means it's
slow to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the sweet spot in the middle is
equal equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go down to the middle where it says 20
to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to focus on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: That in my mind is a sweet spot,
a little bit more available, but not,
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to be like mobile in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use the term rotten manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's not responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not rotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rotten would mean it stunk or it was
fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's composted manure, aged manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where that gentleman,
friend of mine or client ran into
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the compost that he received was
not mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had, it had a too high of a CDN ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was extremely mobile and it burnt
his plants and roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something that you really need
to keep in mind when you're purchasing
[SPEAKER_00]: compost, make sure that you get the most
accurate test data you can.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally, when I'm going to buy
compost in volume, I go to the place where
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to purchase it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell them to make me a pile of it and,
and don't touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mark it in my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember how much volume was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I personally send it out for a soil
test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what I'm looking for is a CDN
ratio, the maturity level, which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: CDN ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, if it's, if it's, if it's too
high in carbon, it's going to take forever
[SPEAKER_00]: for it to break down, which is a slow
release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's too low in carbon CDN ratio,
then it's immature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to fry things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to heat up and you don't want
any of those to happen around your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So take your time on this slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, right in the middle there is your,
is your composted or aged manure and your
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need something quick and fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you got clover and vetch,
which are a little bit slower to move
[SPEAKER_00]: through the soil system, but they will
give you a bump out of the gate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course, straw is, we all know
the benefits of straw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen tremendous amount of straw used
in the cannabis production industry as a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to prevent soil from drying out and
prevent, prevent ground cover from,
[SPEAKER_00]: from coming up and creeping into or weeds
to causing problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the best part about straw is it breaks
down slow.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, I'm working on a
strawberry project out here, which I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: really excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harry's berries.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are sold actually nationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've tried to come up with a
alternative to plastic mulches.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's 20,000 acres of plastic,
double layered plastic mulch being used
[SPEAKER_00]: right around me here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to be able to take that off the shelf
would be wonderful, but that's why they
[SPEAKER_00]: call them strawberries, because they had
to have the straw underneath the peri
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when the berry grew, it wouldn't touch
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it touched the soil, the bacteria would
start to consume it and the berry was no
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So straw has always been a wonderful
material that is very immobile and does
[SPEAKER_00]: provide long-term fungal foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: As well as some biological foods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definitely keep this CDN ratios in
mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has so many benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to, we're going to try to
define it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So humic acid is still very difficult to
describe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know all of the properties of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we do know is there's three forms of
this organic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is human acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Believe it or not, that's fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have humic acid, which is a
smaller fraction of the molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, we have folic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it goes in that order from large to
small.
[SPEAKER_00]: Human has wonderful properties in building
soil structure, but does not have a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: other benefits other than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very slow to break down, which again
is good when you're trying to build
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it doesn't have a lot of other
properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: That humic and folic do.
[SPEAKER_00]: A thing you need to understand is the vast
majority of humic acids are mined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's basically leadedite or brown coal
that they take out of the ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they use acids and bases to break
that down into a liquid or powder form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a big fan of that process because
what is the residual?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are these industrial acids and bases
they're using?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how much is it coming through in the
product?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The product contaminated with those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love Bioag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Faust has done some amazing work over
the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a matter of fact, he's kind of the guy
that pioneered humic acid here in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd been doing a tremendous amount of
work on this over in Russia for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when he kept running into dead end
after dead end here in America trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: find people that had been working with it,
studying it, he ended up going to Russia
[SPEAKER_00]: and start working with the Russian
scientists to up his game.
[SPEAKER_00]: To understand more about this and how to
go about getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did some amazing work with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what he quickly realized was there are
certain pockets or veins within the
[SPEAKER_00]: leadedite or the brown coal that have
value and others have no value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the problem with humic acid is
you don't know because we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: enough data and research on it,
whether this is going to work or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I love Faust because he's
done the work and he's done the trials and
[SPEAKER_00]: he understands where if he just goes off a
meter in his mining process that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing he's done is he's
introduced biological decomposition or
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentation to release the humic acid and
the folic acids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want to buy something off the
shelf, I highly recommend you use those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there was a huge gold rush,
for lack of better words, when humic acid
[SPEAKER_00]: really started to become popular and
people became aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of big boys jumped in the game and
started ripping up the surface of the
[SPEAKER_00]: earth and pulling out these coals and acid
base and the hell out of them with no
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding as to whether that product
was going to work or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after they've invested all that money
in mining it and producing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't tell me they're not going to sell it
because it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to lie, cheat, and steal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really, again, need to know your
source of this if you're going to purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil building structure, I talked earlier
about my work with James Satilo and how we
[SPEAKER_00]: were able to achieve a wonderful surface
aggregation very quickly with the
[SPEAKER_00]: application of the humic acid that I made.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm making it by stripping compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm stripping it off of the biomass of
a well-made compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a plant-based, fresh humic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is not mined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more regenerative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anybody can do this at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a number of different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen guys use everything from
55-gallon drums, plastic drums,
[SPEAKER_00]: PVC pipe, and they just pack it with
either compost or leaf mold, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically ground-up leaves, or just stuff
around the property, around the yard,
[SPEAKER_00]: mulches, whatever browns they can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soak it in water for a couple of days and
then pour it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or press it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And either of these techniques will
provide you with a homemade source of
[SPEAKER_00]: humic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can get crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can put it in a five-gallon
compound bucket and use a mortar mixer and
[SPEAKER_00]: a cordless drill and just beat it up for a
little while, and you will make this
[SPEAKER_00]: homemade humic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have good compost or if you
have good biology in the materials that
[SPEAKER_00]: you went in there, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You get all those as a bonus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would encourage you to do it yourself
at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're on a large scale,
that might not be possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And therefore, you might need to purchase
some of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would send you to Bioag and Dr. Faust's
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another nice benefit of humic acid is it
releases calcium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know how critical calcium is in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you had a calcium carbonate sand
and you added humic acid, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're releasing the calcium plant
available.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, you don't want to do too much of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not about more is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a moron.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go low and slow and wait for plant
reaction before you continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, you won't get in too much
trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humic acid is also a wonderful
biostimulant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it provides food sources for biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps to strengthen the acids in the
cell walls or the enzymes in the cell as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as the cell wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fulvic acid is better than humic acid,
but we'll talk about that in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the plant can uptake it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has tremendous value.
[SPEAKER_00]: The benefits go on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humic acid is just a wonderful product in
everything from soil structure through
[SPEAKER_00]: plant health through cell health.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that this does is water
bridging.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd mentioned that water molecules are
used as a method to transporting signals
[SPEAKER_00]: across cell walls or not cell walls,
but internally in the cell walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cell and also externally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cellular communication can happen from one
water molecule to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by water bridging, it's kind of like
surfactants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if any of you used a surfactant,
you've noticed that the water does not
[SPEAKER_00]: bead up on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: It actually coats the leaf evenly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what's called water bridging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And humic acid is a wonderful product to
help to facilitate water bridging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a surfactant is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's almost a natural surfactant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then again, the fourth phase of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really think that this is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, keep your open mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't listen to the haters.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definite information here that is
of value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as a species move forward in
life, we'll understand a lot more about
[SPEAKER_00]: the properties of water as science catches
up with our present knowledge or surpasses
our present knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Folic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one has a very, very low molecular
weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is that it's very easily
metabolized into cells, both living human,
[SPEAKER_00]: animal, mammal, and plant cells and
bacterial.
[SPEAKER_00]: What it does is it helps to build the cell
wall strength, which is really important,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a wonderful foliant and more
importantly, it also provides a higher
[SPEAKER_00]: level of enzyme or acid within the enzyme
to break down things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have that little bacteria hanging
out on that grain of sand and it's trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to just pull that silica out, release the
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's going to need some strong acids
or enzymes in its inside of its cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great way to add a tremendous
amount of value and health to your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dilution ratio is usually like one to
a hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is like a natural farming
preparation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not using this in strength.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do use it in strength, you're
wasting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the good news is if you spray it and
some of it drips off your plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not going to hurt anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to actually add benefit to the
soil microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a great soil structure builder
like the humic is, but it's definitely a
[SPEAKER_00]: food source for all the bacteria and all
the biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to understand, you know, what is
fulvic acid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because it has the lowest atomic
weight of any of the other organic acids
[SPEAKER_00]: that we just talked about means that it's
really the very end of decomposition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it came from a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came from organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in some cases, animals and plants are
both organic matter as they break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the very end of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in using common sense to think,
well, if I get this at the very end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle, it's going to be very beneficial to
the beginning of the cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like everything in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a closed loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is understanding that this is
the very end of it means that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: probably got great value for the beginning
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means so as your plants are
growing to apply a little bit of this at
[SPEAKER_00]: the correct dilution is a wonderful way to
really strengthen the plant and give it an
[SPEAKER_00]: extra little bump from, you know,
worrying about pest traction or molds or
[SPEAKER_00]: any of these other things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super healthy plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chances are you're not going to have the
kind of pest pressure or issues that you
[SPEAKER_00]: would if your plant was not as healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Down in the picture, I just wanted you to
see the color of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The color is a little bit off in the
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not orangey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more like amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you looked at a crystal of amber
in the sunlight, you would see that that
[SPEAKER_00]: golden yellow color.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it really looks like if it's
in its purest form.
[SPEAKER_00]: How I get folic acid is basically after
I've washed the compost, I screen it kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like making bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use 47 micron and 120 micron screens to
trap the humus, humates, in particular
[SPEAKER_00]: that I'm looking for that are super
biologically charged or the biology is set
[SPEAKER_00]: up on these little tiny pieces of organic
matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've gotten all the humic acid off
of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through the drying and screening process,
I use a vibrating screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I take that semi-wet solid and I
put it into a press.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I use again a 47 micron stainless
steel screen and wrap it up and then press
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what comes out of there is just pure
folic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant-derived folic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you too can make this product at your
home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, if you're large scale, you don't
have the capacity to do it, then go with
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Faust full plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can't even call it folic acid because
we do not acknowledge that name here in
[SPEAKER_00]: America, believe it or not, in our
arrogance and stupidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yes, you can make this at home.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is going to be a way more
regenerative, way more plant available
[SPEAKER_00]: form than the ones that are mined to acids
and bases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the whole point of this
conversation is how to achieve living
[SPEAKER_00]: soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've talked about soilless versus
horizontal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it possible to achieve living soils in
a soilless mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I said two years ago, I didn't think
it was possible, but I was proven wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend you guys start
following Livity on IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's L-I-V-I-T-Y.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a crew back east in Rhode Island that
is doing some amazing medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production in 100% organic living soil
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started working with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I met them in Portland four years ago,
specifically Jeff and some of his crew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we chopped it up and he was making
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so later that year, he invited me to
get together and have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we started looking at his compost and
started looking at his soil systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was amazed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, wow, this is really
impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he was only missing the fungi piece
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everything else was in play.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had protozoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: He had both the flagellates and amoebas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was another thing that we encouraged
him to get some more of those involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: But his F to B ratio was a little bit low.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had him go out and sample a bunch of
different piles that he'd been making over
[SPEAKER_00]: the years to see if he had any that were
really fungly dominant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I encouraged him to screen that and
start top-dressing that on all his plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you look at the pictures,
the bud porn that's coming off of that IG
[SPEAKER_00]: site, it's impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I've enjoyed the flowers well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's wonderful stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Full of love and hard work, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is possible to achieve a living
soil in a soilless manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medium.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preferably, I still believe that the
horizontal system is going to be easier
[SPEAKER_00]: for people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to have to manage the
moisture as critically because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: forgiveness of the profiles or the
horizons working with you instead of
[SPEAKER_00]: against you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jeff was able to get away from having
hydrophobic situations by making sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: his pot tops were properly cover cropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so he's been able to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's also in a very highly controlled
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he doesn't have to worry about
transvaporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: He doesn't have to worry about humidity or
lack of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his system is going to be less likely
to get into a situation where it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to go hydrophobic on the soil because you
don't have those kinds of swings in
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture level or humidification or
dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the next really big question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is to feed your plant or feed your soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly believe, based on what I've seen
and these foliar nutrients that are
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming available, and again,
we're going to go down that rabbit hole in
[SPEAKER_00]: January as to what's available and what's
working and what's not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen amazing things from foliar
applications of nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that I've played with so far,
I've seen incredible impact in the
[SPEAKER_00]: microbial life as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I lost a dear friend recently,
Michael Hindon, who was working on a
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful formula of amino acid digested
nutrient sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me about how well it worked on
the foliar application of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had to try it in soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I built two compost piles or made one
compost pile.
[SPEAKER_00]: I split it into two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Checked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, it was producing a wonderful
level of biology, diverse biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so at week two, I added his nutrient
pack to one of the bullets and the other
[SPEAKER_00]: one I left alone or just added water as
necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I checked it on week three and four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he had outperformed me or my system in
generating organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Protozoa, nematodes, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So his nutrient solution had benefit to
the biology as well as the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my mind, that's a win-win.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why wouldn't you feed the soil and why
wouldn't you feed the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: And anything that you've fed the plant in
excess will feed the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not saying don't feed the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, please include those crab shell and
those oyster meals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do it in excess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't be a moron.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, test and appropriately amend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that if you maintain that
ideal level of nutritional value in your
[SPEAKER_00]: soil system, whether it's horizontal or
soilless, you are in a better sweet spot
[SPEAKER_00]: than you are if you're either deficient or
you're overabundant in something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know what newtlock looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, test, test, test, and amend
responsibly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to answer the question, yeah,
soilless soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soilless can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've seen it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's proof out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Waters affect at all soils.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're going to get into redox
potential in January and its effects on
[SPEAKER_00]: EH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a low EH means a high level of electron
availability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And water, to some degree, facilitates
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aerometer is a device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the brand name for a tensioner.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm running around installing these things
all over the place with people I work with
[SPEAKER_00]: because I constantly see over and under
water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I personally failed watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought I had it nailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used an aerometer to figure out where
that sweet spot was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized right away I was
overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I used a meter to tell me where I
should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in the soil system that I have,
I used an RT, which is for soil,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 inches deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, the sweet spot is 40 for my
soil type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're high clay, it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, I'm high sand here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in a dune circle off Dune Street in
the middle of Dune surrounded by all
[SPEAKER_00]: sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you have to be smart about it
and understand how to work this piece of
[SPEAKER_00]: instrument.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really low tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't not buy the BlueMat one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The aerometer is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a digital device.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a mechanical device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has less chances of having issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love BlueMat to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that one instrument can be problematic
with the sensors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they're a wonderful company.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're going to spend the money,
please use an aerometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a much safer, less likely to
give false readings, a unit of
[SPEAKER_00]: measurement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I was watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it to the sweet spot for about three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was surfing perfectly through when it go
up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as it goes up, that means it's getting
drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: As it goes down, it means it's getting
wetter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would go up a little, say to 43,
44.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd hit it with four minutes of watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would drop just down below 40.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then throughout the course of the next
day, it would start to rise up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just perfectly surfing back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what happened was one day I got
up, I looked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was 45.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, OK, I got to do five minutes of
watering.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did the five minutes of watering,
shut the water off, went about,
[SPEAKER_00]: got to work, and then came back an hour
later to check it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all the way down to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had way overwatered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what was like, well, how did that
even happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started paying attention and looking
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I noticed underneath the roof line was
wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was all like dripped water kind of
puddled up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We must have had a heavy fog or a mist
event last night that I didn't know about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that water, moisture, or vapor was
trapped in the top 12 inches but had not
[SPEAKER_00]: had a time to get down to the sensor
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I watered it, I just pushed all
that water down to the sensor and
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore it tripped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I had paid attention and looked
around and realized that there must have
[SPEAKER_00]: been a fog event and waited until later in
the day to see where my soil measurement
[SPEAKER_00]: was instead of just doing it first thing
in the morning, I wouldn't have had that
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, watering is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've talked about washing fines down into
the soil profile, washing your nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to get a perfect balance of water in
your soil profile so you have 25% oxygen
[SPEAKER_00]: or air, 25% water to go with your 50%
physical part of the soil is ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that should be your goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aquaponics, I'm just going to touch
briefly on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a really cool way of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a little bit more complicated than
just growing plants and soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big proponent of the aquatic food
web.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Kingdom Aquaponics because I'm trying
to provide all the kingdoms in my products
[SPEAKER_00]: to you, which includes the aquatics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be doing a section in
January on AMOs, which are aquatic
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with some guys back east on a
fish farm, the oldest trout fish farm in
[SPEAKER_00]: America, and the products that are coming
out of there are amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he and I have been working for years
on finding that sweet spot in Keith and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: on how to get the product balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the work that I've been doing over
the years is finding out that in soil
[SPEAKER_00]: restoration, I don't want to just go
straight aerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to work my way up in succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll use a semi anaerobic product out
of the gate, and then I'll push it into a
[SPEAKER_00]: more aerobic product before I go all the
way to completely aerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by doing this, I've been able to
transition dirt into soil really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's biomimicry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm following what nature does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have deep water culture,
DWC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's probably the most complicated one
because what happens is the roots slough
[SPEAKER_00]: off, and eventually they start to build up
an anaerobic layer on the bottom,
[SPEAKER_00]: like a sludge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to offset that, they've used air
stones, a tremendous amount of air stones,
[SPEAKER_00]: to build up the DO.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it still does not get rid of the
anaerobic pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every so often, you have to pull the whole
thing apart, dump all the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: clean all the muck, put it all back
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very labor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So DWC really has not taken off because of
that maintenance issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flood and drains is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like it better than DWC, although I
struggle with bell siphons.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have played with a number of different
designs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried to modify them myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've always struggled with,
they're just finicky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they're working great,
and then sometimes they just stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, it's kind of difficult system to
work with when you have the bell siphon.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dual root zone is a cool system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot less issues because
basically you're just filling it up and
[SPEAKER_00]: draining it down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether you're using a bell siphon or
just a regular manual plunger for a
[SPEAKER_00]: toilet, which I think is probably easier
than the bell siphon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beauty of dual root zone is it
gives you the ability to add nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're putting it in correctly,
it will not ever get into the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant will use it up, or the soil is
medium, will hold and store those
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in play for the plant to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are going to go with aquaponic,
I personally prefer the dual root zone as
[SPEAKER_00]: a way to give you the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in conclusion, I really want to stress
that this is a journey.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a race.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really want to choose what's
comfortable, what you feel it's in your
[SPEAKER_00]: wheelhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not saying don't get a little
aggressive in going for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you want to make sure that you
understand the ramifications of the
[SPEAKER_00]: decisions you're making.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make sure that those are responsible
decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I see too much people jump
in and then they get in trouble,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they start bad mouthing these
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: These systems work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yesterday I tagged a bunch of farms up
in the Humboldt area.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been doing this stuff for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what they're producing is amazing
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they didn't just jump into this.
[SPEAKER_00]: They slowly moved into this as they were
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then again, make small steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Experiment, experiment, experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that is the best way to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are small steps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're learning to work with horizontal
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're learning to work with pit moss.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're learning to work with some of these
other tools like the aerometer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lastly, and probably most important is
do your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't just take anyone's word.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole reason we started these
conferences in the first place was because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the bro science flying around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I see too many people listen to,
oh, I know how to fix this and do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Say, OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for the advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then go do your research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And chances are you'll find that someone
else tried it and it didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're just preventing yourself from
making a large mistake.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more educated you are, the more
good solid decisions that you can make as
[SPEAKER_00]: you move into these other types of soil
and or regenerative organic practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a way to get in touch with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got email, Facebook, as well as
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that concludes my presentation for
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Daniel, would you like to hop on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, thanks, Layton.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You blew my mind a couple of times there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm sure you did the same thing for
some other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So before we get into Q&A here,
I just wanted to take a minute to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about our sponsor for this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: So and I want to first start by saying
that we were actually we were very
[SPEAKER_01]: particular about what companies we allowed
to sponsor this event.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really wanted companies that aligned
with the education that we're doing here
[SPEAKER_01]: that have really good products that are
oriented towards growing with living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we vetted all these sponsors pretty
carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: So PITMOS is actually our title sponsor
for the event.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, just to emphasize the part of
the reason they're title sponsors,
[SPEAKER_01]: because we really think that they've got a
great product.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why Layton talks about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not because they're the sponsor,
but it's because he's actually vetted
[SPEAKER_01]: their product and he believes it's really
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then our sponsor for this session in
particular is Green Grow MI, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: big store, online store based out of
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_01]: They sell a whole lot of great products
for living soil growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check them out and check out PITMOS.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are sponsors for the whole event and
for this session.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are other paper mulch products
out there and I have tried them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they don't have the quality that these
guys did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remember, Charles Bathke spent three years
reformulating this to make it good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the great grow guys up in
Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love them to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, we didn't get to see you guys live,
but maybe in the future we can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: start to get together again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's get into the Q&A here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a lot of questions and
hopefully we'll get to most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're going to start with the ones
that got the most votes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Greg is asking when building the soil
horizons in an 18 inch deep pot,
[SPEAKER_01]: do you allow the water to drain out or
allow it to pool in the E horizon?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do is I actually use a container
water holder.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a pot with a little plate underneath
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go to your local garden supply
place, you'll see regular clay pots and
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can also get the little saucers
that go underneath it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I do is I get a saucer that's the
same height as my E horizon and I put the
[SPEAKER_00]: pot in there so that when I water it,
I can actually see what the water level is
[SPEAKER_00]: in my E horizon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also helps me understand is the E
dry or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just a matter of using traditional
potting methods and it can be a plastic
[SPEAKER_00]: tub, whatever size you're growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're growing in a 200 gallon pot,
then you can just use a rubber liner
[SPEAKER_00]: around the outside and a couple of two by
fours to hold the rubber liner up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as that water gets down into the E
horizon, it leaks out and you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: see the level of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another way you can do is you can actually
slide a pipe down inside the pot with a
[SPEAKER_00]: little hole at the bottom so that the
moisture can go in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can just use a stick to dip
it down, kind of like you see them
[SPEAKER_00]: stabbing gas tanks at filling stations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's another way to measure if you even
have moisture in there or what the level
[SPEAKER_00]: of moisture is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you don't want to ever have a
situation where you've watered so much
[SPEAKER_00]: that your A horizon is now sitting in
excess water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's important to monitor
that somehow, whether it's out externally
[SPEAKER_00]: or internally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that's a perfect segue into the
next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone was just asking, can you use
fabric pots like grassroots for the
[SPEAKER_01]: horizon method?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I forget which pot it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shango has showcased it lately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the grassroots pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has a vapor barrier on the inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was always my biggest issue with
the traditional fabric pots, like the
[SPEAKER_00]: smart pots, is there's no vapor barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what happens is you're allowing that
moisture to wick out the sides and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: allowing the oxygen to dry out the sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where those hydrophobic
situations come in and you pour water on
[SPEAKER_00]: the top of the pot and it just runs right
down the sides of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not getting any penetration
whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And perhaps I should address what
hydrophobic actually is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where you have a high level of
bacterial concentration and, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: their biofilm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they go into a cyst form,
they create a wax coating around the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of their shell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what repels the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a highly biological system
and it's dried out, those bacteria have
[SPEAKER_00]: gone into cyst form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that water can't penetrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the grass pots or whichever
company it is that has the liner on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: big, big fan of it because it's going to
prevent that from happening to the side of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what the ideal fungal to
bacterial ratio is for growing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of work being done on this
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Elaine, I think I'm hoping she's going
to touch on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's been doing some work in Brazil.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But bottom line is you have to understand
successionally where the cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_00]: falls in plant succession.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, you have what we want to call the
sativa indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they did exist at one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've crossbred them so many times.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one was grown up in the mountains,
a very dry, arid climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably less F2B there than the ones
that were grown down in the jungles or in
[SPEAKER_00]: the higher, more advanced complex
ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would tend to think would be on the
higher F2B ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do believe that it would be higher
than a one to one.
[SPEAKER_00]: One to one is typical like vegetables,
house plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be about one bacteria to one
fungi, whereas the cannabis plant is later
[SPEAKER_00]: in succession and therefore should have a
higher level of F2B.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully, Elaine, we'll get into that
a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I just want to make a quick note
because people are still asking about this
[SPEAKER_01]: issue with the pop up asking you to
continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe we fixed that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may need to just refresh your browser.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that should be gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, that won't be a problem for
the sessions going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: What, the pop up that happened to me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it the pop up that kept happening to
me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, it might be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's just getting a pop up asking
them to click to continue the session.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I had that happen to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you see it on my screen?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think I figured out how to turn that
off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it shouldn't be a problem going
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So next question is, how would you mix
clay into your soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to answer this for both silt and
clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Silt is usually going to be harvested out
in a wet form.
[SPEAKER_00]: And clay is often pretty wet and saturated
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both of these, I would air dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if it was indoor, I would spread them
out on a tarp with a dehumidifier and dry
[SPEAKER_00]: them until they are fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot homogeneously mix them when
they're wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get clumpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So both your silt and your clay should be
as dry as you possibly can get them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing is a trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're doing this at home, get a cement
mixer, not a mortar mixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A mortar mixer will not do the right job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the difference is a cement mixer is
going to be in a cone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a mortar mixer is going to be more in
like a bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So get a cement mixer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Use a one gallon bucket, whatever,
to do your ratios correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Throw it all in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then turn your cement mixer on,
because it's going to homogeneously mix
[SPEAKER_00]: this together thoroughly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do it with your hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's too hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the goal is to have that as well
blended as possible so that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning at peak performance right out
of the gate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then another question along this train.
[SPEAKER_01]: When building a fresh batch of soil
according to your Horizon method,
[SPEAKER_01]: what total volume would you recommend per
four foot by four foot growing bed?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I imagine that means total volume of
each component, perhaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say go back to that ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: 3-0, 2-A, 1-E.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will give you the height version.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as the actual square footage,
that's something you're going to have to
[SPEAKER_00]: do some calculating on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not that complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that the depths are way more
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than the overall square footage you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just want to note to everybody,
you have access to watch the replay of
[SPEAKER_01]: this for 30 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you miss something, if you want to
see that graphic again, you will be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to go back and replay it and reference
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And another thing, too, is shaping fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a wonderful presentation with Shango
a year or so ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a 10 minute video clip on his
YouTube channel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shaping Fire site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we did the podcast, which was
like an hour and a half where we really
[SPEAKER_00]: chopped it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you want a refresher,
that's a great place or a great resource
[SPEAKER_00]: to go back and check out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another question just about
basically what are the ideal pots to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: in?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I think you kind of answered that
already, Leighton.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't know if you want to say
anything else about pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I like raised beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: More than I like pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just think that you have more spaces for
diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a big fan of polyculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Joshua Steensland, so excited to have him
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I check out his IG page of his indoor
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a jungle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, his approach to cover
cropping was like, I threw a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff in there and saw what worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that is the correct approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'm a big proponent of carrots and
potatoes for a root crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm a big fan of these big leafy
greens to help create a microclimate on
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface of the pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you really can't do that kind of
diversity in a regular pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my mind, the bigger the pot,
the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, get a get a 200 gallon pot and
put a plant in each quarter.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, you're going to get a little bit
more surface area to get you diversify
[SPEAKER_00]: your your green mulch or your cover crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, I mean, again, if you're going
to go with a fabric pot, make sure that it
[SPEAKER_00]: has that vapor barrier so that you do not
lose your moisture out the sides and or
[SPEAKER_00]: your you don't have correct gas exchange,
because remember, the horizons are
[SPEAKER_00]: designed like soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil isn't ever put in a pot in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's flat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there is not no sides to the soil that
is getting exposed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, again, that's why, you know,
I like bigger sections like these raised
[SPEAKER_00]: beds than I do the little pots,
because you're preventing that both
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature swing, gas exchange,
hydrophobic potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're going to go with a fabric
pot, make sure it has the vapor barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope I answered your question,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you amend the soil with diatoms or do
you water them in?
[SPEAKER_01]: And doesn't this kill off good micro life?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you have to water them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diatoms are a really cool creature.
[SPEAKER_00]: I highly recommend you you go online,
go to Google and go to imagery.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're like snowflakes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're they're just so many different
types.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ones that I harvest from back east are
more tubular.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've found we found them actually in in
the water column.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I started having Keith collect me
the solids off of his rotary drum screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put those in a stainless steel tank
with no light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did have him add oxygen or an air
stone.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, there's no light in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I went back to harvest it,
you know, like a few weeks later,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was amazed at the fact that they they
were they were breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were splitting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were dividing in a tank with no
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's when I really kind of made me
start thinking about what is their energy
[SPEAKER_00]: source?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're obviously not living off of the
sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're living off something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know they're producing oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're they're a really interesting
creature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're going to deep dive into that in
January, mid-January.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by then, we'll have all the kinks run
out of the product production system back
[SPEAKER_00]: east.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these will be available on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those those you'll be actually be able
to have an AMO aquatic microorganisms that
[SPEAKER_00]: are complete diatoms, nitrifying bacteria,
phosphate solubilizing bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these are what's called in vivo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're grown in nature, not in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with growing in a lab is
you're you have basically spoiled
[SPEAKER_00]: children.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had the perfect environment,
perfect foods, no, no competition,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, no hassle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you take them and throw them into
an existing hostile system where
[SPEAKER_00]: everything had to learn to live in this
hostile environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's their biostimulant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to last long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why it's really important that
when you start talking about using
[SPEAKER_00]: microorganisms like Chris Trump,
natural farming, IMO, it's all about IMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the same thing is true that I'm
working with AMO that's being harvested in
[SPEAKER_00]: vivo in nature so that they are going to
function and survive in your soil system.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it possible to plus or minus charge
different soil layers to hold nutrients?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's the that's the those are the
micro and macro aggregates.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the beauty of these aggregation
processes are that and we really don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know which one is which, whether the
center is negatively charged and the
[SPEAKER_00]: outside is positively charged.
[SPEAKER_00]: My gut feeling is that that's going to be
based on what's in that macro aggregate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what is the content of clay?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's high silt, then chances are
it's going to be more negatively charged,
[SPEAKER_00]: where if it's high organic matter,
it's going to be both positive and
[SPEAKER_00]: negative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's that's a that's a complex
question that I can't specifically answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I can tell you is if you have
aggregation, you have great gas exchange,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have great water infiltration,
you have great nutrient storing capacity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you have a beautiful system that the
roots can thrive in and push in all
[SPEAKER_00]: directions and do mine mine those those
goodies right out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aggregation is the key to everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're composting in the Midwest or the
Northeast, do you have any recommendations
[SPEAKER_01]: for getting through the winters when
temperatures are below zero?
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I would be going with a hugel
culture system there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I used to do when I was in
Connecticut was I would build one in
[SPEAKER_00]: spring and one in fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason I build the one in spring is
because I didn't want to have to worry
[SPEAKER_00]: about moisture in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by building it in spring,
by the time summer came, the whole top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pile was green.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was grown in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was protected by its own
microclimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those leaves protect the sun from
drying it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The miles of roots that were great were
growing off of those cover crops or the
[SPEAKER_00]: little shrubs and trees I planted on it
provided that extra aggregation to store
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't have to worry about it drying
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the opposite is true in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I build it in the fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it going.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get it cover cropped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Snow comes in, insulates the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then come spring, the snow melts off.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the plants pop back up and take over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So build in spring and fall and obviously
don't try to build it in the winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you build in the summer,
you're going to have drying out issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to be able to get that
plants, the cover crops that are so
[SPEAKER_00]: critical to establish themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're using wood chips or straw,
et cetera, as a mulch, do you move the
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch to expose bare soil surface when top
dressing or just top dress on top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: mulch?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would tend to pull the mulch back
depending on what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of guys will use a heavy chip to
keep the fungus gnats down, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: great trick.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you were using chips as a method to
prevent inappropriate dehydration of the
[SPEAKER_00]: surface of the soil or to mitigate a
fungus gnat, then I would just gently push
[SPEAKER_00]: it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if it's just a thin layer of hay,
I would just top dress it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just top dress over it because
that hay, as I said, was a great long-term
[SPEAKER_00]: storage for nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so again, the hay is going to soak up
the top dress if it's liquid.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's a solid, it's not going to prevent
it from getting down there unless it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: super heavy hay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that case, if you got like an inch
or two of hay, then yeah, just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: scratch back the surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hay on the bottom that's coming in
contact with soil, don't disturb that
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're already going to have
fungal networks going into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have all kinds of protozoa
mining it or bacteria mining it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and of course the protozoa living off the
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't ever want to really disturb
your soil if at all possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I would just carefully peel it
back if it's really deep, top dress it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then cover it back up again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, that's a great answer, Layton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, I couldn't help it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I live in a desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I do to have better finished
product growing in desert sand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, I was just down in New Mexico,
boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so you got like 4% humidity in
the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a high altitude, so your UVs are
super hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before the great humidity, it was like a
human expansion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The prairie grass down there was like
eight feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's pictures of the guys
riding a horse because they had to ride a
[SPEAKER_00]: horse.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't walk through this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't see where you were going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so back then, the soil was amazingly
fertile, and those roots were down 20
[SPEAKER_00]: feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then we chopped all the prairie grass
down and started growing crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that caused desertification.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you're in a situation where,
yeah, you've lost all your organic matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've lost your clays.
[SPEAKER_00]: All that's blown away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I was talking about, soils are formed
through transpiration, transportation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you've got to transport that stuff
back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bottom line is you're going to do the
same thing that I did here in Oxnard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I basically had a sandbox, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all it was, was sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I did was I harvested or
wildcrafted some local chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a safe place that I knew was not
going to have a bunch of toxins or
[SPEAKER_00]: hydrocarbons in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the first thing I did was I busted
up the clay or the sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I loosened it up because it was kind of
like crusty on the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I rototilled in a whole bunch of
chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I put three or four inches on top of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rototilled those in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I broadforked them in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So because you want to try to work them
really down into, you know, 12,
[SPEAKER_00]: 18 inches down into that soil profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I came back with a yard of
compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I added another couple inches of
top dress.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, I rototilled it in first and
then broadforked it in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I watered it with a nice compost
tea, which in my case was more of a humic
[SPEAKER_00]: acid extract with biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let it set up or spray that in,
watered in a little bit, covercropped it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And bam, I had wonderful soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you're in a desert, so you're probably
going to have a different humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be a little bit harder
for you to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the way you're going to
establish your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you get something rooting in
there, do never let it get bare,
[SPEAKER_00]: dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just whatever you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to have those cover crops and
you're going to have to cover crop
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically to your area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, what those cover crops are
doing is they're shielding that soil
[SPEAKER_00]: surface from UVs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're shielding it from evaporation and
they're creating a microclimate right on
[SPEAKER_00]: the surface of that soil so that you can
get that biology to take and the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: will get down into the deeper parts of the
sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll start to be able to mine that
little water vapor that's down in there
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the key to taking a desert back
is just whatever you do, never let it get
[SPEAKER_00]: bare again.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a question that just says
masonry sand, question mark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, masonry sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Masonry sand tends to be a little bit more
not as, not as coarse as I want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like masonry sand more often than not,
depending on which supply you're working
[SPEAKER_00]: with will be close to what I'm talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally like to get sand wildcrafted
because you're going to get a bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: biology with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the biology that mines sand is a very
specific type of bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas if you're buying the sand from a
yard, that's been washed and processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've lost all the life that's on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're trying to establish a soil
system now, again, if this is scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if this is small scale, no,
then I would recommend that you harvest
[SPEAKER_00]: the sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ideally, if you're near an ocean where a
river meets the ocean is a great place
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're going to get all kinds of
diverse biology and you'll get some
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium carbonate sand as well as some
silica sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't, then go to your river or
your stream or your lake and find a
[SPEAKER_00]: natural sand pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, you're looking for taupe,
yellow, slightly orange, those kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: colors will indicate good mineral content
and stay away from the white sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you're trying to do a big
commercial grow, dude, get me involved
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's so much bad shit that can
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I've been working for years with
different blending companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the ins and outs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I speak their language.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how to find the sources that I'm
looking for and then have them brought
[SPEAKER_00]: into the blender and then have it blended
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you just walk in and say,
oh, I'm doing a cannabis grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need this.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, they're going to rape you
and charge you three times as much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And second of all, you're not going to get
the ingredients that I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: recommend to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another question about sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sand made from wind is more rounded than
water form sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this make a difference when creating
a soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would say like, have you ever
been on a really windy day down at the
[SPEAKER_00]: beach?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you would see the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would see that white, fluffy stuff
that's really soft that I was warning you
[SPEAKER_00]: to stay away from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you'd see pockets of this coarser
stuff that's got that yellowy,
[SPEAKER_00]: tanny color to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, you're going to find these
sources of sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to pay attention to nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as the actual shape of the
sand, it's less important than whether
[SPEAKER_00]: it's soft and fluffy or whether it's
coarse and a little bit more jagged.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I would tend to think that with
wind, you're going to be knocking the
[SPEAKER_00]: corners off and rounding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, with a softer sand,
now you're getting this tiny little sphere
[SPEAKER_00]: that's going to plug up those pores,
which we're trying to avoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're really looking for that coarse
sand that isn't as mobile in the wind that
[SPEAKER_00]: the light, fluffy stuff is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_01]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question was, can you put,
somebody had asked, can you put a
[SPEAKER_01]: millimeter size on that sand particle
size?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think what you're saying is a micro
mesh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Micro mesh, micron scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are unit of measurement that soil
scientists use to define particulate size.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say that you're looking at
somewhere around 200 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somewhere between 150 and 250 micron
would probably be appropriate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you Google mesh, micro mesh to
micron scale, that would give you that
[SPEAKER_00]: calculation back to what you will purchase
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't need to go to the store to
find it, because you're going to find it.
So it's really important to be able to
find the right size and how you're going
to get those right.
So that's what you're looking at.
But it's really important to be able to
find the right size and how you're going
to get those right for your screens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But best way to do it is to learn about
sands is go to a masonry yard and go feel
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just pick them up and run them between
your fingers, and you'll tend to see where
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to go with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want a super coarse sand,
but I don't want a super fine sand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somewhere in the middle and again look for
those colors those colors will indicate
[SPEAKER_01]: they will steer you in the right direction
All right, and I'm just trying to just
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to hit off all the stand questions
here Someone asked should I wild craft my
[SPEAKER_01]: sand from the beach if I can?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again where I would go is where the rivers
meet the ocean because you're gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: both the the transported sand the silica
sand as well as the calcium carbonate sand
[SPEAKER_00]: and again, I'm all about You know
diversity the more diverse you can get the
[SPEAKER_00]: better you are And the other side of that
coin is that that sand is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: biologically active You're already gonna
have the specific bacteria Colonized on
[SPEAKER_00]: that sand that is mining and how better to
get you know that kind of benefit into
[SPEAKER_00]: your soil system is already having Having
the specific type of bacteria that can
[SPEAKER_01]: mine it present on it All right How many
how many milliliters of humic and fulvic
[SPEAKER_01]: acid per liter?
[SPEAKER_01]: Per gallon should I use for soil
applications?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a different difficult question
because it really depends on what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to accomplish if you're sand and
You're trying to get that that layer to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen You're gonna use a lot more heavily
concentrated version again.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was using Five four four to five to one
water to humic acid, but my humic acid you
[SPEAKER_00]: got on a I understand is is like Super
dark chocolate milk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's it's not like what you're
gonna get when you purchase it and and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna purchase something again go
with bioag and then I would read the label
[SPEAKER_00]: as to what makes sense if you're just
doing a a general drench you don't need a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of it and Specifically with with
fulvic acid the dilution ratio is crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one one to a hundred Anything more
than that you're wasting you're wasting
[SPEAKER_00]: material or you're just Donating it to the
soil system.
[SPEAKER_00]: But remember the fulvic acid Molecule is
so small that it will wash right down
[SPEAKER_00]: through the soil profile It's not
biologically active.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not gonna stick So again with the
humic acid I would read the label of on
[SPEAKER_00]: bioag's products as to what it is and and
again It's like you're gonna use one
[SPEAKER_00]: dilution for soil and one dilution for a
foliar So again, it would be read the
[SPEAKER_00]: directions but if you're trying to you're
trying to fix sand or turn sand Into soil
[SPEAKER_00]: very concentrated and again, I would just
experiment I would try, you know a little
[SPEAKER_00]: patch and see what happened Big proponent
of trying side-by-sides and trialing and
[SPEAKER_00]: experimenting that really helps you get
through the humps quickly All right,
[SPEAKER_01]: so we're gonna wrap up shortly here so we
can get to the next session so just last
[SPEAKER_01]: couple questions Someone asked are there
pre-made super soils comparable to what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're talking about today for the backyard
grower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, there are a number of super soil
companies out there soil scapes solutions
[SPEAKER_00]: Build a soil in Colorado soil scapes is
out here on the West Coast And I would I
[SPEAKER_00]: would go with someone very experienced I
would not go with the mom and pop that
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't had a tremendous time amount of
time to learn their lessons and by that I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean Not make mistakes but learn your
lessons one of the biggest problems with
[SPEAKER_00]: someone who doesn't have a lot of
experience In blending these things
[SPEAKER_00]: chances of them blending them
inappropriately would be a lot So just be
[SPEAKER_00]: again know your vendor know your supplier
ask for references talk to those
[SPEAKER_00]: references How did the soil work?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it perform?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it did it leach out a bunch of fines
out the bottom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did my plants ever hit any kind of
deficiency or did I ever get into nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: lock using it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So just do your homework on that All
right, and then we had a few questions at
[SPEAKER_01]: least about using pumice Is pumice an
appropriate choice for an alluvial layer
[SPEAKER_01]: or just what would you use pumice for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would use pumice for an aeration So
similar to rice holes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's got some water storing storage
capacity It has some irregular shapes so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can create pockets for the
biology to set up home or set up
[SPEAKER_00]: condominiums So in that regard,
I'd use it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would not use it in my e horizon what
you really want for an e horizon is
[SPEAKER_00]: Diversity, so you're looking for all
different color rocks and you don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: round rocks because the round rocks are
difficult for the bacteria to set up their
[SPEAKER_00]: biofilm and They're basically polished
smooth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it takes a long time for that biology
to actually build a niche to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: itself So what I recommend people do is
you go to the river you find all these
[SPEAKER_00]: round rocks that are all different colors
and smash them up get good in stone and
[SPEAKER_00]: beat the hell out of them with a
sledgehammer and make as many jagged
[SPEAKER_00]: corners as you can because the more jagged
they are the more surface area that the
[SPEAKER_00]: biology has a chance to set up on and mine
and again the different colors Represent
[SPEAKER_01]: different minerals in in the stone itself
All right, and just lastly Somebody had
[SPEAKER_01]: asked about the Johnson-sue bioreactor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you familiar with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Man, you know, it's so funny is I use
the term bioreactor for years and I never
[SPEAKER_00]: heard anybody question it right and then
List literally like three times four times
[SPEAKER_00]: in the last few months I've said that and
they're like, oh Johnson-sue and I'm like
[SPEAKER_00]: who knows Johnson-sue So I finally did the
homework to figure out who this was and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a couple that had put together a
Composting method that they let sit for a
[SPEAKER_00]: year and that was what they called the
Johnson-sue bioreactor This is different
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's it's basically like use your head
like think about it as like this little,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know nuclear reactor So what's
happening in that sphere about a third of
[SPEAKER_00]: the way down in the in this pile is where
all the magic is happening So,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I didn't mean to steal their
term But I just use it because in my mind
[SPEAKER_00]: it made sense that that that sphere was
was a reactor of some kind That's where
[SPEAKER_00]: all that magic was happening So I'm now
familiar with that who they are but not
[SPEAKER_00]: comparing them or it's not the exact same
system Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've Got to wrap it up now and get
over to Elaine's presentation starting in
[SPEAKER_01]: about five minutes So thanks everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you Layton.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was awesome Looking forward to the
next one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're really gonna go deep guys really
deep All right
