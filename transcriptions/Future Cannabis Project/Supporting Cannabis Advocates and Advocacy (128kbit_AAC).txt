[SPEAKER_06]: There seems to be a disconnect in this
industry We have we seem to have a weird
[SPEAKER_06]: line that's going down the middle of this
industry We seem to have people that are
[SPEAKER_06]: fighting the fight Working on the regs
working on the policy working on the
[SPEAKER_06]: ordinances spending time with states
County City officials trying to make sure
[SPEAKER_06]: that we all have fair equitable and
inclusive cannabis policy going forward
[SPEAKER_06]: because let's remember This is the first
and only time California will do this the
[SPEAKER_06]: first time so it's really up to us To make
sure that we get it right as right as we
[SPEAKER_06]: possibly can given the limitations and
circumstances that may happen In you know
[SPEAKER_06]: with everything going on what I wanted to
try to do tonight is sort of shine a light
[SPEAKER_06]: on the Advocates and the nonprofits
because here's the deal Those are the
[SPEAKER_06]: people who are making all this happen
those are the people who are working hard
[SPEAKER_06]: with all of the government to make sure
that there is a solid Foundation for
[SPEAKER_06]: businesses to sit on top of and actually
make money We the other side of the coin
[SPEAKER_06]: is those people who are in it for the
money only or they're in it for their own
[SPEAKER_06]: self-interests And they're not
contributing back so we have a problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we need to talk about It it really
hasn't been talked about that much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really just want to commend everybody
in this room for showing up tonight We
[SPEAKER_06]: have so many amazing people and
organizations that are out there every
[SPEAKER_06]: single day Making sure that there's good
policy when you're talking to your friends
[SPEAKER_06]: and you're talking to other businesses
cannabis businesses Encourage them after
[SPEAKER_06]: tonight after you listen to what's
happening encourage them to get out there
[SPEAKER_06]: and support Encourage them to get out
there and volunteer encourage them to
[SPEAKER_06]: gather and go speak to a city council
encourage them to get Out there and put
[SPEAKER_06]: money in if they have money in to support
some of these funded these foundations I
[SPEAKER_06]: mean MPP is here in the house tonight
marijuana policy project drug policy
[SPEAKER_06]: alliances here tonight I know that these
organizations who are really doing some of
[SPEAKER_06]: the heavy lifting they're struggling for
financing They're struggling for funding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: These are the people who helped carry the
the baton over the line and get us to
[SPEAKER_06]: legalization And yet we can't seem to get
them funded so and it's not just them
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of people who work in this
industry every day who get No dollars zero
[SPEAKER_06]: dollars, but they're still going and doing
it because they believe that it's the
[SPEAKER_06]: right thing to do So that's what we're
gonna talk about tonight, so I want to
[SPEAKER_06]: start with a couple of quotes From some
people that are not here tonight and also
[SPEAKER_06]: one that I'm gonna read to you right now
So there's this amazing woman her name is
[SPEAKER_06]: Susan Burton some of you may or may not
know her Okay got becoming miss Burton.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know some people in the room know who
this is So Susan has this amazing book she
[SPEAKER_06]: did She does a reentry for women that have
been incarcerated and are trying to go
[SPEAKER_06]: back into their real lives She has a quote
in this book that I want to read So so
[SPEAKER_06]: she's actually quoting somebody else
telling her this story long time ago,
[SPEAKER_06]: and here's the quote She said they said
there was this book.
[SPEAKER_06]: I read as a child.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was called the little red hen Where a
hen finds a grain of wheat and goes around
[SPEAKER_06]: asking all the other farm animals To help
make it into bread, but no one will help
[SPEAKER_06]: Finally when the hen manages all on her
own to make the bread everyone who
[SPEAKER_06]: wouldn't help shows up to eat the bread
Welcome to the cannabis industry All
[SPEAKER_06]: right, I'm gonna read you three quotes
They're they're fast so somebody in the
[SPEAKER_06]: house are familiar with some of these
people so Diane Goldstein from leap which
[SPEAKER_06]: is law enforcement used to be law
enforcement against prohibition now It's
[SPEAKER_06]: law enforcement action partnership Diane
Made an interesting comment here.
[SPEAKER_06]: She said the Greek playwright Escalus once
wrote in war truth is the first casualty
[SPEAKER_06]: His president summary of the nature of
conflict and power has played out on
[SPEAKER_06]: American soil over the last 40 years as we
have strived to make our country drug-free
[SPEAKER_06]: It's clear that the industry needs to
recognize that they are not just
[SPEAKER_06]: entrepreneurs, but that they are drug
policy reformers and Advocates as well and
[SPEAKER_06]: can help by continuing to support drug
policy reform organizations That have been
[SPEAKER_06]: instrumental in rolling back the harms of
the drug war while protecting all of our
[SPEAKER_06]: civil liberties, okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: Lynn Lyman state director for Drug Policy
Alliance You're walking you're walking in
[SPEAKER_06]: today to this whole nice legal world where
everybody can wear a name tag that says
[SPEAKER_06]: there was some cannabis Association
whereas five years ago even people were
[SPEAKER_06]: still doing federal time for having a
dispensary the advice I give to all of
[SPEAKER_06]: those people to come in who's coming into
the cannabis industry is Understand the
[SPEAKER_06]: history there is the sense that people are
just Wait waltzing in as if it's just any
[SPEAKER_06]: other industry I want to discourage that
and remind that a you that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_06]: have died people have been Incarcerated
they've had their families destroyed
[SPEAKER_06]: making sure you're a good neighbor and
you're working with the community that you
[SPEAKER_06]: are based in and finally Kristen of it all
who some of you may know in the room
[SPEAKER_06]: Kristen is the chair of the International
Cannabis Farmers Association in NorCal
[SPEAKER_06]: Kristen wrote donations from cannabis
businesses in Humboldt have built a
[SPEAKER_06]: community center KMU derail The civil
liberties monitoring project local
[SPEAKER_06]: volunteer fire departments technical
rescue and sports and art programs at our
[SPEAKER_06]: rural schools That's a farming community
for you She encourages folks to get
[SPEAKER_06]: involved with our local community by
supporting and volunteering our schools
[SPEAKER_06]: fire departments parks and so much more
need time and donations So we are strong
[SPEAKER_06]: as a group, but we need to continue
further on to that As we're talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: advocacy there are people who've been
doing on a really long time and They have
[SPEAKER_06]: lots of stories and there are people that
are new like myself.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm only a couple of years in But some of
these people on the stage here have been
[SPEAKER_06]: doing this for a really long time So I
thought it'd be really good to be able to
[SPEAKER_06]: ask them some questions Listen to their
stories and then figure out have this
[SPEAKER_06]: conversation so we can figure out what we
do going forward So first thing I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_06]: do is just have everybody quickly
introduce themselves and tell you just a
[SPEAKER_06]: short story about their background Okay,
so here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's Mary Patton
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, I Started as an activist in the
80s when Ronald Reagan was still president
[SPEAKER_02]: and Back then there wasn't a whole lot of
different organizations to sign up with it
[SPEAKER_02]: was mostly grassroots people, you know
that you knew in your community There was
[SPEAKER_02]: normal That was pretty much it And so what
we would do is organize with people we
[SPEAKER_02]: knew in our community and we did a lot of
wiring and we did a lot of meeting and
[SPEAKER_02]: events and eventually You know I started
with moving to Seattle and met up with
[SPEAKER_02]: this group of people called the peace
heathens and we started this little event
[SPEAKER_02]: called the Seattle Hemfest which is now
the largest in the country or probably the
[SPEAKER_02]: world 20 some years later really dating
myself, but It's taken a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've seen a lot of momentum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for me, I'm always the optimist like,
you know every time they try to throw some
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of Jeff Sessions at us or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, whatever I live through Reagan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's okay We've come a long way really
excited about the progress that we've made
[SPEAKER_02]: but the problem that I'm starting to see
and I've started to see in the last couple
[SPEAKER_02]: of years is When the culture clash started
happening the suits and the stoners or the
[SPEAKER_02]: activists and the capitalists and they
weren't getting along It was like water
[SPEAKER_02]: and oil It's just not always getting along
because they just didn't understand each
[SPEAKER_02]: other and I don't think you have to be one
or the other you really can find a way to
[SPEAKER_02]: do both and I think that that's part of
what we're trying to do right now is
[SPEAKER_02]: remember that this was a movement that
started out of compassion and It started
[SPEAKER_02]: as a movement about freedom not about
money I mean money we all of course want
[SPEAKER_02]: to make a living and and have a good
livelihood and we're excited and
[SPEAKER_02]: privileged to be able to do that in this
industry now, but We have a lot of work to
[SPEAKER_02]: do so 25 years later here we are Great
hell you want to go now Brad.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't care which one you how's going.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll go Okay, my name is Hal Lewis,
I know a lot of you in this room,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is really cool I want to take a poll
real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people have been in the industry
for the last five years raise your hand
[SPEAKER_03]: Excellent how about ten years raise your
hand excellent 15 years Nice 20 years 30
[SPEAKER_03]: years Cool, there's a few people in here
that have paid their dues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay and Somebody's raising their hands
and saying 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay The first thing I want to say is my
first detainment was in Los Angeles the
[SPEAKER_03]: federal building in Wilshire in 1978
petitioning for normal Okay, I was with
[SPEAKER_03]: Jack And Steve and a few other people and
we were all smoking a joint on the federal
[SPEAKER_03]: building grass feeling really good and
they came over and detained us and I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: never forget it because they said we could
arrest you but we're not going to because
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a lot of you and some of us
believe in what you're doing and Jack said
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I want to be arrested He was arrested.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was sent to Lancaster for that week in
1978.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll never forget it because we ended up
bailing him out finally and he went in
[SPEAKER_03]: front of the judge and and then he took
the van down to Venice and talked about
[SPEAKER_03]: him See what got me into this was hemp
back in the day and it was medicine
[SPEAKER_03]: because I lost both my mother and my
father to cancer and UCLA was studying it
[SPEAKER_03]: then The one thing that I look at now is
where we've come from 1978 to today
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody is fighting for a piece of the
pie And the problem is there is no pie in
[SPEAKER_03]: the oven yet Okay, bottom line and that
pie is really a cake and that's what it is
[SPEAKER_03]: in the oven Okay, and there's enough to go
around for everybody But it's something I
[SPEAKER_03]: saw that happen in Nevada a couple years
ago when everybody was fighting for
[SPEAKER_03]: Licensing and I started a company there
called Las Vegas Cannabis Information
[SPEAKER_03]: Center Because I do things like this to
bring the people together and we did a
[SPEAKER_03]: Party every three months and what we did
was we brought all the licensed people
[SPEAKER_03]: that were out waiting for applications And
we said all I want you to do is find a
[SPEAKER_03]: common bond with somebody else in the room
Reach your hand out your neighbor's not
[SPEAKER_03]: that bad and in this room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could tell you the same thing There's a
lot of people in this room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of them are really good Some of them
have ulterior motives, but they're not all
[SPEAKER_03]: bad It's up to us to find the good in each
and each and each Individual person out
[SPEAKER_03]: there right now, you know Advocates we
lost a lot of advocates that a lot of us
[SPEAKER_03]: know over the last couple years Okay And
some of them bring a tear to my because
[SPEAKER_03]: some of them were called crazy before they
passed away because of their ideas May
[SPEAKER_03]: Jeff rest in peace Jeff and I went to
battle all the time on Prop 64 I was an
[SPEAKER_03]: advocate and I worked my ass off for Prop
64 because of the hemp part in there and
[SPEAKER_03]: for To help people get out of jail,
but I had a lot of people hate on me
[SPEAKER_03]: because I was that old hippie That's what
taught me that there is a big divide right
[SPEAKER_03]: now in this room There's still a divide,
you know, and it's cannabis and back in
[SPEAKER_03]: 78.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't really a divide It was like hey,
can't we all just get along?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't we just smoke a joint just
really help each other?
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know if you needed help your
brother or sister would help you no matter
[SPEAKER_03]: what?
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now the questions I get on a
daily basis are how can I get in this
[SPEAKER_03]: business?
[SPEAKER_03]: What will it take?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much money can I make?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you help me get that done over there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I want to get to the next level in
business and that goes against everything
[SPEAKER_03]: I was taught about in the cannabis sector
The cannabis sector first and foremost is
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine Okay, if we forget about the
patient You should not be in this room or
[SPEAKER_03]: in this industry period The patient is the
number one thing Period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, that comes from all forms of
cannabis Marijuana hemp all forms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going on myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just want to give Brad an opportunity to
introduce himself All of our panelists are
[SPEAKER_00]: very enthusiastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all passionate people I thought
we're just introducing ourselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I guess I was wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Brad Lane I'm the producer of a
television show called Cannabis Planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I created that show back in 2009 and I am
a cannabis activist and My activism like
[SPEAKER_00]: this gentleman stems from Jack Harris work
I was in the Haight-Asbury in 1986 or
[SPEAKER_00]: seven at a debt show and I ran across his
book The Emperor Wears No Clothes and I
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at this book and I thought oh my
god Look at this thing and it was amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: because you didn't have to read it in
linear form like most books It just was
[SPEAKER_00]: filled with factoids about cannabis and
hemp and hemp can save the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the fuck is hemp?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I read this book on the airplane on the
way home and it was just It was amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: much like a Grateful Dead shows,
you know coming of own in my life and in
[SPEAKER_00]: enlightenment So I took that book and I
gave it to every member of my family for
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas because I wanted to show them
that hey this proves that My ideology and
[SPEAKER_00]: using cannabis is not wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was kind of a hard sell, but that's
where my activism started Does anyone in
[SPEAKER_00]: this room know what the three-foot rule
is?
[SPEAKER_00]: No one the three-foot rule Anyone ever
heard that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a multilevel marketing term and
anybody within three feet of you you're
[SPEAKER_00]: chatting up about your downline Hey,
have you heard about hemp heard about
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty amazing stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, come on So that was my activism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the three-foot rule and anybody had
read that the Emperor wears no clothes and
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody that came within three feet of me
I was explaining about cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason was most activists have an axe to
grind and I I realized my axe to grind was
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't taken seriously in life because
of my cannabis use I was an athlete.
[SPEAKER_00]: I played football in college on
scholarship if I lost my keys I'm a stoner
[SPEAKER_00]: if the accountant loses keys and so,
you know mind fart so I wasn't taken
[SPEAKER_00]: seriously in life and so I Fast forward I
had retired early with some other,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know legitimate business ideas I had
and I was snowboarding in the mountains
[SPEAKER_00]: and every year I go to Europe and I would
go to Amsterdam because Cannabis was like
[SPEAKER_00]: you were treated like a normal person.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was like paradise My father got ill
when I came back out of the mountains to
[SPEAKER_00]: Long Beach Prop 215 was kind of gaining
some momentum in Long Beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my gosh It was like Amsterdam had
nothing on Long Beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like what the hell happened while I
was gone to the mountains so I decided to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring that three-foot rule to television
and Originally, I thought you know what I
[SPEAKER_00]: was already producing some bootie TV and I
went through the OC weekly to get ads for
[SPEAKER_00]: the sports programming I was doing and
There were all these cannabis ads.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, oh my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to produce a show about weed so it
was So the first thing was make money,
[SPEAKER_00]: but when I started doing my research I
realized no way we're like the Jackie
[SPEAKER_00]: Robinson breaking the color barrier and so
we were active as a Based and we became an
[SPEAKER_00]: extension of Jack Harris work food fuel
fiber medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produced 36 episodes We ran for 13
weeks reran them for 13 weeks and that
[SPEAKER_00]: would be season one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran three seasons We went to a little
bit of a hiatus.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been in hiatus The marketplace has
caught up our show is coming back and
[SPEAKER_00]: We're one Jeff Sessions memo away from
there not being a pie to be baked I was
[SPEAKER_00]: just denied going on direct TV Last week,
we don't show anyone smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't show you recreational use of the
plant It's like what it wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're you're you're broadcasting
Viceland.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shows Bon Appetit and Weed a kit but
oh, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're taking their big money from the
network But if I want to make a paid
[SPEAKER_00]: programming by your your standards and
practices says it's illegal We can't bank
[SPEAKER_00]: is an industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was just an article today I said
that's a sort of Senate bill where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna prohibit marketing on t-shirts So
the point is this It is a plant the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: comes first if that wants to be medicine
and patients for sure But the whole reason
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis was prohibited had nothing to do
with the medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the industrial applications So
today those industrial barriers don't give
[SPEAKER_00]: a shit because it's so far antiquated sans
first Perlowans, you know decorder but The
[SPEAKER_00]: point is is that tobacco alcohol and big
pharma that's the money trail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones pushing back right now
But it was industry they'd be pushing back
[SPEAKER_06]: to it was paper or nylon who do we think
should be giving to us the industry and
[SPEAKER_06]: Simultaneously who should we be giving to
and when I say giving again, I'm not
[SPEAKER_06]: necessarily only speaking about money I'm
speaking about your time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm speaking about your Brain I'm speaking
about anything that you can give so it's
[SPEAKER_06]: not just financial.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be the question I would say
to you One of them said to me What do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think of all of us coming into your
industry now?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said listen, I've been trying to
build the biggest army I can build for my
[SPEAKER_02]: entire life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been waiting for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What took you so long?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad you're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This industry is open to everyone and
every I don't care if you're a suit of
[SPEAKER_02]: stone or a deadhead or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a place for you, but I just have
one request and that is to remember
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody that made this possible for you
to be here and to quit stoner shaming all
[SPEAKER_02]: the people that have Paid the way for you
to be here All these so-called stupid
[SPEAKER_02]: stoners are the reason every one of you is
here today because they did something
[SPEAKER_02]: right We'll welcome you into our industry
happily we want you here But you know
[SPEAKER_02]: there's so there's that and then also I
always say to every business that I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: working with I do a lot of consulting that
it's vulgar and obscene for you to try to
[SPEAKER_02]: profit from this industry if you're not
willing to actually contribute to moving
[SPEAKER_02]: the needle and If you're not willing to
have a give-back plan, then I don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: want to buy what you're selling So there's
a consciousness that I think needs to
[SPEAKER_02]: happen with this type of capitalism.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not anti-capitalism I've been an
activist, but I believe in a conscious
[SPEAKER_02]: capitalism because this is a movement of
compassion and we're conscious people and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're very you know people were really
underestimating Us as a consumer those
[SPEAKER_02]: those dumb stoners.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can just slap any Name or packaging on
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll buy from us No, they're figured
out that we're a lot smarter than they
[SPEAKER_02]: realize and that we actually care who is
behind the brand and how they run their
[SPEAKER_02]: business and the ethics that they have and
How they do their business that's really
[SPEAKER_02]: important to most consumers in the
cannabis industry and there are lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: other than you think So don't ever
underestimate the consumer or the other
[SPEAKER_02]: people that paved the way and always
remember There's still people sitting in
[SPEAKER_02]: jail for doing what you're trying to do
right now And we owe a debt of gratitude
[SPEAKER_02]: to them, and I think we also should never
stop Trying to get them out because we're
[SPEAKER_02]: not free
[SPEAKER_00]: The ethics married us would be resonated
over there Mary said to me Everyone's idea
[SPEAKER_00]: of activism is different from the
three-foot rule I mentioned to someone
[SPEAKER_00]: donating money Donating their time
collecting signatures Producing the
[SPEAKER_00]: information to disseminate everyone's idea
is different and it all is important so
[SPEAKER_00]: giving back and give back in many
different ways, but To me the ethics thing
[SPEAKER_00]: is really important because like I was
mentioning earlier with my show being
[SPEAKER_00]: Jackie Robinson breaking the color we're
being watched people So I mean just common
[SPEAKER_00]: sense tells you to try to market yourself
and portray the imagery of your brand in a
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible fashion not You know market
kids Recreational cannabis is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all about recreation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should be able to alter our level of
consciousness as human beings But we have
[SPEAKER_00]: this beautiful thing with prop 215 and
patient I Have ADHD.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I use cannabis We're pretty
compassionate society right if I had
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer just such it could probably say it
was okay But if I'm ADHD, it's all you
[SPEAKER_00]: stoner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't take this pill So we should be
able to use our whole medicine for
[SPEAKER_00]: insomnia We should be able to use our
whole medicine for ADHD We should be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to use it for menstrual cramps not just
spasticity or Crohn's So until we educate
[SPEAKER_00]: the general public Re-educate them this
refer madness mentality that went down 80
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago permeates everyone's mentality
So I don't know how we end it except
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody stands up and says hey,
what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should really use it So you donate your
money or you donate your time and you mark
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself as possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's great I wonder if you could tell us
about what you and I were talking about
[SPEAKER_06]: the other day with like investment and
being able to siphon off percentages to go
[SPEAKER_03]: into Yeah, I think so I don't remember old
Yeah a couple things right now I actually
[SPEAKER_03]: have a company in the cannabis sector and
part of my company gives back There's a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of companies out there that does I
know Jenny gives a one-for-one to cancer
[SPEAKER_03]: patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know there's companies that do Give to
veterans miss Mary James.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know they have a big veterans program,
you know, giving back is really important
[SPEAKER_03]: to me I'm actually part of a group that
I'm proud of and hopefully my deluxe II
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't take off Angela's animals or
animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I did a right there you go see What
are the things that we've been working on
[SPEAKER_03]: as community or Our dispensary owners is
setting them up with ways that they could
[SPEAKER_03]: give back to the community and it's really
Simple one of the best ideas that was has
[SPEAKER_03]: been around for a long time is go to Home
Depot Pick up one of those barrels that
[SPEAKER_03]: you chill your drinks in and have a food
drive where people bring in non-perishable
[SPEAKER_03]: items and if they bring in 10 They get a
pre-roll and you could donate them that
[SPEAKER_03]: food to the hungry See basic things like
that is a way to give back to society.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be big You don't have
to write checks for hundreds of thousands
[SPEAKER_03]: of dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not where it starts It starts with
the basics is somebody hungry something in
[SPEAKER_03]: need And so that's where I'm at right now
with with a great group that's in the back
[SPEAKER_03]: I know the LA task force has a program
that they're putting together to Ruben's
[SPEAKER_03]: in here somewhere So definitely see
Jonathan or Ruben about about some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff that's going on out there about how
to give back and What I was asking him
[SPEAKER_06]: about is as we're lately myself included
as top we're talking to investors and
[SPEAKER_06]: people are coming into the industry I know
I personally do it and I know she's been
[SPEAKER_06]: doing it as well Which is making sure that
out of a hundred percent of the funds that
[SPEAKER_06]: they are gonna donate X percent it could
be eight seven ten somewhere in that range
[SPEAKER_06]: must go to Nonprofits must go to advocacy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Otherwise, I don't want Your money because
if you're not willing to help this
[SPEAKER_06]: industry so you can profit off of it
You're not the right investor and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of how I feel about it So the piece
of property off and I've got a lot of big
[SPEAKER_03]: investors that want to come in and I've
already turned down two of them And we're
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at two of them possibly to buy
this piece of property and that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: Jackie and I were talking about if they
buy it What is their endgame?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is their plan?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is what are they giving back?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the bottom line is I don't care
about sure The most important thing is the
[SPEAKER_06]: people and also and I'm then Brad I'll
take follow this but also Some of us
[SPEAKER_06]: myself included spend time speak with
cities and city council members and I can
[SPEAKER_06]: say from my own personal experience that
the conversations that I'm having with
[SPEAKER_06]: them are Involving community action are
involving as they're gonna look at who
[SPEAKER_06]: they're going to license how many licenses
and who they're gonna choose to Have a
[SPEAKER_06]: license in their city When they go through
the vetting process They're going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: paying attention to what kind of giving
back you do what kind of programs you may
[SPEAKER_06]: want to create They're going to be looking
at that stuff because it's not going to
[SPEAKER_06]: necessarily go to the highest bidder Okay,
because the highest bidder is great for
[SPEAKER_06]: money, but it doesn't necessarily help the
community it might but it might not so
[SPEAKER_06]: when the cities are thinking about who
they're going to license just keep in mind
[SPEAKER_06]: that that's going to Be a factor and it's
going to be a criteria and you know what
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm all for it because it's time for us to
be able to Bring this industry into the
[SPEAKER_06]: into the mainstream.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's do it the right way and show
everybody how awesome Cannabis people
[SPEAKER_00]: Once upon a time we had five collectives
in our little unincorporated Hamlet It was
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was patient number one little at the end
of my streets and Unincorporate OC one
[SPEAKER_00]: flock there and now there's not one city
in Orange County San Santa Ana where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's Also all delivery service all
black market, so it's a big problem and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think this whole like you know message of
giving back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be activism We've got to push the
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to push the conversation to the
politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to push the conversation to the
city councils, and we've got to stop this
[SPEAKER_00]: refer madness mentality It's like we know
scientifically alcohol is more dangerous
[SPEAKER_00]: than cannabis There's liquor stores on
every corner yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't have a dispensary but pardon me
dispensary for profit We can't have a
[SPEAKER_00]: nonprofit collective of patients to share
medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's lunacy Mary I want to talk to you
about technology as We are in this social
[SPEAKER_06]: age, and we are using we're taking our
messages socially How do you think
[SPEAKER_06]: technology is helping and how is it maybe
hurting our advocacy efforts out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've always had a love-hate relationship
with it as you know Because one of the
[SPEAKER_02]: things that I think obviously it's been a
tremendous help It's probably really one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the best tools that has helped really
catapult a lot of our movement But at the
[SPEAKER_02]: same time what I've also seen is like
Facebook activists where All you think
[SPEAKER_02]: that they have to do is like post a link
and they're an activist You know and I say
[SPEAKER_02]: come on this takes a little bit more than
that I appreciate that that helps,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's not enough And we need to really
motivate people to do more and to show up
[SPEAKER_02]: and to have their voice heard and to And I
know people don't like to do this with
[SPEAKER_02]: their actual voice anymore, but call your
local representatives and talk to them
[SPEAKER_02]: Send them a text and send them an email it
just goes into a digital file of bits and
[SPEAKER_02]: Bites and they don't they can't really
keep that Registered, but when you write a
[SPEAKER_02]: letter and when you make a phone call
there's more human connection and tell
[SPEAKER_02]: your story tell them how it this has
changed your life or what's happening to
[SPEAKER_02]: you because they listen to those stories
and You know a long time ago I used to
[SPEAKER_02]: work for the Oprah Winfrey Show And I
never believed in a million years that she
[SPEAKER_02]: used to read all that mail because all of
this mail would come in and she herself
[SPEAKER_02]: did not It's true, but she had piles of
people that would sort through the mail
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for those stories And they would
synopsis everything and give her a report
[SPEAKER_02]: of all these amazing stories For a person
that got as much mail as she got I was
[SPEAKER_02]: amazed at how much she actually did read
But you know it was important to have that
[SPEAKER_02]: personal story so tell your story and tell
it to the right people because they need
[SPEAKER_02]: to hear it and They're not watching your
Facebook feed so tell it to the people who
[SPEAKER_02]: matter that's what One of the easiest
things you could do I write letters all
[SPEAKER_02]: the time That's how I started as an
activist when I was eight years old my
[SPEAKER_02]: third grade teacher said We're gonna do a
project today and write a letter to the
[SPEAKER_02]: president and that was the first time I
realized I could do this and I got a
[SPEAKER_02]: letter back and then That's what started
this whole thing really Because eventually
[SPEAKER_02]: I realized I could do that to talk about
marijuana which I did very short You know
[SPEAKER_02]: teenagers, but my point is it got a
response and it's something I continue to
[SPEAKER_02]: do to this day because I can't show up to
everything there's so many things to show
[SPEAKER_02]: up to I'm out of town a lot maybe I show
up to everything I can but we can't all
[SPEAKER_02]: show up to everything show up as often as
you can and Write letters and make those
[SPEAKER_06]: phone calls So so to continue this
conversation, so how do we?
[SPEAKER_06]: Choose let's say we're gonna donate our
time or our money to an organization.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we choose?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do we know which ones to?
[SPEAKER_06]: You know we've got NPP DPA normal all
these organizations, and they're all doing
[SPEAKER_06]: wonderful things how how do we choose?
[SPEAKER_06]: how do we figure out what we can do and
and you know and make a decision because
[SPEAKER_06]: Everyone has to give their part right if
we want to pie it has to be big Brad you
[SPEAKER_00]: won't take it No, I don't know I would say
support my television program that's
[SPEAKER_00]: biased, but we do have a pretty loud
megaphone You know one of the way that we
[SPEAKER_03]: do choose is to look at the organization
It's very important.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of organizations that have
popped their head up in the last couple
[SPEAKER_03]: years Saying if you join me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will guarantee you a license Just give
me ten thousand or thirty thousand dollars
[SPEAKER_03]: these people how I look at it is What are
they doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is the organization really doing out
there?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are they giving back?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's most important to look at what an
organization is doing and how They're
[SPEAKER_03]: giving back because all these
organizations even if they sit there and
[SPEAKER_03]: say we're not making a dime They're making
a dime Okay, they're just lying.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know and the bottom line is what
they're doing Yeah Yeah, well I'm in these
[SPEAKER_03]: big organisms these big new organizations
Let's put it that way the big new right
[SPEAKER_06]: but the ones that are working on the front
lines that are on the ground Every day
[SPEAKER_06]: some many of them in this room.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, right Yeah, we they all need help
they all they need volunteers and they
[SPEAKER_06]: need funding.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how do we get that to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so many different ways to give and
you know but I think what we're here for
[SPEAKER_02]: as a group is because we're interested in
and being entrepreneurs or working in this
[SPEAKER_02]: industry and I think really the most
important thing we can do as an industry
[SPEAKER_02]: is hold each other accountable to certain
sets of ethics and to support the people
[SPEAKER_02]: that are supporting us because we can't
thrive as a business or an industry if
[SPEAKER_02]: we're not willing to invest in creating
the business environment that's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: allow your business to succeed which is
why you need to support people like MPP
[SPEAKER_02]: and DPA and the people that are making the
laws possible for you to be in business at
[SPEAKER_02]: all so That I think is why we're here.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of different ways to give
there's a lot of different You know things
[SPEAKER_02]: that we can all be doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I was poor in college poor But yet
I found time to raise money and to get our
[SPEAKER_02]: voices heard and to put on events and you
know somehow you can find the money if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're really willing and if you're going
to try to Turn a profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you should invest in your own best
interest by supporting the movement as
[SPEAKER_00]: well I want to fall upon the IT point that
was the original premise you know IT is
[SPEAKER_00]: like technology Mary said you know they're
not to be watching your Facebook feed now
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it'll be their snapchat or
Instagram feeds Social media is a scourge,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's also very Amazingly powerful
medium that we have today the internet
[SPEAKER_00]: social media, so you can't discount it
We've got so I think Putting your message
[SPEAKER_00]: out there Where the most people can see it
is definitely a start to helping you
[SPEAKER_00]: change public opinion you change public
policy The politicians are behind the
[SPEAKER_00]: curve the citizens know but the
politicians want votes So if enough
[SPEAKER_00]: citizens say hey, this is what you know
people are sheep We know we are you take
[SPEAKER_00]: away their alcohol they get pissed well it
should be they take away our cannabis for
[SPEAKER_02]: getting pissed One of the things that I
think is also really interesting,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm sure that when Karen is up here
She'll be able to speak to this as well
[SPEAKER_02]: for a long time At the marijuana policy
project where I used to work with Karen We
[SPEAKER_02]: were we were funded mainly by
philanthropists who were just really
[SPEAKER_02]: generous people who cared about freedom
and wanted to support civil liberties not
[SPEAKER_02]: so much by an industry as The industry
kept growing and becoming more and more
[SPEAKER_02]: wealthy There came a point where a lot of
the philanthropists were starting to look
[SPEAKER_02]: around and say those guys are getting rich
And they're not putting any money in We
[SPEAKER_02]: don't really want to be the one supporting
this industry by ourselves anymore We
[SPEAKER_02]: really want them to step up and to start
contributing and so the philanthropists
[SPEAKER_02]: started pulling back some of their money
and their Contributions and the more we
[SPEAKER_02]: kept putting pressure on the industry to
give back there was always an excuse
[SPEAKER_02]: There's like we're not making enough and I
get it where you know a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: really struggling You're either getting
robbed or you're getting raided or the tax
[SPEAKER_02]: man's taking it all I mean, there's a lot
of different things that get in the way of
[SPEAKER_02]: Getting rich off the industry,
but like I said if I could find a way to
[SPEAKER_02]: contribute when I was poor in college I
think we can all find a way and we should
[SPEAKER_02]: find a way but What's really interesting
is the fact that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Since that's happened since we've really
built this industry when I talked to my
[SPEAKER_02]: friends and all the advocacy groups They
tell me that the donations are not still
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from the industry They're still
mostly coming from philanthropists and the
[SPEAKER_02]: same people that were supporting us all
along Are still mostly the people still
[SPEAKER_02]: supporting us and we're seeing more from
the industry But not nearly as much as you
[SPEAKER_02]: would think so that's one of the other
reasons I think we call this group
[SPEAKER_02]: together because we kind of need to hold
each other accountable and do better
[SPEAKER_02]: because People think that this is
inevitable that the laws are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: change and that the legalization is
happening And you don't really have to do
[SPEAKER_02]: very much But I remember in the 70s when
we thought it was inevitable and it was
[SPEAKER_02]: going to happen and Then they were
decriminalizing across the state and Jimmy
[SPEAKER_02]: Carter was on board and then all of a
sudden we got Reagan and he said marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: was the most dangerous drug known to man
and then we started seeing some of the the
[SPEAKER_02]: worst drug war Prohibition than we've ever
seen I mean that he escalated it beyond
[SPEAKER_02]: belief So you can't get complacent and you
can't think someone else is going to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: and you can't just think it's automatic
You know I remember when people were
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to come and ask me how to get in
the industry I'd say volunteer get
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in the movie That's the best way
to learn because you can't get a course on
[SPEAKER_02]: this in college where you can now but you
couldn't then So, you know Giving back
[SPEAKER_02]: that's one of the best things you can do
and that's still one of the best things
[SPEAKER_02]: you can do and the best thing to do is to
just Get involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really What I always say that this
isn't a career this is a calling for me
[SPEAKER_02]: but it it became a career too,
but once you kind of start with that it
[SPEAKER_02]: becomes So infectious in your soul that
there's nothing else that you can do You
[SPEAKER_02]: can't even walk away from it even when the
industry is hard It's and it's been really
[SPEAKER_02]: really hard a lot of the time over the
last several years We got a lot easier
[SPEAKER_02]: road to go down now and we have all these
amazing people to think but don't get too
[SPEAKER_02]: comfortable Because they can change at any
moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't know what Jeff Sessions is gonna
do even though he doesn't scare me at all
[SPEAKER_02]: It will adjust Whatever happens it's still
a scary prospect and people used to say to
[SPEAKER_02]: me I can't get into the industry because
it's illegal now the argument is I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: get it I can't contribute because it's you
know, it's legal now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to do anything, you know,
so There's obviously that's not the case
[SPEAKER_02]: on either side.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we still have a lot of work to do I
think that the key here is understanding
[SPEAKER_06]: that cannabis is not just a lifestyle
Cannabis is not just a medicine Cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: is not just a culture cannabis is also
Regulations and laws and policies and you
[SPEAKER_06]: can't separate them if you want to have a
commercial activity So and I'm assuming
[SPEAKER_06]: that everybody in the room is somehow
involved in commercial activity Whether
[SPEAKER_06]: you have want to get a license or you just
want to remain an advocate You're still in
[SPEAKER_06]: that commercial world So understanding
that those two things really can't live
[SPEAKER_06]: apart if you're just living in the
lifestyle culture You're in the consumer
[SPEAKER_06]: land.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nobody cares if you're making any money if
you're just living in policy land That's
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of boring So it's really like it's
really the two together that what makes
[SPEAKER_06]: the magic and I think that's what we need
to continue focus on So I think what I'd
[SPEAKER_06]: like to do is open it up for some
questions here I'm gonna have Robert come
[SPEAKER_06]: around and they were down to two mics.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want to add one quick thing You
know a lot of advocates for I was
[SPEAKER_03]: mentioning have passed away in last year
or two that I've known For a long time we
[SPEAKER_03]: lost one last week that some people loved
and some people hate it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know Yeah, and Mickey,
you know, I take my hat off to the
[SPEAKER_03]: gentleman because he called it like it is
Yes
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, and I just want to say on
Facebook there's a go fund me page for his
[SPEAKER_03]: family right now see a lot of us That have
been around this scene for a while don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have money when we pass on because we've
spent it in helping others and You know if
[SPEAKER_03]: you can't contribute Put it out there go
to his Facebook page go to the go fund me
[SPEAKER_03]: page because you know The kids and the
family are going to need help,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that's what we find in this
industry We're here to help each other
[SPEAKER_03]: person foremost.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Alana You were discussing.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just curious if you have specific
Nonprofit organizations that you can name
[SPEAKER_05]: that I can write down But I should walk
out the doorway I have a short list and a
[SPEAKER_02]: long list, but I'll try to just start with
a couple of my favorites like the
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana policy project and I'm biased
because I work for them and obviously the
[SPEAKER_02]: drug policy alliance and all your local
organizations I really appreciate what the
[SPEAKER_02]: LA task force is doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always want to work locally in your
community as much as possible In addition
[SPEAKER_02]: to the state and national as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the maps organization, which is
multidisciplinary Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah psychedelic studies I'll second
everything Meredith said I like all those
[SPEAKER_03]: organizations, you know, I'm gonna second
what Mary said to One thing I'm gonna add
[SPEAKER_03]: that's deep to my heart and has been is
it's California normal the main normal
[SPEAKER_03]: office There's a lot of different normal
organizations Organizations out there,
[SPEAKER_03]: but because my first detainment was
getting petitions with normal that's
[SPEAKER_03]: always been in my heart right there Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: All right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take another question.
[SPEAKER_06]: I saw some Candice Hawes OC normal The
overview that's right.
[SPEAKER_07]: How's your name?
[SPEAKER_07]: Good evening everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Russell.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you for your time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hey So I guess I have a quick question,
you know, it's it's on or maybe not so
[SPEAKER_07]: Quick, but it's on the question of
community engagement so the first one is
[SPEAKER_07]: You know one of the things that I know
that we're doing just you know for my
[SPEAKER_07]: business in terms of community engagement
is We're plugging into all of our local
[SPEAKER_07]: cities leadership programs most cities in
the Los Angeles area have some type of
[SPEAKER_07]: leadership program facilitated either
through a chamber or through some City
[SPEAKER_07]: office economic development something like
that that gives you kind of like this fast
[SPEAKER_07]: track to understand the players You know
and understand the policies and what works
[SPEAKER_07]: There so for I guess it's gonna be the
perfect two-part first part is what your
[SPEAKER_07]: guys's views were in with that type of
engagement and if any Pointers you guys
[SPEAKER_07]: would have about how we craft that
engagement once you're getting so close
[SPEAKER_07]: with the people through a leadership
program like that the second part to my
[SPEAKER_07]: question and I guess it's a little bit
more so boxy But you know to be to talk
[SPEAKER_07]: about non industry specific Charities,
you know, for instance something that we
[SPEAKER_07]: know all of us whether or not here in
cannabis housing is a really big problem
[SPEAKER_07]: in LA Homelessness is one of the biggest
issues our county is facing currently What
[SPEAKER_07]: about partnering with groups like Habitat
for Humanity, you know kind of normalizing
[SPEAKER_07]: our charity game so that we aren't just
staying within our lanes We are reaching
[SPEAKER_07]: out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are showing people who do care about
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: You do care about your issues I'll jump in
really quick and say that that's an
[SPEAKER_06]: excellent idea and I and I'm glad you
brought that up because We don't just need
[SPEAKER_06]: to give to our canvas for organizations.
[SPEAKER_06]: Although they need help We also want to
show the whole community that we can Give
[SPEAKER_06]: back and we can help support them as well
So I think something like Habitat for
[SPEAKER_06]: Humanity any of those kinds of things are
great like Diane in her quote earlier was
[SPEAKER_06]: talking about or Kristen was talking about
firefighters and you know other there's
[SPEAKER_06]: other organizations and groups that are
involved indirectly With cannabis or not,
[SPEAKER_06]: but you could just give back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really it's there's no rules You can
just give back but you I think what we're
[SPEAKER_06]: all saying is that you should right?
[SPEAKER_00]: if you if you're a collective owner or a
Organizer of a collective I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: huge importance John mentioned alluded to
it earlier work with your local city
[SPEAKER_00]: council Luke would work with your city
community and take a proceeds of your
[SPEAKER_00]: donations and give them back to the
community That builds goodwill all across
[SPEAKER_00]: the board.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every collective owner in my opinion or
party organizer of each collective should
[SPEAKER_00]: work with their local city Council to
build goodwill through giving back Now one
[SPEAKER_02]: thing to keep in mind is that they don't
always want to take your money and we've
[SPEAKER_02]: run into that in the past so That's
changing but there have been times when we
[SPEAKER_02]: attempted as a community or To some of
these organizations and they said that
[SPEAKER_02]: they can't take our money So there's still
some work to be done there and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that as the industry evolves and
we continue to earn the community's
[SPEAKER_02]: respect they'll be more comfortable taking
it but
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, 100% on that I agree with you Mary
because we've tried to give money to
[SPEAKER_03]: certain Community leaders and they won't
accept it because it is cannabis what we
[SPEAKER_03]: found, you know besides taking food
donations when I did have a open
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary was to right now buy lunch
tickets take a couple hundred dollars go
[SPEAKER_03]: down to a Middle school and buy lunch
tickets and then say it's a donation and
[SPEAKER_03]: don't name the organization You know,
if you're if you're only there's donations
[SPEAKER_03]: work two ways One is you're trying to make
give the donation to get your name out
[SPEAKER_03]: there The other way is you're making a
donation to make the world a better place
