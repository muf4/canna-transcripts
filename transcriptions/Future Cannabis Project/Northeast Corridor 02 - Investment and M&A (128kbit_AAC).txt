[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the other thing I was going to say
about those management teams that Debra
[SPEAKER_03]: referenced is that I've seen a lot more of
them now being people with a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: consumer packaged goods experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come out of Procter & Gamble.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come out of Molson.
[SPEAKER_03]: They come out of other Wrigley.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're starting to see the management
coming in from these other traditional big
[SPEAKER_03]: company industries and really start to
take some of the senior roles in these big
[SPEAKER_03]: brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think the one that bugs me the
most is Green Growth Brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys were all like laid off
Victoria's Secret folks out of Columbus,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you knew that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they come into the industry and they're
like, oh, man, all these cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries, they don't know how to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know retail because we sold bras and
we're going to show them how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they buy a dispensary in Las Vegas,
the source, which is already doing 17
[SPEAKER_00]: million dollars a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm thinking, well, apparently they
know how to do it because they're doing 17
[SPEAKER_00]: million dollars a year, which is not too
shabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, their claim to fame is that
they're all from Victoria's Secret,
[SPEAKER_00]: which in my opinion was a bunch of men
selling bras to women and over
[SPEAKER_00]: objectifying the women and
hypersexualizing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they lost sight of the fact that there
was a whole hashtag me too and college
[SPEAKER_00]: rape and they were not paying attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, they were not really good
retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to come into the cannabis industry a
little late to the party and to say that
[SPEAKER_00]: they knew how to do it and no one else did
really bugged me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting is that they just
made a bid to buy another company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of brings us to our next
topic, which is consolidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing a ton of consolidation
happening in the market right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like every week I'm talking about
another acquisition that is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's talk about that because,
Matt, obviously you pay a lot of attention
[SPEAKER_00]: to all these acquisitions as you're
following these companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, and I think we're going to continue
to see that because if you think about it,
[SPEAKER_04]: the way it is right now, early on it was
the mom and pops and some of these
[SPEAKER_04]: well-capitalized companies came in and
then they got bigger, bigger, bigger and
[SPEAKER_04]: they went to Canada and they listed,
they got additional capital and now
[SPEAKER_04]: they're just scooping up all these
licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the smaller guys really don't have a
chance, in my opinion, of sustaining.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to your point, yeah, would you rather
just get the license out of the gate and
[SPEAKER_04]: then get tapped on the shoulder and be
cashed out of $20 million?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what's happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just saw in Connecticut, there was GTIs
in Connecticut now, 30 something billion
[SPEAKER_04]: or billion, million dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all kinds of those plays going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is to the point I made earlier is
that if you got 30 billion or 30 million
[SPEAKER_04]: valuation, that could be cut in half
tomorrow if the state decided to issue
[SPEAKER_04]: additional licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you're going to see a
continued wave, a green wave of these type
[SPEAKER_04]: of plays.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think it makes sense that these
states start to limit that a Cresco Labs
[SPEAKER_00]: or an Acreage Holdings can only have X
amount of licenses per state so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't end up with a madman coming in and
buying 20 of the licenses because they got
[SPEAKER_00]: the money?
[SPEAKER_04]: The thing is too, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to be mindful of the future of
the industry, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're sort of near the end zone,
sort of maybe, when prohibition ends.
[SPEAKER_04]: So whatever happens now, it's going to
change when federal laws change.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the federal government could have a
completely different view on how this
[SPEAKER_04]: whole entire market is regulated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really hard to call how what any
state's going to do if it's favorable or
[SPEAKER_04]: unfavorable because it could only have a
limited life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And mergers and consolidation is
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's huge what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they tried to limit the number of
licenses that one entity could hold,
[SPEAKER_01]: then they're going to move to a management
model or a franchising model.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to hire high-priced lawyers
to figure out a way around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If these states want regular people to get
into the industry, I'm going to harp on
[SPEAKER_01]: this point, hoping some state regulator
sees it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to lower the barrier to entry
because the timeline to get a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: business off the ground is 18 months to 24
months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to the vast majority of people,
to hold on to a piece of real estate,
[SPEAKER_01]: pay rent on an empty building,
go through the costs of putting together
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, architecture drawings,
operational plans, whatever you need to
[SPEAKER_01]: submit to your state, all of these
thousands of dollars add up to a quarter
[SPEAKER_01]: million dollars or a half million dollars,
which is completely unattainable to these
[SPEAKER_01]: regular folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the states that pay lip service
saying, you know, we want to prioritize
[SPEAKER_01]: social equity, we want to give
opportunities for folks who have been
[SPEAKER_01]: harmed by the war on drugs, then do
something meaningful because, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: telling folks without money that they're
first in line is completely illusory
[SPEAKER_01]: unless you're actually providing
meaningful funding or assistance to help
[SPEAKER_01]: those folks get through the program and
that you provide a real way for them to
[SPEAKER_01]: qualify to get licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of the problem, what happened
in Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the first state to champion
social equity, but very few applicants
[SPEAKER_01]: were able to make it through due to the
capital costs involved to go through the
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And until that happens, you know,
it's just going to be big money,
[SPEAKER_01]: big capital who are either going to play a
predatory role and, you know, set up
[SPEAKER_01]: really bad deals for the social equity
applicant in order for the company to get
[SPEAKER_01]: priority or we're just going to see
consolidation.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll continue to see consolidation rather
than new folks, you know, entering the
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the biggest challenge that
we're seeing because more and more of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cities and states are doing competitive
licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to find the best operators who
have tons and tons of experience and who
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to be, you know, low risk for
the city, you know, low risk for the city
[SPEAKER_01]: in setting up shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've never run a cannabis business
before, you're just automatically
[SPEAKER_01]: disqualified because, you know,
you don't have the ability to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: California first or you haven't been in
Massachusetts before now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, these states need to think
about, you know, actually following
[SPEAKER_01]: through and not just talking about raising
people up and providing opportunities for
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It needs to be broad, low cost entry into
the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, the unlicensed market,
the unregulated market, it's just going to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to thrive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Billy on Aaron's point, as we watch
licenses build in Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_03]: the state would actually tell people how
long it might take.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some of the timelines were 300 to 500
days to get through the medical license
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I know this isn't in this
region, but one of the biggest stories in
[SPEAKER_03]: the fourth quarter last year was Oklahoma,
which started issuing licenses kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: like crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I checked today, they issued about
2500 licenses in the course of 45 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cost per license is twenty five
hundred dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the state raised six million
dollars just in licensing fees.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they were pretty happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now they've got, you know,
hopefully a licensed infrastructure there
[SPEAKER_03]: now with only four million people living
in that state and close to 700
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do the math.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like 5000 people to a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at least it lets the market decide who
are the best operators, who are the best
[SPEAKER_03]: retailers, who can make a go of this from
cultivation to manufacturing to running
[SPEAKER_03]: retail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's sort of a study in contrast.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people are looking at that state
and a lot of my customers are selling into
[SPEAKER_03]: that state.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they're selling insurance and
other products.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it appears to be a market that may have
some vibrancy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's interesting, though,
like Vegas or Nevada, like they were six
[SPEAKER_04]: months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Boom.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were ready rock and roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: They talk about high taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to that Planet 13 dispensary,
the world's largest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was crazy expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went I, you know, picked up some flour,
go to the ring it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it was like 40 bucks or
something dumb like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just bringing home to my husband.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that the guy brings it up and he's
like, OK, well, that's fifty five dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no, no, no, it's like 40 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's like, that's the tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's killer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no wonder the black market does so
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think it's you know,
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I kind of feel like the mom and pop idea
is going to is not workable anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think that that was quaint and
nice at the early days of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just don't think it's well,
what's interesting is in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_04]: The last the last round, I mean,
most of them were multistate operators.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think that's going to be the
trend.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not going to see like the small
guys winning these licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's the big guys are here and they're
going to continue to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, what about micro licenses out in
California?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say in California,
we still have a large number of mom and
[SPEAKER_01]: pop businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the trouble, you know, at least with
California, we love California,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they've overly complicated it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of those mom and pop
businesses, though, won't be around two
[SPEAKER_01]: years from now because the cost of
compliance is so high.
[SPEAKER_01]: The amount of unlicensed competition is so
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And many of those folks who are here
today, you know, they're probably not
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be here because somebody is going
to come in and say, look, it's easier for
[SPEAKER_01]: me just to buy you than go through this
process myself because it's so long and
[SPEAKER_01]: cumbersome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's just, you know, dozens of high
net worth individuals and public companies
[SPEAKER_01]: from Canada who are just going on a
shopping spree in California right now
[SPEAKER_01]: because this historically has been a mom
and pop industry like the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry up until now has been a mom and
pop industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the implementation in California has
been so slow that, you know, it's easier
[SPEAKER_01]: for people to buy businesses now than go
through the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least in California, there's a
strong push to keep it a mom and pop
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll see how it plays out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of the multistate operators are
there or they're coming in right now as
[SPEAKER_01]: part of that shopping spree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you made a good point with some of
those regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of the regulations make
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're creating an edible product,
you need to have some kind of food
[SPEAKER_00]: standards and certain standards within
your kitchen so that you are not selling
[SPEAKER_00]: an edible product to, you know,
people that it might go bad on the shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that when July 1st regulations
kicked in, a lot of the established
[SPEAKER_00]: companies, they just went out of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just said, we can't afford to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think was it Mary's Medicinals?
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some that were really,
really popular that just said,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, we're not going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just closed shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the ones who were ready and who were
remaining on the shelf in that month after
[SPEAKER_01]: July 1st, they're killing it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Candescent is one of those
companies where they were way ahead of the
[SPEAKER_01]: curve and took compliance seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're ready for that July 1st
transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, well, every Papa and
Barkley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Papa and Barkley.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, every retailer was like,
you know, destroying old products or
[SPEAKER_01]: having fire sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, on July 2nd, Candescent was
there in every store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Papa and Barkley is there in every store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not doing it to plug those brands,
but but they were the companies that like
[SPEAKER_01]: understood compliance and actually like
read the regulations ahead of time and
[SPEAKER_01]: built their business strategy around these
dates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, you know, I would say 85 percent
of the licensed cultivators and
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers, they just woke up one day
and were like, you know, gee whiz,
[SPEAKER_01]: we got to change our packaging in two
weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, no one's going to buy it at the
retail level.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the lesson from those those really good
mom and pop operators is that look,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you read the rules, you follow them,
you implement them in a meaningful way.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of the industry is going to
provide opportunities for you to rise to
[SPEAKER_01]: the top, because most folks don't take
those compliance deadlines seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from the from the regulatory
compliance standpoint, when California
[SPEAKER_03]: started issuing licenses last year,
they wanted to do it by year end and they
[SPEAKER_03]: started like middle of December.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my partner and I got off a plane and
like we got the email like, oh,
[SPEAKER_03]: my goodness, they started doing it
already.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had a researcher start getting the
information together.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one company, perhaps a client of
yours, because they were repressive,
[SPEAKER_03]: that they managed to get eight licenses
from three regulators within like two
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how much did they pay?
[SPEAKER_03]: C.A.
[SPEAKER_03]: Systematize was the name of the company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they got a med and a rec cultivation,
med and rec distribution, med and a rec
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary and a retailer and maybe
delivery.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but they were able to line up
eight licenses across three regulators in
[SPEAKER_03]: a short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they obviously had a very good set of
professionals helping them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they took the compliance seriously.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, they were certainly an outlier,
but they really jumped out at us because
[SPEAKER_03]: they had to navigate a lot of really hard
compliance work, I would imagine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think over time, though, like this whole
concept of in a bifurcated market of a
[SPEAKER_04]: medical and a rec license, it's just going
to go away.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're already starting to see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Colorado is really the only state that
continues to track it separately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Makes no sense because you have two
agents, two authorities within the state
[SPEAKER_04]: regulating basically the same market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, right in California, or I'm sorry,
Massachusetts that's starting to settle
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in Oregon, the dispensary list used to
have like five hundred stores on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's down to four that are dispensary
only.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in most cases, it's a retailer that
has sort of a checkbox on their license
[SPEAKER_03]: that says, yeah, your permission to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at that point, it just becomes like an
SKU at the cash register.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in every state, we're a record market
comes in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Patient counts go down pretty steep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I've seen the data that about six
months to a year after the fact,
[SPEAKER_00]: they start to come back.
[SPEAKER_04]: They start to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they're still down, like from
their.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: M.J.
[SPEAKER_00]: Freeway had that data that I don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I see from the states.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I know what you're talking about,
but I would disagree with that because it
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't it doesn't reconcile with what the
states are reporting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm an accountant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I think we'll shift gears
and start to talk about the the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: investment of these companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that we really haven't
touched on is some of the valuations on a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of these companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them are publicly traded.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's getting to the point where there's
very few that aren't publicly traded right
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've all gone into the public markets
in order to raise money to get capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're either on the CSE or the OTC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a handful that have Canadian
companies that have got onto the nice in
[SPEAKER_00]: the NASDAQ.
[SPEAKER_00]: The valuations have been all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wildly volatile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it seems like we're in a real
down cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ended the year 2018.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stocks were way off, like down 30
percent, some down 40 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then 2019, we started to kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We read, you know, rebound, rebound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: What what do we think that we're going to
see this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's going to be continued
volatility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, you know, maybe toward the
back of the end of the year, we'll see
[SPEAKER_04]: some rationalization as more countries
make announcements and the world becomes
[SPEAKER_04]: more on board with with marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like Canada, the big hype was like
they were going to export to the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a huge oversupply in Canada or
there will be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you know, I think when the market
realizes that that's not they're not going
[SPEAKER_04]: to be supplying the whole world,
the stocks will contract accordingly.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are starting to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that that the prices are
really more getting more in line with what
[SPEAKER_00]: the companies are doing, i.e.
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue and such that they were just
wildly inflated?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I think it's still too early to tell
because we don't have a lot of history
[SPEAKER_04]: under our belts to really look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plus, you also have to remember we don't
really have real audited financial
[SPEAKER_04]: statements yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we have these.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to say subpar firms,
but subpar firms.
[SPEAKER_04]: But no, no, I don't mean no.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, no, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I mean, like I mean, like mom and
pop.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of OTC names that
don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't mean that against anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they have accountants that are
doing their books, but they're not really
[SPEAKER_00]: securities law accountants.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, audited financials.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think also, like, there's still a
lot of, like, uncertainty in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: accounting standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's there's no consistency in the
reporting.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have seen various earnings
reports coming out with issues about
[SPEAKER_00]: valuing the biological assets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's become a real issue is how do
you value these biological assets?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you've had to destroy a crop or
throw out a harvest, how do you recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: that on the books?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they haven't dealt with that
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know we've seen a lot of situations
come up with men who have had accounting
[SPEAKER_00]: issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, they're like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to figure out if we've got a
Canadian stock that we're trying to then
[SPEAKER_00]: give to our employees who are American,
how do we calculate that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that's not necessarily
been done before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's all new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's not that many American
companies who have gone public in Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: who are now trying to give their American
employees Canadian stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not a simple process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they, you know, come under fire for
things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, to be fair, it's it's new
territory.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not easy to figure out how do you
actually calculate all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there are certain metrics that
investors, especially when the
[SPEAKER_04]: institutions step in, that will be
relevant, that will move the stocks,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the yields and certain things
that are really going to be more
[SPEAKER_04]: important, perhaps than the revenue or the
EBITDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The price will like the cash cost per
gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, all that kind of and the efficiency
and how efficient the operational
[SPEAKER_04]: efficiency, any metrics related to that
may move stocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we're going to see a lot of,
you know, this year, it's all going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: record revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every quarter is going to be record
revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all we're going to hear for a
year is record revenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'd hope so, because they're making
all these.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because it's brand new dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's new markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's going to be a while before we
get an apples to apples quarter to where
[SPEAKER_00]: we can tell, are they really operating
well?
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then one thing to look at,
I can't remember which company,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they had a pretty sizable accounts
receivable balance.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do you have an AR balance?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that supporting your sales number?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I there's a lot of things to
scratch my head on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think Canopy Growth had a harvest
that they had to destroy, but they were
[SPEAKER_00]: criticized on how they recognize that in
their earnings.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Counting talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's let's talk about the international
market, because we you kind of touched
[SPEAKER_00]: base on that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really been discussed quite a
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think mostly with Afria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you guys have followed
that drama.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cannabis industry, so there's always
drama.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there was a lot of controversy with
that company over its international
[SPEAKER_00]: acquisitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of these
acquisitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, who knows what's going to happen
in these countries?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's still a real crap shoe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Still the Wild West, the wild,
wild west.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, we've started to look at the
international licenses just to see what's
[SPEAKER_03]: out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in a lot of countries, we're actually
seeing a structure set up in places like
[SPEAKER_03]: Denmark and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Colombia has quite a few licenses for
cultivation and Australia, New Zealand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's definitely starting to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's interesting, we're talking
about this earlier, is how each country
[SPEAKER_03]: decides to do things like delivery and
sales.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like here in the United States,
you need a dispensary or retail,
[SPEAKER_03]: you need a store, you need a business,
you need a license for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You go up to Canada, where the population
density is a lot less.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can just go through the mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just you get it in the mail.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whereas in Europe, you can often buy
it in pharmacies.
[SPEAKER_03]: In some cases, insurance will will cover
it as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Health insurance.
[SPEAKER_03]: So very different models.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're very intrigued to see how this
plays out.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we think it's going to be about wild,
wild west, but definitely wild,
[SPEAKER_03]: wild continents there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of expectation that
you're going to be able to set up
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation shops in Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And export here to the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always going to be so much
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that's a long way down,
if it ever even happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of it goes back to the
federal prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're we're talking about,
you know, maybe companies having an
[SPEAKER_01]: operation in one state, two states,
five states.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rest of the world is like looking at
this global market that as of right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not going to be a part of and we're
not going to be a part of anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in that whole a free deal,
that can really surprise me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sold their Florida operation to get
the money to buy the international
[SPEAKER_00]: Caribbean stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Florida people, the money
that that they got, they just flipped
[SPEAKER_00]: those properties and turned around and
sold them and made a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just and now a free has come under a
short attack.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's kind of an interesting
thing, too, that we've seen in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like more in the cannabis industry
that I've seen in other industries with
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole short attack, where you've got
short sellers that find a company and they
[SPEAKER_00]: start writing tons of negative reports
about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if it's true or not, you know,
the negative reports set the stock down,
[SPEAKER_00]: it goes spiraling down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's true or not, it's hard to
say.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've seen a lot of that happen in
this in this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we'll probably continue to see
more of that as well, because I still
[SPEAKER_04]: think there's plenty of characters,
still bad actors that are still remaining.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that there's going to be a
plethora of just irregularities,
[SPEAKER_04]: litigation, all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we watched the licensing happen,
even in the states where they restrict the
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses, it sort of goes through this
phase of just like groups.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's forming, storming, performing and
norming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you see all those laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: They should be.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see that where there's always a
lawsuit from the people who lost the
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses and then people wind up not doing
a thing, not putting one seed in the
[SPEAKER_03]: ground, but they find a willing buyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Aaron got the license.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to buy it from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the transaction happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think we're still going to see more
of this, especially as more states come
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think a lot of regulators are
learning from other states and have tried
[SPEAKER_03]: to course correct and make sure that they
come up with a better set of regulations
[SPEAKER_03]: so that they don't get necessarily tag
with some of the same problems that the
[SPEAKER_03]: last state that went through licensure
did.
[SPEAKER_03]: So maybe to shorten the storming part,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're certainly starting to pardon the
pun, weed out a lot of the bad players.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know like five or six years ago when I
was writing about these companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: there were so many dodgy people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were so sketchy and so shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was it was easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was low hanging fruit for me as a
journalist, because all I had to do was go
[SPEAKER_00]: to a filing and see that, you know,
the husband sold the wife all the stock
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're housed in their
brother-in-law's office park that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: giving five thousand dollars a month for
rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was all so easy to just look at and
go, this is so shady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like now that because we have
some of these MSOs that are polished and
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate, that it's shaken those people
down to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not just winning off of having
the word cannabis in the company title
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're having to really prove themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're they're truly a penny stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that that's, you know,
certainly we're starting to see that
[SPEAKER_00]: maturation of the market where we're
getting rid of those some of those shady
[SPEAKER_04]: people like the big guys come in like big
pharma, big alcohol, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's just going to be totally
cleaned up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, and I think with the multistate
operators, you know, as they go into
[SPEAKER_03]: different states, it's a lot like other
companies decades ago when they'd go
[SPEAKER_03]: international.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what international going international
men or in this case, crossing state lines
[SPEAKER_03]: is you may be exporting people,
brands, expertise.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really what's allowing Columbia
Care to move from, let's say, New York
[SPEAKER_03]: into other states like New Jersey or
Virginia, because they've got a track
[SPEAKER_03]: record.
[SPEAKER_03]: They've got people that they can then move
around and say, we're going to put you in
[SPEAKER_03]: charge of Texas.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we're going to see more of
that as they just get better and better
[SPEAKER_03]: what they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think their metrics in terms of,
you know, cost per gram, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_03]: is just going to be way better.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from a financial standpoint,
that'll be a better bet or investment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And multistate is good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, we're also seeing a
little pushback against it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the world of competitive
applications, you know, and some of these
[SPEAKER_01]: like sexy cities around Los Angeles,
MedMen wasn't selected in West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to close down their West
Hollywood location at the end of March.
[SPEAKER_01]: MedMen wasn't selected in Santa Monica for
their little beach front location.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: But an out-of-state operator.
[SPEAKER_01]: How were they able to operate?
[SPEAKER_00]: That West Hollywood thing is a very weird
situation because I was given a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: city council's discussions about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now West Hollywood is going to have
no dispensaries because the existing
[SPEAKER_00]: players were all all the exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it wasn't just MedMen.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the existing dispensaries in West
Hollywood were rejected for dispensaries
[SPEAKER_00]: that they might not even be able to open
right away because they had no experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so West Hollywood may have no
dispensaries for several months because
[SPEAKER_00]: the city council made that choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was very strange.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_01]: We scored number one in West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think West Hollywood got that one
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the pushback.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a question for these like
multistate operators right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just barging into people's
communities saying, we make billions of
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're publicly funded in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're getting a little blowback from
cities and cities are saying, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in the driver's seat here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to do for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, my message to the big
guys, the multistate operators,
[SPEAKER_01]: is what are you doing to be a good
corporate citizen?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you write these applications
like you're writing to your investors on
[SPEAKER_01]: how much money you're going to make,
your rate of returns, how great you are at
[SPEAKER_01]: making hundreds of millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cities don't care about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to know what are you going to do
for that neighborhood?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to do about local
hiring?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I think the big guys are
kind of tone deaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're running into roadblocks
getting into these new sexy markets where
[SPEAKER_01]: the local regulators are in the driver's
seat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to underscore that, where that really
happened was in Arkansas, of all places,
[SPEAKER_03]: where none of the multistate operators got
a license.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we looked at all the scores,
the big name companies were way at the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could see the scores where they
lost out on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes it was sort of, what are you
doing for the community?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's usually a community or,
you know, how are you going to help the
[SPEAKER_03]: local state or town?
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's often where they were
probably scored down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, but there's a whole state,
you know, jumping in there and saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick question on this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in New York when five licenses are
issued and then immediately they're
[SPEAKER_02]: flipped, are there any states that write
clauses that say you can't flip,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you, when you can't flip within a
certain period of time?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I, well, this is your area.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the one thing I can think of in some
states is that you actually can't sell the
[SPEAKER_03]: license right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know like even in New York when that one
that MenMen got, they weren't able to
[SPEAKER_03]: actually buy it.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was like a step that had to happen
intermittently or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some places really do seem to restrict
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I see my time to my colleague here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think unless there's like a financial
distress, because it wasn't Bloomfield
[SPEAKER_04]: that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know about that deal, but most of
these states, you know, they require a new
[SPEAKER_01]: application or they specifically change
the rules to allow for changes of
[SPEAKER_01]: ownership for the longest time in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wouldn't allow like changes of
ownership until the legislature stepped in
[SPEAKER_01]: and created a pathway to it in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you had a change of
ownership, of your business, you had to do
[SPEAKER_01]: like a brand new application.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've loosened those rules up a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, at the local level is where
they're really like tightening it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a number of small cities around
Los Angeles that have said, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: the folks who apply on paper, those are
the folks who get the license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're changing ownership
structure, then you forfeit the license.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is, you know, there's creative
lawyers out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it says no change of ownership,
they'll put a management company there and
[SPEAKER_01]: run it like the hotels do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one way or another, you know,
the folks who want to buy their way in,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to find some way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're doing that in Ontario right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the folks who were selected in that
lottery out of 2,500 applicants,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they can't sell their license to
somebody.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I imagine, you know, all of the lawyers
at Dentons or whatever law firm they're
[SPEAKER_01]: using, they're coming up with whatever
creative solution to let the big money
[SPEAKER_01]: guys multi-state operators, multi-province
operators, multi-country operators figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out a way to get control of those
licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they keep some of the old company
within the new company in the board or in
[SPEAKER_00]: the C-suite so that it looks like we still
have the residents in the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And know that early days New Jersey,
the, what was it, the green dispensary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not cura leaf, but they're one of the
original three that was, they were from
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado and it was the father and the son
team.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, you know, one of them had to
move to New Jersey in order to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they they're still in business,
but they, yeah, it was kind of an odd
[SPEAKER_00]: situation that I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I went to the dispensary as a
wonderful, wonderful operation,
[SPEAKER_00]: really nice, but because they had the
experience from Colorado, they had already
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing it for a couple of years in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to really easily transition
to New Jersey, but one of them had to live
[SPEAKER_00]: in New Jersey and that was apparently an
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't imagine why you wouldn't want to
live in New Jersey and not Colorado.
