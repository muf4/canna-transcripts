[SPEAKER_02]: I mentioned to you, we have a few friends
out here from Denmark, a couple friends
[SPEAKER_02]: down from Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: More and more, it seems the world is
recognizing, thankfully, the California
[SPEAKER_02]: really is the epicenter in many respects,
at least with respect to the craft,
[SPEAKER_02]: as well as the culture, and I definitely
would say the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you see that playing out as far as
tourism, as far as people coming here,
[SPEAKER_02]: and this essentially being the Holy Land,
for lack of a better term, when it comes
[SPEAKER_02]: to the industry of this cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh man, I think it has an unbelievable
potential, because California is already
[SPEAKER_01]: clocking over a billion in tourist money,
so it's already a global tourist
[SPEAKER_01]: destination, and all over California,
it's not just one spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: San Francisco has an ungodly amount of
people that want to come and see the
[SPEAKER_01]: beauty of San Francisco, the culture of
San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have people that are going to Southern
California to do the Hollywood experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that is unbelievably populated with
people from every part of the earth coming
[SPEAKER_01]: into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have these global attractions,
you get into Napa area, the wine county,
[SPEAKER_01]: same thing, global attraction,
up around from Humboldt County,
[SPEAKER_01]: Redwoods, global attraction, and then all
of a sudden, you put cannabis in there,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it doesn't mean that the people all
have to come here to get high,
[SPEAKER_01]: it just means that they get a window into
a world that they heard about,
[SPEAKER_01]: but never could see, and it starts to
allow people, tourists, to be able to come
[SPEAKER_01]: to regions where you had people living,
like where we are in Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_01]: to use that specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of the most beautiful region in the
world.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tell people, being from the Bay Area,
the most beautiful part of California,
[SPEAKER_02]: your point, is north of San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all the way up to Crescent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt's stunning, and what you find is
you find all these individuals that form
[SPEAKER_01]: this really interesting relationship with
their property.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they always highlighted all the grows
that were contaminated facilities,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in every population, you're going to
have outliers that are dirty.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of people were really pretty
good land stewards, and built a really
[SPEAKER_01]: nice relationship with the land they lived
on and in the region.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that does, it allows people to
come up and see what's it like to live in
[SPEAKER_01]: the country where you have an industry
that was hidden that can now be seen,
[SPEAKER_01]: and what are the people like, and because
cannabis people are eclectic and
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting generally, it allows the
tourists to really have a different type
[SPEAKER_01]: of connection with the people,
and the people, for the first time,
[SPEAKER_01]: have to be open about what they do,
and they know that they need to be open so
[SPEAKER_01]: they can get their products out in the
world, and they're also no longer afraid
[SPEAKER_01]: of getting arrested so they can actually
laugh and feel good about what they've
[SPEAKER_01]: done with the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: The shoulders aren't as tense,
and all of a sudden, you've got some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the realest human beings, and they're the
opposite of a lot of the corporate,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the whole thing with cannabis was
that you were basically an independent
[SPEAKER_01]: producer that could function in all
aspects on your own with very little
[SPEAKER_01]: oversight, very little accountability to
others, and as long as you made enough
[SPEAKER_01]: money, you had time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you live this unbelievable life that
only the mega-wealthy really live,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't, and no one else has
time, and so all the cultivators had time,
[SPEAKER_01]: which gave them time to develop
personalities and eclectic hobbies and
[SPEAKER_01]: things, and it makes it interesting
because it's like going to a circus,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's so many little facets that are
unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: To me, that's the growing community,
where everybody is really a unique
[SPEAKER_01]: character in a play.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have to homogenize because
they didn't have to fit in, and when the
[SPEAKER_01]: tourists meet the people, they really
enjoy the company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I watch it, I go, when farmers meet
customers, it is a really, real solid,
[SPEAKER_01]: cool thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll have all these facilities
that people get to check out, product
[SPEAKER_01]: assortments will be there, people will be
able to come in and experience cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: and bath bombs, so you take your wife and
go hiking, and she's like, I'd love to
[SPEAKER_01]: take a cannabis bath bomb, so she feels
wonderful.
[SPEAKER_01]: She goes, wow, that's how I consume
cannabis, through the skin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your grandmother uses it on her feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your brother only likes to take a candy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're smoking flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're able to use cannabis in all these
ways that are readily available,
[SPEAKER_01]: accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tourists from all over the world want to
experience it, and if you make it
[SPEAKER_01]: pleasant, and you give them all the
different choices, and you allow them to
[SPEAKER_01]: make the choices, then they get to
experience cannabis in some of the most
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful regions in the world,
and it allows them to be able to relax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I see with most of the tourists
is that they're overworked in their tech
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people are doing data entry,
tech, very computer-driven work,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're frozen in a thing,
and you get them out in the country,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you get them into cannabis-growing
regions, and you got yourself an
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible experience, different than
wine, because wine, even though the
[SPEAKER_01]: facilities are gorgeous, and wine is an
incredible substance, you have a different
[SPEAKER_01]: impact from wine in terms of, it's a
depressant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is, 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a drug, it's a drug, and so I don't
knock the wine or the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind what the grapes do to the soil,
but that's a whole other subject,
[SPEAKER_02]: too, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a thing, and what chemicals
can be used, but ultimately, the grape
[SPEAKER_01]: industry does some unbelievable work on
visual beauty, and satisfying the
[SPEAKER_01]: individual's experience visiting that
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really where we model cannabis,
in a sense, is that we realize that people
[SPEAKER_01]: want good escapism, and cannabis provides
it, and it doesn't have to be necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: in a psychoactive way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the people that produced it provide
escapism to them because they're very
[SPEAKER_01]: unique individuals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd be like going back into Appalachia
and talking to the moonshine runners,
[SPEAKER_01]: and saying, hey, let me hop in your car
and go drift around, because moonshine
[SPEAKER_01]: turned into NASCAR.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it is, you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think of some of the growers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a huge fan of you guys, but even the
family over at Hidden Prairie,
[SPEAKER_02]: or Eeyore River, I mean, to your point,
everyone is so unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is eclectic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've done some world travels.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can attest, just like I've been to
Australia, I've been to South America,
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been across Europe.
[SPEAKER_02]: The culture, it's uniform.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so interesting because the religious
beliefs might shift, or the language might
[SPEAKER_02]: shift, or certain elements of the
ideology.
[SPEAKER_02]: But overall, it is good vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy, because that's kind of like
almost an unofficial mantra of our
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as long as it's good vibes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But speaking specifically about use,
I don't know if people know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: you really remind me, Kevin, and this is
going back to being a California guy,
[SPEAKER_02]: almost like the Huel Hauser of this
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this guy, Huel Hauser, originally from
Tennessee, he had come out and did a
[SPEAKER_02]: series called California Gold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nobody embraced, I mean, this guy really,
he knew California better than most native
[SPEAKER_02]: Californians.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I love about you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, coming from the East Coast,
coming, interesting story.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a whole other show.
[SPEAKER_02]: But your background coming here,
you have so embraced not just California,
[SPEAKER_02]: not just this industry, but the whole
aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the things you're doing with
Humboldt, specifically on to your point,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Chamber of Commerce and the stuff to
get the tourism and breathe some much
[SPEAKER_02]: needed life into that area, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You tie it all together because prior
cannabis stigmatized a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: legitimate industries, even though they
benefited from it, but publicly causing
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now with that stigma removed,
you're able to really start to be honest
[SPEAKER_01]: with each other as business owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can all start to figure out how do
you benefit each other in a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits the region so that you have a
longevity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we all live there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not colonialism.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not resources leave, money leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hopefully resources are rebuilt,
improved, and capital remains so that you
[SPEAKER_01]: end up having better quality community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just dumb about it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: The new billboards that are going up,
Laura from the Southern Humboldt Visitors
[SPEAKER_01]: Bureau, they put together this incredible
campaign with some of the other business
[SPEAKER_01]: owners, Elevate the Magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have some phenomenal billboards
that are going up that are going to talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about America's cannabis heartlands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have publications like the North
Coast Journal that are putting out the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary guides and they're helping with
the picture, the visual.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're helping shape the tone,
but in a way that really reflects the
[SPEAKER_01]: region, not because they're trying to be
your distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're trying to highlight it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's this beautiful internal
development versus an external force to
[SPEAKER_01]: drive a result.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about really getting the people to be
able to see what's happening and help them
[SPEAKER_01]: with the things they need, which are
things that they're opposite of what
[SPEAKER_01]: they've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's really good at hiding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the shadows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a big skill set.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody thinks that's easy, but it's
hard, just like it's hard to be well known
[SPEAKER_01]: and to have the community say,
OK, we'll all agree that we don't need to
[SPEAKER_01]: be shamed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can advertise it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have quality advertising and then
we can have cannabis people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: coming to see cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we steer them into the hotels?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we steer them into vacation
packages that are going to be fun for
[SPEAKER_01]: them, that are going to reflect Humboldt
County's lifestyle, which is unbelievably
[SPEAKER_01]: diverse from a heavy coast, pound and
surf, beautiful rivers, stunning plains,
[SPEAKER_01]: gorgeous mountains.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything you want is there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a night and day difference from
Southern California or even Stetson Beach,
[SPEAKER_02]: quite honestly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody on Stetson Beach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many people out in Petrolia.
[SPEAKER_01]: No people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a privilege to walk on the
beach with nobody on the beach,
[SPEAKER_01]: except you and your friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, what is unreal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and even when you guys throw a party
and again, this is in your backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: But talking about northern nights or
reggae on the river.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're tapping into the Gen Y,
the Z generation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I love how even when they come up,
you guys are like, hey, we're on the
[SPEAKER_02]: river.
[SPEAKER_02]: No glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all about eco.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the water stations like everything
that that goes on in Humboldt is still
[SPEAKER_02]: respecting what Humboldt was always about
all the way back to which we've discussed
[SPEAKER_02]: before.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was it wasn't the hippie movement as
much as it was the forestry.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you've talked about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I love the history lesson that you
give when people come up there and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: you guys got it all wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, this is what really happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was the evolution of of how cannabis
came to be in this this area of the
[SPEAKER_02]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people are passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the kids are today are,
too, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, the problem is that, you know,
what happens is you get educated how to
[SPEAKER_01]: behave by the world around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's in a disposable world and
very transient, fast paced, no need to
[SPEAKER_01]: make connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you come up to a smaller town,
you go out on the coast, you go into the
[SPEAKER_01]: into a small neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, people are more watchful
of each other because you learn to rely on
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it starts to humanize people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why, you know, small town
Americana is in your small town anywhere
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world is always so rich because you
get to see people at their at their finest
[SPEAKER_01]: because their desire to be good is that
it's their desire to be good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no ulterior motive.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you can get people into the
country and you can you can let them enjoy
[SPEAKER_01]: being in a clean environment and they
realize that that that's part of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we don't throw trash on the ground.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people start to really, you know,
slow down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they put the phone down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They might actually talk to you in person
instead of text you while they're standing
[SPEAKER_01]: next to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's important because it starts to
get you back on a more grounded level so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you can then return to your busy,
hectic life living in the city that looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like someone dumped a trash can over the
top of the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and deal with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, you can go to the
country, go to the ocean and find some
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you go there, you don't bring the
bad habits of the city.
[SPEAKER_01]: You bring the good habits, which is
understanding that things move,
[SPEAKER_01]: but also understanding that you don't have
to move in tune with it the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked about just now touched on,
but maybe getting a little bit more into
[SPEAKER_02]: one log.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is something where people
that aren't from California aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar or those that haven't been here
for decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of special when you come up one
on one.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people don't know this.
[SPEAKER_02]: You ask someone that's from San Diego,
L.A., San Francisco, Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you ever knew there to be a stop sign
or a single lane on one on one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they go, what are you crazy?
[SPEAKER_02]: This this is the biggest freeway runs
through our state.
[SPEAKER_02]: This kid, you go to a little town called
Garberville and you will find that stop
[SPEAKER_02]: sign.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will find that crosswalk across one on
one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what amazed me again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing up in Marin County, being a kid
from the Bay, that people don't know just
[SPEAKER_02]: how sacred and special it is when you're
coming up into the proper triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you guys are right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got one log.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's the first thing I see when
I come into town.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never mind the huge tree that that it was
named after.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So tell me a little bit about what you
guys are doing there and what you have in
[SPEAKER_02]: the works.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you have some plans as far as
expanding on the space you have in 2019 as
[SPEAKER_02]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the really fortunate though,
the one log site right on the one on one
[SPEAKER_01]: is a historic tourist destination with
coffee shop, tourist things, redwood
[SPEAKER_01]: carvings, a lot of cool old school big
redwood carvings.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it used to have a lot of salmon that
was sold out of there back in the day when
[SPEAKER_01]: the salmon was really hot in the in the
river before we had the droughts and some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the offshore issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the salmon business was hot at the
spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people from all over would be driving
down one on one.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd pull in.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a beautiful grove, stunning
redwoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the one log itself is a giant one log
redwood tree that they used to drive
[SPEAKER_01]: around the country on the back of a truck
in the 50s.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it took six months to carve out with
chisels.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they built a house inside it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can actually walk around inside
the log like it's a house.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a crazy story.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and my partners grabbed this
facility and we put a dispensary in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: the nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a new extraction, a giant,
a giant extraction facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all these things are tucked away.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see the store when you roll up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the signage.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everything else is completely woven
into these groves so that you never really
[SPEAKER_01]: think you're in an industrial area at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, you walk in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I walked in and I was like, well,
you have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole building is a nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole the whole basement is a nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is stuff I got all blown up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you're on five acres.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's something I think we
mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: With three-eighths of a mile of
riverfront.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got the Northern Nights that you
do in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Reggae on the River is right next
door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Northern Nights is my partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're the Northern Nights crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great guys too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they're great guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then High Times is next door,
which is the old Reggae site.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we catch some of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're doing right now is we're
putting in the development of some form of
[SPEAKER_01]: visitor center so that what we have an
ability to do is start to really get the
[SPEAKER_01]: tourists to come into the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then help them understand where to go
because you need, what do you do when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're out in the middle of nowhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no real directories.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's pamphlets and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you need is more comprehensive
and packages.
[SPEAKER_01]: And river guides and hikes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the ecotourism component at Humboldt
just has to be really highlighted because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of hard to know what to do
without having some form of help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we will be able to put in all the
farmer's gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll be able to sell farmer's clothes
and all the branding labels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let the people come in and pick this
stuff up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can have music events in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can have farmer events.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be able to put the Golden Tarp event
back out on it, which is the cover.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't do it this year because we
didn't have an ability legally to do it
[SPEAKER_01]: without it being an estate fairground.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a year of transition and
fairness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you guys are patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just paused the cup.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll do it again in the back of the
facility next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have this ability to hold all these
really killer events.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it allows people to come off the
highway and pull in the parking lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have ADA bathrooms, which is
crucial because it allows you to catch a
[SPEAKER_01]: population of everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a food.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a small restaurant.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a gift shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all Humboldt County-centric.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it lets people come in and feel like
they're in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we built the dispensary,
one of the partners, Jonah, was a master
[SPEAKER_01]: bricklayer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Jonah's a great guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he glued like 14,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: He glued and shot 14,000 hand-cut redwood
blocks to the wall to make it look like
[SPEAKER_01]: you're inside a lock.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's visually wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully the guys can dub in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm coming up on Monday.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll send them a picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't understand this until you
actually go there and see it for yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's trippy looking, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you know you're in the redwoods,
but it has modern amenities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what it does is it lets people that
want to escape their digital life and be
[SPEAKER_01]: green, but they can still use the phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can still have normal things that
they need to function in the way they've
[SPEAKER_01]: built their world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they can get out of that world and go
enjoy the river and enjoy the grandfather
[SPEAKER_01]: tree next door to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been massive trees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in Richardson Grove, which is some
of the most beautiful region in the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really nice to be able to be so
open.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I didn't mind being private.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's what I knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to say, yeah, you guys grew up
on the hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've been private for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I got to tell you, I didn't mind that
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I love the new renaissance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I call it a renaissance all the time
because it's an awakening, which is what a
[SPEAKER_01]: renaissance is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, for sure, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the first time, the mainstream can
touch cultivators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Businesses can benefit from the new
tourists that will come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humboldt's going through some hard times.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact that you're able to start
having a California that's so big that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not that many places left that
aren't that crowded.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Humboldt's one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just a trip up the 101.
[SPEAKER_01]: Greg Foster did an incredible job bringing
in airline.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have direct flights to L.A.,
direct flights to Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was up at Humboldt County Grove
Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my friends was like, I'm doing a
direct flight to L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they call it the Investor Express.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have one in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: They used to have the Frisco one every
day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now they've got Frisco, L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: and Denver every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can go from Humboldt to Colorado,
the East Coast in a single hop.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't got to go to another hub airport
and jump out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go to L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an hour and a half to L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: 35, 40 minutes of Frisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of a sudden, man, people are
coming in to visit and hang out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just I hope I live long enough to be
able to see where how this will change,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it'll be like Napa and the wine
region where at one time it was like this
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it became so developed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Napa was.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got my mom moved up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, parents divorced as young or
long story short.
[SPEAKER_02]: My mom moved up there off Silverado.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when Napa wasn't cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't know downtown Napa was was
pretty ratcheted.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the kids say, it was kind of tired.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then all of a sudden, to your point,
Napa and Yorkville.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, there's Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's come a long way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to see that in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love to see it in Garberville.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, all the way up the corridor to
Fortuna, Eureka.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bottom line is you have these
beautiful northern regions that are
[SPEAKER_01]: underpopulated and they'll never be
overpopulated because they're not built
[SPEAKER_01]: for the flat ground sprawl for the big
city.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they're definitely designed for people
to escape the sprawl and to go enjoy
[SPEAKER_01]: themselves and meet nice people,
smoke some really good grass and see some
[SPEAKER_01]: visual beauty.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just, you know, you can't you can't
you can't film it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't wait to come back up.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I can't wait to see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be great.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I stopped by, it was supposed to be a
half an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ended up together.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to say it was about four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know, it's really funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like there's better signal and reception
up there than there is here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the one place where I really
didn't need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, dude, this is I've been
wanting it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know me like I travel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my 20th.
[SPEAKER_02]: 28 show this year between domestic and
international.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, like that's a weird thing,
dude, like hanging out, talking to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just humble feels like home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's just this is a place I'd love to
come home to kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I work so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're a smart guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got lucky that I was so fortunate to
move there in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just never want to leave.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you work really hard to
force whatever you possibly can positive
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that you're able to enjoy that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a gift, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's up, boys?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we're on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
