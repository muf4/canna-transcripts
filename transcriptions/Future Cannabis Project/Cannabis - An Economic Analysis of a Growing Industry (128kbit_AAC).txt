[SPEAKER_04]: It's really exciting to be here in
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: As Tripp mentioned earlier, California has
always been at the forefront of marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: reform, passed Proposition 215 almost 20
years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's activists in the room.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been doing this for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's activists in the room who have
been doing it much longer than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we're standing here in a world
that is completely different than 20 years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not only do we have medical cannabis in 23
states and the District of Columbia,
[SPEAKER_04]: we also have adult use markets emerging in
Colorado, Washington, Oregon, soon Alaska,
[SPEAKER_04]: and D.C.
[SPEAKER_04]: Soon enough, here in California,
it's ours to lose, 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: But these markets are also different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every regulatory framework and structure
is different than the one before it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes, especially on the East
Coast, the regulations seem crazier than
[SPEAKER_04]: the one that came before it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's also little micro-economies
within each state, especially a huge state
[SPEAKER_04]: like California, where Los Angeles is
vastly different than San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we have assembled a great panel
from states across the country and also
[SPEAKER_04]: national players to kind of give a look
from their perspective at the different
[SPEAKER_04]: markets and the economic opportunities.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because even in these heavily regulated
markets, like New York, Illinois,
[SPEAKER_04]: there are opportunities.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to start with Jill,
actually I'll just introduce the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: panel, Jill Lamoureux.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have an advisor with Botech and several
other hats.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have James Sladek with Bank
Corporation and Med West.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt Carnes with Green Wave Advisors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Erin Justice with Buds and Roses here in L
.A.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just told me your name and I made
you give me your card.
[SPEAKER_04]: John Caja with New Frontier.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll start with Jill, since you're
here to my right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Jill Lamoureux.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a former operator in Colorado
starting about 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have worn several hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of them focus on regulatory
analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of wanted to talk a little bit
about how regulation actually drives all
[SPEAKER_00]: of these different markets we're going to
be talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at new states,
one of the things I help people do is
[SPEAKER_00]: apply in the onboarding states and come up
with pro formas and financials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the first thing that I do when making
projections for a state is go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations and say, what do these say
about the potential market size?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just kind of wanted to talk about
a couple of the major inputs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you guys in California have the
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had a lot of people ask me,
oh, have you read the regulations?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, you don't have regulations
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have about another 500, 600 pages
coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully there will be the
opportunity to provide a lot of input into
[SPEAKER_00]: that process for those of you who are here
on the ground and advocates and looking to
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that this market evolves the way
that you can capitalize on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the major drivers, one of the
first things we look at, the economics
[SPEAKER_00]: start with the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the first things we look at is
what's the condition list?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not going to change here in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably has the best condition list in
the country other than maybe Massachusetts
[SPEAKER_00]: and Maryland and a few states where they
let doctors prescribe for pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: anything they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: But chronic pain and PTSD are the two
indicators we look at first.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90% of patients report chronic pain is why
they're using medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is crucial in a good market for that
to be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing with patients is how hard
is it to obtain a card?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there very few doctors because there's
a lot of pressure on them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there a lot of doctors?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it expensive?
[SPEAKER_00]: In Illinois, you have to be fingerprinted
as a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that drives our estimate of patient
bases way, way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because not many people want to subject
themselves to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talked a little bit about the
environment for the doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then the next thing is what is it going
to cost operators to grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what regulations really impact
operators?
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant limits, canopy limits really dictate
how a market is.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they restrict the size of an operation,
you're cutting down on economies of scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Washington, for example, where they
have plant canopies, you have operators
[SPEAKER_00]: going, well, can I stack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I go vertical?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I have three tiers?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always going to be that
question, how limited is my actual
[SPEAKER_00]: potential growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing, cannabinoid limits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we see in Florida where you have to be
under .8% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can only have five brands and they
must be within 105% of this ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: That drives up costs significantly when
you have to fractionate and separate
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids and make sure that your
formulations are really on par with what
[SPEAKER_00]: the legislation says.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then limited licenses that,
I mean, for sure dictates the size of a
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there going to be competition or are
there only going to be 15 operators?
[SPEAKER_00]: If there's only Connecticut, for example,
there's four.
[SPEAKER_00]: If one of those operators fails,
great for the other operators,
[SPEAKER_00]: but are they scaled properly?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can they pick up the slack?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can four people with all that cap X on
them, the amount of investment they had to
[SPEAKER_00]: put into these grows was huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if they're not prepared for that or
they're not ready for the market to come
[SPEAKER_00]: out way slower than they anticipated,
it can really impact the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If nobody is supplying or producing or
marketing to create a patient base,
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be really, really terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the excise or VAT tax?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, in Washington, it was a
three tier system where it was 25% on top
[SPEAKER_00]: of 25% on top of 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've already looked at reworking
that because if the taxes are too high,
[SPEAKER_00]: you obviously can't compete with the black
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the quality assurance
requirements?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the testing requirements?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the compliance requirements?
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, it started out that there was
zero quality assurance items at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we have evolved, now you have to
have an industrial hygienist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to test every batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there batch limits?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does a lot size have to be five pounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Am I going to be testing every five pounds
or every 20 pounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is the, you know, what is the
number of tests I have to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a $25 potency test or is this a
$1,000 full slate of tests on every five
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Accounting and record keeping
requirements, you know, you wouldn't even
[SPEAKER_00]: think about this, but if they tell you you
have to store camera data for 90 days,
[SPEAKER_00]: your, you know, server and your computer
costs go way, way up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so even the simplest thing like that
on how long are we going to store these
[SPEAKER_00]: videos for is critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you're going through this mind
numbing regulatory process, you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at those little things and be like,
is this going to cost me money?
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the ones to fight for or
against.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the demand factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there purchase or possession
requirements?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there limited amounts that a patient
can buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: That really, really drives your budget as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, most recently,
Minnesota just had an article about how
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's still on the black market
because the cost is just too high there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when talking with regulators,
those are the kind of things that you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to pay attention to and be like,
if we drive the cost way, way,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have an established market here in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a set price.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the regulations drive that up too much,
they're going to force people back into
[SPEAKER_00]: the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my talk will be entirely different than
Jill's because I'm going to take a step
[SPEAKER_01]: back because this is the economics of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started in 2009 on the packaging side.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started a company called PopModels.com
and then kind of morphed into the medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: side and now I think arguably we're one of
the largest companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in multiple states.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I've seen the evolution of this
industry and now it's sort of at another
[SPEAKER_01]: crux.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tripp, if you were here for the last
session, Tripp was hitting on this and we
[SPEAKER_01]: say, you know, the next great American
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we talk about the economics of
that, there's, you know, the challenges
[SPEAKER_01]: and the opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Aaron is involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I must say, I preface this by
saying there's always the activism side
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're still putting people in jail
for possession of this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of what got me involved in
the activism side.
[SPEAKER_01]: A very quick story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was delivering, I met a elderly couple
and they were getting a cookie because
[SPEAKER_01]: this woman had osteoarthritis and she was
in pain in the city of San Diego where we
[SPEAKER_01]: lived.
[SPEAKER_01]: They decided to shut down all the
collectives, including that one where this
[SPEAKER_01]: elderly couple lived in an old folks home
and they came down.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't know about delivery service or
weed maps or weed maps.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just knew that this helped her more
than the Vicodin.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said the Vicodin made her a vegetable
and, you know, all the other side effects,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I know about now too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm having that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the city of San Diego and your
government thought better than them being
[SPEAKER_01]: able to have access to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they shut down that collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, you know what,
that's just not right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was like, they can't fight.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're 80 and infirm and I have a little
bit of money and a lot of gray hair so I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to fight for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got on the activism side and I'm on
boards, you know, with MPP and I think was
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the first people to get involved
with Aaron and the National Cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please, if you're not, if you're just
here for the economic side of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: please leave immediately because we're
still putting people in jail for this
[SPEAKER_01]: plant and harm reduction and what it's
doing to families.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we don't address that, we're really
building a house on a foundation of sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the preface speech and Susan
knows that very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then back to the business
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've heard the first inning of the
double header or seven game series or so
[SPEAKER_01]: forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt it's at the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I see from my level, from going
around the business interests and ARC view
[SPEAKER_01]: and the investors at the very beginning in
2009, 10 and 11, no one would invest.
[SPEAKER_01]: So of course we have a hard time getting
banking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course we have a hard time with the IRS
and 280E and a number of things and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing everything we can to resolve that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there was just really no mechanism to
do a real business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in California you have to be
non-profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other states you can be for-profit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're still dealing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our corporate structure is convoluted
because you're not allowed to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: profit in California from the sale of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So half the time you're dealing with
regulatory banks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had 10 banks in six years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are a multimillion dollar company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a 401K, we have health
insurance, we have corporate matching and
[SPEAKER_01]: then they go, oh yeah, you have no bank
account.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually getting my statements and
then putting cash in an envelope and we
[SPEAKER_01]: pay the tax payments for the employees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very hard to navigate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a great business model.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've gone out and you've raised your
friends and family capital and you're
[SPEAKER_01]: walking it out to the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, make sure that you budget 30% of
your time for issues that you would never
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: In any other business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't do that, you're going to
be in big trouble because when you get
[SPEAKER_01]: that letter from Wells Fargo saying,
yes, your dirty cannabis money is not
[SPEAKER_01]: welcome here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't have to give you a reason why
and they won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also been evicted twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wound up buying a building in San Diego
because we've been evicted twice and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: very costly to move.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that impacts the business and its
future.
[SPEAKER_01]: So going back to investment, the future,
we're seeing a very, very, very big
[SPEAKER_01]: morphing now of the level of
sophistication of investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the beginning of Arcview, we had 13
people sit around a conference table and
[SPEAKER_01]: we were going to put our own money in and
people came and pitched us a PowerPoint
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we said, who's interested in
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd raise our hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now Arcview has over 450, maybe 500
accredited investors.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are now coming from Europe,
seeing the opportunity here and investing
[SPEAKER_01]: in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Originally, they wouldn't touch the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Still a lot of them are like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will invest in software and security
and business services or containers or any
[SPEAKER_01]: one of a myriad of things that don't
actually touch the plant but are involved
[SPEAKER_01]: tangentially in the issue in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is now changing.
[SPEAKER_01]: More and more, I'd say easily 50% of the
investment companies, firms and
[SPEAKER_01]: individuals are now willing to invest in
grows, processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see a lot of action in the space that
we're in, the vape pen and concentrate
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we expect that to continue.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the risk profile originally,
very few investors were willing to touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you touch a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd much rather invest in a software
program that helps people attract
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a long time, the largest company in
the space was Weedmaps because they had
[SPEAKER_01]: what we call the first mover advantage and
they had a model that drew a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: traffic to dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to take a wild guess and say
they're about a $25 million company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in any multi-billion dollar industry,
if the biggest company in the space is $25
[SPEAKER_01]: million, $25 million in revenue,
it shows how fractionated it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just use a cannabis term.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so segmented, so small.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nobody is a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no Kleenex or Band-Aid in cannabis
as yet as much as brands like Bang or
[SPEAKER_01]: Dixie would like to think, oh,
everybody knows us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people in the industry, you go to
somebody in the general public and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: what's Dixie or what's Bang and they're
like, I have no freaking idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're seeing this with media.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of media ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saw a new media venture that Snoop Dogg
was launching this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so where is that target?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are people going after?
[SPEAKER_01]: What they're going after is the
millennials.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the biggest spender and the biggest
growth area in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've all been fighting over this core
group of stoners, the ones that love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we got in the arms race of the higher
and higher dosages because it was like an
[SPEAKER_01]: arms race.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you sold our bar, the chocolate,
we went from 60 to 120 to 180 in the
[SPEAKER_01]: milligram strength.
[SPEAKER_01]: And every time we did that, the sales
doubled of the higher milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, like how high was up when we
started seeing things in the thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, regulations are coming in with dose
specific type situations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe personally that that's where
the growth is in the so-called low dose,
[SPEAKER_01]: five, 10, 15 milligram products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to appeal because we've
all heard the horror stories of I OD'd on
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles and I've OD'd on edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have personal experience there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a lot of times people,
once they OD'd on edibles, they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: fuck that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm never going to eat that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't give me that cookie, like forget it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because, you know, if you had a bad
experience, then you're kind of out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the education side,
the low dosing side, that's going to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: in about another core group of about 30
million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we estimate that the hardcore stoner
market is about 10 million people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that the millennials that know
cannabis, maybe tried it, don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: know where to go, where to get the
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think that is about 30 million.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's three times bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you got like 25 companies all fighting
over that hardcore $10 million stoner
[SPEAKER_01]: market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd much rather target that 30 million
market that likes it, thinks that it could
[SPEAKER_01]: be cool, but don't know where to go,
what to get, what's the cool thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the next frontier I feel in the
economic growth of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's my five minutes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, James.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm a numbers guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never actually touched the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's not actually true.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I have never worked touching the
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I should say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm a numbers guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked, I started my career as an
auditor with Price Waterhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I then went to Wall Street.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to me, I really find this industry
of great intrigue from a numbers
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective, because we all know that this
is an industry that's really thriving and
[SPEAKER_03]: is going to continue to do so.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I really felt it was necessary to get
an understanding of the industry dynamics,
[SPEAKER_03]: what is unfolding, to help investors
understand the different dynamics that
[SPEAKER_03]: we're seeing in each state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I've done the last year,
I started Green Wave Advisors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm leveraging my prior work
experience to really get an understanding
[SPEAKER_03]: of what's going on state by state.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gone through the arduous task
single-handedly of going to each state,
[SPEAKER_03]: compiling data, and analyzing that data,
and trying to make sense of the industry
[SPEAKER_03]: so that investors are better informed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the day comes, they'll have
something for them to really give a better
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding of what's going on in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we've done is we went state by
state.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've defined what the addressable market
is on the medical marijuana side,
[SPEAKER_03]: determining how many people have cancer,
how many people have glaucoma,
[SPEAKER_03]: et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we determined what the potential
market size is.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are all broad-based assumptions
in certain categories.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we looked at Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: We looked at the penetration rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we applied this exercise state by
state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we drilled down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we, of course, focused in also on
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as we did that, we then also
determined what the recreational market
[SPEAKER_03]: would start to look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, that's a little bit more difficult to
assess, because we don't have the data.
[SPEAKER_03]: In every state, either the data is
provided by the state, or if you're
[SPEAKER_03]: proactive, you could approach the state,
in most cases, under the Freedom of
[SPEAKER_03]: Information Act, and get the information
that you need.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we compiled all this data.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now the medical market's a lot easier
to assess, because then you could kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: determine what average revenues are per
patient and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're developing all these metrics.
[SPEAKER_03]: The recreational side, we're still
continuing to evaluate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we size the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we put our estimates in a model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have full transparency as to how we
get to our numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we estimate by 2020, under the normal
trajectory of when we think states are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to legalize, we expect a market of
about $22 billion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you then say, OK, in that first
year, in 2020, if those remaining states
[SPEAKER_03]: are legalized, we easily get to $35
billion.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we kind of look at it and say,
OK, well then, what's going on in the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when we wrote our report last year,
we expected that the medical market would
[SPEAKER_03]: be disrupted by the recreational market in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the first state where we have both a
medical and a recreational market that's
[SPEAKER_03]: commercially available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we continue to see a decline in
fundamentals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we expect that same trend to happen in
other states that implement a recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: program where there's a medical program.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're going to open a business in a
medical facility of dispensary,
[SPEAKER_03]: just be cognizant and be mindful and hope
that there would be state protections that
[SPEAKER_03]: would enable you to have first dibs on a
recreational license like they did in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think they're doing that in some
other states as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then what we looked at from that,
we really also have an industry thesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we think is going to happen is
that the way the markets are right now,
[SPEAKER_03]: the medical and the recreational market
will combine into one substantially larger
[SPEAKER_03]: market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the medical market will
recalibrate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that will be defined.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be more precise dosage and so
forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And big pharma will probably come in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will be regulated by the FDA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really, what underscores that,
when I flew out here yesterday,
[SPEAKER_03]: it was a flight from hell.
[SPEAKER_03]: I missed my first flight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the silver lining was that I was in a
mill seat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was next to a physician and a
pharmaceutical rep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, wow, this is going to be a
really good conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is going to be a horrible flight.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to get a lot of good
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the doctor really kind of underscored
what we believe is that the medical
[SPEAKER_03]: community, the medical marijuana market is
only as good as the doctors are willing to
[SPEAKER_03]: recommend the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's right now the patients are having
to push the product rather than the
[SPEAKER_03]: doctor, I'm sorry, pull the product,
rather than the doctors push the product
[SPEAKER_03]: to their patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the doctor, the physician from
Michigan said basically, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have a lot of concerns about,
you know, prescribing marijuana because we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know what's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know if then, you know,
we tell one guy that it's good and then he
[SPEAKER_03]: brings five other people and they don't
really need it and so forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of concern.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then I was talking to the
pharmaceutical rep.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she said, you know, some of my
colleagues are really concerned about the
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmaceutical market, that they're going
to lose their jobs in a few years because
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana is going to replace a lot of
these pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I said, well, what do you sell?
[SPEAKER_03]: What drug do you sell?
[SPEAKER_03]: She said, I sell fertility drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, well, you don't have to worry
about your drug because as far as I know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's no cannabinoid that is going to
address that right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you never know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we're really striving to do is
to continue to evaluate all the
[SPEAKER_03]: information that's coming out of these
states.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like really, loosey and ethyl in
the chocolate factory.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's just more and more information
coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we are really focused in on is to
collect this data and really analyze it
[SPEAKER_03]: and make sense of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the time comes, you know,
you'll all be better informed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on a personal note, my mother,
I mean, a lot of this is really driven in
[SPEAKER_03]: memory of my mother.
[SPEAKER_03]: She had Crohn's disease and she was
miserable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there was nothing that was working.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she got sicker and sicker and sicker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she's just got more and more bitter
about the medical profession.
[SPEAKER_03]: Finally, we got something for her up in
Vermont that, you know, alleviated a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of the pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then about, I don't know, six months
later, she got diagnosed with lung cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And she went to chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was early stage, she had surgery.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, it was four years and we
just watched her kind of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: we knew the time was going to come.
[SPEAKER_03]: But during that time, we go to the doctor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think any of them said,
hey, why don't you try some marijuana?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because every time they offered her
something for her nausea, it was making
[SPEAKER_03]: her more sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanted to do the marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brother's a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: My sister likes to bake.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I live in Manhattan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I could get marijuana quicker than I can
get a pizza delivered.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there was really nothing we could do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then to add salt to injury four months
before she passed, she had kidney stones.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if nothing else, I needed the
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, that's my story.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my name is Aaron Justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: As Aaron said, I am the president of Buds
and Roses here in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also serve on the board of directors for
the National Cannabis Industry Association
[SPEAKER_02]: with Aaron as our director.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am on the steering committee of Glocka,
the Greater Los Angeles Collective
[SPEAKER_02]: Alliance, where our president is sitting
right there, Yami Bolano.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Glocka has been trying to regulate
cannabis dispensaries in Los Angeles for
[SPEAKER_02]: almost 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yami's been at the forefront of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I serve on other various committees,
the Patient Provider Network for Americans
[SPEAKER_02]: for Safe Access, do work with American
Herbal Products Association, and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those of you who don't know,
Los Angeles is by far the largest cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: marketplace city in the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: We currently have maybe 12 to 1,800
dispensaries in the city of LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: The big thing is that all of those
dispensaries are basically illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: About 100 of us have limited immunity from
prosecution.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're one of those dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I pulled some numbers from the Office
of Finance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And last year, there was 100 million
reported in sales in the city of LA.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is with all illegal dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the highest number, as I said,
besides some that have limited immunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that seems like a high number.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's higher than some states.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the truth is, I believe it is grossly
underreported.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost 1,000 dispensaries reported to the
Office of Finance and paid taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you do the math, that's only
100,000 per dispensary, which is not the
[SPEAKER_02]: average.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's much less than the average.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people looked into this, some tax
authorities, and found that the minority
[SPEAKER_02]: of these dispensaries paid the majority of
taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that makes perfect sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Los Angeles is similar to Washington,
DC, if you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: They always scream about taxation without
representation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's kind of the thing in Los
Angeles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we pay a 6% gross sales tax,
but we're illegal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what I think is that the only way
to really get this under control is to
[SPEAKER_02]: regulate it to a certain amount of
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been trying to do that for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to really audit these dispensaries and
to license them so that we can build a
[SPEAKER_02]: real system here that brings in,
instead of $5 million for the city,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is nothing in Los Angeles,
absolutely nothing, that it brings in 40
[SPEAKER_02]: to 60 million dollars in taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a number that our officials
will listen to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beyond that, there is the sales tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that if we were doing those
numbers, a billion dollars a year is what
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe the Los Angeles marketplace is
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we were doing those kind of numbers,
we would bring in $100 million in sales
[SPEAKER_02]: tax for the BOE, our Board of
Equalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last I talked to the BOE, they were
expecting to bring in $100 million in the
[SPEAKER_02]: entire state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that they have grossly
underestimated that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we're doing is what we've
always been trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just passed state, well, the governor
has almost signed state legislation here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we are trying to do is make the
dispensaries in LA that are under limited
[SPEAKER_02]: immunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not authorized to operate,
which means that this whole marketplace
[SPEAKER_02]: could disappear or be completely black
market if the city doesn't act to regulate
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, we are back in the trenches,
Glocka with ASA, most likely the union.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are trying to figure out for the city
how to make a path to state licensure and
[SPEAKER_02]: bring in the revenues that the city should
bring in and the state should bring in and
[SPEAKER_02]: basically finally have a regulated system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we have now in the largest city,
the largest retail market for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the country is a really poor regulatory
system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully our government will act to
reconcile this because the excuse was
[SPEAKER_02]: always we have to wait for the state,
let the state figure out and then we'll go
[SPEAKER_02]: from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So hopefully we can turn this into a real
marketplace that's regulated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you everyone and good afternoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is John Kaguia and I am the
Director of Industry Analytics with New
[SPEAKER_05]: Frontier.
[SPEAKER_05]: I should preface this by saying I'm
sitting in for Giada de Carcero,
[SPEAKER_05]: New Frontier CEO who unfortunately got
detained in Washington.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so even though I am nowhere near as
attractive, I will try and present our
[SPEAKER_05]: points here as well as she did,
as well as she would have.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for those of you who don't know us,
New Frontier is a big data company focused
[SPEAKER_05]: exclusively in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: We founded the company because we realized
that there was a dearth of good
[SPEAKER_05]: intelligence about what was happening in
the industry and how it was growing,
[SPEAKER_05]: how it was evolving and what market forces
were shipping its evolution.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we brought together a team of market
strategists, economists, statisticians,
[SPEAKER_05]: technologists and industry analysts and
have done nothing but pour through data
[SPEAKER_05]: from every state that has an active market
for the past year to really get our hands
[SPEAKER_05]: into a richer insight into some of the
factors that are shaping this market's
[SPEAKER_05]: growth and evolution.
[SPEAKER_05]: So to try and help contextualize just some
of the things that we have found in our
[SPEAKER_05]: research, I'm going to speak about five
different markets and just pick a point
[SPEAKER_05]: about each market that I think is
illustrative of some of the issues that
[SPEAKER_05]: are shaping this industry and I think that
we should consider as we look forward to
[SPEAKER_05]: the market's growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: So starting first with the national
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have spent a lot of time trying to get
our hands around how big this national
[SPEAKER_05]: market is and as everyone here has
mentioned already, this data is very,
[SPEAKER_05]: very difficult to come by but we have a
team of econometricians who applied a
[SPEAKER_05]: patented, very, very sophisticated model
to all of the data that we have and we
[SPEAKER_05]: project that this year the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: market will be slightly over $5 billion
and that will grow to over $17.5 billion
[SPEAKER_05]: by 2020.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things that we're particularly
focused on in the national market is we
[SPEAKER_05]: have this discussion about the U.S.
[SPEAKER_05]: market overall is what's going to happen
in 2016.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have a major election going to
happen in 2016 with three, well actually
[SPEAKER_05]: four candidates representing states that
will have initiatives on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_05]: John Kasich from Ohio, Bush and Rubio from
Florida and Bernie Sanders from Vermont.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to make the discussion about
marijuana more prominent and prevalent in
[SPEAKER_05]: a way that we haven't had in a generation
and I can assure you by the time we get to
[SPEAKER_05]: 2016, the idea of marijuana legalization,
marijuana's effects on society,
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana's, the effect of the prohibition
regime is going to be part of the public
[SPEAKER_05]: discourse in a way that we have not seen
yet and one of the potentially interesting
[SPEAKER_05]: things about that is that I think that
could prove to be a catalyst in reshaping
[SPEAKER_05]: the way we are approaching our federal
policy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You may have seen yesterday this article
that came out that the DEA is spending $60
[SPEAKER_05]: per plant to approve plants in Oregon and
people in Oregon are saying but it's
[SPEAKER_05]: legal, why are we spending that much money
to address illegal grows.
[SPEAKER_05]: The national debate that's going to happen
during the presidential election will be
[SPEAKER_05]: bringing these sorts of points about how
federal policy into light in a way that it
[SPEAKER_05]: hasn't done before and I think that could
be one of the major catalysts for change
[SPEAKER_05]: as we look at the years post 2016 and as
you heard, Tripp has bet MPP's CEO $1,000
[SPEAKER_05]: that there's going to be a federal pivot
in 2017, some say 2019, but it is coming
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's going to help really transform
this industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: A second market, Ohio.
[SPEAKER_05]: In political circles, there's a statement
that says as goes Ohio, so goes the
[SPEAKER_05]: nation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, as you may know, Ohio has a ballot
initiative on the books for this November.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some are controversial or quite
controversial for some in that one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: stipulations in it is that it limits the
number of licenses to 10 producers.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, despite the controversy
surrounding the way they have drafted the
[SPEAKER_05]: ballot initiative, we think it has a very
good likelihood of passing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a couple of things about Ohio that
make it unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's going to be the first state that has
legalized medical and recreational
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we forecast that by 2020,
the Ohio market is going to be generating
[SPEAKER_05]: $1.8 billion in sales.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's slightly lower than responsible
house projection of 2.2 billion,
[SPEAKER_05]: but either way, that's some very,
very serious money and I think one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: outcomes of Ohio is that we expect to see
other states that have a similar marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: use profile as Ohio to adopt similar
approaches to legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here we're looking at states like
Kentucky, like Tennessee, and the two
[SPEAKER_05]: Carolinas where they don't have medical
marijuana or if they do, it is a low THC,
[SPEAKER_05]: high CBD only program.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're much more likely to adopt the type
of regime where it is a group of investors
[SPEAKER_05]: who are designing a ballot initiative that
works to their advantage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Rather than the more egalitarian models
that we have seen in the marijuana
[SPEAKER_05]: programs adopted to date.
[SPEAKER_05]: Third, California, the powerhouse state.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think as Anne beautifully said,
LA is the biggest market in the country
[SPEAKER_05]: and California is far and away the biggest
state in the country.
[SPEAKER_05]: By our modeling, we estimate that
California's market this year alone,
[SPEAKER_05]: the medical market alone, will generate
$2.5 billion in revenue which is half of
[SPEAKER_05]: the national total.
[SPEAKER_05]: And by 2020, that will have grown to over
five and a half billion with expected
[SPEAKER_05]: legalization in 2016 and the market coming
online in 2020.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I know we'll have in 2018.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know we're gonna be discussing
California in a little more detail here,
[SPEAKER_05]: so I don't want to belabor the point,
but there's one aspect as I was reading
[SPEAKER_05]: the proposed legislation that really
caught my eye and that was on the creation
[SPEAKER_05]: of standards for organic marijuana
certification.
[SPEAKER_05]: California is gonna be the first state
that's attempted this and I think it will
[SPEAKER_05]: be a signal because if the program is
effective here, other states are gonna
[SPEAKER_05]: follow suit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as I was thinking about what models we
can look at as analogies for what might
[SPEAKER_05]: happen with organic marijuana standards,
I looked at American Spirit, the tobacco
[SPEAKER_05]: company that's now owned by R.J.
[SPEAKER_05]: Reynolds that offers natural and organic
cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now as we all know, cigarette consumption
has fallen fairly dramatically over the
[SPEAKER_05]: past 15 to 20 years and that is a
consistent and fairly strong trend.
[SPEAKER_05]: However, American Spirit sales have gone
from 260 million in 2009 to over 650
[SPEAKER_05]: million last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're doing very, very well.
[SPEAKER_05]: They now have 2% of a market and this for
a company which when it was founded,
[SPEAKER_05]: people thought was absolutely ridiculous
that who was going to smoke organic
[SPEAKER_05]: cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's huge demand for this and I think
it's illustrative of the sort of demand
[SPEAKER_05]: that we might expect to see for organic
cannabis and I think in California,
[SPEAKER_05]: the organic cannabis market, it could be a
small but potentially very, very lucrative
[SPEAKER_05]: segment of the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fourth, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oregon's a particularly exciting market
for a couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: One, right now it's set the lowest tax
rate in the country and there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: states which are gonna be watching this
quite closely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our analysis has shown that marijuana is
very price elastic which means that even
[SPEAKER_05]: small changes in price will dramatically
reduce demand.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it's not that the demand goes away,
it just means that demand stays in the
[SPEAKER_05]: black market.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean that's the reality of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Legal cannabis is competing with the black
market and so when states set their taxes
[SPEAKER_05]: very high as Washington did, they're
sensibly almost guaranteeing that
[SPEAKER_05]: consumers who may want to be active or
participating in the legal market are
[SPEAKER_05]: being priced out.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to be spending twice the
product what they have been spending in
[SPEAKER_05]: the black market by the product from the
legal market and this is why Oregon's
[SPEAKER_05]: model is so interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: At 70% it's the lowest tax rate in the
country and both Washington and California
[SPEAKER_05]: are going to be watching very closely how
the market does from outset because and we
[SPEAKER_05]: expect that demand is going to be very,
very strong.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will start to see states gradually
lower their tax rates because in one of
[SPEAKER_05]: the paradoxical aspects of this industry,
the lower your tax rates, the more tax
[SPEAKER_05]: rate, tax revenue will generate because
more consumers will come into your stores
[SPEAKER_05]: to buy legally as opposed to continuing to
buy from the black market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then fifth, Washington DC.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're actually based in DC so we have a
unique view into that market and
[SPEAKER_05]: Washington is unique in a couple of
respects.
[SPEAKER_05]: One, it's the only jurisdiction I believe
in the world where marijuana is completely
[SPEAKER_05]: legal for adults to use and to cultivate
but there is no regulatory model by which
[SPEAKER_05]: you can buy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so earlier this year they had a seed
giveaway and apparently it was the largest
[SPEAKER_05]: seed giveaway that has ever been held in
the country and now all of the product
[SPEAKER_05]: that folks went home and planted in the
basements is actually now coming up to the
[SPEAKER_05]: market and we're seeing a glut of this
product being sold.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are selling it even though
technically it's not legal but that's
[SPEAKER_05]: unfortunately one of the byproducts of
congressional oversight.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are not allowed legally to set up a
regulatory model in Washington DC.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are not allowed to set up a regulatory
framework and council members have been
[SPEAKER_05]: threatened with jail time if they spend
any time even having meetings discussing
[SPEAKER_05]: the possibility of a regulatory framework.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Washington is important in another
respect.
[SPEAKER_05]: As a nation's capital, as a top domestic
tourist destination, it's one of the first
[SPEAKER_05]: places Americans are coming to and it's
the first time they're in a legal
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I spend a lot of time in the tourist
destinations in Washington and so it's
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting to hear people sound
completely gobsmacked that marijuana is
[SPEAKER_05]: legal in the nation's capital.
[SPEAKER_05]: Washington is also the epicenter of global
public diplomacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have virtually all of the country's
embassies, all of the international
[SPEAKER_05]: embassies based there, a huge
international contingency based in the
[SPEAKER_05]: city.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have representatives from other
countries who are saying the United States
[SPEAKER_05]: has paid ahead aid money corporation and
development of our strategic partnerships
[SPEAKER_05]: on how strictly we enforce marijuana
prohibition in our country whereas the US
[SPEAKER_05]: continues to expand marijuana
legalization.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, I'm speaking to somebody in South
America who is complaining about this
[SPEAKER_05]: quite visibly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the fact that Washington is legal
means that it is going to be part of this
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation that is going to lead to a
broader discussion globally about
[SPEAKER_05]: marijuana public policy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's going to help begin this
discussion about whether to dismantle our
[SPEAKER_05]: convention on narcotics or whether to
exclude marijuana from that given the size
[SPEAKER_05]: of the markets that we are seeing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as Amanda Raymond said earlier in this
market, when California goes legal and we
[SPEAKER_05]: fully expect that it will, countries like
Mexico and a lot of other countries which
[SPEAKER_05]: have long histories with marijuana but
have made it illegal due to the rules that
[SPEAKER_05]: were imposed upon them by this narcotics
regime will begin to push back against
[SPEAKER_05]: that which could catalyze a global market
unlike anything we have seen before.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll pause there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm happy to discuss further.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks, John.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm told we need to wrap up, but I want
to, before doing that, I want to pose a
[SPEAKER_04]: question to any of you and really,
you know, as this market has evolved out
[SPEAKER_04]: of a, from first a criminal market and
into kind of a gray market in this wild
[SPEAKER_04]: west that we're still in in California and
have been in Colorado and other states
[SPEAKER_04]: with the unregulated markets, one benefit
of that is we've created these
[SPEAKER_04]: quintessential American success stories in
the cannabis industry where you have
[SPEAKER_04]: world-class businesses now operating that
started with a couple pounds of product
[SPEAKER_04]: and a few thousand dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with the, you know, the current
regime, the current regime now,
[SPEAKER_04]: that seems like those days are over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes I know a lot of us are
concerned that the opportunities for small
[SPEAKER_04]: entrepreneurs and mom and pops and
middle-class folks to get involved and
[SPEAKER_04]: get, become successful in this industry
are dwindling.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to ask those of you who
have been around in all of, around the
[SPEAKER_04]: country, what, do you think that there are
still opportunities for small
entrepreneurs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Aaron?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, I would say that, you know,
one thing about Los Angeles, and I said
[SPEAKER_02]: there was limited immunity, that was about
what happened was, and it will probably
[SPEAKER_02]: never happen again, but in 2007,
an activist, Don Duncan from Americans for
[SPEAKER_02]: Safe Access, he floated a resolution and
got a city council member to basically say
[SPEAKER_02]: anyone who comes forward can be registered
with the city of L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 185 people came forward and they said,
okay, no more.
[SPEAKER_02]: No more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think those days are over.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the state legislation that was
just, or almost signed by the governor,
[SPEAKER_02]: and probably will be, this leaves a lot of
opportunity in California still for
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller players because it is a,
you have to get your license locally,
[SPEAKER_02]: you have to convince your locality for it,
and it's not like you're just applying at
[SPEAKER_02]: the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: So California, when it comes to wineries,
when it comes to craft beer, you have a
[SPEAKER_02]: very similar model, and we believe maybe
there's 50,000 growers in California,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm also a member of the California
Growers Association, hopefully soon to be
[SPEAKER_02]: a board member, and we are pushing to
license tens of thousands of growers in
[SPEAKER_02]: the state, so California is going to keep
that tradition alive opposite of Ohio that
[SPEAKER_02]: wants to give the license to 10 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say coming from Colorado that,
I work nationally and I'm in Denver,
[SPEAKER_00]: and any time I go to the east coast,
I get off the planet, and I have to remind
[SPEAKER_00]: myself I'm not in Kansas anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the opportunity, you know,
west of the Mississippi, California,
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon, Washington, Colorado, where we had
very entrenched cannabis cultures,
[SPEAKER_00]: that opportunity still exists,
but when you go to the east coast and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's only five people in New York who
can get a license, yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hold on, hold on tight, build what you
can build now because this is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: last few places where that mom and pop
spirit can survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the ancillary entrepreneurship
and finding a good product and a new idea,
[SPEAKER_00]: that will always work, but when you talk
about, you know, micro wineries or micro
[SPEAKER_00]: breweries, those cost millions of dollars
to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you can't start a micro brew with
a six-pack and $1,000, so I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: it has evolved and it is kind of
unfortunate, but that is just,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's the way it's going.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know in Connecticut, where I'm from,
there's more and more, there's added
[SPEAKER_03]: expansion in other counties.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably, you know, I don't know
how many more licenses are on the table
[SPEAKER_03]: right now, and you know, I think what will
happen, too, is they'll be looking for
[SPEAKER_03]: different types of products to stock on
their shelves in these dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's the innovative opportunity that
will transpire.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Connecticut, further.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, New York is, you know,
very, a unique animal.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it will, it's baby steps right
now, and eventually the products will
[SPEAKER_03]: become more widely available and more
abundant in terms of selection.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Will.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm told we are out of time, but the
panelists will be around for questions
[SPEAKER_04]: afterwards, so let's hear it for our
panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
