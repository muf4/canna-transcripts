[SPEAKER_01]: So the amount, the temperature and the
amount of dissolved oxygen are two big
[SPEAKER_01]: factors that dictate the rate of
multiplication of life in the tea,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the temperature, yeah, those are the
two biggest factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: That and what you started off with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's having kind of a clean slate for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually when I'm starting teas,
I'll be measuring three things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be measuring the PPM, the total
dissolved particulate that's in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll be measuring, ideally,
dissolved oxygen and temperature of the
[SPEAKER_02]: water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the temperature has a huge role to
play in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's biology in 80 degree water is going
to explode.
[SPEAKER_02]: 50 degree water, it's going to,
just like a person, you're not going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: moving very far, very fast if it's three
feet of snow and 20 degrees outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're in the tropics and hot and
humid, you probably wouldn't be moving as
[SPEAKER_02]: fast as you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you have a nice, comfortable day
where it's 60 something and a light
[SPEAKER_02]: breeze, then you're going to be able to
run a marathon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that brings up a good point,
too, in that the temperature and the PPMs
[SPEAKER_01]: both have a direct correlation effect to
dissolved oxygen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if temperature is too high,
your dissolved oxygen potential,
[SPEAKER_01]: what you can actually reach, hits a
ceiling.
[SPEAKER_01]: At 80 degrees, you can't reach the same
dissolved oxygen level that you can at 65
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing with PPMs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said to start off, a clean slate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a clean slate means there's plenty of
room for dissolved oxygen and there's
[SPEAKER_01]: plenty of room for biology to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you add food sources in there and
you add your PPMs of, say, a fish emulsion
[SPEAKER_01]: as a food source for your biology,
if you add too much of it, then there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: room for the life to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the dissolved oxygen levels come down
as the PPMs go up also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to make sure there's a balance
there of the right temperature and the
[SPEAKER_01]: right PPMs or your dissolved oxygen level
won't be able to get high enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of the best teas that I
personally have created over the years are
[SPEAKER_02]: based on that less is more type mentality,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, one of the resources for me in
getting started on all of this was Dr.
[SPEAKER_02]: Elaine Ingham, was the Slow Food Web.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find that online.
[SPEAKER_02]: I absolutely love everything that she has.
[SPEAKER_02]: She, to me, is one of the founders of this
whole practice, one of the originals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the stuff that she has done was really
what got me interested in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then pursuing was the mentality that I
had as I started to branch out and try and
[SPEAKER_02]: learn a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because she does tend to lean on,
she almost takes a don't do anything type
[SPEAKER_02]: of approach, very, very light hands when
it comes to manipulating soil ecosystems
[SPEAKER_02]: from her mentality.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas for us with cannabis, we can hit
the throttle a little bit harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it does have a direct effect on yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this stuff is all about, obviously,
medicine, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yield is everything for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yield and product quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can manipulate a lot of that stuff a
little bit safely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But generally speaking, less is more.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have created better, I have created more
explosively alive teas using really
[SPEAKER_02]: minimal input.
[SPEAKER_02]: Far more than using some of the products
that you might buy where you use them at
[SPEAKER_02]: their full recommended dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what you end up with is a solution
that has some bacteria in it, but it also
[SPEAKER_02]: has a whole lot of fish and a whole lot of
kelp and a whole lot of humic that isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily being utilized just yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the purpose of the compost tea is
not necessarily, you can use this as a
[SPEAKER_02]: mixing tank for fertilizer if you want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really the purpose of the tea practice
or brewing compost teas is for me more
[SPEAKER_02]: about the biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: That other stuff is a separate practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the biology is one part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the foods that you might
introduce to this last minute right before
[SPEAKER_02]: you put it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, then we're just starting,
then we're walking a different,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're talking a little bit different game.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about a feeding regimen,
not biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the term compost tea, in a lot of
cases in our industry, our industry does
[SPEAKER_02]: have a lot of kind of misused terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like mass for grower is actually
a certification.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that you just say,
oh, I've been growing cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a mass for grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's actually a certification that
people go through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll find that people that are
taking care of very complicated botanical
[SPEAKER_02]: gardens with thousands of species,
that's generally a mass for grower.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just kind of that, that term
compost, he tends to kind of be this all
[SPEAKER_02]: encompassing thing where, you know,
anybody that's using this kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: mentality while it's all considered
compost tea.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for me, compost tea is more about the
biology specifically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can combine that with
fertilizers, with nutrition, with plant
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrition.
[SPEAKER_02]: And obviously, they're not only
compatible, but they're in a direct
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they kind of get tossed in the same
boat a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, I tend to take the lessons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost like the tea is creating the
army of helpers to help the roots break
[SPEAKER_00]: down what the part two is, which is the
nutrients you would then introduce into
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if you're using nutrients that are
easily broken down by the biology,
[SPEAKER_02]: in my experience, it's a little more
beneficial to divide them up, do one
[SPEAKER_02]: that's all biology or almost entirely
biology.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you can even you can even use
this brewing, you can even use the tea
[SPEAKER_02]: tank to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then you brew up your nutrients,
or you know, mix up your nutrients and put
[SPEAKER_02]: those on.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, and then obviously, there's a
timing factor with there too, and that,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, do you want to lay down the food and
then introduce the biology to it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you want to introduce the biology
and then put the food in?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that comes down to what kind of
rates are you using?
[SPEAKER_02]: How fast are you trying to do it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the idea behind a lot of this is
to keep that soil ecosystem as stable as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible, because that to me is where a
lot of when things get thrown out of
[SPEAKER_02]: balance in the ecosystem, that's what
leaves the door open for things like
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogens to come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you have a like, like,
you know, we kind of talked a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: about that jungle mentality, if you've got
a jungle where, you know, the hunters come
[SPEAKER_02]: through and they pick off a bunch of the
predators, then you have an explosion of,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, versus a healthy jungle that has
never been touched and everything is kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of in balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, anytime you throw in anything from
the outside, you're throwing that out of
[SPEAKER_02]: balance a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as little as you can throw those things
out of balance, and that includes like
[SPEAKER_02]: your your feeding rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, for me, nutrition
specifically, a lot of a lot of the
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient companies will tell you,
you know, feed this stuff at full
[SPEAKER_02]: strength, but then every every other
watering, you have to use water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's an excess of stuff in
there and you have to rinse it out in
[SPEAKER_02]: order to introduce new stuff to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When, hold on a second, I just put it in
there on purpose and now I'm rinsing it
[SPEAKER_02]: out so I can add more.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that mentality is coming from
they want to sell you nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you introduce that stuff in a
very light amount all the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're missing or what you're
mimicking is rain coming down through a
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy compost layer, washing down a
relatively consistent amount of these
[SPEAKER_02]: things down into the soil to where the
soil is never really thrown way out of
[SPEAKER_02]: whack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different parts of the year, obviously,
you go through the winter, it's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: affect the biology and you're going to end
up with it in the spring.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to end up with that kind of
that new flush of nutrients down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: soil and they get used up at different
rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really, for me, keeping it balanced is
about using minimal input and in using
[SPEAKER_02]: minimal input, you can do it consistently.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do it all the time and if you're
doing it all the time, you can actually
[SPEAKER_02]: have a little bit more direct relationship
with what effect that's having on the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because with a lot of this stuff,
if you hit these plants with 16-0-0 full
[SPEAKER_02]: dose of something, yeah, you're going to
see a bang of a result, but then if you
[SPEAKER_02]: try and do that repeatedly, you're not
going to see the same result, whereas if
[SPEAKER_02]: you feed things a little bit at a time,
slowly over time, what you'll see is a
[SPEAKER_02]: much more natural kind of cycle,
whereas those other cycles will spike when
[SPEAKER_02]: you're spiking the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of that stuff is either A,
insoluble, which means not readily
[SPEAKER_02]: available to the plant, which is why you
have to rinse it out, or the plant's not
[SPEAKER_02]: able to take up even the soluble stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much of it in a lot of what we
tend to feed from the kind of common
[SPEAKER_02]: fertilizer regimens.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's so much of it in there,
the plant can't use it, which is,
[SPEAKER_02]: again, why you get back to that needing to
flush it out of the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I tend to lean towards having
everything available on a light scale,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then if I want to bump that up during
certain periods, if you want to bump up
[SPEAKER_02]: nitrogen a little bit here, and then you
want to bring the nitrogen down a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit while you're increasing it,
like an NPK through that cycle,
[SPEAKER_02]: so NPK or N and then P and then K,
I would tend to lean more towards this
[SPEAKER_02]: rather than this, and that's a lot easier
to do if you're just feeding things light
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're kind of dividing up those two.
[SPEAKER_02]: The food and the tea are definitely
separate entities, although they generally
[SPEAKER_02]: are thrown into the same term compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what would be the frequency of tea
feeding?
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about those three scenarios,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like one cocktail that would be more
conducive to new clone put into the
[SPEAKER_00]: sterile pro media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing that just once, like on
initial transplant?
[SPEAKER_02]: It really depends on your media.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have a sterile media that's not
necessarily going to support these things,
[SPEAKER_02]: you introduce this whole ecosystem into a
desert.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not going to last very long,
and there's going to be certain species
[SPEAKER_02]: that will become dominant very fast,
and a lot of the other ones won't be able
[SPEAKER_02]: to compete or will not have their
preferred foods or ecosystem, and they'll
[SPEAKER_02]: start to die off.
[SPEAKER_02]: With something like an organic base blend
that's been commercially batched and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just not very broken down, generally you
don't have to do it that often.
[SPEAKER_02]: I tend to hit it pretty hard at first just
to get everything established,
[SPEAKER_02]: but then if you just kind of let
everything reach a natural equilibrium,
[SPEAKER_02]: you taper off a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using a sterile media,
obviously that's not going to support that
[SPEAKER_02]: life, and so you're going to introduce it
and it's not really going to have much to
[SPEAKER_02]: feed on except in a lot of cases synthetic
nutrients unless you're doing something
[SPEAKER_02]: really organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's another term that there's all
kinds of different types of what is true
[SPEAKER_02]: organic versus what is OMRI certified or
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're introducing nutrients that would
keep the biology alive on a regular basis
[SPEAKER_02]: and trying to keep that biology stable,
it doesn't always work out.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, it kind of depends on what media
you're using.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're using a rich backyard compost,
then you're not using this to do anything
[SPEAKER_02]: at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you're doing is taking that stuff and
rinsing it in here to use it somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: On that level, the ecosystem is there,
it's established, it's healthy,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you don't really need to do much to it
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas if you're using something that's
like pure cocoa, or you've got these
[SPEAKER_02]: materials and nutrients that you're
putting into the soil and building up,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my experience, I believe I've seen
results.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I'm not a biologist.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you test this stuff in these types
of environments?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not in a laboratory.
[SPEAKER_02]: In those type of situations, it's
something where you would follow up almost
[SPEAKER_02]: every feeding with at least a light tea
because that's what's going to speed up
[SPEAKER_02]: the breakdown of what you just introduced,
a lot of which is not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately available for the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: The biology is what makes it available.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost like introducing nutrients
into a healthy compost that's alive.
[SPEAKER_02]: That soil will immediately start to break
that stuff down and it'll happen
[SPEAKER_02]: relatively quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas a sterile media, you introduce the
nutrients and it's going to take them
[SPEAKER_02]: longer to break down because the
biological activity going on in that soil
[SPEAKER_02]: is a much lesser scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
