[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a trademark copyright and innovation
lawyer by training.
[SPEAKER_02]: Been doing that for about 35 years and
about 10 years ago I started branching out
[SPEAKER_02]: into taking that skill set from all these
other industries like electronics and
[SPEAKER_02]: clothing and restaurants and expanding it
into the legal cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I say 10 years ago, it feels like 70
marijuana dog years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been in it five years and I'm like
this is dog years, this is like dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was in that industry it seemed so
much longer so we've seen so much in such
[SPEAKER_00]: a short amount of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been phenomenal growth in 10 years
really from a lot of the underground
[SPEAKER_02]: economy to an above ground economy and
with that comes investment and with the
[SPEAKER_02]: investors come the questions about where
are the intellectual property assets,
[SPEAKER_02]: where are the copyrights, where are the
patents, where are the trademarks,
[SPEAKER_02]: where are the trade secrets that underlie
this whole thing that distinguishes one
[SPEAKER_02]: company from another company.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been helping people in the
industry from cultivators to dispensaries
[SPEAKER_02]: and everything in between, now retailers
we like to call them, figure out what they
[SPEAKER_02]: have, what they could have and how to
protect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny you touched on the nomenclature
because that's one thing that's changed
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to say budtender and now we try to
say cannabis consultants and not as much a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary as a retailer and it is kind of
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've seen a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well tell me what it was like because
myself being from California as well,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people don't recognize and I find
this interesting because I've traveled,
[SPEAKER_00]: even when I briefly lived in Knoxville,
I'd tell people where I was from at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time before I'd left from Ventura County
and then they're like, oh I've been to
[SPEAKER_00]: California, I've been to San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like so many people associate,
almost more so than LA and San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_00]: I dare say, San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of them don't know that San
Diego's a very red county.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean out of 18 cities I think it is only
the city of San Diego is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: considered blue, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So how's that in the industry down there?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: San Diego really is a military town if you
think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really came to life after World War II
and it has a very strong military
[SPEAKER_02]: background and a very strong military
presence.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can be very conservative.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean after all, like in my district,
I live in the northern part of San Diego
[SPEAKER_02]: County.
[SPEAKER_02]: That cross bad or?
[SPEAKER_02]: I live in Solana Beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh okay, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually I live in, so I work in Solana
Beach, I live in Encinitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the last, I forget how many years,
Darrell Issa, a very conservative member
[SPEAKER_02]: of Congress, was my Congress person.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well he decided not to run again this last
election in 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because he saw the handwriting on the
wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: He almost lost two years ago to Doug
Applegate, a Democrat.
[SPEAKER_02]: He decided not to run again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a new Democrat emerged named Mike
Levin.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was challenged by a Republican
candidate and Mike Levin, a Democrat,
[SPEAKER_02]: replaced Darrell Issa.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big change.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big, big change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things do change over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because San Diego is the seventh or
eighth or ninth largest city in the
[SPEAKER_02]: country, there's a tremendous interest in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean there's a big population.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything from CBD to the strongest
cannabis products you can think of.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of interest in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have found there's no shortage of
people wanting to know, get into it,
[SPEAKER_02]: or who are already in it, trying to figure
out how to expand, how to grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: how to change with the times.
[SPEAKER_02]: How to change with the ever-changing laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we try to help them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our niche is to help them with their
innovations, their new ideas, their new
[SPEAKER_02]: inventions, their new delivery systems,
their branding and their trademarks.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of cannabis compliance and
regulatory lawyers out there who help them
[SPEAKER_02]: get their permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the due process.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We specialize really more in the
intellectual property, the branding,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the new ideas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really the fun for us because
there's so much innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have a few companies,
at least a few friends I've worked with
[SPEAKER_00]: between here and in my time at Weedmaps,
like Flavor X based out of San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: CureTube is based out of San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: Billy's company, Pure Ratio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of transdermal and some more
innovative ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's interesting how I was still,
I was impressed with these companies being
[SPEAKER_00]: based out, to your point, of conservative.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has kind of shifted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the city of San Diego itself,
the city of San Diego is only one city in
[SPEAKER_02]: the county.
[SPEAKER_02]: The county of San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many of the cities in the outlying
areas are not quite so welcoming.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the city of San Diego is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's created a whole industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flavor X and Pure Ratios and many,
many other companies are all based in San
[SPEAKER_02]: Diego and thriving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happens is they'll come in and
they'll say, gee, I have this new idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something I want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to patent my trademark or I want to
trademark my copyright.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know the terminology.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they know that they have something
they want to protect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so our job is to help them figure out
what it is that they have and what it is
[SPEAKER_02]: that they might have, what might they be
developing, and what's the best way to
[SPEAKER_02]: protect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which combination of patents, copyrights,
trademarks, trade secrets, and domain
[SPEAKER_02]: names do we deploy and what sequence to
get them the best protection within their
[SPEAKER_02]: budget?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the fun part, helping them
strategize.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting, too, because a lot of
people don't realize this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's the thing that happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned on this what order and what
process you do it in, because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: people, there's vultures that are
monitoring what domains are being
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased, what patents are being applied,
what trademarks are being.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't it just crazy how a lot of the
common individual, no matter if a business
[SPEAKER_00]: professional or otherwise, are kind of a
loop to the fact that a lot of this is
[SPEAKER_00]: public information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just keeping an eye on the right report,
you can find out a lot about what's going
[SPEAKER_00]: on, right?
Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can do competitive intelligence by
searching the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patent and Trademark Office, just the
Trademark Office.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, take a look at all the
patents or the trademarks that Amazon is
[SPEAKER_02]: filing, and it will give you a pretty good
indicator of the products and services
[SPEAKER_02]: they plan to introduce in the next two to
five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's publicly available information.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the crazy part.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to see what kind of new
cars Ford or GM are planning to bring out
[SPEAKER_02]: in the next couple of years, you can take
a look at their trademark applications,
[SPEAKER_02]: because they'll often file a trademark
application a year or two or three in
[SPEAKER_02]: advance of actually introducing the
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a great example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my other hobby, my less mainstream
hobbies, I guess, is kind of food,
[SPEAKER_00]: hot rods, and motorcycles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for motorcycles, I'm a big Triumph guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love the Triumph Daytona.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on my seventh now, and we've been
waiting for the new 765.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been rumored about this new Daytona
765 coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: To your point, the way that we picked up
that it was happening is Triumph of UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they did own the Daytona trademark in
the UK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were encouraged to get Triumph
Daytona trademark, not only in the UK,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone caught wind of that, and they're
like, oh, obviously this is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're spending the time and money,
not a lot, but still spend the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: money to get that established so that they
can launch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in fact, it's funny you mention that
because we have a lot of clients in the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our other big industry that we service is
aftermarket auto.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything that goes on or in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edelbark and Borla and all those types of
companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a member of SEMA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm there every November.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm surprised I haven't seen you there.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I took the last two.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get so much trouble from my friends in
that industry because I went every year
[SPEAKER_00]: from 2000 to 2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I got into this industry and my
friend's like, you've missed three years
[SPEAKER_00]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, it's a few weeks away from the
biggest show of the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I still am passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't have the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who has the time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's like our unofficial slogan for
my law firm is fast cars and weed,
[SPEAKER_02]: but not at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm liking you guys more and more.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might have to start working together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could talk for hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see a lot of that in the
aftermarket.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys are constantly innovating.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might be an X-pipe or it might be a new
down valve or it might be a new intake.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if you think about it, what's wild
about aftermarket auto is you go walk
[SPEAKER_02]: around SEMA, you walk around the parking
lot, you go walk around the convention
[SPEAKER_02]: center, and you realize there probably
isn't one product being sold there that
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody really needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hence the whole aftermarket, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a want, not a need.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all wants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Billions and billions of dollars being
spent on products that aren't really
[SPEAKER_02]: necessary, but people are buying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been going for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you noticed the trend?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if you remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going back to like when Lambo doors
were a trend, then LED under lights were a
[SPEAKER_00]: trend, and then the bigger dubs 20 plus
were a trend.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about the 28 inch wheels on the
trucks?
[SPEAKER_00]: So obnoxious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, this is going back to the wagon
wheel days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shout out to Wheel Pros and XD and Motegi
and American Racing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like wheels.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like big wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, definitely Motegi worked with those
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They sponsored one of our race cars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Asante.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that is a very valid point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I used to sell back in another life,
my college years, I sold motorcycles and
[SPEAKER_00]: watercraft down in San Luis Obispo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny because that's why I
explain to people, I'm like, I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: selling a need.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm selling a want.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people need a C2 to get to work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many really need a motorcycle versus a
traditional automobile or a bus or mass
[SPEAKER_00]: transit?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought it was so funny that I'm
like, wow, here I'm selling a want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, to a certain extent,
it could be considered harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have a demographic, to your point,
just like SEMA and the hundreds of,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the biggest convention of the year
in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bigger than CES, bigger than AVN.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering, is it bigger than CES?
[SPEAKER_00]: It is bigger than CES.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you know this, they take over
all halls of the Las Vegas Convention
[SPEAKER_00]: Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still take over Sands Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just knocked down the Riviera to
expand the parking lot to add on another
[SPEAKER_00]: wing to the, I mean, it's.
[SPEAKER_02]: But apropos of this, I hear MJBizCon,
I have no interest in MJBizCon that I just
[SPEAKER_02]: attend.
[SPEAKER_02]: In November, they're expanding.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're moving into December.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're moving from three days to five
days.
Oh, they're moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so they're moving it to the week of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh great, they're getting away from SEMA,
thank God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, so I can actually catch up with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, that'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm still an alumni.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, they're moving it to the,
I wanna say it's the 11th to the 14th.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I mean, it hit 30, they're in
exponential growth mode.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of a, I hate to say but
necessary evil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I've always supported SEMA and what
SEMA does and their background for the
[SPEAKER_00]: automotive industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: MJBiz.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost too big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost too big.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to really plan ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you wanna see people, you're not gonna
run into the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: You will run into people, but you may not
run into the people you wanna run into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct, because it is so large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even for me, I mean, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not much of a partier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting too old for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, you're never too old.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so much of the, I can only get so
much done during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what I get done is at night with
networking events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was one event to the next.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, literally, it was just nonstop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to your point, I mean, there were a
thousand vendors on that floor this year,
[SPEAKER_00]: which for this industry is a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I'm a member of NORML,
National Organization Reform of Marijuana
[SPEAKER_02]: Laws.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm a big fan of the founder,
Keith Stroop, who's been at it since 1970
[SPEAKER_02]: or 71.
[SPEAKER_02]: We in the cannabis industry owe a
tremendous debt of gratitude to Keith.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been fighting this fight for 46,
47 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I saw him in December a couple months
ago at a NORML conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, Keith, I asked him,
when you started NORML in 70, 71,
[SPEAKER_02]: what was the percentage of the population
that supported marijuana legalization?
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, 12%.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a short 46 years, 47 years,
it's gone from 12% to 65, 66%.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's been a long, hard road.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people don't realize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some influencers, even some that
kind of, we'll just say market themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: as OGs, original growers, as I call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the true, like the Keith, Jorge
Cervantes, Ed Rosenthal, these guys that
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing it before it was cool,
the guys who actually went to jail for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they have the track records to
prove.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the ones that were going against
the grain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it's a hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those fellows and their sisters,
the debt of gratitude, because they've
[SPEAKER_02]: been fighting this fight.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been a fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you hear the old stories of people
bringing in land race strains from South
[SPEAKER_00]: Africa, from India, from Asia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it was so hard to bring over these
coveted seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could get away from the Mexi tie and
get into the true land race, the true pure
[SPEAKER_00]: strains and origins of these strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a phenomenal story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm waiting for someone to properly
tell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing against some of these biographies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have friends here from the
triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talk about Murder Mountain and the
perception that Murder Mountain is giving
[SPEAKER_00]: the masses on the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately, I'm not saying that it
isn't 100% accurate, but they took certain
[SPEAKER_00]: truths and lined them up in a fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did tell a story in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not quite the story that I know growing up
in Northern California that I recognize.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I think it is giving more
education to the consumers and hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: stripping away the stigma that I fully
blame Hollywood and the government for
[SPEAKER_00]: putting in place in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's definitely an interesting
space now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the reasons I'm still at it,
I mean, I don't want to date myself too
[SPEAKER_02]: much and tell you how long I've been doing
this kind of law, but I've been doing it
[SPEAKER_02]: for a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one of the reasons I'm still doing it
is because I see so much innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: New products, new ideas, new delivery
systems being developed all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is in many ways a real American
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's a tangible good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was with the whole dot com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, the thing about the
dot com was, oh, yeah, I'm starting new
[SPEAKER_00]: toys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dot com.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, that's a domain name.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do I turn that into a business?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was just not there wasn't much
thought or much passion, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_00]: that was going in behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a lot of vultures.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is you still have the passion and
you have the culture that people are
[SPEAKER_00]: making sure remains a consistent in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't let big fill in the blank
come in and swoop on it or large
[SPEAKER_00]: corporations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I really try to encourage my clients to
recognize, especially the new ones who are
[SPEAKER_02]: coming in late into this now, is it's more
than just a business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more than just an industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still is a movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really highly encourage them to get
involved with the movement aspects and get
[SPEAKER_02]: involved on either a local national level
on changing the laws that still need to be
[SPEAKER_02]: changed and putting their money where
their mouth is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So several years ago when Nevada was
trying to get their law passed,
[SPEAKER_02]: for recreational, I was at a conference
and they were looking for donations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of my clients, who had been very
successful in the industry, was the first
[SPEAKER_02]: guy to stand up and pledge $50,000 to the
legalization effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: And kudos to him for putting his money
where his mouth was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we would be that much further along if
everybody did a little bit of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a guy, won't name any names,
but an individual is like, what is Boveda
[SPEAKER_00]: doing for the industry?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is Boveda doing to get back?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I'm glad you asked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they brought me on to be a part.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was already a part of the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm kind of working it from the inside
out versus the outside in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, we sponsored California
Growers Association last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sponsored local like Humboldt County
and Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then also being a part of Attach,
the American Trade Association for Canvas
[SPEAKER_00]: and Hempware.
[SPEAKER_00]: To your point, a lot of the individuals at
that table are growers, cultivators,
[SPEAKER_00]: extractors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're an ancillary business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so thankful that us being an
ancillary aren't just standing on the
[SPEAKER_00]: sidelines and letting them fight the
fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're intervening and being a part of
that fight as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what makes me so proud.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just a tangent to be a part of this
company is because we do invest a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: money into making a difference and
bringing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if the grower is successful,
if the producer is successful,
[SPEAKER_00]: the distributor is successful,
we're successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all of us to be a part of that
movement, to your point, and be an
[SPEAKER_00]: advocate for it, that's what makes a
difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has to be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: It makes a big difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And always trying to stay innovative.
[SPEAKER_02]: And always trying to stay out of the
leading edge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Microsoft doesn't sue every
single one of its competitors to get them
[SPEAKER_02]: out of business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just keeps innovating faster than they
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the competition has to catch up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's going to be part of
what's going to propel the next generation
[SPEAKER_02]: in the cannabis space is continuing
innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can say that from what I've seen in
the 10 years that I've been doing the
[SPEAKER_02]: trademark copyright and intellectual
property aspect of it is that's also
[SPEAKER_02]: changing all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The rules are changing all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just a year ago, California allowed
trademark registrations for cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: products for the first time.
[SPEAKER_02]: The feds at the U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: Patent and Trademark Office won't.
[SPEAKER_02]: The state of California will.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got to keep abreast of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to see that opportunity and
take advantage of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had clients on day one, literally on
January 2, 2018, who slept overnight at
[SPEAKER_02]: the State Trademark Unit's office in
Sacramento to be able to be the first or
[SPEAKER_02]: second or third person to file a
California trademark application for
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they're on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take it serious.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a month ago, the farm bill gets
signed into law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now there appear to be opportunities
to finally file U.S.
[SPEAKER_02]: trademark applications to try to get
federal protection for certain types of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis products, for certain types of
CBD products, I should say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp derived, compliant with the farm
bill, less than 0.3% THC.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all it takes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not ingestible yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Probably not tinctures or transdermals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, maybe transdermals, but I don't
think tinctures or edibles because the
[SPEAKER_02]: Food and Drug Administration is still
trying to clamp down on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But maybe topicals and especially if no
health claims are made.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big one, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't say your shampoo, your cannabis
infused or your CBD infused shampoo is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to cure cancer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to get you in trouble.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are these opportunities out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of our job is to stay on top of
these opportunities and help people
[SPEAKER_02]: understand what they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're seeing clients now all of a
sudden rushing in to file federal
[SPEAKER_02]: trademark applications for their products
that contain CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's farm bill compliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Couldn't have done that two months ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I keep calling it the hemp bill
and still the farm bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I don't care about other aspects
of it, but really it was the fact that,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, by the way, we're legalizing something
that went into prohibition decades ago.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been great talking to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad we got to meet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm glad we got to meet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to give a shout out to the
Future Cannabis Project.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that they are doing good work and
hard work and trying to gather a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: information and data that's going to
really help the industry understand where
[SPEAKER_02]: it's been and where it's going.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I appreciate what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to support them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
