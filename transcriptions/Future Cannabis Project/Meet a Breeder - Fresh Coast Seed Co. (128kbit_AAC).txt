[SPEAKER_01]: How long has the company been going?
[SPEAKER_01]: The company's been going for probably
about four years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We started it, but we've been growing
behind the scenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Experimenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: You didn't just wake up one day and do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I was like 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Michigan the whole time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Been in Michigan the whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the time I went down to MSU and got my
degree there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just from there it kind of turned into
this beautiful thing where we were able to
[SPEAKER_01]: just, yeah, start working with the plant
and creating new strains of our own and
[SPEAKER_01]: testing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Were there a lot of cannabis growers at
MSU when you went to school with them?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know there weren't really at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were the guys that were growing in
their closets or their basements.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of people, at least that were in
my graduating class, were really focused
[SPEAKER_01]: on the organic farming and their degrees
and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now I see universities, I think it's
like Northern or something like that,
[SPEAKER_01]: they have a cannabis production class
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a course at the university.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny how you could at one point a
couple years ago get kicked out of college
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis and now they're teaching you
how to grow cannabis at universities.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Pueblo, Colorado, which is just south
of Denver on that I-25 front range,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a CSU division or branch or
university and they have a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: studies master's degree program.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been there for a couple years and
you're like, what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you're like, what is this now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, if they would have called
it hydroponics growing or how to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in your closet, they would have
had 10, 15, 20 people just be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I am here to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was saying a lot of people would
show up for his greenhouse classes and
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff like that and he could tell they
weren't actually interested in learning
[SPEAKER_01]: how to do a commercial greenhouse of
sorts.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just there to grow flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: How did you guys decide to get into
breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got into the whole breeding thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, actually my business partner
approached me one day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was working at a hydro store at the time
and he was like, you know what,
[SPEAKER_01]: man, we should start a seed company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, sounds like a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And six months later I quit my job and we
started doing this full time and we were
[SPEAKER_01]: growing at the time to support ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just really wanted to do something
where we were able to be creative and
[SPEAKER_01]: create a product that somebody else could
also experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that started about four years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we've got seeds all over the world
from Australia to Spain, the UK,
[SPEAKER_01]: US, you know, East coast to West coast and
upping to Canada as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really been, you know,
a crazy growth over the last four years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went from, I think, two followers on
our Instagram and now we're up to almost
[SPEAKER_01]: 13,000 and we're seeing pictures of
plants, you know, that people are growing
[SPEAKER_01]: of our strains and it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it allows us to be creative and,
you know, leave our mark.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I guess what we're doing is we're just
looking to kind of follow our own path.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to work with the things that we've
created to continue to develop on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you know,
maybe take a step back and look into more
[SPEAKER_01]: of the land race and some of the original
varietals that were out there before,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, all this cross pollination and
all this giant melting pot essentially has
[SPEAKER_01]: come about and kind of look backwards and
bring some of the old strains into the
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like give me some examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like with some Death Star strains,
that's something that we've been looking
[SPEAKER_01]: into working with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually ran across an individual who
has a plethora of heirloom land race
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics that he's collected from
Colombia, in India, in Thailand and just
[SPEAKER_01]: all over the place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're, you know, 25, 30 years old
and he's just kind of been stashing all
[SPEAKER_01]: these away.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he approached us actually at a grow
event a couple of months back and was
[SPEAKER_01]: like, by the way, I have all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he busted out his seed list and we
just about shit our pants when we found
[SPEAKER_01]: out what he had.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, he had original sensei stars and
there's all sorts of stuff that you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: get anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would like to hear something about
the learning curve in a genetics program.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of that education did you get at
school and how much was it on the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: or from your partners?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are the big hurdles?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you think about breeding programs
taking a long time, even decades in
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional crops, and you get F1s and F2s
relatively quick in this particular crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the diligence and the challenge to
get high quality, repeatable genetics from
[SPEAKER_00]: your experience?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it definitely takes time and it's
very meticulous work in regards to you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to be paying attention to everything,
you know, from vigor to the overall plant
[SPEAKER_01]: structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, how much does this plant eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what's its terpene profile?
[SPEAKER_01]: What, you know, what does the leaf
variegation look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we had, you know, in our
peanut butter breath project, we had used
[SPEAKER_01]: the leaf variegation on the edge of the
leaf to be a real indicator trait for us
[SPEAKER_01]: because the ocean grown Kush breath or the
OGKB has that wild duck foot going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can tell when you get something,
it looks very mutant and not normal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's, you know, the more dosy
dose side.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with our peanut butter breath line,
not only were we able to decipher,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what we were getting from the
physical traits, but also the color and
[SPEAKER_01]: the frost content.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it takes time to get there,
you know, and nowadays, like you said,
[SPEAKER_01]: the F1s and F2s are, they're easier to
come up with and everybody's doing it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but to really truly, you know,
get an inbred line, you have to get,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, many generations deep into your
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it takes a lot of time and MSU when I
was there, I had taken plant genetic
[SPEAKER_01]: courses and, you know, you'd get into the
really intricate parts of it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: much further than the Punnett squares and,
you know, all those science experiments,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, you would do back in grade
school, but it gets deeper than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to see a project come to fruition and
you can see the mother and the father's
[SPEAKER_01]: distinct traits, you know, passed down to
those next filial generations is really a
[SPEAKER_01]: neat thing, especially too when you're
seeing the same results in other people's
[SPEAKER_01]: gardens.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it, but it takes time and yeah,
figuring out, you know, figuring out what
[SPEAKER_01]: makes sense, you know, you're not just
going to put two totally random species of
[SPEAKER_01]: plant together and, you know, it'd be
like, all right, this is the one that it
[SPEAKER_01]: takes looking at, you know, the parental
lineages and figuring out what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: really trying to capture out of crossing
those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, without you, I don't want to,
I don't want to call anyone out because
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not an expert.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a horticulturalist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a plant geneticist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm an avid gardener.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up as a garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a microbiologist and so I'm completely
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people actually get genetics
relatively speaking to people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing genetics?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you sound like you have some
classical training.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You went to MSU, great university.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do most people understand it or how many
people are just winging it?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say probably 60% of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of them are winging it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not necessarily saying that they're
winging it, just throwing pollen in their
[SPEAKER_01]: room, but they're not necessarily,
you know, making a decision and crafting a
[SPEAKER_01]: experiment.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you will, you know, where they have a
hypothesis like, okay, this is my male.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my female.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I'm trying to get out of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then doing the experiment and
following through on the conclusions by
[SPEAKER_01]: testing the progeny and really figuring
out what you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, a lot of these people will test
up a couple of times and, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they might put it out on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically you see people that are
doing that, they will sell the seeds for
[SPEAKER_01]: cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're 40, $50 a pack on
certain stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, we believe in our line and
we've tested ours, you know, for three
[SPEAKER_01]: years consistently ourselves, as well as
giving it out, you know, to our testers
[SPEAKER_01]: all around the country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're getting the same results that
we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're confident, you know, in that
we're seeing the same results over and
[SPEAKER_01]: over again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so a gap in the, at least the
adherence to an experimental design and
[SPEAKER_00]: the follow through of actually that
rigorous data collection and that
[SPEAKER_00]: repetition from lineage to lineage to
validate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's the gap?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not necessarily that it's a gap
because, you know, some of our most
[SPEAKER_01]: popular strains, you know, ChemDog,
that was bag seed, if you will,
[SPEAKER_01]: originally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, everybody knows that now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so who's to say the next one couldn't
be?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's definitely, you know, becoming sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've saturated, you know, the entire gene
pool overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's exciting, you know,
and that's where I think there will be new
[SPEAKER_01]: people that step in that could potentially
introduce a species or a strain that no
[SPEAKER_01]: one's ever seen before just in terms of
its physical appearance or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene profile or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think with the industry, yeah,
growing the way that it is and all the new
[SPEAKER_01]: techniques that are being developed and
strains that, yeah, people are trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: come up with, it definitely has the
progress and I can see it continuing to
[SPEAKER_01]: progress for the next 10 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there a ceiling on this for me?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I think there's a lot of overlap
and we've progressed so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: How far will it go?
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, I think there's really no
limit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're still the innovators in
this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't even think we've really
hit the growth stage yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of a big statement compared to
everything that's going on relative to
[SPEAKER_01]: everything going on right now that we
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, think about, yeah, how many states
still are, you know, not allowing us to do
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: From a production, but I mean from a
genetics and a diversity point of view,
[SPEAKER_00]: is there things that just haven't been
tapped into yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I think there are, and I think a
lot of those traits that we may be looking
[SPEAKER_01]: for lie back in those land race heirloom
varietals.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, who's to say that, yeah,
it couldn't come from something new,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think a lot of the stuff that we're
looking for or that was originally
[SPEAKER_01]: created, you know, on this planet by
whatever that may be, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are true genetics and those are true
species, you know, at their core and you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't find a lot of that any longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question that someone asked me
again, and I don't know, but we talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love talking about this topic because
I'm not an expert in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything I talk about and get
information in is new kernels of
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so thanks for doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you pick males?
[SPEAKER_01]: So selecting our males is pretty much how,
you know, you would select a female in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms of you grow it, start to finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have multiple clones of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to run yours, select it,
and then you're going to run it again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that second run, you know,
you can stress test them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you can test for disease
resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people, you know, they'll
experience issues when they let their male
[SPEAKER_01]: go, it'll start to herm out on them at the
end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not necessarily an indicator of
stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, letting it run a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really running your male start to
finish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, like I said, where you're
looking for, you know, a stem rub or a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain leaf, you know, variation pattern
around the leaf margin or just structure
[SPEAKER_01]: overall, you know, vigor, all those things
come into the equation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of analyzing and, you know,
making your best educated guess on what
[SPEAKER_01]: you deem the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then obviously, you know, you can get
the plant tested as well at the end of its
[SPEAKER_01]: growth cycle to kind of determine the
average percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's actually really helpful for
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because I've always understood on
females or certain traits, at least,
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of people chase THC for a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I get that measuring trait and it
seemed like it was harder for me to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand conceptually how to measure or
what to want, what I would want to measure
[SPEAKER_00]: out of male.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have, we have high CBD farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use them for agriculture purposes,
mostly for our inputs and looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: certain metrics of chemical constituents,
CBD, cannabinoid in general, terpene,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then yielding growth and maybe rooting
or whatever we're kind of targeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't have a breeding and we don't
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more of agronomics and for,
for growth patterns and different inputs,
[SPEAKER_00]: natural inputs, because that's what our
wheelhouse is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense to me that you could really
do diligent stress tests, resilience tests
[SPEAKER_00]: on the males to make sure that you at
least have some of those test resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: traits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are more easily conceptually
measured in the males and maybe structure
[SPEAKER_00]: and morphology.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what I heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the females, you want to couple that
along with some nice characteristics of
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavor qualities and whatnot.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then too, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after you put that all together,
you know, your final product is the mix of
[SPEAKER_01]: all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're able to identify that and see
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, yeah, that's what it's all
about at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you measure terpenes or cannabinoids
in a male?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is actually, you know, one of the
ways that we select males.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do stem rubs if one's more than the
other or they may even be the same strain,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they do have a slightly different
smell to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, well, this one's more
appealing than this, but this one might
[SPEAKER_01]: smell more prominently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did they teach you the stem rub technique
in school?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they didn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, they did not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole school.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the cannabis industry technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nomenclature, horticulture, go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of people, you know,
that are classifying things as what they
[SPEAKER_01]: say they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when it really gets down to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of, you know, feline
generations or doing an inbred line or a
[SPEAKER_01]: back cross, I think nowadays people are
trying to catch on to the lingo.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something where, you know,
I had learned it a long time ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: so it all kind of clicked for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it made sense in terms of
what we were trying to accomplish.
[SPEAKER_01]: And really it's.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something worth getting to know,
you know, for every grower in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, you can properly classify your
plants and, you know, if you're trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell your seed stock, especially being
able to tell people exactly where it is in
[SPEAKER_01]: its breeding process, you know,
first, second, third, feline generation
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're talking F1, F2, F3,
and that's a proper nomenclature for that
[SPEAKER_00]: first generation, second bred generation,
third bred generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be having perhaps a static
pollen donor with a reoccurring mother
[SPEAKER_00]: breeds and then taking seeds from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you can work your way down and
then, yeah, it depends on how you're
[SPEAKER_01]: looking to breed back and what your end
goal is.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're looking to,
at the end, ultimately create that inbred
[SPEAKER_01]: line that you've just been putting back
into itself or if you're looking yet to
[SPEAKER_01]: do, you know, an F1 or an F2 and then use
something from there to do another project
[SPEAKER_01]: once, you know, if you feel that that
plant that you're using is stable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Man, you better have a, it seems like you
better have a real vision as a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder because there's just a thousand
directions you can go with any one
[SPEAKER_00]: generation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, it's just, you know,
like anything, like if you're in the stock
[SPEAKER_01]: market or if you're starting a business,
you know, really having a plan to put into
[SPEAKER_01]: action and following through on that and
ensuring that everything is taken care of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, in the same manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we grow and breed
organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, having microbes like what
you guys do in the soil and having that
[SPEAKER_01]: symbiotic relationship is really key to
ensure, you know, success from start to
[SPEAKER_01]: finish on everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's where we feel a lot of our
really good germination rates come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're near 99% on all of our
germination rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, male to female ratios are about
50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then typically with our phenotypic
ratios, we'll see a three to one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that three to one, I'm basing that on
color specifically.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the dominant color gene, came through
from our male.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more likely than not, you're going to
get something that's a dark purple as
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to a green.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a probability game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, with our females,
a lot of them had a dominant terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: trait.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was able to carry on down that
lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas the peanut butter breath male that
we used, it had a recessive gene for
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that was the less dominant and that
wouldn't carry down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so yeah, like I said, it's neat to see
the creations come together, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: at different stages, different generations
and see, okay, this is what's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where do we want to go with it now?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I spend a lot of time in Europe
and they talk about feminized seeds a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can chemically feminize seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's very common practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And seeds a big business as a souvenir
business in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's the legal terms for
selling seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe I should, but I just don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that bad for the ultimate plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it just reverting in a safe,
stable way?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear your opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with feminized seeds, essentially what
you're doing is you are creating a
[SPEAKER_01]: mutation within the chromosome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're essentially creating a triploid,
which is a mutation in chromosomal binding
[SPEAKER_01]: that is caused by the application of like
a colloidal silver product or something
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, thus giving you a feminized
seed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by not allowing that chromosome to
bind, it's guaranteed that it's female,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it could also create instability.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, that's just nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are transgendered people in
the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's not an uncommon thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's the same with plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very similar to them in terms of our
genetic code and our breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for true breeding program,
you would recommend not doing that because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the introduction?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do you feel that it's not that big of a
deal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it depends on your
application.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you were ever going to try to
do a breeding project, you wouldn't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to use anything feminized and it wouldn't
be worth even trying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for people who are getting into this,
a lot of people want an easy route.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, it's just like the auto
flower thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people shy away from that and
don't want anything to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are other people that swear by
it because it works for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think really at the end of the day,
it just kind of comes down to what you
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do as a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the creation of feminized seeds,
it's essentially a colloidal silver,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a natural compound.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you can drink it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, you probably wouldn't want to
consume the flowers after colloidal silver
[SPEAKER_01]: has been sprayed on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the end, I think if you're
following your initial intention and
[SPEAKER_01]: applying it at the proper times and really
watching your plants develop and
[SPEAKER_01]: determining when is the right maturation
time for you to call it and start drying
[SPEAKER_01]: your seeds and properly creating the seed,
then there's really no health risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say associated with, you know,
the seed directly in that plant that would
[SPEAKER_01]: be grown from that seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I actually have another
question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep on thinking about things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All this is new.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at some point we're going to get shut
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But while we're still on, you know,
we talk about in Colorado, the lack of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics for hemp farms where,
you know, a lot of the genetics there,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're marketed as legal and you can grow
them, but then they end up going hot and
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to be at the point three percent
THC or lower to be within that realm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a big opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, I guess the only way people
are getting around it and it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: challenging is buying clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a near term future where there
are going to be seeds?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a two part question that
comply.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, one of the challenges,
I think, is when you get down to that low
[SPEAKER_00]: THC, you really compromise other
cannabinoid development where you can have
[SPEAKER_00]: a point seven percent THC strain and have
in the high teens CBD or the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, a relative abundances.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you cut that down for every tenth
of a percent, you really decrease the
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of CBD production.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there is that a real correlation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And where's the line?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think that's just lack of breeding,
lack of effort, or is there a real
[SPEAKER_00]: limitation there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's something where there is the
potential to, you know, create through
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding a strain that is stable and will
consistently be below the threshold.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also there is genetic variation and
there is that chance for a gene to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, put it above that point three.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with I think all of the stuff
that's going on right now, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: really focusing in on getting a certified
seed to start with is what's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the most beneficial as compared to going,
you know, through any Joe online that has
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp seed that says, hey, this is what the
cross is, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know they've been doing it in Europe
and Canada for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like those regions are going to
be the areas that we're looking to going
[SPEAKER_01]: forward, you know, more so than Colorado
and California, you know, that they're new
[SPEAKER_01]: and everyone is just getting into it
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys have been doing it for damn
near 100 years or longer over across the
[SPEAKER_01]: ocean.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, do you think there's a big
difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, China is the number one producer
of hemp as an example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll call it just low, low THC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's mostly bred for, I think,
fiber and rarely bred for its amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: seed production or quality of nourished
seed because that can be an interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: food source or obviously for flour and
extraction purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you find most of the certified
seed in Colorado, as an example,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're certified, but they're certified
under a fiber and a coupler certified
[SPEAKER_00]: under a seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But none are really certified as a strong
producer for extract cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think mostly because those have come
from Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see that changing in the near
future where we're going to have really
[SPEAKER_00]: strong strains that are certified for CBD
production and extraction?
[SPEAKER_01]: I really hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, with, you know, with the way
that the industry is going, I think
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of potential for that to
take place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that they're letting us do this
legally, you know, there's going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more closet scientists and people that
want to experiment and learn and really,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, figure this out and figure out
what the best way is to utilize this
[SPEAKER_01]: resource for our future going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's a beautiful thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we will definitely see that
from companies here in the next couple of
[SPEAKER_01]: years.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to start coming out with
products that are superior to others or
[SPEAKER_01]: what is the current status quo.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD or THC a bigger market in the next
five years?
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think so?
[SPEAKER_01]: For the next five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everyone's trying to hop on that
track.
[SPEAKER_01]: Train right now and get involved with it
in one way or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, for our industry,
obviously THC is the game.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a spot for those two
circles to overlap in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's going to be a huge market
that's interested in finding that that
[SPEAKER_01]: golden ratio, you know, that one to one
where they're really getting the relief
[SPEAKER_01]: that they need from the products that
they're consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I used to say this a lot and I
think I still believe this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this THC customer base market and
it's not going anywhere and it's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then there's this CBD market that
might encompass everyone else on earth
[SPEAKER_00]: that might not necessarily be interested
in the THC aspects of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the CBD aspects or even for your pets,
the healing aspects, it's incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC is a part of that, but it's not as
much as a psychoactive as it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: activator component where we know we need
a little bit of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we all think.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have a little activation in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point, we're staying away from
Ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we said we weren't going to do
Feminized and we're finishing a Feminized
[SPEAKER_01]: project right now, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing a one to one CBD THC cross
with moose cookies that was bred by Light
[SPEAKER_01]: Sky Farms and we're crossing that to a lot
of our strains and mothers that have
[SPEAKER_01]: proven themselves to us over the years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're excited about that and that line
will be released in probably about five to
[SPEAKER_01]: six months.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got testing and stuff like that to
finish up and checking in with people and
[SPEAKER_01]: putting our brains together and being
like, all right, let's look at the data on
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it looking?
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is something where people want
the auto flowers too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to mess with the time
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want it easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so some aren't willing to do the work
and some are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the ones that are willing to
do the work and really put in the time to
[SPEAKER_01]: get to know their plants and the genetics
that they're working with are going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones, you know, reaping those benefits
a little bit more in the end in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: quality yields and just overall
performance of their plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seems like the auto flower phenomenon in
Europe has been very strong and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: actually starting to fade away where
people are realizing they want the
[SPEAKER_00]: non-Ruderalis versions of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I see that with a lot of the people
that I work with over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny to see this drifting in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of fading out of Europe thinking
that the United States non-version is
[SPEAKER_00]: cooler and then the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: is adopting some of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think no matter what I've heard,
people that grow auto flowers,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's something about the Ruderalis that
you can sense across all the auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowering strains and kind of ties it
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes sense, but it might not be as
desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: For some people, that's the kind of
feedback I've got.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, yeah, just what you said and
it just comes down to what your growing
[SPEAKER_01]: style is, you know, what works for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much time do you have to devote to
looking at them every day and watering
[SPEAKER_01]: them and, you know, what product are you
looking for at the end of it all too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So...
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
