[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to invite Kevin de Leon up to
join us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: And support his campaign.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give it up for Kevin de Leon, you guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Kevin's going to tell us that he's smoked
a lot of weed for his entire life.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he wants your vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, very quickly, let me introduce
myself to each and every one of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those who don't know me, I thank you
very much for allowing me to share a few
[SPEAKER_00]: words with all of you here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: An incredible night here in Venice,
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Kevin de Leon, and I'm running
to become your next U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: Senator for the great state of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe strongly that these are very
dangerous, consequential times in our
[SPEAKER_00]: nation's history, that we're in fact
engaged in a battle for the soul for this
[SPEAKER_00]: nation against a president without one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the issue of cannabis and why this is
so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why we should have a voice in
Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: is because the current incumbent that I'm
running it against doesn't even support
[SPEAKER_00]: the use of cannabis for medicinal uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, think about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever your perspective may be on the
issue of cannabis, and I know where all of
[SPEAKER_00]: your perspectives are on cannabis,
but society as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you don't support at minimum the
use of cannabis for medicinal purposes,
[SPEAKER_00]: when we have scientific empirical evidence
with regards to people who have AIDS,
[SPEAKER_00]: people who have Alzheimer's, Parkinson's,
some form of cancer, breast cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: ovarian cancer, whatever type of cancer,
whatever variation, to help alleviate
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't support that with scientific
evidence, then I don't believe you should
[SPEAKER_00]: be a voice of a state like California that
is diverse like no other state in the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I am a supporter of the medicinal use
of cannabis as well as the recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have an incredible opportunity to
make sure that cannabis industry becomes a
[SPEAKER_00]: strong green pillar of our economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're the fifth largest economy in
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to put this in context, there are only
four economies larger than that of ours.
[SPEAKER_00]: The United States of America as a whole,
China, Japan, Germany, then your great
[SPEAKER_00]: state, our great state, the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're remotely interested in
rounding out the top 10, that number six
[SPEAKER_00]: is United Kingdom, seven it is France,
then we have Italy, India, and that number
[SPEAKER_00]: 10, it is Vladimir Putin's Russia.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to put this in context, California's
GDP is larger than that of Vladimir
[SPEAKER_00]: Putin's Russia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am a strong proponent of clean
energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the author of the most far-reaching
climate change policy in the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: of America, 100% clean energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: California is the largest economy in the
world to legally mandate 100% clean energy
[SPEAKER_00]: by the year 2045.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a strong supporter of clean energy
because we have an incredible opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: to convert these environmental challenges
into real economic opportunities,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially given those at the lowest
economic strata, those men and women of
[SPEAKER_00]: color, real opportunities to succeed in a
clean energy space, energy efficiency,
[SPEAKER_00]: renewable energy, wind, solar,
and other clean energy technologies that
[SPEAKER_00]: will be invented in the future,
transportation, electrification,
[SPEAKER_00]: ZEVs, zero emissions vehicles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a green economy is our future,
but a green economy with cannabis is our
[SPEAKER_00]: future too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are two twin pillars that can
really drive California's economy well
[SPEAKER_00]: into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why having a voice in Washington DC
and being a leader nationwide for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: is absolutely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when we pass medicinal use of
cannabis, we thought that that would open
[SPEAKER_00]: up the doors, but it really didn't because
of all the litigation, because of local
[SPEAKER_00]: governments, because of cultural
prejudices with regards to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's why we have a Department of
Justice that's hostile to the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: establishment of cannabis, not just in
California, but throughout the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we need a voice in
Washington DC that's gonna de-schedule,
[SPEAKER_00]: de-schedule cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because to put cannabis on the same level
of heroin and cocaine is ludicrous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have seen the consequences of so
many men and women, but particularly men
[SPEAKER_00]: and men of color that have been
incarcerated because of this scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen the devastation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've seen our taxpayer dollars blow up
budgets to incarcerate so many
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we need a strong voice in
Washington DC that will fight the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Justice, that will fight the
prejudices that exist in the Congress
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: We export 75% of cannabis to other parts
of the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So California will be and can be and
should be and will be that economy for the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire nation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I just wanna thank you very
much for giving me an opportunity to share
[SPEAKER_00]: a few words with all of you here today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanna say that we have a real
opportunity to grow this industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you need champions who are gonna be
there with you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Kevin, can I start a conversation here
with you about this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you for being a champion for our
cause.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you definitely have our votes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I voted for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So excited that you're here right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're in the midst of a tsunami of
regulations that just changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're in an awkward state right now where
we're not sure which way we're going.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even the smartest people in the
industry, we can't come to a consensus.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't come to a consensus on what just
changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Therefore, we can't come to a consensus on
what solutions we need to employ.
[SPEAKER_05]: What to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so really where we're at is we're
having a tremendously challenging time
[SPEAKER_05]: regulating an unregulated market and
competing with an unregulated market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what it seems like California did was
they took models from other states and
[SPEAKER_05]: tried to copy paste this section over
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we'll do it like Colorado did it over
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But they did not take into account that we
had a thriving black market that produced
[SPEAKER_05]: 12 and a half million pounds of cannabis
prior to legalization going into effect.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, I mean, really like the number one
issue that we're discovering right now
[SPEAKER_05]: that is blowing all of my smartest friends
away is that we have an inversion problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everyone was so worried about a diversion
problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a significant inversion problem
because there's so many legacy operators
[SPEAKER_05]: that can't get permits.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we wanted to be able to talk to
you about these challenges that we're
[SPEAKER_05]: facing at the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have 11 days right now left of a 15 day
public comment period where we can't get
[SPEAKER_05]: consensus with the smartest people on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So take over, Pamela.
[SPEAKER_01]: The consensus is difficult because the
issues of fact operators at different
[SPEAKER_01]: pivot points, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different pressure points.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are a retailer and you have
multiple operations or if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: vertically integrated or if you're a tech
platform, what does a non-cannabis plant
[SPEAKER_01]: touching business look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that those are the real
quintessential issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what does it mean to be an owner?
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it mean to be a financial
interest holder?
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we chart through these issues that
we'll talk about, I think knowing as
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who is hopefully going to be
representing California's interests at the
[SPEAKER_01]: federal level, a lot of these issues
splinter down into how do we get access to
[SPEAKER_01]: banking?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we go about forging a path of
uncertainty through these regulations?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know that if 280E, for example,
weren't an issue, some of these other
[SPEAKER_01]: licensing, white labeling, structuring
issues would also then evaporate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's interesting for us to
start that dialogue is what is the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: effect to the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me just add one thing, because you
said something that was really critical
[SPEAKER_00]: with the issue of banking and how many
folks put their lives at risk with so much
[SPEAKER_00]: cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the banking system here that
won't.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's prohibited legally, obviously,
from accepting legally gotten gains by our
[SPEAKER_00]: retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just this Monday, I did a press conference
with the president of the City Council of
[SPEAKER_00]: Los Angeles, Herb Wesson, with regards to
the establishment of a public bank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the reasons is because the
federal regulations won't allow cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: to be part of officially the banking
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why at the federal level,
I want to be your voice to push this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's a lot of cultural
prejudices, obviously, that permeate
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: on the issue of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're so innovative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're so creative.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're disruptive of a state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just don't push the envelope.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we tear the envelope apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why California is always so
ahead of the curve in many ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why in Washington, D.C.,
it's always been archaic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just been behind the times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we have to have a voice in
Washington, D.C., because what permeates
[SPEAKER_00]: Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: are these cultural prejudices that you
remember the movie, the old movie,
[SPEAKER_00]: Reefer Madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: People truly think that in Washington,
D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: with regards to Reefer Madness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's so behind the times in
comparison to what is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bless you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what makes California such an
incredible place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on the banking issue is what I want to
work on as well, too, because that will
[SPEAKER_00]: help legitimize, if you will, and then
cash flow price points with regards to
[SPEAKER_00]: getting access to capital, which right now
is very, very complex, if not almost
[SPEAKER_00]: impossible right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just a little, you know,
with regards to the banking issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give us your full circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So something that I love seeing in
individuals lives, because I'm all about
[SPEAKER_02]: self-enrichment, is seeing people that
have a full circle moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually had a very much a full
circle moment tonight as about two and a
[SPEAKER_02]: half, three years ago, I was in
Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_02]: at our capital lobbying for cannabis
rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I actually spoke with our California
senator's office at the time that you're
[SPEAKER_02]: running against.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the chief of staff and the assistant
chief of staff were very non-responsive or
[SPEAKER_02]: combative with the group from Americans
for Safe Access.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the end of it, I told the chief of
staff, I look forward to the day that I
[SPEAKER_02]: get to vote for the person that will be
replacing you, because this is California
[SPEAKER_02]: and we support cannabis here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if our representatives don't stand
behind what we believe in, then it is time
[SPEAKER_02]: for you to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am personally very honored tonight to
be sitting next to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does someone have a guitar for me right
now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I will play.
[SPEAKER_00]: No Joe Rogan moments right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw what happened with Elon,
that stock went down real fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought it would go up, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let me say this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, thank you very much from the bottom
of my heart for giving me a few moments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sorry if I disrupted a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my campaign is a disruptive campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: And listen, I would never have been a
state senator, nor would I have ever been
[SPEAKER_00]: the leader, the president of our
California state senate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I had listened to folks say,
know when it is your time and know your
[SPEAKER_00]: place.
[SPEAKER_00]: In many ways, we're all disruptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's who we are, because that's that
creative spirit that's restless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And precisely what you said is that this
is about values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's our values.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's time that we export
California values to Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not the other way around.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't have to accept the status
quo.
[SPEAKER_00]: The naysayers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always we can't do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we can't deal with the issue of
banking because the law doesn't allow for
[SPEAKER_00]: banking for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, why not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's disrupt the status quo.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how you make laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you make change in this
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're the fifth largest
economy in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we need to deal with the
issue of this cannabis industry and make
[SPEAKER_00]: it a very legitimate industry like clean
energy, like any other industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are on the cusp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are in the vanguard.
[SPEAKER_00]: You are the progressive wing of this new
industry that is a legitimate industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: will be sooner or later recognized by the
federal authorities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in order for that to happen,
you have to be involved in public
[SPEAKER_00]: politics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you're not involved in
politics, politics is going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: involved with you, whether you like it or
not.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this case, politics is getting
involved with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're not liking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to cross your arms and say,
well, that's the way it is?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to fight for what you believe
is right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's who we are as Californians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I'm asking you come
November 6, less than two weeks from now,
[SPEAKER_00]: don't forget to vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell your friends, your neighbors,
your loved ones, your coworkers,
[SPEAKER_00]: your workers.
[SPEAKER_03]: For the next two minutes, I want you to
listen to the three other people on stage
[SPEAKER_03]: with you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I want each of you to give Kevin one
thing cannabis related that if he wins,
[SPEAKER_03]: you would like him to think about as he
settles into Washington.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you choose banking, I'm choosing law
enforcement, which when you go into it,
[SPEAKER_05]: I only get one.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want retraining for law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't know the difference between a
licensed operator and an unlicensed one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're having a really hard time even
calling them for support when a licensed
[SPEAKER_05]: operator is getting robbed for them to
care and care about our licensed weed.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not going to go find it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is happening in a lot of
jurisdictions at the moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's sort of, you know, but if we had
banking, that's my number one thing,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I'm pretty sure that Pamela was going
to go with that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, banking, retraining for law
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to that note, though, as a person who
fights for people dealing with
[SPEAKER_02]: disabilities, as I was an individual on
disability myself for several years while
[SPEAKER_02]: I went back to college due to my epilepsy
is police force.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's every area that you're an outlier
that if you're outside of the norm,
[SPEAKER_02]: they need training, but I'm not going to
take that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm going to take is maybe a little
bit grander is that I would love to see
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis part of a universal healthcare
system and not owned primarily or only by
[SPEAKER_02]: the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to second that I had debilitating
migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: So much so that they wanted to put me out
on disability.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm an attorney.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't hire an attorney who has a
cognitive deficit for migraines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was able to get a standing
prescription of 60 to 90 opiates in a
[SPEAKER_01]: month.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I had to leave California to go
to my family in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: And luckily cannabis was there for me and
that's why I have a career.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started advocating for, you know,
the single most important person in your
[SPEAKER_01]: life is you, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You are irreplaceable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're irreplaceable to yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I had to start advocating for
myself and through the advocacy of myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was advocating for those that were
providing clean medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to echo Brett's statement, we need to
see reform for cannabis such that it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: $32,000 a year to be a patient to get
Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just, it's unfathomable and you
don't get insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get medical reform without
insurance reform.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we haven't seen that and cannabis can
be such a good conduit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to think of it as the mirror that
we can look at how we deal with so many
[SPEAKER_01]: other issues and treat so many other drugs
that could be, if used and dispelled with
[SPEAKER_01]: this nefarious brush, better than their
opioid counterparts that are only there
[SPEAKER_01]: because the pharmaceutical companies are
pushing them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't take away the small business that
California is built on in cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: replace it with the pharmaceutical
companies by blanketing reform that allows
[SPEAKER_01]: for them to reschedule instead of
de-schedule without a plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think it's important to have both.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is wonderful input.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate very much the input that I've
received.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important that all elected officials,
all policymakers listen to all the
[SPEAKER_00]: perspectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'd be remiss if I don't also,
introduce quickly a California state
[SPEAKER_00]: legislator as well, Assemblywoman Wendy
Carrillo, who's always been a strong
[SPEAKER_00]: supporter of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Wendy, can you show your face so folks
can see you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi Wendy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Wendy Carrillo, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Newly elected Assemblywoman.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a strong, strong, fierce,
independent woman, a strong supporter of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has an incredible future.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's in the beginning stages of being
your Assemblywoman, representing parts of
[SPEAKER_00]: East LA and El Sereno, Echo Park and
Silver Lake.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look a lot, you know, to her for
leadership, not just on this issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: but on many other issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, it's Wendy Carrillo who's there
today with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thanks a lot for coming out to Venice
today at the last second.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's get out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's win.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's show the rest of the country and
show the rest of the world how it's done
[SPEAKER_00]: in the great state of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, thank you very much everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Kevin.
