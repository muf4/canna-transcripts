[SPEAKER_01]: Tony has been everything that we needed in
this industry to speak for us to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I say on the other side, Tony has
worked for, for example, for Governor
[SPEAKER_01]: Brown doing economic development impact
studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just did the high-speed rail study for
Governor Brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personal connections throughout the
legislature and the political
[SPEAKER_01]: establishment in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an economist.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was a rancher.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had 21,000 acres in King County,
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know none of you know where that is,
but it's down the way in the south over to
[SPEAKER_01]: the east.
[SPEAKER_01]: And his, Tony came on the scene and went
with us with a tour up in Humboldt County
[SPEAKER_01]: with Fiona Ma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fiona, you out there somewhere?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, Fiona Ma is a board of equalization
member.
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll be with us all day today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with George Runner, her colleague from
the second district, and we had a roving
[SPEAKER_01]: farm tour with economic analysis and tax
policy analysis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that day was a catalyst for a lot of
what's been happening across the state and
[SPEAKER_01]: even in the legislative process that we
saw earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say enough about Tony.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an amazing voice for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should all go up and see him.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say hello to Tony afterwards today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give him your cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tony is accessible, available,
wants to forward this agenda, the agenda
[SPEAKER_01]: of legalization and ending prohibition and
doing things rationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, I give the microphone over
to Tony Oliveira.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you that might be here for the
state, just so you know, I'm used to
[SPEAKER_00]: working out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been appointed by three governors at
one time or another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a legislative judge for the great
Buttonwillow lawsuit, the environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: lawsuit, radioactive lawsuit that lasted
seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just spent a year doing the economic
impact study for the high-speed rail.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spent a year and a half doing the
agriculture impact study for the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: California on value added.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work on ESG, environmental and social,
and governments projects all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in India right now and in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really go all over.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the only gratis job that I'm
doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I felt, because somebody's got to pay
the bill, but I felt this was important
[SPEAKER_00]: that I be not paid by anybody,
try to keep as much bias out as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today, instead of giving you answers,
I hope that I really present with you the
[SPEAKER_00]: questions that are needed, because what
you heard up here was a lot of effort has
[SPEAKER_00]: been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some big voids and some big
questions that I think that are natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a county supervisor for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a president of the California State
Association of Counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I come from local government,
so I understand them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I served on the CalPERS board for
seven years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was appointed by Schwarzenegger and
Brown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I understand the state and I understand
local government.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I am 44 years a farmer of many
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'm going to get to the
script.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll go all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then if you have, we have time for
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to sincerely thank those that
have made my visit and presentation
[SPEAKER_00]: possible today, as I truly do appreciate
the opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to especially thank all those that
have opened their doors, literally,
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses, fields, dispensaries,
homes, hearts, and minds, to me this past
[SPEAKER_00]: two and a half years of research.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been introduced to every part of the
industry, spoke with hundreds of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in case anyone questions if there's
enough data out there, I can honestly tell
[SPEAKER_00]: you, if you want to come and visit my
office, there are over 20,000 page of
[SPEAKER_00]: academic and industry research out there
available if people are just willing to
[SPEAKER_00]: look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that comes from academic blogs,
emails, information that's available
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to especially thank Susan Sories of
CARE for all the introductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because without her, I've never been able
to meet many of you in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally have been up and down this
state and no one has ever turned us away
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk to us in a research, in a
confidential way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of you that listened to the radio
talk show we did a couple weeks ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: we were pretty open about that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've attended Humboldt and their work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been at Fresno County when they ruled
the growing of cannabis outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know those board of supervisors since I
was one and I sat in the audience that day
[SPEAKER_00]: and listened to the lack of reasoning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And keep in mind that you're going to hear
in this is that it's without bias if it
[SPEAKER_00]: should be or not be, because that's my
job, but there are some built-in biases
[SPEAKER_00]: and I will point those out.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I begin my observations today,
I want to preface it by stating that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have read the current iterations of AB
243, 266, and 643 SB, and yet as a market
[SPEAKER_00]: economist, I stand by the challenges and
threats that I see that will impede a free
[SPEAKER_00]: market environment and that will cause
some degree of market failure going
[SPEAKER_00]: forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: My observations are not just focused on
the approach, compromises, appeasements,
[SPEAKER_00]: and or interpretation of the medical
marijuana law and administration thereof,
[SPEAKER_00]: but rather an all-encompassing marketplace
that will exist if and when recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is approved by the voters of
California, because it's all tied
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to make it clear that even
though I may disagree with some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: actions taken and or proposed,
I do strongly acknowledge the efforts of
[SPEAKER_00]: so many trying to do what they think is
right for the industry and the communities
[SPEAKER_00]: of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let us always acknowledge that the fact,
and it's a fact I've always reminded
[SPEAKER_00]: people at the state level, Californians,
100% of Californians, those of you living
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting in this audience, at the end of
the day live in local governments.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one lives in the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live in local governments and therefore
the vested interest by local governments
[SPEAKER_00]: is the heart and soul of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to recognize that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our communities are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to confirm I am not part of
the cannabis industry or have I ever been
[SPEAKER_00]: compensated at any time or in any way by
any entity in the last two and a half
[SPEAKER_00]: years for my research.
[SPEAKER_00]: My comments today come from a diverse
background of being a farmer, a professor
[SPEAKER_00]: of economics and public policy,
and as a 25-year veteran of government
[SPEAKER_00]: service.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a practice and economist and public
policy practitioner, I typically do
[SPEAKER_00]: research in a way to try and limit bias
and rather report what it seems to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: facts or strong opinions about a
particular subject by those within this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry or those of the older side of the
industry, and what you heard today was
[SPEAKER_00]: just a touch of, and those of you that are
part of the industry, more than any other
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture crop, and we have 450 of them
in Fresno County alone in the Central
[SPEAKER_00]: Valley, that this is a very complex
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: My research into the California cannabis
and the prospects of full legalization had
[SPEAKER_00]: taken me on a physical research trip all
across California and a virtual research
[SPEAKER_00]: journey across the US and around the
globe.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've exerted the utmost effort to limit
bias in my work, but as a farmer of a
[SPEAKER_00]: number of crops for over 40 years,
as a past CEO of one of the world's
[SPEAKER_00]: largest multinational specialty companies
out of London, and as a California local
[SPEAKER_00]: elected government official for 20 years,
I have a built-in firsthand knowledge of
[SPEAKER_00]: both growing and governance, and as the
president of CSAC, I can tell you how many
[SPEAKER_00]: times we lived with the unintended
consequences of both referendums and
[SPEAKER_00]: legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given my background, I am going to present
information embedded in academic theory
[SPEAKER_00]: and research today, but I will also step
out beyond that and give some personal
[SPEAKER_00]: opinions of unintended consequences or
threats that possibly are on the path of
[SPEAKER_00]: the journey to a new and modified medical
marijuana market and or for recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: use in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also want to point out that we should
never forget that cannabis begins as an
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture product and therefore shares
all the risk and challenges of a growing
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, and like all farmers, cannabis
growers are price takers and therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: subject to real and artificial changes of
supply and demand in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that I've noticed in
this legislation, there are some
[SPEAKER_00]: artificial barricades the way it is right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they'll work that out and I'll touch
a little bit on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a free market society, a competitive
market is composed of many buyers and
[SPEAKER_00]: sellers of goods that are fairly
unrestrained to trade on products and
[SPEAKER_00]: services and negotiate an ultimate market
price that reaches what we call
[SPEAKER_00]: equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know basic economics, what we as
consumers are willing to pay, and what
[SPEAKER_00]: growers need in order to make a profit,
or at least break even.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where the buyer and seller reach a
satisfactory level of consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The buyers consider to be a fair price and
they have the willingness and ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: pay for what producers, growers need to
cover their costs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully that is profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real question here is how free and
competitive can the California cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: market truly be?
[SPEAKER_00]: Given the possible restraints of
interstate, because right now it's
[SPEAKER_00]: interstate, within the confines of the
state of California, and possibly no
[SPEAKER_00]: interstate consumers across the U.S.,
even though we know part of the production
[SPEAKER_00]: currently goes interstate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The current proposed legislation changes
will satisfy the concerns as many at the
[SPEAKER_00]: state and local levels, but a number of
changes will impede any chance to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: fair and competitive marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: As government imposes more and more
restrictions in the marketplace,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will cause distortions to what the
ultimate supply and demand equilibrium
[SPEAKER_00]: might be, and is further distorted if the
grower is disallowed to be competitive by
[SPEAKER_00]: lack of diversification or use of vertical
efficiencies, which we talked about
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: In my opinion, as it is proposed by some
right now, the new California medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana stands to be restrained by lack
of vertical integration of the grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Market power may be prevalent by those
that have the power of distribution The
[SPEAKER_00]: market will be oversupplied by new
producers and potential offsetting demand
[SPEAKER_00]: diminished by some regional opt-outs and
the right of local governments to tax,
[SPEAKER_00]: I quote, the Senate bill, privilege of
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a farmer, I've never seen language
where it became a privilege to grow an
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other major threat to a large
oversupply in the interstate, within the
[SPEAKER_00]: state market, will be the current
estimated significant amount of state
[SPEAKER_00]: sales of California cannabis production
that are forced back into the intrastate
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, we know some estimate,
heard it on the radio show that it was on,
[SPEAKER_00]: about 80% of the cannabis, sorry,
80, I started becoming that professor,
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% of estimated cannabis in production in
California could be going out of state,
[SPEAKER_00]: either through policy or by enforcement,
just think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what that number is,
but let's just take it from a mathematical
[SPEAKER_00]: point of view right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the production units, let's call it a
thousand units, that could be tons,
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if 20% of that is in state and 80%
leaves, if you reduce the amount of export
[SPEAKER_00]: out of this state into the rest of the
United States, it would be a 50% decrease
[SPEAKER_00]: to that, but it would be a 400% increase
to the supply and you would be totally
[SPEAKER_00]: oversupplied.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if California growers were going to
worry, and the reason I bring that up is
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't know what the Fed or other
enforcement agencies might want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to be legally intrastate,
is there going to be further pressure to
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the amount of interstate out of the
state of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could have a profound impact on local
supply and ultimately much lower prices to
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: This, of course, might be opposite trend
if in fact the restrictions and possible
[SPEAKER_00]: taxation structures forces some growers to
the alternative market place, and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say that fees and structures become
too high, and since marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, and the black market are
replacement products, growers put in a
[SPEAKER_00]: devious position or a dubious position of
being overtaxed, overfeed may decide that
[SPEAKER_00]: their only alternative is the export
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we think about fees, fines,
and taxes, it is important to first degree
[SPEAKER_00]: that even in a free marketplace,
some level of fee and taxation is
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable in a democratic society where
it is understood that government
[SPEAKER_00]: participation of some limited degree is
necessary for services and oversight to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent market failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: The definition of a market failure in a
free market is when a market fails,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's due to the inefficient allocation of
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: This can be from a number of variables,
but more typically is from negative
[SPEAKER_00]: externalities, they were talking about
environmental impacts, such as impacts and
[SPEAKER_00]: costs on third parties, such as the
environment, other property owners,
[SPEAKER_00]: or local governments, or perceived impacts
to local governments, or it can be where
[SPEAKER_00]: market power causes a failure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Market power is one I'm concerned about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Market power is defined where an
individual actor, a group of actors in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market have substantial influence on the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe that research indicates quite
clearly to some degree that in some
[SPEAKER_00]: regions, there has been market failures
due to environmental impacts, and that was
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: On those environmental impacts,
I guess the only thing that I would say as
[SPEAKER_00]: a grower, I would just like to see
cannabis treated like any other crop
[SPEAKER_00]: that's grown in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by that, I'm not saying give it away
out, I'm saying we got the Air Board,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got the Water Control Board,
we got Cal EPA, but don't look at it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: demon crop, look at it as any crop,
and therefore, apply the same kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies, research, and requirements,
and I'll talk about that in a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fines, I wanted to touch on fines just a
moment from a civil fine point of view,
[SPEAKER_00]: as criminal fees, of course, are and will
be very much adjudicated in the California
[SPEAKER_00]: court system, as established by current or
future laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I raise this point as a way of
making sure that any civil fines remain in
[SPEAKER_00]: current law with agencies such as Air
Boards, Cal EPA, the Water Board,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, and that cannabis be treated
like any other agriculture crop if in
[SPEAKER_00]: violation in the growing process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any new civil fine structures must be
required by state statute to ensure no
[SPEAKER_00]: local agency can be empowered to impose
fines outside the state restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm concerned about personal bias.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a past county supervisor, no one stands
for local home rule more than I,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when it comes to health and
safety, but my concern is where personal
[SPEAKER_00]: bias dictates public policy beyond the
constraints of statute.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have seen that all over the United
States in things other than cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: where people in personal positions have
decided not to go by the law of the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: In taxes, the purpose of a tax on a good
or service is typically expected in the
[SPEAKER_00]: realm of good public policy to pay for
necessary specific or general oversight of
[SPEAKER_00]: the function of society, to mitigate the
externalities, the impacts, negative
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts of products, services,
and use of private and public goods,
[SPEAKER_00]: and yes, to raise general and specific
funds to operate local, state,
[SPEAKER_00]: and federal governments, including
education, public policy, infrastructure,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the many responsibilities of
government in a free society.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a few exceptions, most of them most
Americans understand the need for some
[SPEAKER_00]: level of taxation, and the dispute
discussions of taxation usually comes down
[SPEAKER_00]: to the equity and equality in the actual
burden and ultimate distribution of
[SPEAKER_00]: service and benefits of the tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You notice I said a burden of tax,
because as an economist, there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: questioning that any degree of taxation on
a product or service is a burden to the
[SPEAKER_00]: market surplus.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, economic surplus.
[SPEAKER_00]: What consumers have left over if they buy
their products or service and what the
[SPEAKER_00]: producers keep as margin after they sell
their products is the market surplus.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have heard this before, that in many
writings out there about how taxation
[SPEAKER_00]: causes a deadweight loss to a free market
as a revenue collected in taxes is taken
[SPEAKER_00]: from the total market surplus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any time government takes a tax,
it takes it out of the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's in the marketplace, it's spent on
capital improvements, it's spent on labor,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not if it's taxed, even though I say
some tax, and we'll get to that,
[SPEAKER_00]: is necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is my belief there is a false
assumption by some that California
[SPEAKER_00]: taxpayers see that a heavy tax on cannabis
will generate positive outcomes either to
[SPEAKER_00]: local and state government revenue sources
and or to solve other financial issues
[SPEAKER_00]: within their jurisdiction, and therefore,
such tax proposals are needed to pass
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: California taxpayers by nature are not for
excessive taxation or have they
[SPEAKER_00]: traditionally felt comfortable to empower
government entities to tax to solve their
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibilities or misjudgements of
government.
[SPEAKER_00]: Proposition 13 is a great example where
taxpayers rebelled against somewhat open
[SPEAKER_00]: checkbook on taxing property values,
even though some tout the unintended
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences of Prop 13 about the effects
of the restraint put on local governments
[SPEAKER_00]: to tax property in their jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is quite evident that it did curtail
the runaway evaluations of property taxes
[SPEAKER_00]: in some jurisdictions and push taxation
strategies in a more market consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: driven taxation strategy by stimulating
investment by cities and counties into
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial business and retail business
and generated taxes and revenues through
[SPEAKER_00]: user fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: There has been a public policy standard in
California that growers of agriculture
[SPEAKER_00]: products in general have not been burdened
with tax on their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: At their level, other than property tax
increases where capital improvements have
[SPEAKER_00]: been made and have in fact increased the
value of their property.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would of course include personal
property tax on equipment, supplies,
[SPEAKER_00]: etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fees of course, charges mentioned earlier
to pay for oversight and possible
[SPEAKER_00]: mitigation offsets.
[SPEAKER_00]: As price takers, the farmers are price
takers, and what I believe will be an
[SPEAKER_00]: oversupplied market at least in the
interim, short period, first two or three
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any unnecessary burdens of taxation will
force growers out of the market or down
[SPEAKER_00]: another path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry for the reading, but I believe that
California cannabis, at least in the near
[SPEAKER_00]: years, will be sensitive to price
increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we call, and you guys have read about
inelastic and elastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that's inelastic is not price
sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diabetes medicine, like I take,
I'll buy it no matter how much it
[SPEAKER_00]: increases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis at this point is what we call
elastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very price sensitive and it will be
more price sensitive because it has a
[SPEAKER_00]: substitute.
[SPEAKER_00]: A substitute to legal cannabis is the
black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any price increase will make it more
sensitive and force choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: Potential unintended consequences and
threats to the marketplace, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on how the eventual legislation
statute are enacted, the following
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences are possible and are only a
few of many potential impacts some have
[SPEAKER_00]: been talked about today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fees, the allowed fee structures through
the lack of understanding or intent could
[SPEAKER_00]: put the California growers, processors,
and retailers of cannabis in a
[SPEAKER_00]: disadvantage with other regions,
other products, and the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've not understood, I would ask that
question if we didn't have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will at some time in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why we have empowered local government so
much as a compromise to kind of charge
[SPEAKER_00]: fees and charge taxes somewhat with an
open checkbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize that there are some
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I come from local governments and fees
typically are defined that we charge them
[SPEAKER_00]: for the cost only.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cost of oversight and the cost of
mitigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm concerned about some jurisdictions
that already have a bias against the
[SPEAKER_00]: growing packaging or cultivation effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, in the case of cannabis,
if that fee structure is not in statute by
[SPEAKER_00]: the state and has limits to it,
I'm concerned about where that fee
[SPEAKER_00]: structure would go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fines, fines that have or can have local
bias by administrators, law enforcement,
[SPEAKER_00]: or public officials will distort the
marketplace and therefore the choices of
[SPEAKER_00]: both consumers and growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, I'm concerned about the limits on
fees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taxes, taxes should be defined and
purposeful with very distinctive
[SPEAKER_00]: definitions of reason and application that
are set by state statute and cannot be
[SPEAKER_00]: altered or set by local government.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not my belief, even though I come
from local government, that local
[SPEAKER_00]: government should be empowered to set a
tax level that they think is necessary
[SPEAKER_00]: for, because it even says in the current
legislation, it can be for general
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: General purposes can be for a lot of
reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can solve infrastructure problems or
take care of large unfunded pension
[SPEAKER_00]: levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be restricted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a local government advocate,
but the fee and tax structure must be set
[SPEAKER_00]: by the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the questions that we've talked a
little bit about is even though it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: require a vote for a local board of
supervisors to charge a fee, it takes a
[SPEAKER_00]: vote to raise a tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should be very concerned about at what
tax level that's going to be set.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, when I was a supervisor,
if it was for a specific reason,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could pass at 51%.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it was for a general reason,
it had to be two-thirds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pardon?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it, because if money goes into
the general coffers of any local
[SPEAKER_00]: government, they can spend it how they
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taxpayers are more concerned, and you can
check on that, but I think you'll find
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless, it's the question.
[SPEAKER_00]: The question is at what threshold could a
local government tax cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: The Senate bill says they can even tax
growers for the privilege of growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to be concerned about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally agree with that you need the
voters to do that, but the threshold of
[SPEAKER_00]: the vote should be important to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the taxation is above what is
considerable, equitable for the defined
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose, it will surely drive some
consumers and growers to the substitute
[SPEAKER_00]: product, which is the black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: In no realm can I consider that any tax
structure that puts a privilege tax on
[SPEAKER_00]: growers makes any economic or charity
sense, as they truly are the risk takers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in this area, and they talked a
little bit about it, if growers ... I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: very much in this industry, because the
industries I come from, we survive many
[SPEAKER_00]: times by having co-ops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grower co-ops, I think, are very necessary
in this industry because you are small.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the margins are going to be small,
but you can't have a co-op if it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: allow vertical integration, because co-ops
don't just grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The power of a co-op is to grow it,
bring it in, package it together,
[SPEAKER_00]: negotiate the price, ship it, and then
deliver it to your growers on a parity
[SPEAKER_00]: basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a co-op is a very important part
of what's necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They should be granted the same reverence
given to all agrarian stewards.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talk about all growers in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should not punish an emerging valid
industry due to actions of some bad
[SPEAKER_00]: players in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a prop.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you guys said over here was great,
and I think you said that, is treated,
[SPEAKER_00]: because no one wants herbicide and
pesticide on cannabis more than I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the power of value added.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of you asked about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to give value, it's kind of
like growing ... I grow pomegranates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I ship them all over the world,
and they're organic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get value because they know what I've
used and not used.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need the same thing with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the last thing is market power.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless we are very, very careful about
watching who has the power of distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: and make sure that we close all the gaps,
some could become power players,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's not going to be growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers are going to be trying to just
survive and barely survive in this market
[SPEAKER_00]: for the next few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The co-ops would help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: This could easily happen if the structure
just allows growers to have efficiency and
[SPEAKER_00]: capabilities and some degree of vertical
integration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the distribution of retail is
controlled by a chosen few, it will surely
[SPEAKER_00]: cause a degree of market power,
causing damage to the grower, consumer,
[SPEAKER_00]: and ultimately to those seeking tax
revenues in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, in a free market society,
what you want is you want the sellers and
[SPEAKER_00]: buyers to be creative and create a lot of
revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where you get total tax revenue,
is the highest volume we can get with a
[SPEAKER_00]: lowest tax, and we look for that
equilibrium.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just concerned about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they've done fabulous work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The things I'm bringing up today are just
the questions that if you don't ask over
[SPEAKER_00]: the next several months and by 2016,
it's the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want the answers, we have to ask
the questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's been a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've talked to so many of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's great hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry needs to be legitimized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get asked all the time after two and a
half years how big it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one knows because we can't measure it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called one of the favorite things in
the economic world we say is if we can
[SPEAKER_00]: measure it, we can manage it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we should ask our legislatures is to
allow us to measure it so we can manage
[SPEAKER_00]: it, and to take the handcuffs off the
growers and the distribution to allow this
[SPEAKER_00]: to become a true marketplace, legitimize
the product, and let this build into
[SPEAKER_00]: something that would be substantial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: You mentioned how the states might impose
punitive fees in a way that would not be
[SPEAKER_02]: advantageous to the industry, but isn't
that also part of a free market that if
[SPEAKER_02]: some municipalities want to say,
look, we've got to buy us against this,
[SPEAKER_02]: then the businesses will move to other
municipalities that are very welcoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't do that in the alcohol industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is cannabis, or aspirin, or I can name
a number of products, why do we empower
[SPEAKER_00]: local government?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to one of my students at one
of the universities I teach the other day.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's from France.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, I don't understand this.
[SPEAKER_00]: He was reading the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, in France, if we pass something,
it's good for the whole country.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to pass something in
California and few areas say you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to have it here.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not a free market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free market is where both sellers and
buyers can get together in an open market.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to be a market that's going
to have market failures in certain areas
[SPEAKER_00]: because of those restrictions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it may just be something we work
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you guys mentioned, great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be if you were at first some don't
want it and decide later on as everything
[SPEAKER_00]: comes along, it will work that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But unless you're knocking on those doors,
if you're a grower, how do you know where
[SPEAKER_00]: your product is going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you know who's going to opt out and
who's not?
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be like the products that I sell,
my pomegranates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can only sell them in King's County,
it has X value.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can sell them in 10 counties,
it has a different value.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can sell them worldwide, it changes
the value of that product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read all the bills and watched all
your guys work, God bless you,
[SPEAKER_00]: and talked to a lot of other attorneys
about it and I still can't get that
[SPEAKER_00]: interpretation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All I can see right now is that the only
restriction that I really see a local
[SPEAKER_00]: government can decide what level of
taxation it needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing they're restricted by is
the thing that we don't know the answer to
[SPEAKER_00]: is at what threshold will the voters
permit that to be, but I didn't see any
[SPEAKER_00]: constraints on what that tax would be and
or what the fees could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some counties, I can tell you coming from
CalPERS that I'm for pensions and for all
[SPEAKER_00]: that, but there are some jurisdictions
that are financially struggling,
[SPEAKER_00]: pensions, infrastructure, and others that
need a bigger percentage of something than
[SPEAKER_00]: others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a way?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the reason most of the time I like
governance from the bottom up.
[SPEAKER_00]: In this case, I would love to see guidance
from the state that puts in law the
[SPEAKER_00]: maximum amount of tax that can be charged
by local government and fees because if
[SPEAKER_00]: not, who decides?
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like there's a basic
contradiction with calling it medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't tax medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm glad to see the guys that you have
working on this from the legislature
[SPEAKER_00]: because they understand medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is first of all, you need to
recognize it as a true agriculture crop
[SPEAKER_00]: for what it is, number one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two is if the people have voted and said
that medical marijuana makes sense,
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's legal in California,
then you need to recognize it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and treat it that way,
then first of all, you wouldn't be taxing
[SPEAKER_00]: a medical product and you certainly
wouldn't be taxing the growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Tony.
[SPEAKER_01]: Round of applause, please, for Tony.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope the legislators are listening
carefully to an academic who actually
[SPEAKER_01]: studies and gets deep into the effects of
these things and we know we do have to do
[SPEAKER_01]: clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
