[SPEAKER_00]: That year was a very successful year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew over 500 pounds, top-notch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, really top-notch since EMEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys wanted to do it again the
next year, and they were bringing in money
[SPEAKER_00]: people, right, who were just drug dealers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't feel good about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like the people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't like the fact that they wanted to
upscale so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all became the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was more interested in the actual
growing and seeing what happened and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next year, they bought 140 acres
further away from where we originally grew
[SPEAKER_00]: and went at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was back in California when I got a
call in July to come out there and help
[SPEAKER_00]: them, and I didn't really want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I relented because a few of the
people, they had sunk everything they had
[SPEAKER_00]: into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went back there to rescue them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was hard to believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had gone through a whole year of
growing this very successful crop and
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't seem to have learned anything
because they went from a place that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were growing in, like bottomland,
really rich, beautiful soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we had to do nothing to the soil,
really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could put your hand in it and just
reach this beautiful soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was really easy to grow there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where did they buy this land?
[SPEAKER_00]: They bought it at another 1,000,
1,500 feet higher where the soil was rocky
[SPEAKER_00]: and sandy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And additionally, New York State that year
had a drought.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I come and look at the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have no nutrients and no water.
[SPEAKER_00]: No wonder they're not growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, I kind of remedied that and got
them growing well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometime in late August, I had to come
back to Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I said, you know, I'll be back and
we'll be ready to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: This crop would have been over a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would have been over a ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as I was flying, flying back,
they got busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they lost everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of them ended up in jail,
partly because New York didn't understand
[SPEAKER_00]: growing at that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The year before, I was standing in this
wonderful field and one of the guys came
[SPEAKER_00]: out and he showed me a local newspaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: The headline was that they estimated that
the New York State marijuana crop that
[SPEAKER_00]: year would be worth a half a million
dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm thinking, it's worth more right
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's how little they knew about
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when they got busted the next year,
they didn't end up in jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just lost everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lost a fortune.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were lucky back then though.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were lucky for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, I never got busted in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never been arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it had to do with luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it had to do with the fact
that I didn't personally sell marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't sell seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't sell anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I made money from my writing and my
photography.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the other words, I didn't take anything
except all these offers to come to Hawaii,
[SPEAKER_00]: come to here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do the growing for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll make a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that wasn't really my interest so
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really was fascinated with the plant,
the botany, and that's the way I went.
Thank you.
Thank you.
