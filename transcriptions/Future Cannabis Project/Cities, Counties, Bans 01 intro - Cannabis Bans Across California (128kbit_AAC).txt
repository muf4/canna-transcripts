[SPEAKER_04]: This is Jackie McGowan, and I am the owner
of Band-Aid Consulting Firm, which is a
[SPEAKER_04]: direct result to this Facebook group that
Susan says I started.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm here today because I am forever
indebted to a plant and the people that
[SPEAKER_04]: provide it for me in this room today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thank all of you that risk their lives
and their safety in order to be in this
room today.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, at the beginning of this year,
I began a Facebook group called California
[SPEAKER_04]: City and County Band Watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're not a member and you're looking
to be up to date on current marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: policy in the state, I'm obsessed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw the first wave of bands hit our
state after the passage of MRSA last year,
[SPEAKER_04]: and in November, I saw about 10 come
through in one day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I realized that there was something
going on that we weren't aware of.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason that I saw this was due to
some Google alerts that I had set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: My background is I worked on Wall Street
for 18 years as a stockbroker,
[SPEAKER_04]: so I am a research junkie.
[SPEAKER_04]: I crave information.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I saw this first wave come through,
and I didn't know, I didn't understand,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I knew there had to be other people
out there that wanted more information
[SPEAKER_04]: like this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, on January 2nd, I knew that our
legislature would be reconvening
[SPEAKER_04]: statewide.
[SPEAKER_04]: On January 4th, there was set to be
massive bands being implemented across the
[SPEAKER_04]: state.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, that was actually the second wave,
but most people think that that was the
[SPEAKER_04]: first wave because it was when I formed
this group.
[SPEAKER_04]: And January, we got massacred.
[SPEAKER_04]: The League of California Cities was on a
roadshow encouraging all of our local
[SPEAKER_04]: government to ban instead of regulate.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were pushing that erroneous deadline
that was passed in MRSA, which was the
[SPEAKER_04]: March 1st deadline.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the time it had been repealed,
we had, I believe, 240 localities that had
[SPEAKER_04]: banned marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, my background being that I worked on
Wall Street, I was craving this
[SPEAKER_04]: information.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I set up 540 Google email alerts,
one for every city and every county.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, 482 cities and 58 counties so that I
could see everything going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I still have all those Google alerts set
up, and I still search what is going on,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, with our cities and counties and
what they're regulating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And right now, I believe about 20% of the
state is either implementing regulations
[SPEAKER_04]: or talking about regulations, and that is
up from about 10% just a few months ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, we are definitely seeing progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now, I'd like to give each of our
speakers a chance to introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dami.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of stuff that I can talk
about, but I guess the one that I'm going
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about is Prop D in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prop D is probably the worst legislation
that has ever been written to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, for a city in the history of the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but it kept us alive, and that's
why, you know, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the only thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we're in the process of working with
the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Six months ago, we gave the city of Los
Angeles an ordinance that was written by
[SPEAKER_00]: Mayor Brown, which is one of the most
prestigious law firms in Los Angeles,
[SPEAKER_00]: to ensure that they have a framework that
they can work with that won't be suable.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is our main, it's different now.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started this 10 years ago,
we had to beg to talk to elected
[SPEAKER_00]: officials.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Koretz always welcomed us and was
always wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most of the city council members,
you know, it was like we were begging
[SPEAKER_00]: them, please listen to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things have changed now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The politics have caught up to the
science, and so everybody understands that
[SPEAKER_00]: medical marijuana is just that,
it's medical, and that also that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot to be gained by tax income in the
city, which everybody, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: really likes that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's why the politicians are so
ready and so able now to help us go along,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they know we're here to stay,
we're not going away, and that better for
[SPEAKER_00]: them to regulate us in a correct manner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that they can collect their taxes
for the city and everybody can be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope that in March we're able to do
something in the city of LA to fix D
[SPEAKER_00]: because it needs to be fixed, and so that
we can join the rest of the state in being
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated by MRSA and whatever else comes
along, and we can all step up in Los
[SPEAKER_00]: Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead, Paul.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Yami.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know where to start,
but I could say I was the author of Prop
[SPEAKER_02]: D.
[SPEAKER_02]: So bad introduction, but let me start at
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just having a meeting with some
folks about talking about cultivation,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they said, so where do you get your
marijuana?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've been involved in this issue
very visibly for years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I'm not a marijuana user.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were astonished.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now have I ever smoked a joint in my
entire life?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I wasn't college in the 70s.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to say anything about
whether I inhaled or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not a marijuana user.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm involved because I got elected to the
city council in 1988, but I was involved
[SPEAKER_02]: in founding the city of West Hollywood in
1984.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did it for all kinds of good
reasons, and all of it went perfectly,
[SPEAKER_02]: except the AIDS crisis hit, and it hit
with a vengeance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were the hardest hit city per person in
the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I personally, as I mean,
this is a disease that in West Hollywood
[SPEAKER_02]: mostly hit gay men.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a straight guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally knew over 200 people that
died of AIDS, and there were many,
[SPEAKER_02]: many more.
[SPEAKER_02]: At one point, we had over one person in
every 10 housing units in the city had HIV
[SPEAKER_02]: or AIDS.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the beginning of the week,
we had no medicine for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing we had was medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it improved the quality of life,
and it kept some people alive longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It dealt with the nausea.
[SPEAKER_02]: It dealt with the wasting and kept people
with an appetite.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were so many elements to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It dealt with the pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have friends that are alive today
because they lasted long enough as a
[SPEAKER_02]: bridge to get to this strong stronger
drugs, and people like Richard Eastman,
[SPEAKER_02]: who some of you know, and others are still
around today 30 years later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that got me involved in the issue,
and I've been involved from that time,
[SPEAKER_02]: that whole 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when John Vasconcelos drafted SB
420, people were really terrified to be
[SPEAKER_02]: associated with marijuana in the
legislature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was the principal co-author on the
assembly side.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there weren't a lot of other
co-authors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there might have been one other
person.
[SPEAKER_02]: People ultimately voted for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was written in a very compromise-y way
to get passed, but it was so vague that
[SPEAKER_02]: its regulations caused as many problems as
they solved.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ultimately, we tried to correct that with
Prop D.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Los Angeles, we took so many
different approaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every step we took in every direction
caused us to get hammered legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So no matter what we tried, it didn't
work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prop D was the only thing that stuck.
[SPEAKER_02]: But before that, we passed things that
were more permissive, and we legally got
[SPEAKER_02]: hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We actually had a vote at one point to ban
marijuana, and that passed 13-1.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was the one vote against it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yet we found that there are too many
legal problems with that, so we repealed
[SPEAKER_02]: that right away, also.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only had one colleague who was an
enthusiastic supporter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think because of his presence on the
council, Prop D passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: His name was Bill Rosendahl.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if any of you know him or
remember him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wonderful guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he was a medical marijuana user
because three years before he died,
[SPEAKER_02]: he was diagnosed with fourth-stage cancer
and was literally just about dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought he was going to last a couple
weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: He reacted well to chemotherapy,
and he survived all of his side effects
[SPEAKER_02]: and the pain and lack of appetite and all
kinds of other things because of medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kept him alive for three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that made the council see that
they had to accept something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, Prop D was vague, partly because we
were told it had to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were told we couldn't license because
it was illegal by our city attorney.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we sort of had a list of people that we
would give a wink and a nod, and under
[SPEAKER_02]: Prop D, they would be compliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even then, we didn't have a list of
who they all were.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sometimes we would crack down even on
the people that we were supposed to not
[SPEAKER_02]: crack down on, and our city attorney would
go after them.
[SPEAKER_02]: At the same time, we had 135 that were
semi-legit in this unclear way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We probably have a thousand that are
illegal that have popped up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we tried to prosecute them and close
them down.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for every one that got closed down,
another one would pop up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's been a mess.
[SPEAKER_02]: State legislation, I think, will help.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we will figure out how to deal
with things that we should be dealing
[SPEAKER_02]: with, like cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, right now, we deal with marijuana
by immaculate conception.
[SPEAKER_02]: But somehow, it gets to the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it's there, it's legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we catch you growing it in L.A.,
we prosecute you.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we catch you transporting it to a
dispensary, we prosecute you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, this makes great sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are working to try and correct it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also a question of how many
dispensaries we're going to have,
[SPEAKER_02]: which ones are going to be legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: We think around 65 of the original 135
that were compliant are still in business.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do we grandfather them in?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of question about fair
distribution, ethnically, geographically
[SPEAKER_02]: in the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's an appetite to fill that
all in.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's equal access across the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we pass Prop 64, which I think is
absolutely inevitable, there's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: much more demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think if we have too few
dispensaries, we'll have the problem that
[SPEAKER_02]: my council has reacted to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that they're anti-marijuana,
but there were some nuisance factors.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were some bad operators of
facilities, and council members responded
[SPEAKER_02]: to constituent complaints.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, if we have too few dispensaries,
we're going to have lines around the
[SPEAKER_02]: block.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to have a lot of the
complaints that my colleagues complained
[SPEAKER_02]: about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have to at least provide enough
dispensaries to meet the demand.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are a lot of confusion issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: is kind of a mess on this, but I think we
will clean this up before the deadline for
[SPEAKER_02]: permitting goes into effect, hopefully a
lot sooner so we cannot arrest people for
[SPEAKER_02]: no purpose and we can get this show on the
road and start doing it the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure my colleagues care that much
about the revenue.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it will be a nice added bonus.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I should say is we thought we were
going to have to put something on the
[SPEAKER_02]: ballot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our city attorney is opine that we can do
everything but tax by ordinance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think we should just keep our 6% tax
where it is at least for a while and just
[SPEAKER_02]: focus on doing this right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not put it on the ballot, pass an
ordinance that works, and get going.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't it a breath of fresh air to hear a
regulator admit that there are problems
[SPEAKER_04]: with an ordinance?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Paul.
[SPEAKER_04]: Janine, tell us a little bit about you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, first of all, I'd like to welcome
everybody here to Long Beach and the
[SPEAKER_05]: second district.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are in my district which I have been
representative for just about two months.
[SPEAKER_05]: So welcome, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm originally from Texas and I grew up
always knowing that marijuana had
[SPEAKER_05]: medicinal purposes.
[SPEAKER_05]: My mother used it and she, the first time
I did, she gave it to me to help with my
[SPEAKER_05]: cramps and said, if you go to the doctor
and cry or, you know, you can do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was something that, that was the
frame that I always had.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I came to the issues of medical
marijuana, to the debate about it with a
[SPEAKER_05]: very open mind even though I'm not an avid
user, although also college and high
[SPEAKER_05]: school.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll admit I did inhale.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so when I started running for council,
it was one of those issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in Long Beach, and I'll talk about the
history of our, you know, sorted debate
[SPEAKER_05]: about to regulate, not regulate,
and what to regulate in a minute.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I came to the debate and the
conversation very openly in support of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wasn't going to try to walk the line that
I think other electeds have tried to walk
[SPEAKER_05]: in the city because we have a more
conservative background, because we've
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of been timid of regulating it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very openly being able to say,
we need to have access to medicine for all
[SPEAKER_05]: of our residents that doesn't hinge on a
delivery system where you're putting
[SPEAKER_05]: people at risk for robbery that doesn't
hinge on other cities.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, getting their tax revenue in
Long Beach missing out.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Long Beach is definitely moving in the
right direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a regulator, I think it's really
important to start in cities and partner
[SPEAKER_05]: with folks like you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because as much as we can be supportive of
an idea or concepts, how it works is,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's the devil in the details.
[SPEAKER_05]: As we've heard from LA and other places,
whenever we try to do ordinances,
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes we have to learn from those
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so working closely with you all to
talk about what works, what doesn't,
[SPEAKER_05]: what's the right amount of dispensaries to
have grow and everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'm really happy to be here with
you guys today and to learn from you all
[SPEAKER_05]: to move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I do believe that in November,
Long Beach has two ballot measures,
[SPEAKER_05]: which I'll talk about, but MM,
which is medical marijuana, bringing that
[SPEAKER_05]: back to the city.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now it's banned.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then another initiative that the city
council put on the ballot to tackle both
[SPEAKER_05]: medical and recreational at a higher rate
than is already taxed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I'll talk in detail about both of
those as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Janine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nathan, tell us a little bit about you.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Nathan Vosburg.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from the city of Kalinga.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are currently the only city in Fresno
County that has moved forward with
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look on weed maps, there is a very
giant hole in the Central Valley about
[SPEAKER_01]: like this, which in my opinion has
promoted a very gray and very black market
[SPEAKER_01]: area.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when the issue came in January
and we were asked to make a decision,
[SPEAKER_01]: to me personally, I thought in my mind,
you know, this is something doing research
[SPEAKER_01]: beforehand that could help a lot of
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I looked into the audience,
and our audience was pretty much at that
[SPEAKER_01]: point in time, I think maybe they're the
only people that paid attention to the
[SPEAKER_01]: agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they were 100% in for this at the
time, I believe, almost 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our next meeting, it wasn't so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: People found out what we wanted to do with
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had a big group of people show up
that were not in support of what we wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was really an interesting thing to
try and somewhat sell ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went through with our citizens
on the idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we went through quite a few different
phases in trying to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We fought the medical battle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went back and forth with our citizens
on who supported this for medical use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we went through, you know,
the security and what comes along with
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing facilities, which we were
initially talking about a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's when we had our first 5-0 vote,
which pretty much shocked everyone in
[SPEAKER_01]: Fresno County, because everyone,
including our sheriff, was completely
[SPEAKER_01]: against this kind of idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of shocked the council, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were kind of like, you know,
interested, like, hey, we have a group of
[SPEAKER_01]: people in front of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those people wanted it, so we did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I'm here to tell you guys is,
is that I want to thank every single
[SPEAKER_01]: person in this room for providing us with
the data, with the ideas, with the
[SPEAKER_01]: research to move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because without you people, this doesn't
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, in council, in government,
our job is to promote what the people want
[SPEAKER_01]: and to make compromise most of the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finding out how to compromise in
between something where people are what
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm finding a 50-50 split in our
conservative area, maybe even 60-40 on the
[SPEAKER_01]: other side.
[SPEAKER_01]: California-wise, it may be 60-40,
70-30 towards AUMA passing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a very conservative belt of the
Central Valley, it may be flipped.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so trying to figure out a way to
compromise with both sides has been very
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been taking the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been, you know, when I joined
Jackie's Facebook group, it was for just
[SPEAKER_01]: that, to get the data.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to take the data back to our
council and say, hey, this is what other
[SPEAKER_01]: counties and cities are doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the information from the
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have visited lots of different
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've visited GROS.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've visited all kinds of different
places to try and figure out, like,
[SPEAKER_01]: what is best practice?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the things that come with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the good actors?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the bad actors?
[SPEAKER_01]: And everyone in this room probably has had
something to do with, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: us trying to figure this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just want to really thank everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because without that, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I couldn't, my people wouldn't relate
to this in Kalinga at all if there wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: other people saying, hey, this is what
we've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is what it's worked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this isn't just, you know,
your cliche of potheads and stoners out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your people that are seeking some
kind of help that don't want to go the
[SPEAKER_01]: traditional route or the traditional route
isn't working for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'd like to thank Susan for putting
this together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to thank Jackie for her
Facebook group who has allowed,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, our city and other cities like
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I'm going to talk about today
is that journey that we went on and the
[SPEAKER_01]: different perils that we've went through
trying to move forward to provide
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what this is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is opportunity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you think that 50, that we're
going to do something for 50 percent of
[SPEAKER_01]: the people in my place that support
medical and the other 50 percent of the
[SPEAKER_01]: people who don't believe in it,
well, that just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's what we found.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found that that doesn't work because
you have a divide in people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to find a topic or a narrative
that fits everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we found that jobs and economy fit
everyone's narrative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I want to show you guys something.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have this green wristband on right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This green wristband is in support of the
thing that we couldn't do in Kalinga,
[SPEAKER_01]: which was we couldn't pass a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put it on the ballot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ballot's coming up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is my support right here for that
ballot measure to say that I support a
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary in Kalinga.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, we had to compromise.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to say we listen to our people and
our people are citing security concerns
[SPEAKER_01]: and all kinds of things, you know,
to do with dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel really bad that we couldn't get
that moved forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I do feel confident that our people
will come around and say, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what, you guys are going to show
us the opportunities and we are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: respond.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for everyone here today,
you know, I hope that you follow us in
[SPEAKER_01]: Kalinga.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have lots of opportunity popping up in
the Central Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I believe that with a little push that
the rest of the valley is going to turn
[SPEAKER_01]: green as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I appreciate you guys for coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Nathan.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's important to note that by
him sticking his neck out, by Kalinga
[SPEAKER_04]: moving forward with regulations,
there are now two more cities inside of
[SPEAKER_04]: Fresno County looking to regulate that
called him up and said, hey, we want some
[SPEAKER_04]: of these jobs, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I attended one of those city council
meetings and it was jam packed with people
[SPEAKER_04]: that did not care one way or another about
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were there because they heard jobs
were coming and their lives were going to
[SPEAKER_04]: change.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, Nathan.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next up is Don Saylor from Yolo County.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Jackie.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a pleasure to hear the stories of
these three city council members in their
[SPEAKER_03]: very different settings.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you see some common commitment to
doing the right thing for people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a county supervisor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm in my second term in Yolo County.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a city council member for two years,
two terms in Davis, California,
[SPEAKER_03]: and a school board member for two terms
prior to that in the same community.
[SPEAKER_03]: I worked for state government for about 25
years before I retired in 2003.
[SPEAKER_03]: My jobs in state government were five
years with the legislative analyst office,
[SPEAKER_03]: nonpartisan fiscal advisor and 20 years
working for the Department of Corrections.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Department of the Youth Authority.
[SPEAKER_03]: In corrections in the mid-80s,
my role was to build new prisons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then realized we can't build enough if
we're going to continue on the trajectory
[SPEAKER_03]: that we've been on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yolo County is about 210,000 people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 1,100 square miles.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 85% of that is farm country.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a hundred year partnership between
the University of California Davis and
[SPEAKER_03]: growers, farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The waves of agriculture have been really
amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's innovation in farm country.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's something that I think of as the
square tomato.
[SPEAKER_03]: The square tomato is this unique
partnership between genetic manipulation
[SPEAKER_03]: and engineering so that we can produce
tomatoes that have a longer shelf life,
[SPEAKER_03]: harder on the outside, and still juicy and
very nutritious on the inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can harvest them and have them
shipped to a place where they can be
[SPEAKER_03]: processed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we created at the same time harvesting
equipment that could handle those products
[SPEAKER_03]: and get them to market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a result of that, our county is the
world's leading producer of processing
[SPEAKER_03]: tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes no sense in the world that we
don't acknowledge the agricultural
[SPEAKER_03]: enterprise that cannabis brings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Yolo County is perfectly situated to
do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited about the changes that we see
afoot because we can see better research
[SPEAKER_03]: on the efficacy of medicinal uses of
cannabis for specific maladies that the
[SPEAKER_03]: human suffers from.
[SPEAKER_03]: And University of California Davis is the
home of a medical school, a life sciences
[SPEAKER_03]: powerhouse, as well as a veterinary school
and just an amazing conglomeration of
[SPEAKER_03]: partnerships with the agricultural
community.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yolo County, when we were faced with this
threat of a March 3rd deadline,
[SPEAKER_03]: we struggled to try to find a way to
balance the interest, this March 3rd
[SPEAKER_03]: deadline that you're either gonna have to
regulate or do some other ban.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the easiest thing to do in the world
was to simply fall back and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: no, we're not gonna do any of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That didn't make sense for our county.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think we have 800 to 1,000 growers in
our county currently.
[SPEAKER_03]: 210,000 people, 800 to 1,000 growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a pretty big number.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know that in the fields and hills that
we already have cultivators.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cultivation is a thing that we wanted
to really look hard at.
[SPEAKER_03]: We found a way to balance, I think,
an ordinance.
[SPEAKER_03]: We adopted it in February.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an interim ordinance.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be considering some tweaks here in
the first week in October.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're looking at a December adoption
of a final ordinance that's based on what
[SPEAKER_03]: we started with and lots of input from
community members We think that probably
[SPEAKER_03]: 800 to 1,000 of those growers out there,
we figure about 20% of them will want to
[SPEAKER_03]: come out of the shadows, will want to
become legitimate operators.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're already seeing, I mentioned that
we had about 11 the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I had a conversation with our ag
commissioner last night and this morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we now have 53 growers that are in the
process of becoming fully permitted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm looking forward to sharing with you
some of the experiences that we've had and
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the challenges that we're
continuing to face.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I will tell you that if you look on
the website, and this is my last comment
[SPEAKER_03]: for this round, you look on the website
for adult use of merit, yes, on Prop 64,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll see this long list of people who
have endorsed AMA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm still stunned that when they asked
me if I would endorse it, I said,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of the 300 county supervisors in
California, mine is the only name on the
[SPEAKER_03]: list.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want you all to talk to some of your
friends who are county supervisors because
[SPEAKER_03]: it was a feeling a little lonely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
