So,
[SPEAKER_02]: hi, I'm Dr. Nadia Saba, the president and
founder of Dr. Greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are an HVAC, well, we're a mechanical
and agricultural engineering firm that
[SPEAKER_02]: specializes in HVAC design for indoor
farms and greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greenhouses is where I got my start trying
to grow mushrooms in a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about challenging or trying to grow,
you know, a crop that likes it damp and
[SPEAKER_02]: cool in a greenhouse in southern Idaho.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a humidity control problem,
but the opposite of what everyone is
[SPEAKER_02]: normally thinking about, we couldn't keep
it wet enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that for me was my aha moment 22
years ago that I wanted to help farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: control their environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, fast forward, went to a PhD,
did my PhD at the University of Arizona
[SPEAKER_02]: where I studied.
[SPEAKER_02]: Greenhouse production of tomatoes and had
a special focus on water use efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it's not always about energy,
sometimes it's about other resources that
[SPEAKER_02]: we are also trying to conserve in our
farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Enough about me, you're going to hear
plenty from me earlier or later,
[SPEAKER_02]: not earlier, later.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to let my panel here introduce
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think some of them have some slides
to share with all of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, thanks.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, hi, I'm Tim Kniff.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm the co-founder and executive vice
president of Little Leaf Farms.
[SPEAKER_08]: Little Leaf Farms, we are five acres of
hydroponic lettuce in Devons,
[SPEAKER_08]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's an NFT mobile gutter system.
[SPEAKER_08]: Should I show the video now or?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, let's do the video.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, do the video real quick.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was always interested in locally grown
food.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been involved with greenhouses for
most of my life.
[SPEAKER_09]: Paul called me up and said, hey listen,
this lettuce business still hasn't been
[SPEAKER_09]: figured out yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: I felt strongly that we could do it a
different way, grow local, and then
[SPEAKER_09]: deliver a better, superior, fresher
product.
[SPEAKER_09]: We basically have learned from,
I think, the best practices around the
[SPEAKER_09]: world and found our own unique way of
operating here at Little Leaf Farms.
[SPEAKER_09]: Over 95% of all the lettuce that we
consume is grown in California and
[SPEAKER_09]: Arizona.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're 3,200 miles away from where they're
growing these products on the West Coast.
[SPEAKER_09]: But for us, it's simpler because we cut
it, we deliver it, and it's in the store
[SPEAKER_09]: within 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're successfully competing against the
proven West Coast operations with close to
[SPEAKER_09]: 10 acres under glass.
[SPEAKER_09]: People didn't know what good lettuce was.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then all of a sudden, we reset the
expectation.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're all about giving the plant what the
plant needs and taking away all stresses.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not in charge.
[SPEAKER_08]: The plants are the ones that are in
charge.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're just living in their world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hydroponic means grown without soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's way easier for the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to work.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just can take it up and enjoy the sun
and just grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Big believer in the sun.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_01]: The light we are running from solar
fields, the water we collect from the
[SPEAKER_01]: rooftop and we use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we throw nothing away.
[SPEAKER_01]: People ask us, what are you doing to the
lettuce?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what we don't do to the lettuce.
[SPEAKER_08]: We never get the lettuce wet.
[SPEAKER_08]: We never spray it with anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: My family eats the lettuce.
[SPEAKER_09]: All my colleagues eat the lettuce.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so I don't want to have pesticide
residue.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't want to have herbicide residue.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't make it travel miles.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't let it sit around.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't treat it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We triple wash it over the course of
moving it through some chlorinated waters
[SPEAKER_08]: for it to have kill steps in it because we
don't need to.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're basically feeding people's families.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's a big responsibility.
[SPEAKER_08]: I really believe this is the right way to
grow lettuce.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that it's a lot more sustainable.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot more efficient.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a lot safer.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it also comes up with a better quality
product.
[SPEAKER_09]: New England at one time was a huge food
producer.
[SPEAKER_09]: We fed ourselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I love the fact that we can be part of
the catalyst in being a driver here.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as we succeed in New England,
we look forward to going to other regions
[SPEAKER_09]: and doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's us.
[SPEAKER_08]: So Paul's the present CEO.
[SPEAKER_08]: He was originally supposed to be here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got unavoidably detained and asked me to
come in instead.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I appreciate the invitation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got some slides, but I'll do those
later, I guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want me to do slides now?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you can go ahead and do the slides
now.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, could you cue my slides, please?
[SPEAKER_08]: So like Paul said, basically we're a
technology taker as opposed to a
[SPEAKER_08]: technology maker.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one of the things that we do is we
take a look at where the technology comes
[SPEAKER_08]: from.
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically it's the Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_08]: Pete, our grower, is a fourth generation
Dutch grower.
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically you take a look is that
there's a country the size of New York
[SPEAKER_08]: state, about a tenth the size of
California, and the number two exporter of
[SPEAKER_08]: food in the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reason that they do that is
simple.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm not sure how many people are
familiar with Holland or the Dutch
[SPEAKER_08]: greenhouse industry, or in particular the
Westlands, which is a picture of this.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been at it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in terms of continuous improvement,
they're there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not just the greenhouse growing industry,
but also glass manufacturers, water
[SPEAKER_08]: systems.
[SPEAKER_08]: The growing system that you saw in our
video is actually from Finland.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Dutch had not figured out what we felt
was a good lettuce growing system.
[SPEAKER_08]: They'd already figured out tomato
industry, cucumber industry, pepper
[SPEAKER_08]: industry, obviously the flower industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: But lettuce and leafy greens, they hadn't
figured out yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: We actually found a Finnish company that
was growing lettuce for about five years
[SPEAKER_08]: in the Arctic Circle that we basically
took it in, brought it in, and then
[SPEAKER_08]: basically continued to refine and retrofit
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The one thing I would say in all of these
sessions that I've gone to and listened to
[SPEAKER_08]: people is that there's not, I'm a produce
guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've got 30 years in the experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: My first job was selling pineapples for
Dull into the Hunts Point Terminal Market
[SPEAKER_08]: in New York City, and I've gone from
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's about the product.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there's not a lot of discussion about
product in these sessions, and maybe it's
[SPEAKER_08]: because of the audience, but the one thing
I would say is that we focus in on the
[SPEAKER_08]: product, the variety, our product
strategy, how we're gonna get to market,
[SPEAKER_08]: because the market's being served.
[SPEAKER_08]: People that wanna put up greenhouses and
feel, well, I'm gonna have a local product
[SPEAKER_08]: and everybody's gonna beat a path to my
door, that is not the case.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have to come in and be able to compete
at, if not better, than the market that's
[SPEAKER_08]: currently serving us.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's basically, our view is the
Salinas Valley.
[SPEAKER_08]: Since we have opened, so it's been,
we've been operating for three years,
[SPEAKER_08]: we actually have the number one skew.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our Baby Crispy Green Lettuce is the
number one selling salad in New England
[SPEAKER_08]: from a single skew.
[SPEAKER_08]: We beat Organic Baby Spinach last year,
which we're pretty excited about,
[SPEAKER_08]: and we're continuing to grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically, it's my job is we,
I came from backyard farms.
[SPEAKER_08]: We ran a 42-acre tomato business out of
Maine, and I had proven basically
[SPEAKER_08]: relationships with all these customers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're in over 2,000 grocery stores in
New England, and we're having a tough time
[SPEAKER_08]: keeping up with demand.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you have to get traction in with these
guys if you're going to actually sell
[SPEAKER_08]: something.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our business is all about scale.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking to basically compete
head-to-head with the Salinas Valley for
[SPEAKER_08]: shelf space and share a stomach,
and that's what we've been basically
[SPEAKER_08]: doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are my slides.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Dave Nichols, Director of Strategy for
App Harvest.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're building a 60-acre lettuce facility,
or sorry, tomato facility in Moorhead,
[SPEAKER_06]: Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're scheduled to open up September of
this year.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of our view that there's a huge
opportunity to build greenhouses at scale
[SPEAKER_06]: in the United States.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of the support, our view here is
there's a high demand for food.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need 70 percent more food in the world
by 2050.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sustainability is a big topic across the
investment community and the economy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Boost of acreage, really, in America.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have between 1,000 and 2,000 acres,
while, as Tim said, in the Netherlands,
[SPEAKER_06]: they have more than 20,000 acres,
second largest exporter of agricultural
[SPEAKER_06]: products in the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a great model.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of room for growth in the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: Agtech ecosystems are successful.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Netherlands is great, 20,000 acres.
[SPEAKER_06]: Leamington, Ontario.
[SPEAKER_06]: These facilities seem to benefit from
clustering, improving health care.
[SPEAKER_06]: One in 10 Americans eats enough fruits and
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just imagine if we can get that up to two
or three, how we'll grow the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Increasing interest in farming.
[SPEAKER_06]: The average age of the farmer in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: right now is 58.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we really think controlled
environment ag has the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_06]: bring young people into agriculture,
really make it cool again.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a big opportunity and a big
challenge.
[SPEAKER_06]: And economic development.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, we're importing four billion
pounds of tomatoes from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_06]: We think, why not bring that production
home?
[SPEAKER_06]: The trends are in our favor.
[SPEAKER_06]: Increasing demand for plant-based foods.
[SPEAKER_06]: You see that with Burger King is selling a
plant-based food.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's got to be a trend here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Veganism is increasing and a need for
innovation.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not going to be able to feed the
world the way we're growing right now,
[SPEAKER_06]: so we need to have some technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think controlled environment agriculture
is that technology.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over the summer, the UNIPC came out with a
really interesting report on food systems
[SPEAKER_06]: and climate change.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really the best advertisement you can
see for controlled environment
[SPEAKER_06]: agriculture, basically saying climate
change is affecting the way the bread
[SPEAKER_06]: baskets of the world where food is grown.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to need more food.
[SPEAKER_06]: The only way we're going to get there is
technology, and all that technology points
[SPEAKER_06]: to greenhouses and controlled environment
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: The UN Sustainable Development Goals,
we use these all the time.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's 17 of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great tool for going into the
sustainable investment community.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we chose these six.
[SPEAKER_06]: But really, greenhouses can fit into 13
out of the 17.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really a sustainable business.
[SPEAKER_06]: When we started App Harvest, we knew we
just couldn't drop a greenhouse into the
[SPEAKER_06]: middle of Kentucky and be successful.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had to build a community around it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We really set out to build an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_06]: We started that from day one.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit about why Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was going to get my sales pitch in here.
[SPEAKER_06]: From Kentucky, we can reach 70% of the US
population in one day's drive.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great place.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a great place for a produce hub.
[SPEAKER_06]: Energy prices are relatively low.
[SPEAKER_06]: Record amounts of rainfall the last three
years, and easy access to natural gas.
[SPEAKER_06]: And really, the most important kind of the
mission for our company is the labor force
[SPEAKER_06]: in Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as you all know, the coal industry has
taken a big hit over the past four or five
[SPEAKER_06]: years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lost tens of thousands of jobs.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our view is we need a new industry to come
and revive the region.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are some of the hardest working
people in America.
[SPEAKER_06]: Labor is a huge challenge in all
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we figured it's a great spot to kind of
come in and build a greenhouse and start a
[SPEAKER_06]: new industry in Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_06]: We started a ground game from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_06]: We knew it wasn't going to be easy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Day one, we got to have 285 employees
working in our greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've had a community outreach effort
since day one.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've got MOUs with four of the local
addiction recovery care centers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So obviously, opioids are a huge issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Around the country, even worse in
Appalachia, we've got a program where we
[SPEAKER_06]: transition the clients from recovery into
the workforce, into the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: Government, we think government's a big
issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: We work with state, local, federal,
and even international governments.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had a meeting with Sonny Perdue.
[SPEAKER_06]: Controlled environment ag is very much on
his radar.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's visited a facility in Georgia in his
home state.
[SPEAKER_06]: And recently did a trip to the Netherlands
to get a kind of a view of the Netherlands
[SPEAKER_06]: ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had the opportunity to pitch a
Controlled Environment Act to the UN
[SPEAKER_06]: Security Council of all people that came
to Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our CEO got an audience with them,
sat down, talked about the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And obviously, it's really a global
opportunity right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: China's adding thousands of acres a year,
not thousands, hundreds of acres a year.
[SPEAKER_06]: Russia's adding a lot of acres.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of activity, or at least
talk of activity, in the Middle East.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's really a global opportunity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And most importantly, education.
[SPEAKER_06]: We realized we've got to create an
ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need people to be excited, kids to be
excited about agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we started last fall a ag tech
education program in Shelby Valley High
[SPEAKER_06]: School, which is in Pikeville,
Kentucky, right in the middle of coal
[SPEAKER_06]: country.
[SPEAKER_06]: The program has been very successful.
[SPEAKER_06]: 90 kids signed up for 33 spots.
[SPEAKER_06]: We teach basic horticulture and plant
science.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we, App Harvest, put in a freight
farms unit on campus there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the kids get classroom training and
then some hands-on growing experience in
[SPEAKER_06]: the container, growing leafy greens.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at the college level, we're engaged
with all five local universities,
[SPEAKER_06]: University of Kentucky, Maria College,
Eastern Kentucky University, Morehead
[SPEAKER_06]: State, and University of Pikeville.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we just finished a eight-day trip to
the Netherlands with 10 professors from
[SPEAKER_06]: the universities.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dutch government sponsored the trip,
just really giving them exposure to what's
[SPEAKER_06]: possible, if we can make this whole
ecosystem happen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that was a great trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of a little bit about our
company and our playbook.
[SPEAKER_06]: And follow us on social media,
leading up to the launch year in
[SPEAKER_06]: September.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_07]: Kale Harbick.
[SPEAKER_07]: I work at USDA in a new position,
formerly at Cornell.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I work for ARS, the research arm of
USDA.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to spend a few minutes
talking about some of our upcoming
[SPEAKER_07]: research projects.
[SPEAKER_07]: First of all, Virtual Grower is software
that's used for greenhouse growers to be
[SPEAKER_07]: able to plan lighting systems or growth
patterns of their plants or energy
[SPEAKER_07]: modeling.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to be coming out with a new
version of that, hopefully by the end of
[SPEAKER_07]: the year.
[SPEAKER_07]: There was a hiring freeze in the federal
government for about three years,
[SPEAKER_07]: ended last year.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to be able to fill some of
those vacancies now and release a new
[SPEAKER_07]: version of the software.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we've got a lot of big plans for it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to improve the energy modeling
capabilities using a lot of my previous
[SPEAKER_07]: research, improve the lighting system
capabilities, be able to do more
[SPEAKER_07]: sophisticated cost comparisons,
and specify custom geometry for your
[SPEAKER_07]: buildings.
[SPEAKER_07]: We also want to have a research mode
that's kind of more technical,
[SPEAKER_07]: more advanced for university and
government researchers to be able to use
[SPEAKER_07]: the software to do some of the research
that we've done previously.
[SPEAKER_07]: Done a lot of work with uniformity of
lighting systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you look at the system on the left,
you see kind of a bullseye pattern.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's really what happens every time
you have lights that are in a plane that
[SPEAKER_07]: are equally spaced.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're pretty much guaranteed to get a
bullseye pattern, especially on smaller
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouses and shelves.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've done a lot of work on how to
optimize that to make a more uniform
[SPEAKER_07]: lighting system, either by changing
spacing or changing intensity of
[SPEAKER_07]: individual lights.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to continue some of that
work.
[SPEAKER_07]: Near field optimization.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is basically the issue of if you
have short distance between lights and
[SPEAKER_07]: plants, all the other techniques for
measuring light don't really work because
[SPEAKER_07]: they're meant for long distances.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're developing specialized modeling
and measurement techniques to address the
[SPEAKER_07]: unique uniformity issues of very close
light to canopy systems.
[SPEAKER_07]: Drones and greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a lot of big work being done in
the field agriculture space with drones.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to bring some of that
technology into the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_07]: Starting with light mapping, but then
we're going to expand to machine vision
[SPEAKER_07]: applications.
[SPEAKER_07]: So for example, being able to look in
spectra that are outside of the human
[SPEAKER_07]: vision to look for disease indicators.
[SPEAKER_07]: So imagine a drone flying around your
crop, and it'll spot disease indicators
[SPEAKER_07]: before you're able to see it as a grower
with your naked eye.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're excited about that project.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I wanted to close with some just tips
on if you're thinking about starting a new
[SPEAKER_07]: greenhouse business, these are some key
things that free advice that I recommend.
[SPEAKER_07]: So number one, do your due diligence
before you build anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: Almost no one does this, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have great plans and energy,
and that's great.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you really got to have somebody who
knows the energy side of things,
[SPEAKER_07]: the HVAC side of things, lighting side of
things, give you an accurate cost
[SPEAKER_07]: estimate, and see what you're getting
into.
[SPEAKER_07]: You don't have to worry about this if
you're in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in the Northeast, thermal curtain is
huge.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's probably the number one thing you can
do to save on your heating costs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lighting control systems that minimize
your use of supplemental light.
[SPEAKER_07]: Unfortunately, commercially available
lighting control that's out there right
[SPEAKER_07]: now is still pretty rudimentary compared
to what we have in the research world.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're working to try to bring some of
that technology into the commercial space,
[SPEAKER_07]: but there's a long way to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course, looking at your efficacy of
your luminaires is important.
[SPEAKER_07]: Making sure you have the right amount of
supplemental light, that you're not
[SPEAKER_07]: undersized.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then a big one, which Nadia's going to
talk more about this afternoon,
[SPEAKER_07]: is install HVAC systems that are
appropriate for your situation,
[SPEAKER_07]: your location, your crop, the type of
building you have.
[SPEAKER_07]: There is no one size fits all approach to
this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you really need some good engineering
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Utility rate schedules.
[SPEAKER_07]: I see a lot of people that kind of get
screwed by their utilities, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because there's a lot of choice sometimes
for the utility rate schedule that you can
[SPEAKER_07]: be placed on.
[SPEAKER_07]: You might be able to get a more
advantageous one if you look into it a
[SPEAKER_07]: little bit more.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the basic schedule that you get
put on might not be the most economically
[SPEAKER_07]: advantageous for your business.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then finally, check with the local
utilities for available incentive
[SPEAKER_07]: programs.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'll wrap it up there and look forward
to your questions at the end.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Move up here so I can point to my slides.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Eric Omatos, and I am the
director of the Greenhouse Lighting and
[SPEAKER_05]: Systems Engineering Consortium.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think what we just hear from our
panelists here, it's a perfect setup for
[SPEAKER_05]: my talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: We come to life.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are a seven-year, $5 million project.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our goal is to develop, transfer,
and implement new energy-efficient
[SPEAKER_05]: technologies to reduce the energy costs of
lighting in greenhouses and indoor farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: So pretty much, we can develop anything so
then people like team literally farms,
[SPEAKER_05]: technology takers don't have to develop.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's ready to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we do that by working with the private
and a lot of partners.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I want to talk here today,
four quick topics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our program is very comprehensive,
so I'm just going to do a quick overview
[SPEAKER_05]: in four quick things.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're talking about farms of the future
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first one is models to accelerate
technology development, the risk,
[SPEAKER_05]: and bring those technologies to market.
[SPEAKER_05]: With Glaze, we work with five man-peelers
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're working with manufacturers,
so lighting manufacturers, sensors and
[SPEAKER_05]: controls, greenhouse growers, retailers,
and policymakers, or energy-efficient
[SPEAKER_05]: companies, service providers.
[SPEAKER_05]: We work with four, actually three,
academic partners, which is Cornell
[SPEAKER_05]: University, Rutgers University,
and Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute in
[SPEAKER_05]: New York and New Jersey, and are funded by
the state of New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we are a public-private consortium,
so that means we work with several
[SPEAKER_05]: industry members to really de-risk this
technology development process.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're constantly interacting with them to
understand, find the gaps between those
[SPEAKER_05]: different segments, and understand what we
are developing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a technology that is ready to go
to the market at the right price and at
[SPEAKER_05]: the right time.
[SPEAKER_05]: It can solve a problem.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've seen recently that this model
has been more and more adopted.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's becoming more common because it makes
a lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here I have three other examples.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is this program named LAMP,
led by University of Georgia.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a five million dollars program.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have several collaborators there
to minimize costs of lighting.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have Optime IA that's recently
awarded.
[SPEAKER_05]: The leading university is Michigan
University, really focused on reducing the
[SPEAKER_05]: costs of indoor farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, they work with several
institutions sponsored by the USDA.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have new institutions like the RII.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have too many members, so I didn't put
the members here, but I think the main
[SPEAKER_05]: goal here is you're working in five
different categories.
[SPEAKER_05]: So bringing all these different moving
parts together.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to collaborate.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how we're going to bring,
that's how I see the futures, the
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouse of the future, and indoor farms
of the future as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I want to give now one quick example of
integrated technology that's only possible
[SPEAKER_05]: when we are working together.
[SPEAKER_05]: We call LESSI, which is Light and Shade
System Implementation.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's something Kay just mentioned.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the control systems to optimize
lighting delivery in greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_05]: aspects of that can be used in indoor
farms as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what LESSI does is it monitors the
ambient.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first aspect here is the
environment.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's monitoring how much sun is being
provided throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And based on that, calculates how much
supplemental lighting should be provided
[SPEAKER_05]: to achieve a certain DLI, daylight
integral.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can see here, we are measuring from
June to July 19.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that's a sunny period of the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the reason I did that is because we
also control shade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the DLI controllers available,
they will provide more light, but they do
[SPEAKER_05]: not control shade.
[SPEAKER_05]: So here's a true DLI control.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the first aspect is controlling DLI.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see here, the green line is the
target DLI.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you have the red and blue.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's an LED lighting system and an HPS
lighting system.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you get really close to the target
every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Second aspect here, trying to integrate
the control systems.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looking at the plants now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how plants respond to lighting and CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you understand that, one of the
examples that I have here, it's Albion.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a strawberry crop.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we see here is the net
assimilation CO2 per meter squared per
[SPEAKER_05]: second.
[SPEAKER_05]: In micromoles versus lighting intensity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have 500 micromoles, 1,000,
1,500, and 2,000 under different CO2
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to one take out of this graphic,
which is under different CO2
[SPEAKER_05]: concentrations, you can achieve the same
net assimilation, which we are here about
[SPEAKER_05]: 7.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can get at 500 micromoles,
you get a 7 under 675 ppm.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can hear exactly from here.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if you use a higher CO2 concentration,
which is now 900, 975, you get the same
[SPEAKER_05]: assimilation using 30% less energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you can achieve that under 350
micromoles lighting intensity throughout
[SPEAKER_05]: giving the same DLI.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there are significant savings if you
can control together lighting and CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the last aspect that I think is really
playing a big role into the future is now
[SPEAKER_05]: looking at the grid, the energy.
[SPEAKER_05]: We call day ahead market price.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this graphic here shows how the peaks
vary throughout the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have all the hours of the year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the red line here is the average
price.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about 17 gigawatts.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the peak price is about 32.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the average energy price is 40% lower
than the peak time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we want to do here, we want to
integrate these three variables.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're looking for the environment,
we're looking for the crops, and we're
[SPEAKER_05]: looking for the grid.
[SPEAKER_05]: How can you make decisions having all
these inputs to provide the same amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: light every day that we need for a crop
using the minimum amount of energy?
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is carbon reduction.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do we do with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: To show the savings that is possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here's a quick setup that we did.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we run an integrated model using GEM.
[SPEAKER_05]: Greenhouse energy model is one of the
available models that Kyle talked about.
[SPEAKER_05]: We pick Ithaca in New York as the
location.
[SPEAKER_05]: Target DLI was 17 moles per meter squared
per day.
[SPEAKER_05]: Two different lighting levels at the crop,
one at 180 micromoles, one at 250.
[SPEAKER_05]: The on-peak electricity costs we use 0.12
cents, off-peak 0.08 cents, and then CO2
[SPEAKER_05]: costs at 50 cents per kilogram.
[SPEAKER_05]: Results are pretty impressive what
happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: Using the basic LASI control, looking just
at the environment, would cost in dollars
[SPEAKER_05]: per meter squared per year, about $28
under the 180 micromoles light level,
[SPEAKER_05]: and about $18 under the 250 micromoles
light level.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we use the different technologies,
now we talk LASI, and then the second one
[SPEAKER_05]: was lighting environment plus CO2,
the third one, the day ahead market price
[SPEAKER_05]: and LASI, so the grid and the environment,
and the last one combining grid,
[SPEAKER_05]: plant physiology, which is the CO2
supplementation, and LASI, we come down to
[SPEAKER_05]: about $9 and about $60.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means almost 70% less energy than the
basic control, and 60% less energy under
[SPEAKER_05]: the second light level.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, the problem is how we take these
technologies and implement them on the
[SPEAKER_05]: market.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have these available in the research.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why we have to work with companies.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have to collaborate.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna implement these technologies
into commercial greenhouses in New York,
[SPEAKER_05]: which are part of the Glaze Consortium,
one named SAF Produce in Berlin,
[SPEAKER_05]: New York, one with Field Gardens in
Buffalo, New York, and they will be,
[SPEAKER_05]: over the next four years, implementing
these technologies so we can create a
[SPEAKER_05]: baseline right now to show how much
they're spending right now, and over the
[SPEAKER_05]: next three years, we're gonna be
implementing environmental part of the
[SPEAKER_05]: control with LASI, then CO2 LASI,
then then CO2 LASI, which is the day ahead
[SPEAKER_05]: market CO2 LASI.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, pretty quick here, data analysis is
gonna be another big part of the
[SPEAKER_05]: greenhouse of the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: Here I have two examples using a similar
lighting control to LASI, but we come to
[SPEAKER_05]: just lighting, not shade.
[SPEAKER_05]: In this case, it's a greenhouse in
Georgia.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can see on the blue, this is data from
November all the way to February.
[SPEAKER_05]: The blue bars represent the amount of
sunlight irradiation, we get the crops,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the green lights, supplemental
lighting.
[SPEAKER_05]: With an intelligent lighting control that
it can keep modulating the lights,
[SPEAKER_05]: we are trying to get close to the target,
the DLI target, which is the red line over
[SPEAKER_05]: here.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I wanna show the difference in data
analysis, you don't have to look at the
[SPEAKER_05]: prices exactly here.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I really wanna show here is the
difference between a greenhouse in
[SPEAKER_05]: Georgia, where you have certain
environment, and one in New York during
[SPEAKER_05]: the similar amount of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: In New York, to achieve the same DLI,
the lights basically needs to be on all
[SPEAKER_05]: the time because the weather is really
different from Georgia.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if you don't have a dynamic lighting
system, you're gonna be on all the time,
[SPEAKER_05]: or half part of the time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Take a look what happened in the last few
days in Georgia and the last few days in
[SPEAKER_05]: New York.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a bad week in Georgia,
and then the intelligent lighting control
[SPEAKER_05]: system just bring your lights on as much
as is needed, so then you can ensure the
[SPEAKER_05]: crop quality.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, in New York, it's the other way
around.
[SPEAKER_05]: You get a few good days, the lighting
control system kicks in and saves energy
[SPEAKER_05]: for you, and you can get to the same DLI
every day, or close as maximum as you can.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the importance of data analysis is
gonna be huge moving to the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: Last one, very quick, is the lighting load
demand response.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's the very important one for
us to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: The IESO, it's the Independent Electricity
Systems Operator in Canada, put up this
[SPEAKER_05]: big report talking about the importance of
managing the loads.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those are peaks, electricity peaks time
throughout the year, so they are foreseen
[SPEAKER_05]: that they're gonna need to work with the
greenhouse to reduce the load when
[SPEAKER_05]: necessary.
[SPEAKER_05]: Through December, through March,
and then here are the hours of the day
[SPEAKER_05]: when you have the peak hours.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to go too much into the
detail here, but I want to, for this crowd
[SPEAKER_05]: that is horticultural lighting,
there are technologies that can reduce the
[SPEAKER_05]: energy load over the peak times,
but are not looking to the crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to understand what's happening
with the crops.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can they take this amount of load?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can we reduce?
[SPEAKER_05]: How many times of the year can you do
this?
[SPEAKER_05]: How much can we reduce the light for the
crops?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that can only be assessed if we know
what's happening with the crops and the
[SPEAKER_05]: environment in real time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that would be a big,
big part of the greenhouses of the future
[SPEAKER_05]: and indoor farms of the future,
having them connect to the grid and making
[SPEAKER_05]: these smart decisions considering the
crops as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it for now.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are with Glaze, so we have a ton of
educational outreach information.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you want to learn more about,
you can go to the website, you can sign to
[SPEAKER_05]: the newsletter, and I hope you guys have
good questions for us right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yesterday we were shown a slide that
showed a pie chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on that pie chart, it showed that
greenhouses use proportionately more
[SPEAKER_02]: heating energy, or at least gas,
I don't know what it's used for
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily, than an indoor facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was wondering if any of you could
speak to that trend that we saw and why
[SPEAKER_02]: gas use might be higher in a greenhouse,
and if you would expect the same trend for
[SPEAKER_02]: a greenhouse where you guys are located.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I realize we don't have anyone from
southern states, and the sun belt
[SPEAKER_02]: represented up here, but if you could also
maybe speak to if you have any experience
[SPEAKER_02]: there of if we might see different energy
trends.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the greenhouse energy profile is
definitely very climate dependent.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in the northern states, you have a lot
of natural gas use or some other heating
[SPEAKER_07]: fuel.
[SPEAKER_07]: You also have less sunlight, so you
typically need more supplemental light
[SPEAKER_07]: than you do in the south.
[SPEAKER_07]: As you go south, that heating energy goes
down, but the lighting energy also goes
[SPEAKER_07]: down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cooling doesn't change too much.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're able to use evaporative cooling,
you're basically just blowing fans.
[SPEAKER_07]: The southeast is a special case,
and I bet Nadi will talk more about that
[SPEAKER_07]: this afternoon.
[SPEAKER_07]: But in general, energy consumption goes
down for the greenhouse as you go south,
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's a dramatic decrease.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, we can still have profitable
greenhouses in the northeast.
[SPEAKER_07]: Little Leaf Farms is a great example of
that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you just need the right systems for
that.
Location.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anything else?
[SPEAKER_02]: For you, Tim, for Little Leaf,
are you guys enriching with carbon
[SPEAKER_02]: dioxide?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we capture basically all our flue
gases off of the boiler, and we pump it
[SPEAKER_08]: into basically we're a semi-closed
greenhouse, so we have a Pelham wall.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have slurps underneath, so there's
about 95 fans.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we're doing is we're circling the
air through the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: It comes back in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're measuring the temperature,
and we're putting the CO2 in there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the CO2 and the temperature of the
greenhouse is modulated by that back wall.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what'll happen is when it's cool
outside, we'll bring cold air in from the
[SPEAKER_08]: outside, mix in with the air that's coming
through the greenhouse, put the CO2 in,
[SPEAKER_08]: and that's because we're an NFT system.
[SPEAKER_08]: The slurps are underneath the crop,
so we got nice airflow that's going
[SPEAKER_08]: through, as well as CO2.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, distribution.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, we capture all the CO2.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then when we're not running the
boiler, we actually buy liquid CO2 and
[SPEAKER_08]: bring it in and supplement CO2 levels
because it's important for the crop.
Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I heard a commercial, I have a friend
who's a commercial greenhouse tomato
[SPEAKER_02]: grower in Canada, and he said that 50% of
his energy bill can actually be running
[SPEAKER_02]: the boilers, not just for heating,
but for CO2.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they use the flue gas from the boilers
even on a hot, sunny day to enrich with
[SPEAKER_02]: carbon dioxide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Tim talked about the Dutch industry at
the beginning, and we had one of the
[SPEAKER_05]: webinars with Glaze was someone from there
talking about cogeneration hidden power.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something that can really help
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: So one of the cases, our commercial pilots
with field gardens, they do buy a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: gas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they run the boilers, and then they
just generate their own electricity out of
[SPEAKER_05]: that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you have better prices on gas than
the electricity from the grid,
[SPEAKER_05]: you can do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: In some cases, according to the Dutch
guys, they might even sell energy back to
[SPEAKER_05]: the grid.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was more profitable than running the
greenhouse in some cases.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you have access to cheap natural
gas, that could be one option,
[SPEAKER_05]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then that goes to your site carbon
footprint versus your out of sight,
[SPEAKER_02]: out of mind carbon footprint, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you're generating combustion gases
on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you for speaking to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: My last question that I want to ask before
I give it to the audience is, in your
[SPEAKER_02]: mind, I want to hear from the growers,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we heard a lot from Cale and Erica
about your ideas for the future of
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I still want to hear from you,
which is, what does the greenhouse of the
[SPEAKER_02]: future look like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it look like what we see today?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a taller greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a greenhouse with new covers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it a greenhouse that is highly
automated?
[SPEAKER_02]: What does this look like?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll speak to the automation piece.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the biggest thing that keeps
growers, I think Tim would agree,
[SPEAKER_06]: is a little more automated than mine,
but is just labor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're looking into all different types
of robotics.
[SPEAKER_06]: For tomatoes, tomatoes are very labor
intensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we require a lot of employees.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll be looking at different labor
enhancing, not replacing, but labor
[SPEAKER_06]: enhancing technologies.
[SPEAKER_06]: Working with a couple of companies now
that are developing tomato picking robots
[SPEAKER_06]: and just ways to supplement our labor
force.
[SPEAKER_06]: Robots can work 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_06]: People can.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think robotics will play a big piece
in the greenhouse of the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I mean, the labor issue is huge.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're looking at, so basically,
we have an automated system.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, nobody touches the lettuce at all.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, the seeding's automated.
[SPEAKER_08]: The gutters come through the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's automated, comes out.
[SPEAKER_08]: You saw it on the video, comes out,
goes straight to the cutting station,
[SPEAKER_08]: into the weir.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only people that we have working are
the packing people.
[SPEAKER_08]: They, you know, the next round of
infrastructure that we put in,
[SPEAKER_08]: those jobs can also be replaced with
further automation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the technology piece of the
greenhouse industry, it's continuing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we started with two and a half
acres.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it's just sort of like to figure
out, you know, the new system and
[SPEAKER_08]: everything.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like I said, we're technology takers,
but we improved on them quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our vendors worked with us in terms of
increasing efficiencies and tweaking it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we made significant tweaks from the
first greenhouse to the second greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it's even the further than the
next greenhouse that's going to be opening
[SPEAKER_08]: up in May, there's the next level on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's everything from, you know,
the glass that we bought, we went to a
[SPEAKER_08]: higher level diffuse glass to basically
our lighting algorithm.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have LEDs as well as high pressure
sodium.
[SPEAKER_08]: In terms of our watering system and our
filtration systems, I mean, we've
[SPEAKER_08]: redesigned that as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also as we're learning from our
vertical friends, it's like, okay,
[SPEAKER_08]: how do you maximize the efficiencies of,
you know, we believe in greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_08]: We believe in doing things horizontally as
opposed to vertically.
[SPEAKER_08]: But there are some aspects where you can
use different layering techniques in terms
[SPEAKER_08]: of maximizing space.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, it's on the, the biggest thing is
that there's going to be just a lot more
[SPEAKER_08]: greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just, it's coming.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people that are doing it have been
doing it for a while and they're pretty
[SPEAKER_08]: good at it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why are greenhouses on the upward trend?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, both of you mentioned being close
to market, but is that the whole story?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think Tim said a lot of it's about the
product and just being closer to the
[SPEAKER_06]: market.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, as us, we're competing with
Mexican tomatoes, which are picked,
[SPEAKER_06]: put on a truck and sprayed with a chemical
to, to ripen on the way to the U S when in
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 days drive.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're, we can be closer to the market's
worth of one day's drive, 70% of the U S
[SPEAKER_06]: population.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can, we can keep them on the vine
longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: They get sweeter, they have more nutrition
and they have longer shelf life.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, really the product is,
I think what's going to drive this in the
[SPEAKER_06]: long run here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's product quality, but it's
also consistency.
[SPEAKER_08]: Basically with the greenhouse,
you go 52, two weeks out of the year where
[SPEAKER_08]: you're pretty, you're not only delivering
a high quality product, but it's a
[SPEAKER_08]: consistently high quality product,
as opposed to our friends in field
[SPEAKER_08]: agriculture that, you know, basically do a
very, very good job, but they're dependent
[SPEAKER_08]: upon the weather.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's going to be swings in terms of
seasonality.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's always the food safety issue that
comes up.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, you know, last this past year,
you almost could set your watch to the
[SPEAKER_08]: second recalls.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, you know, the first one was at
Thanksgiving and then almost a year to the
[SPEAKER_08]: date, there was another recall.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's not going to go, and that's not
going to go away.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, I mean, all those things basically
have people running towards like the
[SPEAKER_08]: greenhouse industry is I think the future
of agriculture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys sell, I'm sorry, one last
question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't help myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys sell your product on a unit
basis or a weight basis?
[SPEAKER_08]: Unit basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unit basis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the way that it works, basically to
figure out what your unit economics are,
[SPEAKER_08]: the grocery store wants to figure out what
the price point is.
[SPEAKER_08]: So price points are for packaged lettuce,
it's basically anywhere from $2.99 to
[SPEAKER_08]: $3.99, anything over $4 is sort of like
Death Valley if you're going to be of
[SPEAKER_08]: scale.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have to understand what the
consumer preference is in working with the
[SPEAKER_08]: retailers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you can get your unit economics
where the retailer can make their margin
[SPEAKER_08]: at a $2.99 to $3.99 and then realize that
if you have to promote, you go down to a
[SPEAKER_08]: two for five and still make those margins,
that's the baseline of figuring out what
[SPEAKER_08]: your business model is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've heard that that can also be a driver
for being close to market is that if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're selling by weight and not
necessarily by unit and your price is
[SPEAKER_02]: dependent on the weight where you sell it,
that being closer to market, the weight of
[SPEAKER_02]: your lettuce or your tomato or whatever is
going to be higher than if you traveled
[SPEAKER_02]: 3,000 miles.
[SPEAKER_08]: For commodity-based businesses,
yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: But for the business that we're in,
it's more like a CPG, a consumer packaged
[SPEAKER_08]: good, that you're selling a unit.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_08]: As opposed to pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got it.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your turn.
[SPEAKER_02]: I promise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got seven or eight minutes.
[SPEAKER_11]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_11]: So nice not to be in the hot seat myself.
[SPEAKER_11]: So first, a shameless plug for Little Leaf
because I am a Massachusetts official and
[SPEAKER_11]: I have to support local agriculture.
[SPEAKER_11]: Also, it's delicious.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're a Little Leaf family.
[SPEAKER_11]: Questions for you for the regulators
because there's at least one in the room.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you had a wish list of anything that
could be done legislatively or
[SPEAKER_11]: regulatorily to help promote greenhouses,
what would be on that wish list?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have one big one.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's got a little bit pie in the sky,
but we're really trying to go after an
[SPEAKER_06]: investment tax credit similar to what was
given to wind and solar.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we saw that industry explode over the
past 10, 15 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was the number one job creator in the U
.S.
[SPEAKER_06]: during that time, and a lot of that can be
pushed back to that 30% investment tax
[SPEAKER_06]: credit.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, I mean, it's a big lift,
but that's one we're going after in D.C.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've just got a simple one.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like basically have USDA and FDA look
at greenhouse, especially leafy green
[SPEAKER_08]: industry, do a deeper dive to understand
it so we can just do something as simple
[SPEAKER_08]: as put ready to eat on our package.
[SPEAKER_08]: Which, believe it or not, is a huge hurdle
for us to climb.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question regarding the way you're
growing inside the greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the panel's opinion on living soil
versus all the bottled inputs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you see or are you trying or are you
going that way or are you currently doing
[SPEAKER_04]: that?
[SPEAKER_06]: We're growing hydroponically in rock wool,
so no living soil.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so are you asking rock wool versus
peat versus soil?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is that the question?
[SPEAKER_08]: So we started out with a rock wool system,
okay, in terms of with the NFT gutter
[SPEAKER_08]: system that we were doing, but we are
transitioning over to peat.
[SPEAKER_08]: When we first started, we figured that we
had enough challenges that we were going
[SPEAKER_08]: to try things for the first time.
[SPEAKER_08]: We wanted to make sure that we had seed
placement and to understand sort of like
[SPEAKER_08]: what the growth cycles are and root
health, et cetera, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the rock wool was a proven entity,
but since then we've gotten, we've done a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of trials with peat, so the third
greenhouse will be completely peat.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hi, my question is for Dave, but maybe Tim
you can answer as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand part of your model was to be
in Kentucky, Dave's Drive, but can you
[SPEAKER_10]: talk about your site selection?
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you work with your utility and on
hookups or do you power on site?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so we got lucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the first site we tried to grow on
top of a reclaimed coal mine in Pikeville.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's, I think in Appalachia,
there's the landmass the size of Delaware
[SPEAKER_06]: that's been a mountaintop removal coal
mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of reclaimed coal mine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looked like a spectacular site.
[SPEAKER_06]: It had elevation, everything you kind of
need for a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: The issue was differential settlement.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got the geotech report back,
like there's no way you can build on the
[SPEAKER_06]: site.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's 800 foot of fill and it's going to
settle differentially and break your
[SPEAKER_06]: greenhouse into a million pieces.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we had to pivot very quickly.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just kind of got lucky on finding a
great site in Moorhead, Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we worked with everybody, anybody and
everybody we could, and just found a great
[SPEAKER_06]: site.
[SPEAKER_06]: We spent a lot of time on site selection,
so we've got a development team looking at
[SPEAKER_06]: future sites pretty much full time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you want to answer to that,
Tim, too?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, I mean, site selection is huge.
[SPEAKER_08]: We worked with the Massachusetts
Department of Development and then the
[SPEAKER_08]: DEC.
[SPEAKER_08]: Devon's Enterprise Commissioned the town
that we're in is an old army base that
[SPEAKER_08]: they decommissioned quite a bit of the
property.
[SPEAKER_08]: So actually that's how we got the site.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it was all working with them in terms
of, you have to figure out longitude,
[SPEAKER_08]: latitude, basically elevations.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to make sure you've got enough
rainfall.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you can capture water, all of the
above.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a lengthy process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my question is to Tim,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You mentioned about quality of letters is
what customers are buying.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk about hydroponic or
greenhouse, the technology has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: reputable and scalable.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, one day right next to your
five acres farm, some rich guy invested
[SPEAKER_00]: and created 50 acres, same technology and
same quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically, he can produce, I don't know,
30, 50% less letters compared to yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I guess my question is how do you
differentiate from yourself, from the
[SPEAKER_00]: scaling industry, and also sustaining
quality on your products?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, so I appreciate the question.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the first thing is, as you said,
a standard that's tough to meet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, which sounds, you know,
people are building these greenhouses and
[SPEAKER_08]: they think that anybody can do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is difficult.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you've got to have, I mean,
we've been, you know, tackling,
[SPEAKER_08]: Paul's an ex Cornell guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've been, the first thing you have to do
is get growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, and in terms of getting high
quality growers, I mean, Peter,
[SPEAKER_08]: our grower, came over from the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_08]: But since then, we've had a pipeline from
Cornell bringing grad students in and
[SPEAKER_08]: training them up to have full-time grower
jobs.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's a huge investment that we're
taking.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're, you have to grow your own
growers to begin with.
[SPEAKER_08]: Second thing is in terms of varietal
selection, figuring out what, there's a
[SPEAKER_08]: lot of varieties out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: We were very fortunate to get a really
good variety that we've been running with.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we just got, basically we've got an
exclusive on this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just worked to deal with the seed
company to get an exclusive on the seed.
[SPEAKER_08]: For the area that we'll be marketing's in.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the third thing is like bring it
on.
[SPEAKER_08]: Competition's gonna come.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we're in terms of where we are in
the Northeast, we're up against Gotham
[SPEAKER_08]: Bright Farms, Leaf Farms.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, competition is the best growers
gonna rise to the top.
[SPEAKER_08]: So even if you're gonna be able to do it
at scale, and if the only thing you have
[SPEAKER_08]: to compete against me is price,
I can handle that.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's like we're working on our unit
economics to figure out where we need to
[SPEAKER_08]: be.
[SPEAKER_08]: But if we're in front of the consumer and
meeting that expectation, we're gonna be,
[SPEAKER_08]: the young lady already said, she goes,
we get fan mail all the time about our
[SPEAKER_08]: product.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've gotta make sure that we're
constantly, constantly hammering that home
[SPEAKER_08]: so that the barriers of entry are tough.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you to our panelists and thank you
to your questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
