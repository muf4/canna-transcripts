[SPEAKER_00]: We have eight separate licenses so The
story of our license we got it back in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2009 My father purchased it My name is
Adim Eri I'm the owner of herbarium and
[SPEAKER_00]: The way we got our license was back in
2009 we purchased a pre-ico from one of
[SPEAKER_00]: our partners who's actually still with us
today and We didn't use the license until
[SPEAKER_00]: about 2017 when cannabis first became
legal We went through some legal battles,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in the end we won and herbarium was
born Yeah, the cannabis industry has
[SPEAKER_00]: always been very Messy, you know people
claiming that they owned a pre-ico when
[SPEAKER_00]: they didn't people claiming that they had
licenses that they never had So us not
[SPEAKER_00]: using ours for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people thought that they could use it
because it was You know, basically idle
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a lot of trafficking in
licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually I'm sure there's a ton of
lawsuits going on right now over these
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses because they're worth so much
more money now and You know a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that were the pioneers of this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't familiar with you know,
legal legal rights or The laws or how to
[SPEAKER_00]: conduct a proper business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all they did was basically open up
these pre-icos And try to run a dispensary
[SPEAKER_03]: and that's as far as they understood Very
likely I'm not familiar with Pasadena,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm sure they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I know the city of Los Angeles
Yeah, same thing as Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were sued by tons of dispensaries
back in 2017 so there's like a line with
[SPEAKER_00]: people suing them
[SPEAKER_00]: Two two three opening is three a third one
opening soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah We're going to our grow room Oh,
it's locked Oh, no, it's not Two And
[SPEAKER_00]: everything here is on rollers As you can

we distribute it from and then I'll take

oh Yeah, I don't want to be in West
[SPEAKER_00]: Hollywood Okay, I prefer to be in LA
really okay, what's Hollywood?
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't be able to do all this You only
have retail licenses there which are for
[SPEAKER_00]: retail and delivery licenses which are
either for Recreational or medical well no
[SPEAKER_00]: on site grows in West Hollywood
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes in perpetuity, yeah, absolutely 45
Well yes across distribution many five you
[SPEAKER_03]: sit here.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you sit down?
[SPEAKER_03]: Tell me about a little bit about When I
was 18 or 19 my father bought this license
[SPEAKER_00]: under my name and we didn't touch it 28 so
Ten years ago I was more focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: fashion I came from a family that had
fashion businesses and At the time I had a
[SPEAKER_00]: fashion website after as soon as cannabis
became legal we decided to you know get
[SPEAKER_00]: back in it and We found out that someone
was using our license, so we were in court
[SPEAKER_00]: for two years over it We ended up winning
we found this location with 14 days left
[SPEAKER_00]: for the deadline
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah This was a diamond in the bed no one
saw It was called herbarium it was it it
[SPEAKER_00]: was a dispensary that did not have a
license so they had to shut down they were
[SPEAKER_00]: closed for about a year and Before they
were dispensary there was another
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary It's always been a dispensary
that just kept opening and closing because
[SPEAKER_00]: of licensing Yeah, so when we first got
the store I was thinking of names to give
[SPEAKER_00]: it and I didn't know exactly what to what
to call it you know, but I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_00]: call it herbarium and One day while we're
you know just setting things up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: shop a customer walks in and she's like is
this herbarium?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I don't know if you guys are open
or not, but I just wanted to say that this
[SPEAKER_00]: place saved my life Yeah she's like I had
you know stage 4 cancer and The edibles I
[SPEAKER_00]: was taking by caroba they saved my life So
I hope you guys come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't wait for you guys to come back
Thank you for everything you've done,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I was like you know what this is more
than just a store you know I thought when
[SPEAKER_00]: I first took over that it was you know a
store and People would come if you built
[SPEAKER_00]: it, but I realized that it already had a
community you know it already had a belief
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it that people knew about and it
helped them That's pretty heavy isn't it?
[SPEAKER_03]: We were talking about that out front a
little bit that all of these shops the
[SPEAKER_03]: whole community especially down here comes
out of medical marijuana dispensaries so
[SPEAKER_03]: everyone was a patient and that was your
relationship I still sometimes say the
[SPEAKER_00]: word patient, but Yes, and as soon as we
and then I Was like you know what let me
[SPEAKER_00]: do some research, and then I just thought
of the name thought of the name And then I
[SPEAKER_00]: one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just fell in love with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like you know what it's perfect It's
a little bit hard to pronounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a you know bold name It's a unique
name that no one uses then the definition
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it is basically a museum of dried
plants So I was like you know what it's
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works to your aesthetic Yeah,
it was perfect and then everything else
[SPEAKER_00]: came after that so your other shop is also
that Our other shop is in needles,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's called herbarium 66 Well actually
now that I think about it you've gone a
[SPEAKER_03]: whole hog with the herbarium everything's
brand new herbarium No, you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: pronounce the H, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I say your bear herbarium yeah so
um talk to me a little bit about like the
[SPEAKER_03]: like retail right now and the competition
and and and what's that like now in in
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis retail it like it's specific to
Los Angeles right now Because that's where
[SPEAKER_03]: we are like what are your challenges,
and you know we've heard some people are
[SPEAKER_03]: also charging What they call them a
sliding?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know there's all kinds of things going
on.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the what are you saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: so There there's a lot of different Thing
channels to this, but I would say I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: believe that I have competition I think
that if you do what you believe in And
[SPEAKER_00]: that's your route, and that's your goal
Either people love your brand or they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't love your brand But if people
believe in what you believe in they will
[SPEAKER_00]: come you know any dispensary can go and
sell blue dream any dispensary can go and
[SPEAKER_00]: sell a select cartridge right or a Any
edible any any flower anyone can sell it
[SPEAKER_00]: right, but why would they come to your
dispensary to purchase it and that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Is where a lot of people fall off
and a lot of and it's I think it separates
[SPEAKER_00]: the the beginners from the believers you
know and When that happens you don't you
[SPEAKER_00]: know if someone still shops at another
store good for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy for you Which brings me to my
next thing another challenge the next
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge is consistency a lot of these
brands and companies lack consistency so
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a challenge for all dispensaries to
be able to always have a consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: product flow Some sometimes there's
droughts sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's shortages sometimes people will
say they're delivering and they never
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver Some people don't know how to do
accounting, so it's all types of different
[SPEAKER_00]: Issues that we're slowly trying to
maneuver through that You know makes it
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult for yourself To grow you know so
I don't look at other dispensary this
[SPEAKER_00]: competition because if someone shops
they're good for them and Maybe they have
[SPEAKER_00]: a product that I don't have that they're
they really need and that's the issue with
[SPEAKER_00]: consistency when you want to carry a
product that you can't necessarily have so
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, are we Yes, that's what I look at it
as definitely getting better at being Our
[SPEAKER_00]: service is consistent ours our selection
stays consistent but to have a consistent
[SPEAKER_00]: flow of a specific product is Difficult
you know there will be people that say
[SPEAKER_00]: they have Which is an example blue dream
right and then they sell out of their blue
[SPEAKER_00]: dream, and they don't have it for a couple
months
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of dogs So yeah that that's
one of them now in regards to Slotting
[SPEAKER_00]: fees the way Slotting fees are approached
are taken the wrong way by a lot of brands
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally as someone who also distributes
I look at a slotting fee as I should do it
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm a brand and I want to be in a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I should do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an issue We have a hundred
thousand different brands in the market
[SPEAKER_00]: But only a hundred and eighty dispensaries
right now these brands are coming in and
[SPEAKER_00]: their margins are insane They're charging
$25 for a full gram cartridge for a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary To sell it to their custom to
our customer for almost $75 out the door
[SPEAKER_00]: after tax you know so Their margin what
they're doing is charging a high margin to
[SPEAKER_00]: a dispensary when the dispensary is the
niche Not the distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a ton of distributors There's only
a hundred and eighty licensed stores right
[SPEAKER_00]: now more opening, but you know there's
there's less stores than there are
[SPEAKER_00]: distributors right so to be able to to be
able to price gouge to me as a distributor
[SPEAKER_00]: is not okay and The way that we look at it
isn't as a shelving fee or charging to be
[SPEAKER_00]: in the way We look at it is 20% off So to
us if you want to be in our store I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: look at her barium as as just a retail
store I look at it as a place where people
[SPEAKER_00]: come to get educated and become culturally
aware of cannabis around them and You know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a spotlight on our store All
dispensaries, you know come up to they
[SPEAKER_00]: they look up to us We have employees come
from other dispensaries trying to work
[SPEAKER_00]: here We have other bud tenders from
Hollywood high-grade shopping here,
[SPEAKER_00]: so We have a standard and people come here
for a reason so To us we're looking when
[SPEAKER_00]: when we have a brand come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're looking for The ability to offer our
customers a better deal You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not looking for us to benefit to
benefit more than we are looking for our
[SPEAKER_03]: customer So how what is the reaction then?
[SPEAKER_03]: So how so so first of all, you're also a
distributor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: So What do you distribute?
[SPEAKER_03]: So how many shops there are over a hundred
and twenty stores right now across
[SPEAKER_03]: California across California So you
distribute out of here A year,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, so is that a growing part of your
business?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we're actually looking to expand it
So we've been focusing on do you think
[SPEAKER_03]: it's essential for a retailer to survive
to have these different?
[SPEAKER_03]: avenues of development and revenue
absolutely, you need to find out what your
[SPEAKER_00]: key performance indicators are and you
need to Strike them when they're when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could you make it as just a retailer?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely at the end of the day If you
Believe if you sell something that you
[SPEAKER_00]: believe in and people believe with you You
can make it as I was saying, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's other stores that sell select,
you know or Connected but why would they
[SPEAKER_00]: come here?
[SPEAKER_00]: I Don't pitch this stores a place that
distributes You know, I don't this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: retail store and face value.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a retail store but To us and our
customer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a customer comes in because I
have noticed this I've noticed that you
[SPEAKER_03]: know, first of all It's the brand
consistency is tough in this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's anchor brands that everyone has
right in their shops There's a few of them
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe doesn't happen, you know,
maybe it does maybe it doesn't happen
[SPEAKER_03]: Beyond that they might have their own
flower right and Their own strains,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, so it's sort of like silos and
this is fascinating to me because I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: constantly interested in You know,
I'm like everyone else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to find what I'm looking for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone doesn't have it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have it over there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I will constantly I'm the type of person
where I'll go in and I'll say,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I love this I love talking
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to get a lash it might be but
itself 90% of the time Keith Keith fails
[SPEAKER_03]: to It what fails testing nails testing
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're just profit margins out
there It's not that of a requested product
[SPEAKER_00]: that we have I have I have people that
come in and ask for it, but it's not You
[SPEAKER_00]: know, everyone has their own thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I try to carry everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I Mean it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there should be a lot more
research done You know If vapes actually
[SPEAKER_03]: are dangerous, they shouldn't be in the
market Yeah, there's so much to it that we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know So yeah, I don't know I don't
know enough to speak about it I just know
[SPEAKER_00]: that like vitamin E is being is people are
adding vitamin E in it which is bad for
[SPEAKER_03]: your lungs I have not had to deal with
anything yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that our bartenders have but they
are very educated, you know, we One as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as it happened I know that there was
a letter that we gave to all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: bartenders to know the products we sell
and what's in them Damage control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, so Yeah, I mean we Jackie and
Omar come one second.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is Jackie no more We there there
are man.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're actually one of my our longest
Jackie has actually been here before I was
[SPEAKER_00]: so she's an OG Yeah When she came in for
an interview, I knew she came with the
[SPEAKER_00]: building And I mean they can tell you a
lot about the vape issue that's going on
[SPEAKER_03]: This is boo, he's our CFO Who's seen it
all yeah, we seen it all he's our mascot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you saying smaller dosages?
[SPEAKER_02]: Smaller dosages.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no thousand-milligram medicals
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right there now drowsed out in 10
milligrams Yeah, but what about your old
[SPEAKER_03]: time patients who had a high tolerance who
needed those thousand-milligram bars
[SPEAKER_03]: because That's what they needed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they still around?
[SPEAKER_01]: Teachers and go through thousand
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of like companies creating
like sprays
[SPEAKER_03]: So so you've kind of you've shifted your
method of intake yes, I've definitely used
[SPEAKER_01]: as much like less than I did
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, well you guys carry live resin and
all that stuff and all the new stuff too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you into that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you gonna produce that stuff as well?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not yet But are you gonna add to your to
this line of products absolutely?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're gonna build a full kitchen in
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean gummy bears and cookies So you're
gonna have more skews.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah You You You You You You You
