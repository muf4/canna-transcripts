[SPEAKER_00]: My own background on this issue is I was
contacted by three different NFL teams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically I was hired by a criminal
defense lawyer in two of the cases who was
[SPEAKER_00]: working with teams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we saw going on in the late
2000s, early 2010, 2011 period was that
[SPEAKER_00]: you had a bunch of doctors affiliated with
NFL teams who were a little bit wowed by
[SPEAKER_00]: the celebrity of being around NFL players.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we saw was just all the rules
went out the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secure sort of storage of prescription
medications, Vicodin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about pill mills being places
where doctors were just giving out the
[SPEAKER_00]: opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't selling them on NFL teams.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just giving them out and putting
them in the hands of players and not
[SPEAKER_00]: practicing medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were basically just enabling a bad
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the NFL Players Association wanted
to work with me, what I would say first
[SPEAKER_00]: and foremost is the conversation needs to
get outside of just talking to Goodall's
[SPEAKER_00]: office.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom line is the commissioner and
the league have been so myopic and so
[SPEAKER_00]: locked down on the potential for cannabis
to be a difference maker and also to the
[SPEAKER_00]: destructive role that opioids are playing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The role in which they're masking pain,
serious nerve damage, and leading to a
[SPEAKER_00]: physical dependency that's leading so many
players both still in the league and
[SPEAKER_00]: retired really suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think this needs to be a national
conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the Players Association
needs to take that message to the American
[SPEAKER_00]: public.
[SPEAKER_00]: The American public has stood with NFL
players on the concussion issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: on their concerns around concussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a deep sympathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone was shocked when Nike created a
campaign that was really heroic around NFL
[SPEAKER_00]: players.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it was divisive, but I'm saying
that was heroic around players standing up
[SPEAKER_00]: for what they believed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the NFL Players
Association should go to the American
[SPEAKER_00]: public and really make an advocacy
campaign that will get this away from
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger Goodall and in the hands of,
and make this a concern that the league
[SPEAKER_00]: understands that viewers are unhappy,
that the league is essentially
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetuating the opioids crisis and
missing a huge opportunity to offer a new
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that starts with awareness,
and that starts with players sharing their
[SPEAKER_00]: stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited to hear from Kasim.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think hearing from players
currently dealing with the stress on the
[SPEAKER_00]: human body of playing football and alumni,
veterans who are living with the effects
[SPEAKER_00]: after, the extent to which people are
sacrificing their bodies and the role that
[SPEAKER_00]: opioids are playing, I think would be just
mind boggling for, and I think people
[SPEAKER_00]: would, people care, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember 1996, I was just a baby lawyer
back then, but when Brett Favre was
[SPEAKER_00]: addicted to Vicodin, when that came out,
that just blew my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was amazing to me to think back how
that didn't register with everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just another story of one person's
addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't think about it in a systemic
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would say to the Players
Association is you've got such an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: This moment in time, we're really just
beginning to wrap our heads around how big
[SPEAKER_00]: this crisis is, and to take people who so
many Americans look up to, my own kids,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have four kids, who are really like
their heroes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wanna be unpopular in LA,
I'm a Detroit Lion fan, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kasim, I know you spent a year or two
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be able to, I think that's an issue
that gets through to people, and that
[SPEAKER_00]: would move the needle, and getting away
from just letting the league tell its own
[SPEAKER_00]: story on this would be all the difference
in the world.
Thank you.
