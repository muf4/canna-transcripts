[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Che Mosman.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm with Glasshouse Farms in Santa Barbara
County.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Brian Malin, Vital Garden Supply and
Vital Grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vital Garden Supply's headquarters is in
Nevada City, California.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Vital Grown Farm is in Willis,
California, Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we smoking?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is OG Cush.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had this cut about 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And who'd you get it from?
[SPEAKER_03]: The guy isn't necessarily in the industry
anymore, but I traded it for a cut of
[SPEAKER_03]: Afgui.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you remember that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an epic one.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what's funny?
[SPEAKER_04]: The plant that we have in our booth is
Afgui.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that plant very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a really easy place to
start.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know each other, but as
cultivars, that's an easy one to go back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out of here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't handle it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wonder how many of those had the
original OG Cush as a backbone of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: because there's a lot of Cush heavy
strains and I'm pretty sure that the world
[SPEAKER_03]: loves that OG Cush fuel flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's that gassy mercy and turf.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like that Durban poison,
like the goo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, there's a lot of Durban's.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gelatos.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the gelatos are from there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're Cush's too, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're pure fucking Hindu.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, very interesting times.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 10,000 square feet, you can't really
play around with a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're growing this in one or two other
cultivars?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have several strains, some gelatos.
[SPEAKER_03]: We grew a bunch of skittles.
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, that's what this jar is right
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's some depth skittles right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're pulling four turns?
[SPEAKER_03]: Probably really only three because of the
elevation.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also like no electricity up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're bringing power in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're still like craft style cannabis
farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're also at the mercy of PG&E.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know what happened with all the
fires and all that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because of all that, everybody's
backlogged and bringing power into
[SPEAKER_03]: properties.
[SPEAKER_03]: So due to that, we're running generators
just to keep plants alive and vegging
[SPEAKER_03]: during the early parts of the spring and
late parts of the winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this winter was very interesting
because it just kept going on and on and
[SPEAKER_03]: on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just gave everything a little bit of
a push back as far as time frames go.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when I got here yesterday.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I got here yesterday, I was laughing
about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's got transfer tanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I miss it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving down to SoCal, I was like,
you know you're back in Narco because
[SPEAKER_04]: everybody has a transfer tank.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to get that generator going.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's good stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a way of life for a long time
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're looking forward to having power.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you were talking before, for 20 years,
you basically just sold locally,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't really need to go outside
Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in terms of you surviving as a company
and a brand and a farmer, you can
[SPEAKER_02]: concentrically start with your home turf.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, my situation is a little different
than a lot of the other farmers because
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also in the nutrient business.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've always been on the nutrient side
of things, supplied a lot of grows,
[SPEAKER_03]: black market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day, then the gray market,
medical.
[SPEAKER_03]: And being that I love the plant so much
and wanting to be involved with it,
[SPEAKER_03]: I always had my backyard grows and
different situations, helping out
[SPEAKER_03]: different friends.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then once things came to be,
then I was like, well, I need to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: piece of this beginning of history.
[SPEAKER_03]: The cannabis industry began here in
Northern California, at least for the US,
[SPEAKER_03]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to say began.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the culture from California cannabis
in Northern California is super strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: And because of my relationships and love
for the plant, I felt it was important to
[SPEAKER_03]: enter the legal market, Prop 64,
and be able to sell licensed recreational
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Didn't you say you're growing outdoor for
your nutrients?
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, we sell organic soil, fertilizer,
and amendments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So talk about building up.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think of creating soil?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I make soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a soil line that has a bunch of
really good ingredients that is something
[SPEAKER_03]: that we sell so people could just plant
right in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: As far as history of building soil,
that goes back to the farmers who've been
[SPEAKER_03]: doing this for many years, reusing the
same soil, amending it, putting their JoJo
[SPEAKER_04]: mojo in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're up on the hill, you're
literally trucking in soil if you need it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the best way to do it is do that once
every three years or whatever,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then amend it twice and make sure you
know what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've been big on selling worm
castings, compost, humus, baguano.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's been the backbone of what our
company is, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's like a really big,
I don't know, overlooked part of old
[SPEAKER_04]: school growing is that you kind of have
that mentality of they're just some dumb
[SPEAKER_04]: pot-crow up in the hill or whatever,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But even back then, there's still a lot of
science to it, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And everybody, that's where the uniqueness
of those strain profiles comes from.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get a way more terpy,
earthy strain, taste-wise too,
[SPEAKER_04]: because it was grown in a certain way with
a certain soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Living soil, beneficial microbes in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So at Glasshouse, we're the other end of
the model, but I come from that
[SPEAKER_04]: background.
[SPEAKER_04]: At Glasshouse, we're 100% cocoa as our
medium.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we use elite nutrients, but it's the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You find you develop those recipes,
same thing, through with the strains,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's how you really accentuate the
terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think as science kind of develops a
little bit more, and we talked about this
[SPEAKER_04]: last time, I really believe it's like
potency's a joke on how you get high.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many people are so locked into the
number.
[SPEAKER_04]: What percentage of THC it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: This stuff probably only tested like 18%
THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it'll get you loaded, and it's your
metabolism, just like anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have your own endocannabinoid system,
and that's what's really regulating how
[SPEAKER_04]: you get high.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the combinations of the terpenes
combined with the percentage of THC,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the CBD, and the CBG, there's way more
to it than just the percentage of THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think with the new market, for me at
least, when I see that's where we get like
[SPEAKER_04]: actually educating people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes back to the stereotype.
[SPEAKER_04]: So many people are just like, oh,
potheads, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: No actual knowledge of the plant,
that it's one, incredibly powerful,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's a medicine, and it's just like a
pharmaceutical.
[SPEAKER_04]: You gotta go into that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A bud tender is basically a pharmacist.
[SPEAKER_04]: They need to develop that with that
person, knows what works for that person.
[SPEAKER_04]: The old model of Steve will make you clean
your house, and Indico will put you to
[SPEAKER_04]: sleep is like, it's gotta go out the
window.
[SPEAKER_04]: We gotta figure out that it's individual
to each person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially with so many hybrids right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Between the hybrids and the strains,
and the hybrids and the humans.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all freaking different, and there's
a million different combinations of
[SPEAKER_03]: strains, and terpenes, and CBD,
THC concoctions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're all different, and it just goes to
show that what an amazing plant this is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody's ever given any other plant this
much energy, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel really lucky to be in this place
right now, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis is getting its day.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's in the sun, finally, after many years
of hiding it in the shade.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: had one of yours, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other ones that you've carried for however
long.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you playing around with it?
[SPEAKER_02]: So one, what are you trying to do with
each one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you like, this is perfect,
and I don't want to tweak it in any way?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or are you bringing it in certain
directions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then what are you playing with?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're working on a little bit of breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have something that we've been working
on a few years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually a cross with skittles and
lemon tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're just working the kinks out of
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing fino hunts every round,
and just trying to find a few that we
[SPEAKER_03]: really like before we really get it out
there to develop.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's signs of things that we're really
seeing that are positive, but every now
[SPEAKER_03]: and then we'll see one that does something
that we're not real happy with.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like shapes of the flower,
or structure, yield, or mold resistance.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, breeding is like, breeding is not
really to be messed with too much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that goes back to how many strains
there are these days.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are so many people that think that
they can just breed something,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then that's a strain, and you just set
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you need like three to five
years of running the same cut,
[SPEAKER_04]: and making sure it's breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, in dogs, they're called a mutt,
if you just have two breed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You didn't create a new breed of dog,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm always amazed these days when a
new strain comes to market, and it's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh wow, have you seen this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it's out, and it's on the
streets, and it's available.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then before you know it, there's
another across of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're like, wait, has it even been
two months since that strain's been out?
[SPEAKER_04]: Runts, and then white runts, and then
purple runts.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, wait, what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for me, the breeding side of things is
like, we're not a genetics company,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we obviously have genetics that we
really feel desirable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when we hit that mark with that one
something that we really feel good about,
[SPEAKER_03]: and want to bring to the world,
we'll let people know.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also don't want to be premature
about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, my whole approach to everything
has always been from the high quality side
[SPEAKER_03]: of things, high end.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vital garden supply products aren't the
cheapest products on the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the best products on the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's our approach for growing
cannabis, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to have high end, quality,
high terpene profiles, different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things that you don't necessarily see
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel, too, like before we were on
camera, me and you were talking,
[SPEAKER_04]: too, that's more like you're going to get
that from the legacy grower, if you will.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Somebody that's been in it for 15,
20 years, like us.
[SPEAKER_04]: The new guys just worried about their
bottom dollar.
[SPEAKER_04]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that 100% quality over everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where you get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's your blood, sweat,
and tears.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it used to be for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where it used to be if you didn't make it
good, your kids didn't eat.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want to own it, and you want to be
proud of it, and say, hey, I did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least for me, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely back that type of thought,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you were talking about the 10,000
square foot cab, you were kind of like,
[SPEAKER_02]: what's going on in Mendo as a grower and
someone trying to survive?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's tricky right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendocino County has a cab at 10,000
square feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And everyone in Mendo who has a 10,000
square feet has to compete with people in
[SPEAKER_03]: other areas that may not have any cabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or they could be an acre cab, or
depending.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like Humboldt County, there's a few acre
projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: Few people have up to even four acres that
I know of up there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lake County is starting to get some
multi-acreage licenses as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then of course, Santa Barbara,
Malte.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're at four acres right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our current cultivation is 134,000 square
feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we just are about to start up our
extra 355,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're having a half a million square
feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's epic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the dream, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also challenging.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's also challenging, right, because
that's also the dream.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the dream for tons of growers up
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But reiterating what he said, I really
think that any of these legacy guys that
[SPEAKER_04]: are in it, they have the chance because of
the quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said the quality and the consistency
and knowing that you really got a cut of
[SPEAKER_04]: OG as opposed to buying in a cut of
Gorilla Glue and it ends up being sour
[SPEAKER_04]: diesel or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because that's another big thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sourcing these days too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It used to be you asked where that came
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: It came from a guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not going to tell you where it
came from.
[SPEAKER_04]: It came from somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to protect your source.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now you go to a big nursery though.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a big change in that aspect of
it too in terms of sourcing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And due to my relationship in the
industry, I am a partner on a pretty big
[SPEAKER_03]: project down in Salinas that's over
200,000 square feet at Pacific Reserve.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have 146,000 square foot all in one
area that's like a multi-bay greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we also have a light assisted one
that has like 600 lights and it's like
[SPEAKER_03]: 40,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that, we're able to really put out
some high quality product.
[SPEAKER_03]: Salinas being the temperate zone that it's
in, it's like a dream to be able to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: down there and be part of that as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And use some of my products and show what
you can do on an organic large scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's been a fun relationship and fun
project.
[SPEAKER_02]: Comparing that to other Salinas grows,
like are they looking at what you're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: and like, wow, like he's getting really
good results with organic soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we definitely have several Salinas
people using a lot of our products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some using the full line, some mixing in a
little bit of organics with a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: of synthetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some will use our soil and use different
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one thing about our product
line is it is diverse.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we sell humic acid that's good for
synthetic or organic fertilizer.
[SPEAKER_03]: We sell calcium magnesium that could be
used synthetic or organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's certified, but it would go into any
reservoir.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could run it through a drip system.
[SPEAKER_03]: You could run it through a dosing system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then our soil is definitely pretty
universal for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were you growing in soil when you were up
in Humboldt?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the transition then like to
cocoa?
[SPEAKER_02]: Tell me about cocoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually really, with what we use,
I really, really like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We use the Elite line of nutrients and I
don't know too much of the science of our
[SPEAKER_04]: line of nutrients, but it is an organic
base.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's salt organic, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a mix basically, but it's an eight
part thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the results have been phenomenal from
what I've seen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And obviously, like I mentioned before in
recipes and certain strain profiles is
[SPEAKER_04]: really where it shines, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: You get good results with everything,
but there's certain terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've kind of broken it down into gases,
fruits, and sugars.
[SPEAKER_04]: But especially the sugars just love the
cocoa and the Elite.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, I mean, they're so,
so THC rich or trike rich.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just so sugary with the cocoa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I said, it is just so trike rich and
fun to look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a couple of cultivars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Particularly, I mentioned to you Hell's
Fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before that, I really like to grow and
it's just so consistent with that line.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I grew in soil and organics and simple
mixes and complicated mixes for years too.
[SPEAKER_04]: And personally, I think that it kind of
just goes in line with how the system is
[SPEAKER_04]: already.
[SPEAKER_04]: I really like soil and organics for big
outdoor plants, for huge outdoor plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: To me, that's the way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you're doing depth or anything,
I do at this point kind of prefer the
[SPEAKER_04]: cocoa because, like I said, I don't have
to manage it as much really.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really where it is to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, you know what you gave it and
that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then if it's missing something,
easily adjustable, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: For me.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another beautiful thing about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a million ways to grow it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you got to do what you're comfortable
with.
[SPEAKER_03]: By no means am I going to tell this guy
that he's doing something wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's growing in 300-some thousand square
foot greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're being successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I respect that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I respect any sort of cultivation style.
[SPEAKER_03]: If somebody wants to come to me and reach
out and say, hey, I'd like to make some
[SPEAKER_03]: transition into some organics,
then of course I'm here for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But everyone's got to do what works for
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm obviously a big believer in the
organic style.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it works for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: It works for our farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's the path we decided to choose.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you getting the price per gram
down to in terms of cultivation costs for
[SPEAKER_01]: a large scale greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_01]: Santa Barbara cultivation operation versus
a small Mendocino outdoor farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're working on figuring that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a little bit of a
misconception there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think people always think that organic
is more expensive than they thought.
[SPEAKER_03]: Depending on the nutrient, depending on
the amounts of nutrients, depending how
[SPEAKER_03]: many times you feed a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, soil holds nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I mean, we have big grows at Pacific
Reserve.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're feeding only twice a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have soil that has nutrients in
the root zone all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you add water, the plant's getting
nutrient.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they've actually gotten their nutrient
costs down quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the beginning, they were feeding three,
four times a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they were worried that it wasn't
enough.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they started bringing in some
synthetics and going back and forth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they realized when they just cut
back and became a little more minimalist,
[SPEAKER_03]: they were actually getting better results.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like I said, every different person has
to go with what works for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They found a system that works.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a couple Dosatrons.
[SPEAKER_03]: They run Humic.
[SPEAKER_03]: They run CalMag.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they run a Grow and or Bloom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they do a foliar when the plants are
young.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a serious IPM schedule,
of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like I said, there's a million ways to
skin a cat.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you'd be surprised how far nutrient
can go in an organic system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, the soil food web is, that goes back
to me, the soil food web being saying
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why I always loved it for outdoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's nature, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the soil food web in nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get those big, beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, like you said, the guy that's 65
and saying he can't figure weed out and
[SPEAKER_04]: he's been growing for 45 years,
that's your real grower, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the guy that's like, this is the only
way you do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sticking the mud and that ain't
going anywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I so resonate with that statement that
there's a million ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's always changing, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the beauty about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an individual, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got a personality.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're both in the middle of kind of
like fall harvest?
[SPEAKER_03]: We just finished up depth and we're
probably about four weeks out from fall
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you excited for where wholesale prices
are going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, we're not disappointed at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last year, it was about half.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's basically doubled since last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: At least, pretty close to double,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hard to pay the bills with that,
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distributors are aggressive and they're
being very friendly, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of DMs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for us, it's different.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and he knows, too, like Pacific
Reserve, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not that classic season, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're perpetual.
[SPEAKER_04]: We harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you do the math, we harvest about once
every six days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perpetually, I think we're on our
130-something harvest right now since we
[SPEAKER_04]: opened the doors almost two years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's ever going.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're lucky to be in Santa Barbara
County, too, because the microclimate
[SPEAKER_04]: there is very stable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's not a lot of huge seasonality
in terms of climate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your DLI is all that's really seasonal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your light index, you're having a little
bit there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, you get less light in the
wintertime, but same kind of microclimate
[SPEAKER_04]: all year round.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to admit, I am jealous of your
weather down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you took your genetics and started
growing down in Santa Barbara,
[SPEAKER_02]: what would you expect to see?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think there would have to be
like some alterations in the amounts we
[SPEAKER_03]: water or things like that, size pod.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think it would still perform
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: A little more humid down there.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we'd have to be a little bit more
careful on the OGs that are sensitive and
[SPEAKER_03]: that are potential to get PM.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, being an experienced grower
and growing in multiple different places I
[SPEAKER_03]: think I'd be able to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we're saying, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: It goes back to it's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's always going to change.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can never really predict what it's
going to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can go and try it and you can figure
it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may take a round or two to really hone
it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: But why are you offering some space?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you offering some space?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are you offering some space?
Why are you offering some space?
