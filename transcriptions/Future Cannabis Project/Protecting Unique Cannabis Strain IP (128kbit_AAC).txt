[SPEAKER_00]: How do you predict your IP?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the pieces that you
hold it right now in form.
[SPEAKER_00]: Philos doesn't take your living material.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they're doing is they're taking
material that's in sap form basically,
[SPEAKER_00]: cellular level.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't take it and utilize it in any
form other than map it on a galaxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I did with the galaxies, I mapped a
tremendous number of cultivars because I
[SPEAKER_00]: was worried about losing the ability to
run them if someone had a broad spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these broad utility patents are pretty
fucking big and they allow them to gather
[SPEAKER_00]: up any variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I said, listen, if I can predate your
work in a marked form, you can't fuck me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did all this work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it was to that a lot of the
farmers were afraid of this tech,
[SPEAKER_00]: but like I said, my mom's a scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like, no, no, no, this shit isn't,
this isn't good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to steal it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to use your data,
but they're not going to take your
[SPEAKER_00]: material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what it does, it starts to allow us to
repeat pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use the galaxy to prove varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I build a new bed, before we
release a piece, I say, just send it in
[SPEAKER_00]: for mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we make sure that the stuff that we're
sending, did you get it from the right
[SPEAKER_00]: mom?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause this shit doesn't look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Map it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I map it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets me come back, but it sets
precedent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it says that you're the first person to
put this up on a galaxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It states a genetic mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you can do is if you're
working with laboratories, like node,
[SPEAKER_00]: our micro arm, then you would work on a
contract with them with all the
[SPEAKER_00]: laboratories where it's secure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you take that piece, you don't have
to put it in propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could work with them directly and
never have me touch it.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, I don't have to touch your product to
go work with my other end of the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what it does, it allows you to
scrub, protect, and then hold in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want it in vitro hold, but the most
of it is the mapping of that genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: material allows you to say what you're
working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause people look at, once it gets out in
the world, they'll S1 it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's going to S1 it, but S1 never
comes back as the same source material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's what we're doing is trying
to build these pieces so we can set up
[SPEAKER_00]: these legal contracts and say,
this is the material we work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as it gives you a head start
on the market, you run and typically S1s
[SPEAKER_00]: don't come off the same because you're,
you're having to go through the genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: selection process.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there, there, there has been no
qualities.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vigor's down.
[SPEAKER_00]: S1 is where I take a, I take a plant and I
self it into itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if I wanted to do self incorrectly,
I could take a plant of a dissimilar
[SPEAKER_00]: genomic form and I could fem it and go
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going female to female,
but because I'm not going Kev to Kev,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going Kev to Ken.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not having that vigor decrease.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as I start to inbreed too much,
my overall vigor levels declined
[SPEAKER_00]: dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same problem with the Royals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every now and then you'll have a huge
pop-up that comes off incredible,
[SPEAKER_00]: but most of the time you get some really
freaky anomalies that you need to get rid
[SPEAKER_00]: of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so most of the stuff you're looking at
in genetics today is someone got a
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting, someone selfed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said, look, I have all these other
cuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my unique cut, but it's never the
same as the parental, the P1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the marking situation allows you to
begin it because none of us can patent
[SPEAKER_00]: this necessarily because you can't just
patent a plant, you have to patent a line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to patent a line, you have to have a
25% reproducibility that's at a genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's with all, you can, you should be
able to increase all of these processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 25% in normal agriculture is
patentable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in normal agriculture, nothing to
do with cannabis, just regular ag,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's considered to where you're
genetically stable, to where 25% of them
[SPEAKER_00]: are identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean identical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now they're similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of this polyhybrid, because you
guys sift, you pop it out and you're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: I did a thousand and I got 900 different
looking plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I got two or three that look the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's polyhybridism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Too many parental lines coming into one,
one swirl.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think like for you guys,
what you do is you take these varieties
[SPEAKER_00]: you have, and if you were going to put
together your own micro prop laboratory
[SPEAKER_00]: and get your own cryo scientists,
then just follow the advice where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to take it, Meristem cleanse it so
that you have no viral contamination on it
[SPEAKER_00]: that you, because it's a lot of these
lines have them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just don't see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scrub it up so that it never comes out on
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold it in cryo, hold it in a bio form
someplace else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a triple redundancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it in cryo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it in vitro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want it in biologics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way I have it in three different
locations, three different forms of hold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you start to be able to have the
ability where if any one of those
[SPEAKER_00]: operations fails, something happens,
catastrophe occurs for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to say raid because I lost rivers
of mother banks to raids through all the
[SPEAKER_00]: hot operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause I've been doing this a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for all the years we were in the,
in the, in the markets prior arm robberies
[SPEAKER_00]: and raids, it's knocked out multiple
libraries of shit that I can never
[SPEAKER_00]: replace.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can never replace any of that stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, when people tell me,
Hey, we can hold it in this form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I want it held in three
different forms and three different
[SPEAKER_00]: locations by three different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I need three that I trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we're talking the hard part for
three that you trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you guys can do your own banking,
then you don't have to worry about it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you start to use the galaxy to mark,
to map your situation to say, look,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is my specific piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can license it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you could always go prove that if
someone utilized it, you could do a cease
[SPEAKER_00]: and desist on that product because you
have control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I learned that from Michael buffer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Michael buffer, the guy that does,
let's get ready to rumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know how much that's worth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Half a billion dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that little phrase is a half a
billion dollar empire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why it's a half a billion
dollars is because he puts lawyers on your
[SPEAKER_00]: ass.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use it, any context, if he didn't
license it, he goes at you a great deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going at you aggressively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I realized from him that his
methodology is it's very easy to use it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but he finds out you're using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's going at you a cease and desist,
just like a hit man glass got nailed for
[SPEAKER_00]: the Starbucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lo and behold, an $800,000 fine later,
they're not doing Starbucks anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd have the ability to do the same
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for us, what we're working with
is some individuals have some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: large indoor facilities that we talked to
that I know said, Hey, would you be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to do my own genetics and then hold them
in in vitro and then release them back to
[SPEAKER_00]: us through micro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can give it to us cheaper than
we can produce it ourselves with the new
[SPEAKER_00]: facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, totally, because we just
signed the same contracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it puts me in a position of
getting, uh, watching language on tape.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would get ripped.
