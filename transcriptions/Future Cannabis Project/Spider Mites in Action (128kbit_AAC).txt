[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, looks like we have an egg that
hatched.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see a little baby spider mite in the top
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Predators, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get you in focus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We introduced some predators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably some California guests.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yum, yum, yum, yum, yum.
[SPEAKER_01]: Food everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: One big leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is four times zoom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where you going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Happy little spider mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did you just go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Off the screen again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fucker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just went on the... Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is this a spider or is that a good mite?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a californicus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy looks totally dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He is definitely dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's pushing a lot of sediment
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are eggs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so he's munching on the eggs,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a spider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's not going to eat the spider,
but he'll eat the eggs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the spider is looking pretty big
compared to him.
