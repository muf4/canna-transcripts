[SPEAKER_00]: She's been working with Korean natural
farming and We're dealing more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: with pathogens and pests on our cannabis
and on our vegetation with environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: stresses that we're all feeling from the
external world, so I'd love for you Wendy
[SPEAKER_00]: to talk about some KNF practices that can
help us specifically to pests and
[SPEAKER_01]: pathogens on our cannabis plants so Really
the basis of a good pest management plan
[SPEAKER_01]: actually starts with scouting which as
I've Integrated more and more with a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of cultivators across the United States
I've realized that most people don't
[SPEAKER_01]: actually really know how to scout properly
One thing that we discovered was that even
[SPEAKER_01]: though we were scouting our cannabis
plants pretty well for the most part We
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't scouting our companion plants so
the clover that you mentioned while it is
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing and awesome is also a wonderful
banker for Thrips and those thrips will
[SPEAKER_01]: move from your clover up into the canopy
of your cannabis So all of a sudden I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like we have thrips in our cannabis Where
did these come from and I looked down at
[SPEAKER_01]: the clover and it was like covered?
[SPEAKER_01]: So learning how to scout properly which
means that you're going to different parts
[SPEAKER_01]: of your garden each time Ideally daily if
you're gonna really you know do it But at
[SPEAKER_01]: least every week and check different
plants you want to check your top your
[SPEAKER_01]: middle Inside and look at different areas
you want to get a really good scope that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can actually see things like Russet
Because what happens with our pests is
[SPEAKER_01]: that in general we have outbreaks and at
that point it becomes very very hard to
[SPEAKER_01]: manage them so you know preventative is
always best, but you know how do you make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure you manage an infestation before it
really gets bad because Preventing is not
[SPEAKER_01]: possible like we're talking about nature
right nature finds a way So what we
[SPEAKER_01]: discovered this year is that it's actually
I mean I again I think pretty much all of
[SPEAKER_01]: us could talk for Like an hour on each of
these, but so figure out how to scout
[SPEAKER_01]: scout well start there Korean natural
farming really builds.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's I've been talking a lot this
weekend about an 80-20 principle So if you
[SPEAKER_01]: do one thing and you do it well It's going
to take care of 80% of your problems and
[SPEAKER_01]: with Korean natural farming what we found
is that the pest pressure is Incredibly
[SPEAKER_01]: mitigated just on the basis of having a
very fungally dominant soil so using
[SPEAKER_01]: indigenous microorganisms get your fungal
dominance way up there 10 to 1 30 to 1
[SPEAKER_01]: Super high levels if you can and keep
building it throughout the years and your
[SPEAKER_01]: press your pest pressure will be reduced
more and more and more That being said we
[SPEAKER_01]: still do have bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna happen You know you're gonna
get a bad cut from somebody somebody's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna come over to visit your farm from
their farm And you know they're gonna look
[SPEAKER_01]: at a plant and bam you got something So
what we did was we reached out to a wide
[SPEAKER_01]: variety of people we had some hemp farmers
in Colorado I had some farmers up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington and Oregon and myself and we
all started trialing out JDOM solutions,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is basically the son of KNF and
Found extremely high success rates someone
[SPEAKER_01]: I was talking to yesterday uses the same
regiment that we did and also said it was
[SPEAKER_01]: highly successful in like pretty much
eradicating russet mites If it's on our
[SPEAKER_01]: farm the only place that we had them
really bad was the one Little area that we
[SPEAKER_01]: weren't doing anything on which is a new
field so all right Already our you know
[SPEAKER_01]: bacterial dominance is too high we had
huge pest pressures over there But we used
[SPEAKER_01]: JDOM sulfur solution, which you can make
yourself cost pennies per gallon.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's extremely cheap It's very effective
because the way that it creates a wettable
[SPEAKER_01]: sulfur is not using a liming process Which
is what they use with the industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: industrial wettable powders which make
Your pests create can can can get
[SPEAKER_01]: resistant to the sulfur itself so it
ceases to be effective in long-term
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions You use it you can use it any
time we use it preventatively once a month
[SPEAKER_01]: we did have an outbreak of What did we
have this year Yeah, we had some aphids,
[SPEAKER_01]: but those don't they're not they're really
not that difficult to deal with If you're
[SPEAKER_01]: in a greenhouse, it's different,
but if you're in a greenhouse you can
[SPEAKER_01]: cover it and heat it up really well For us
we had we have a lot of natural beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: predators That come in and kind of take
care of the aphids for the most part With
[SPEAKER_01]: the exception of the one new garden which
those plants were just weak pests go to
[SPEAKER_01]: weak plants They actually sense it they'll
send out signals the more bugs will come
[SPEAKER_01]: in So the JDOM sulfur is great to use
preventatively and it's great to use You
[SPEAKER_01]: can use it every single day in the evening
an hour before sunset You can if anybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: interested.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a JDOM book It's the orange one and
he takes you through the only thing I will
[SPEAKER_01]: say With this is that he doesn't tell you
anything about protective gear.
[SPEAKER_01]: So make sure you have a mask respirator
glasses the whole nine yards JDOM wedding
[SPEAKER_01]: agent is another one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a soap.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use it for dish soap We use it for hand
soap.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use it as our wedding agent for our
plants So you if you do the JDOM sulfur
[SPEAKER_01]: the JS you do the JDOM wedding agent and
then if you incorporate JHS JDOM herbal
[SPEAKER_01]: solution, which you can make out of a
variety of things the Jerusalem artichoke
[SPEAKER_01]: was highly Effective the ginkgo is highly
effective Apparently oleander is highly
[SPEAKER_01]: effective I'm not gonna go there because
oleander is really poisonous and I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: really want that on my medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: So And we don't I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's just something about I don't want
to do but you can try it And then we also
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of went outside the box and we did a
California Bay Laurel JHS, which was
[SPEAKER_01]: really effective as well and So basically
the whole group of us what we all came
[SPEAKER_01]: back with was that JDOM WA and JS alone
worked really well to mitigate pest
[SPEAKER_01]: pressures adding JHS to that regiment as
well got almost complete eradication and
[SPEAKER_01]: that was against russet mites aphids
Spider mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's what we had with spider mites
on my violas of all things and Thrips
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody had in Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm missing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's another pest that we all get
that's tiny Broad mites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes and broad mites and across the board
this trio of solutions was Extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: effective and it's extremely cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can make it all yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super easy and It's awesome You You
You You
