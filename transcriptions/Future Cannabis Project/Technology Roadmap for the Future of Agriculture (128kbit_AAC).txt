[SPEAKER_04]: Today we have Grant VandenBush from Fifth
Season, Chris Higgins from Hort Americas,
[SPEAKER_04]: and Matt Gabori from Calix King.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll each be talking about issues that
they see in the market right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then how futuristic solutions can meet
those issues and needs of the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, so I'm Grant VandenBush.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just another quick piece of background on
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was at General Mills for a little
over five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large portion of that time I spent
working on the energy risk management
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy for General Mills, looking at a
lot of distributed energy platforms,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at a lot of co-generation systems,
as well as how we thought about both our
[SPEAKER_00]: diesel, natural gas, and electricity risk
programs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I joined Fifth Season,
I think as I mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_00]: we had a very tiny farming technology
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we knew that our whole thesis was to
try and pull the labor out of the growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we knew that once we did that,
that energy would be the largest cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we tried to be very thoughtful about
how we built energy solutions into our
[SPEAKER_00]: growing platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of what I'm going to share with
you today is actually how we've done that
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we've set ourselves up to optimize
energy over the long term.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I certainly want to go into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll try and be brief about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the facility that is coming online
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I mentioned earlier, we'll have
products on shelves within the next 30 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 45 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in a steel town called Braddock.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called US Edgar Thompson Steel.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's actually Andrew Carnegie's former
manager.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's where he invented the Braddock Press,
which ultimately made him a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a 1.5 megawatt facility with
human-free consistent and controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: biodomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's going on underneath the roof
there is what you're looking at in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, that's a two-scale diagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have is a tray loop system where
we've really taken the methodology of an
[SPEAKER_00]: automated fulfillment center and used that
as a platform to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of moving around pallets of
boxes, we're moving around pallets of
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as you think about an automated
processing, an automated growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: an automated harvesting, and an automated
packaging system, that's how that moves
[SPEAKER_00]: around in our full loop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have two biodomes that we have
complete control over.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what that means is that we can be a lot
more precise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from a control standpoint, this is an
example of one of our panels.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have over 100 panels inside of the full
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on our breaker, we have
high-resolution information gathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that allows us to do is feed
everything into our system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we talk about smart manuals,
when we talk about manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_00]: this really allows us to be better about
our scheduling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the human-free grow rooms,
we don't have to wait for a day shift or
[SPEAKER_00]: wait for a night shift in order to move
plants around to the optimal space.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have to wait for a day shift or
wait for a night shift in order to kick on
[SPEAKER_00]: irrigation or kick on fans or even bring
things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That allows us to be very, very smart
around how we schedule and use our
[SPEAKER_00]: electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the combination of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also within the system,
being able to augment them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from an energy optimization standpoint,
what we're doing is we publish grow
[SPEAKER_00]: recipes into our software system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those grow recipes, each one of them
has an energy assumption and a buffer
[SPEAKER_00]: window for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we think about filling up that
biodome with all of these different
[SPEAKER_00]: individual orders, if you will,
that the system then takes care of,
[SPEAKER_00]: the system is re-optimizing to figure out
what the ideal energy usage is based on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then our system is also combining that
with our high-res monitoring based on all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the smart panels that we've created to
look at and say, OK, if we were planning
[SPEAKER_00]: on using this much energy and our actual
energy consumption was this, why is there
[SPEAKER_00]: that variance?
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times, because we have these
buffer zones in our grow recipes,
[SPEAKER_00]: what that allows us to do is be smarter
about how we use energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything's done to a quality standard,
so it's not like we are sacrificing
[SPEAKER_00]: quality on a lot of these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just when we think about blending
product together or we think about
[SPEAKER_00]: creating packages that come from multiple
trays, you might be able to shave an hour
[SPEAKER_00]: here or an hour there when you think about
this full scheduling problem in one
[SPEAKER_00]: instance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we have microgrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really about connecting this
entire energy schedule or this entire
[SPEAKER_00]: energy portfolio along with what's
happening inside of the grid or what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a microgrid architecture.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with Scale Microgrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been fantastic partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Capital is always a struggle when you are
a young startup.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Scale Microgrid's innovative platform
to really reduce that capital requirement
[SPEAKER_00]: has been very helpful to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The solar can really generate a pretty
significant amount of electricity for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not 100% of our requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also have a standby generator
that's fed by NAC gas that can kick on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the three days of resiliency is huge
for us in the event that there is a grid
[SPEAKER_00]: outage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our neighbors next door, they kind of pull
out of power and do have a lot of demand
[SPEAKER_00]: and a lot of say to the utility.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that capability for us to have the
understanding for how we are impacting the
[SPEAKER_00]: grid and the flexibility for how we want
to run our operation is huge when you
[SPEAKER_00]: think about curtailment and other types of
activities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're literally just starting this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wish I had actual numbers that I could
post on here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our projected monthly load versus
available generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely cannot wait until we do have
that data and we can share it with you
[SPEAKER_00]: because to my knowledge, we are the first
real manufacturing process that has
[SPEAKER_00]: dynamic load balancing that we can do
inside of a human-free operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just get really, really geeked up
about what that can do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so my name is Chris Higgins.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am the general manager and co-owner of
Hoard Americas.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hoard Americas is a Texas-based company,
Dallas, Texas-based company.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what we really are is we're a
wholesale supply company.
[SPEAKER_05]: But over the last decade, we've really
focused on controlled environment
[SPEAKER_05]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for us, that means anything from a
tissue culture facility to an indoor
[SPEAKER_05]: vertical farm to a greenhouse,
we work with those growers in helping them
[SPEAKER_05]: develop and implement their ideas as well
as providing with them supplies after
[SPEAKER_05]: they're up and growing.
[SPEAKER_05]: My business partners are from the
Netherlands.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're a Dutch grower cooperative with
about 125 years of experience.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in essence, my board is made up of
about a thousand Dutch greenhouse growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we get a lot of input from the
Netherlands and that's shaped a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: what we've done over the years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Our vision is to be leading North American
wholesale supply company.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's kind of shifting right now
because what we've realized over the years
[SPEAKER_05]: is that many of the growers we're working
with today, especially those looking at
[SPEAKER_05]: growing food crops in unique environments,
need more than just a supply company.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need a partner.
[SPEAKER_05]: They need a partner to talk about what
others are doing that they find
[SPEAKER_05]: successful, what equipment they may be
able to use that they don't have to
[SPEAKER_05]: completely reinvent, and other ways of
helping them manage costs because many of
[SPEAKER_05]: them are on a very tight budget.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what that causes us to do is link the
grower with manufacturers that we've
[SPEAKER_05]: vetted and trust.
[SPEAKER_05]: We do have a demonstration greenhouse in
downtown Dallas.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's connected with the State Fair of
Texas.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if anybody's ever in Dallas and wants
to visit and see seven or eight growing
[SPEAKER_05]: systems right now, I don't know what we
have.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's open 365 days a year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about a hundred yards from the old
Cotton Bowl.
[SPEAKER_05]: And during the month of October,
we get about 400,000 visitors right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's become kind of an agritourism
spot.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in there, you'll see that we will run
product demonstration with new products
[SPEAKER_05]: from some of our vendor partners,
like General Electric, Grodan,
[SPEAKER_05]: other sensor companies like 30 megahertz.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our goal is to figure out that this
technology can work, not for the most
[SPEAKER_05]: technologically advanced group of people,
but that the average grower can make this
[SPEAKER_05]: equipment work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you'll find we've had to prove this to
ourselves because our growing team
[SPEAKER_05]: consists of the landscape scapers that run
the State Fair itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have to teach this to a bunch of
landscape scapers who have no horticulture
[SPEAKER_05]: degree, would probably be more comfortable
driving a lawnmower than calibrating EC
[SPEAKER_05]: and pH.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the way we look at the business,
we try to simplify it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was a question asked about,
do they sell weight or do they sell units
[SPEAKER_05]: in the last panel?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I thought the answer was interesting
because the units are essentially weight.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for a grower of ours that's growing
ahead of bib lettuce, we know that there's
[SPEAKER_05]: a certain weight that fills up a
clamshell.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we know that there are a handful of
clamshells that most of the produce buyers
[SPEAKER_05]: want to receive.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they may be selling a unit,
but inside that unit is a weight that we
[SPEAKER_05]: have to meet.
[SPEAKER_05]: So similar to agriculture, throughout the
years, our growers are dealing with yield.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in order to be profitable,
we really have to understand those yield
[SPEAKER_05]: economics.
[SPEAKER_05]: And our ability to help those growers be
profitable is what's going to lead to our
[SPEAKER_05]: longevity.
[SPEAKER_05]: So again, we're based in Texas.
[SPEAKER_05]: We service all of North America.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have customers as far south as Brazil
and as far north as Barrow, Alaska.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we do have customers internationally
as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: This slide just really kind of leads into
what I finished up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: We as a company are focused on
collaboration, focus and openness.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're focused on developing a business
model that really has a lot of the things
[SPEAKER_05]: that we need to do in mining this.
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the things we see with the industry
is that there are a lot of people that are
[SPEAKER_05]: protecting themselves with a lot of NDAs.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we look at the history of controlled
environment agriculture and we use the
[SPEAKER_05]: Dutch model as maybe a case study,
the interesting thing about that model is
[SPEAKER_05]: that they are very open as long as you
speak Dutch.
[SPEAKER_05]: But all the greenhouses essentially look
the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what that means is that those
greenhouses, while the systems inside are
[SPEAKER_05]: slightly different, what that means is
that their ability to share helps them
[SPEAKER_05]: share the cost.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it helps them build their industry not
only in the Netherlands, but as they
[SPEAKER_05]: export globally.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something that we would like to
see come to the US and come to North
[SPEAKER_05]: America would be more of an openness of
sharing what are the best practices and
[SPEAKER_05]: using those best practices to drive our
industry forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just drive an individual business
forward or an individual opportunity
[SPEAKER_05]: forward, but to drive the industry
forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because with that, we will start to change
the opportunities that we have in the
[SPEAKER_05]: United States.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will start to possibly manufacture some
more stuff here versus just importing
[SPEAKER_05]: everything from either Northern Europe or
Asia.
[SPEAKER_05]: And again, encouraging everybody to be
open and receptive to new ideas is key for
[SPEAKER_05]: our company.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Matthew Gabori.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am an owner and operator in the cannabis
industry in several different market
[SPEAKER_06]: segments, primarily through Calix Culture,
which is a tissue culture and genetic
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding company, and House of Cultivar,
which is a recreational adult use cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: brand headquartered in Seattle,
Washington, but also with presence in
[SPEAKER_06]: California and hopefully in 2020 in
Massachusetts as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in addition, my desire and passion for
sustainability has brought me onto the
[SPEAKER_06]: board of the Resource Innovation Institute
as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I started off about over a decade ago in
my basement with one little grow light as
[SPEAKER_06]: a hobby and as a passion.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then quickly through education and
architecture, expanded that out through
[SPEAKER_06]: one grow light to four grow lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then I built up my basement and then a
small garage.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then from there, a warehouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then as the medical laws and
recreational laws expanded in Washington
[SPEAKER_06]: state, we grew and evolved.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from that first basement to the 50,000
square foot building that we're in,
[SPEAKER_06]: now in downtown Seattle, there's always
been an issue of power.
[SPEAKER_06]: And from a very functional standpoint,
no building that we ever started off with
[SPEAKER_06]: had enough power.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's always been a process of trying to
reverse engineer what your outputs are
[SPEAKER_06]: based upon the limitations of the grid or
your local location.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for us, it's always been a very
functional requirement to have to be as
[SPEAKER_06]: sustainable as possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: So from that very early instance,
about 10 years ago to now, we have been
[SPEAKER_06]: constantly trying to evolve the
technologies.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember building LEDs in my basement,
trying to think that it was going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: the revolution, which through companies
here today have really taken it to that
[SPEAKER_06]: next level and allowed us to capitalize on
those technologies.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I really want to talk about today
is some of the methodology that goes
[SPEAKER_06]: beyond what you see in conventional
agriculture and what is specific to
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a big part of that is the product
selection.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if any of you have ever been into a
retail dispenser or storefront,
[SPEAKER_06]: you've noticed the huge selection of
different strains and genetics and
[SPEAKER_06]: products that are on the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_06]: And each one of those genetics has a
certain requirement for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of it comes down to space,
area, light, water, labor, and supplies
[SPEAKER_06]: and materials.
[SPEAKER_06]: Conventionally, what we have done is we've
created mother plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then from those mother plants,
that mother stock, we've created clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the clones create the production
plants, which then create the products.
[SPEAKER_06]: But for every strain, for every different
product that you have, that means that you
[SPEAKER_06]: have to keep a mother plant alive to
represent and to hold that genetic to
[SPEAKER_06]: create that propagation.
[SPEAKER_06]: That means that at least one large plant
is going to be necessary for each one of
[SPEAKER_06]: those things.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is a light, that is water that
goes into that plant, and that's time and
[SPEAKER_06]: labor that those employees spend dealing
with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for us, what we tried to do was how do
we take that and then consolidate that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because that's how you're going to be the
most efficient, and that's how you're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to reduce your resource usage.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for us, we have spent a lot of time
doing a lot of research and development
[SPEAKER_06]: and perfecting the art and sciences of
tissue culture and micropropagation.
[SPEAKER_06]: What micropropagation has allowed us to do
is essentially take these large mother
[SPEAKER_06]: plants and the large amount of area
resources and consolidate that into in
[SPEAKER_06]: vitro test tubes and essentially take all
of our mother stock and propagation stock
[SPEAKER_06]: that took up about 8,500 square feet in
our Seattle facility and consolidate that
[SPEAKER_06]: down to about 1,500 square feet of space.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has allowed us to reduce our load quite
significantly, and it in addition has a
[SPEAKER_06]: lot of operational benefits as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a lot cleaner plant stock,
we're able to reduce contamination spread,
[SPEAKER_06]: and we're able to actually have a much
more efficient operational process which
[SPEAKER_06]: reduces costs and resources in the
downstream processes through different IPM
[SPEAKER_06]: measures, different technology that a lot
of people have to put in place to mitigate
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff and contamination and negative
consequences from that that we can get rid
[SPEAKER_06]: of in the tissue culture process.
[SPEAKER_06]: So not only does it consolidate the space,
but it also provides for a much more
[SPEAKER_06]: streamlined operation downstream.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as I said, we converted those large mom
rooms into the lab space.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is the example in Seattle of about
8,500 square feet of original mom and
[SPEAKER_06]: genetic storage space that was taking up,
you know, had about 15 tons of HVAC as
[SPEAKER_06]: well supplying it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had even gone through a lighting rebate
and had converted all of our 1,000 watt
[SPEAKER_06]: metal highlight fixtures over to 315 watt
surround metal highlight fixtures,
[SPEAKER_06]: but we were still using roughly a little
over 100,000 watts.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas in the new tissue culture lab,
we're down to about 14,000 watts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as you can see, a significant decrease
from 8,500 square feet to 1,500 square
[SPEAKER_06]: feet and from over 100,000 watts to 14,000
watts, doing the exact same operational
[SPEAKER_06]: protocol and even expanding our genetic
library and storage capabilities.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, as a grower and somebody
who's operational and functionally in the
[SPEAKER_06]: marketplace, you know, one thing that I
want to try to express to everybody as we
[SPEAKER_06]: look at the advancements in the industry,
it's not only in the technology that's
[SPEAKER_06]: required to do this, but also in the
methodology and the approaches.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you go and you visit, you know,
GROWS, you're going to see there's a
[SPEAKER_06]: million different ways to skin the cat.
[SPEAKER_06]: No two operations are doing it the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think as we progress and as we
advance, we need to start to create some
[SPEAKER_06]: of those standards as we discussed earlier
and start to share resources on how we can
[SPEAKER_06]: change methodologies to then put the
proper equipment in place to really see
[SPEAKER_06]: those advancements and those reductions in
resource usage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now we'll take questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: A couple of you mentioned proprietary
advancements and NDAs as part of this
[SPEAKER_04]: work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I wonder, how do we balance those
proprietary advancements and NDAs with
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunities that could kind of lift all
boats, new important ideas for the entire
[SPEAKER_04]: industry?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how do we kind of balance those two
things?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll jump in on this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think it's because we've experienced
this so much.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, especially in the cannabis side of
things, people think that their trade
[SPEAKER_06]: secrets are really their ultimate success
factor, which is, in my opinion,
[SPEAKER_06]: what is slowing down the progress and even
retarding individual growth in a company's
[SPEAKER_06]: business plan and strategy.
[SPEAKER_06]: I really think that through organizations
like the Resource Innovation Institute,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, bringing like-minded individuals
together to share really is the best way
[SPEAKER_06]: to transcend that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think the way that we do that is to
show value with the information that's
coming in.
[SPEAKER_06]: The information that's coming out.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think, you know, through these
standard-setting groups, getting that
[SPEAKER_06]: information percolated out to the widest
audience possible in as cost-effective
[SPEAKER_06]: manner, I think, is the way in which we
spread it as quickly as possible.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only thing I would add there is making
sure you, as a group, we understand what's
[SPEAKER_05]: worth protecting and what has been around
for a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been in the industry for about 25
years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would say about once a month,
I get a phone call from somebody who has a
[SPEAKER_05]: really awesome new idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the idea has been around a long time,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So in a lot of ways, we want to protect.
[SPEAKER_05]: The easiest one I've always used is a lot
of people want to protect the irrigation
[SPEAKER_05]: system.
[SPEAKER_05]: But all we are doing is using irrigation
systems that have been around for 30 or 40
[SPEAKER_05]: years.
[SPEAKER_05]: So making sure you've done your work,
you've done your research, and you
[SPEAKER_05]: understand, okay, am I really doing
anything different?
[SPEAKER_05]: Or am I just slightly modifying the way
I'm moving water?
[SPEAKER_05]: That in itself is not worth protecting.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there are things that are,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And understanding what those are and how
those benefit you and your organization I
[SPEAKER_05]: think are key in helping move everything
forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if you open yourself up a little
bit, somebody may have already made all
[SPEAKER_05]: the mistakes that you're getting ready to
make.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they can save you a lot of money and
time by helping you through those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, I had a question about understanding
the incremental cost between what you
[SPEAKER_01]: could have done and the innovative choice
that you did choose to do and how you were
[SPEAKER_01]: able to perhaps calculate that yourself
and communicate it to your stakeholders,
[SPEAKER_01]: investors, and maybe even the utilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because oftentimes that's what the
utilities want to know in order to
[SPEAKER_01]: incentivize some sort of inventive or
cutting edge technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So finding out the ROI, knowing the
incremental cost between traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: choice versus paving a new path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for asking that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gretchen, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thank you for asking that,
Gretchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me just talk about our switch gear
real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when we first looked at doing the
switch gear, I think our electrical
[SPEAKER_00]: engineer on the project said that that was
going to cost us a million dollars more in
[SPEAKER_00]: capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because our, sorry, let me talk about our
micro grid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because he said that we had to upgrade the
switch gear to be the greatest switch gear
[SPEAKER_00]: that's ever existed before on the planet
of Earth or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a big hurdle for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That took some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The local builder on the project really
liked Siemens switch gears.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for our project, we had to go with a
Schneider switch gear.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was spending a lot of time with that
builder, getting them very comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: with the technology, getting them very
comfortable with the install process,
[SPEAKER_00]: getting them very comfortable with the
corresponding effect, and making sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that, I think you asked the commissioning
question earlier, getting that sequenced
[SPEAKER_00]: into the full commissioning plan and how
that would fit and how that would fit with
[SPEAKER_00]: the local utility electrical inspector and
what would be that process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was something that we knew that we
needed to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we knew that it was something that had
to happen at zero incremental capital to
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was an example of where we
relied heavily on external partners to
[SPEAKER_00]: come in and sit down and take everybody
through the pictures, videos, everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else to get the local constructors,
the local builders, the local people
[SPEAKER_00]: unfamiliar with the technology,
familiar with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that way we could realize, no,
it was not a $1 million incremental switch
[SPEAKER_00]: gear cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was actually apples to apples once you
figured it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the exact same switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was really big for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also looked pretty significantly at a
combined heat and power system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a decision we chose not to make
for us at that point in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was actually looking the other way,
looking at some of the phenomenal advisors
[SPEAKER_00]: that we've had on the HVAC side in terms
of how we were thinking about usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit too much capital for
us at this time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a little bit too much of a
slightly potential risk to the
[SPEAKER_00]: commissioning plan that we said,
no, there's enough in this facility
[SPEAKER_00]: already.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to take on that project as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It all comes down to, I think,
both the math problem and what you feel
[SPEAKER_00]: comfortable doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just to kind of add to that, great
comments, by the way, is really just
[SPEAKER_06]: trying to look long term.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think with most technologically advanced
or sustainable solutions, there's an
[SPEAKER_06]: additional upfront cost associated with
it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So really looking at that ROI not in a
short term one or two years, but more in
[SPEAKER_06]: the five to 10 year realm really makes
things pencil out on paper to make a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: more sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also when you're looking at this from
a prerogative standpoint, I don't think
[SPEAKER_06]: any of these decisions that we're making
are necessarily short term decisions,
[SPEAKER_06]: whether it be for our business or whether
it be for the planet Earth in general from
[SPEAKER_06]: a sustainability standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: For anybody on the panel, can you guys
speak a little bit to your experience and
[SPEAKER_02]: what you're seeing right now with respect
to water or atmospheric water generation
[SPEAKER_02]: systems?
[SPEAKER_02]: Chris, as you remember, we had a system
from a Southern California company called
[SPEAKER_02]: Skywell at Urban Produce, which was a
great system, but it was problematic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were we able to capture about 140 gallons
a day?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you guys seeing in terms of
atmospheric water generation systems in
[SPEAKER_02]: pure indoor environments?
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily greenhouse, but Grant for
you and other gentlemen for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the biggest ones for us in an indoor
environment are the condensation that's
[SPEAKER_06]: coming off of any of your HVAC components,
which nowadays with the filterization
[SPEAKER_06]: that's out there, it's almost a no-brainer
to be able to capture that and put that
[SPEAKER_06]: back into your fertigation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then for most hydroponic gardeners,
you know, there is somewhere between a 15
[SPEAKER_06]: to 25 percent runoff that's typically
happening through that flushing process,
[SPEAKER_06]: which most people right now are mitigating
so that they can put into a sewer system.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there is lots of opportunity to
recapture, filter and reuse that water as
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are the two biggest right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, maybe just to add to that real
briefly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a fill and drain system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We capture a lot of the water that comes
out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the exact percentage.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, for us, water is really
important, but when I think about the
[SPEAKER_00]: hierarchy of cost and strategies,
for us, it's something where it's not the
[SPEAKER_00]: top of the list that's prohibiting us from
either investing immediately in the next
[SPEAKER_00]: project or it's not on the top of our list
for solutions because we can capture so
[SPEAKER_00]: much of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important to us as a company because
we think deeply about our impact to the
[SPEAKER_00]: water cycle and what we're doing with
nutrition.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to create rich water,
but it's not as important to us as
[SPEAKER_00]: figuring out the energy usage.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I would I would add to that most of
the farms that we're working with on the
[SPEAKER_05]: indoor side.
Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: It is it should be much lower on the
priority list because their total water
[SPEAKER_05]: consumption is fairly low, especially on
the food producing side.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they're able to recirculate their
irrigation system so frequently that
[SPEAKER_05]: they're pretty water efficient.
[SPEAKER_05]: When we look at the bigger customers we
have, they're using lots of water.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have they're not implementing those
systems currently in terms of food
[SPEAKER_05]: producing or flower production.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are more looking at how are they
going to capture rainwater?
[SPEAKER_05]: How are they going to be as efficient as
they possibly can when it comes to
[SPEAKER_05]: managing their nutrient salts with inside
their irrigation system?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think for us, with the majority of the
customers we have, it's it is OK,
[SPEAKER_05]: where can I have the biggest impact?
[SPEAKER_05]: Today and probably in figuring out how to
make their nutrient solution go longer by
[SPEAKER_05]: using the right fertilizers and the right
measuring and sensing equipment is
[SPEAKER_05]: probably a better way for them to have a
bigger impact on water than it is to
[SPEAKER_05]: capture the atmosphere of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just add we've done some research on
water and whether they're worth whether
[SPEAKER_04]: it's worth incentivizing from a utility
perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: And at least in the northeast,
water is extremely cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: And plentiful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's usually not.
[SPEAKER_04]: It does not behoove us to look into water
incentives, but that's very geographically
[SPEAKER_04]: dependent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of course, if you were looking at
California, that's very, very expensive
[SPEAKER_04]: and important water.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is very geographic, just like some
states may care more about carbon than
[SPEAKER_04]: other states right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you'll see those priorities switch
depending on where you're at.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard a lot about water here,
but it's really not a concern.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not a concern of any of our customers
in Vermont.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is for Matt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt, I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you travel quite a bit around the
country and get a chance to attend a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of cannabis conferences.
[SPEAKER_03]: What would you say is a level of,
for lack of a better word, cross
[SPEAKER_03]: pollination between what we know to be
true in cannabis and what more mature ag
[SPEAKER_03]: sector players are doing today based on
multiple years of experience in
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a bigger need for that kind of
cross-sector conversation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you seeing that happen in other parts
of the country?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, great question, John.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think over the last, especially four or
five years, as the industry has kind of
[SPEAKER_06]: rapidly grown and evolved, we've seen a
lot of crossover, or I like the word cross
[SPEAKER_06]: pollination a lot better, from major ag
over to the cannabis industry and vice
[SPEAKER_06]: versa.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's been a large amount of monetary
capital to come into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: That has really invoked a lot of
innovation that has been stagnant in
[SPEAKER_06]: commercial ag for years.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, that has also been an Achilles
heel of people trying to evolve too
[SPEAKER_06]: quickly and forgetting some of the simple
standards of large scale agriculture as
[SPEAKER_06]: well.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really where we've seen this
information pass that's been happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the most part, I think that the
scaling and the large industrial practices
[SPEAKER_06]: of ag are starting to be more accepted as
cannabis gets to the scale where those
[SPEAKER_06]: things make sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: For a long time, we were at a hobbyist or
commercial scale where some of those large
[SPEAKER_06]: scale methodologies just weren't
applicable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now that we're really kind of breaching
those size and scale to that next level,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're really starting to become
applicable.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then combining that with the innovation
that's starting to happen, we're really
[SPEAKER_06]: seeing this high hot pot of explosive
growth.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got to think about how I want to say
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to ostracize myself with a
group of people that are looking directly
[SPEAKER_05]: at cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hort Americas, we have had cannabis
customers for the last decade.
[SPEAKER_05]: Prior to that, I ran a company called
Growdan, which we had a large percentage
[SPEAKER_05]: of our business was in the cannabis
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I have watched over the last five
years is that I think that there's always
[SPEAKER_05]: been a cannabis is special.
[SPEAKER_05]: We heard another speaker say that earlier
today.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as an industry, we start to say
we're in indoor crop production or we're
[SPEAKER_05]: in controlled environment agriculture
regardless of the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the industry itself will move
faster and find those cross pollinators
[SPEAKER_05]: much quicker than if we keep setting that
crop aside.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first decade of my career,
I focused on floriculture.
[SPEAKER_05]: In most floriculture facilities in the
United States, growers will grow between
[SPEAKER_05]: 500 varieties and 1,000 varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: What we learn is that you might have a
bedding plant in the same greenhouse that
[SPEAKER_05]: later that year you're going to have a
point setup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Very different crops, very different ways
to grow them, but they're both a plant
[SPEAKER_05]: that responds to the same variables.
[SPEAKER_05]: How you program your growing approach or
your cultivation strategy will change,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it's not going to change so
drastically that one plant's different
[SPEAKER_05]: than the other.
[SPEAKER_05]: In that segment of the industry,
there was no such thing as a poinsettia
[SPEAKER_05]: company or a geranium company.
[SPEAKER_05]: There would be a geranium grower who grew
other crops, but there wasn't this idea
[SPEAKER_05]: that it was a crop that was special.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you look at big ag, especially as we
have hemp making its way into big ag,
[SPEAKER_05]: one year you're going to have a strawberry
grower and next year he's going to be a
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then if he sold his hemp at a reasonable
price, he may be a hemp grower again,
[SPEAKER_05]: but if he didn't, guess what?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's probably a blueberry grower the next
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because those crops are extremely
different, but to change is just a matter
[SPEAKER_05]: of changing or managing different
variables, but they're the same variables.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think once we get that, there will be
growth in the industry that helps both
[SPEAKER_05]: sides, both the food or ornamental
producers as well as the cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have one more question based on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're seeing rapid changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Matt, you talked about how you changed the
grow room into a lab space now.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do people like utilities like me or
other groups that are working with this
[SPEAKER_04]: industry keep up with that rapid change?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's constant consolidation.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's constant new technologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always new customers being added.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could argue that the new technologies
cost more and maybe should be rebated,
[SPEAKER_04]: but how do we keep up with what's
happening so quickly and make sure that
[SPEAKER_04]: we're not, let's say, investing a bunch of
money in grow lights that may not be used
[SPEAKER_04]: as grow lights in that space within a
year?
[SPEAKER_06]: This is my opportunity for another
shameless plug for the Resource Innovation
[SPEAKER_06]: Institute.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's through organizations like
that who are bringing together really
[SPEAKER_06]: smart, like-minded individuals to figure
out the base standards and compare it in
[SPEAKER_06]: an objective way.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a real big fan of proof is in the
pudding, so to actually see it being done
[SPEAKER_06]: and then to be able to compare that with
others who are doing similar things.
[SPEAKER_06]: To figure out the best way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Every day, 24-7, and I still feel like
it's hard for me to keep up on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't feel bad if you have those same
kind of apprehensions.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just look for those verified,
trusted sources like these non-profits,
[SPEAKER_06]: like the RII, for that validated
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please give the panelists another round of
applause.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
