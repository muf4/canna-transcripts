[SPEAKER_00]: So what is this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Tommy, I want to share with you the
ballot initiative measure AF.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ballot measure for what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Ballot measure in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_01]: For this election coming?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, for November 8th.
[SPEAKER_00]: November 8th?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: In California, we're all going to vote for
legalization of recreational cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Mendocino County specifically,
we're going to vote for protecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: small farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's because Big Ag is already
coming in and trying to dominate the
[SPEAKER_00]: field.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want cannabis to be just like
every other crop that's been dominated by
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Agriculture and Big Corporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want it to be the small farmers and the
family traditions they've had for
[SPEAKER_00]: generations protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're one of the only people who really
cares about the small farmers and talks
[SPEAKER_00]: about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these guys all grow pot?
[SPEAKER_00]: They all grow pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been doing it for generations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of them have been in jail then.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they really believe in it and back it
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this initiative will keep the small
farmers from becoming adopted by a big
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will protect them from having
pharmaceutical companies coming and buying
[SPEAKER_00]: the property and going with Big
Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have a lot of places doing that
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just saying let's protect the
heritage strains, the heritage practices
[SPEAKER_00]: of farmers in this region.
[SPEAKER_01]: So buy Chong's Choice Herbalizer and we'll
donate a big portion of the proceeds to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure this initiative passes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vote yes on measure AF.
[SPEAKER_01]: AF.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
