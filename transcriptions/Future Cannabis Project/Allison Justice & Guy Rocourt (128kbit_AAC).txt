[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, my name is Allison Justice,
and I'm VP of Cultivation at Alco Labs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also own a 40-acre hemp farm in South
Carolina, along with an extraction
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was here at the Cultivation Classic
today to be on a panel with some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry leaders to talk about production
science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm going to let my partner here
introduce himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Guy Rokort.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a chief product officer at Papa &
Barclay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are a California wellness company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make topicals, tinctures, capsules,
and pain relief patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: All our products are solventless.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to be invited here to the
Cultivation Classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my first time in Oregon, which is
surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of great people here,
a lot of aligned values around the future
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis and how we need to,
A, self-regulate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So seeing the folks from KIND looking at
evaluating farms, since the feds aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, talking about being on the
panel with Allison and just talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was great to be flanked by two
scientists that are data-driven,
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm kind of in that weird mix where
I have this CPG company and some years of
[SPEAKER_00]: anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just kind of plodding along as the
industry needs data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's great to have these panels and
these talks where we start to share
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge, because one of the best things
about the rollback of prohibition is the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to speak openly and share
knowledge and connect with folks that just
[SPEAKER_00]: know different things and have different
approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time you meet them, they grow
your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully you can do the same for
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the things I wanted to touch on
a little bit with you specifically was I
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely agree that this medicine works
the best as a full botanical, so as a full
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So getting a piece of a little bit of
everything, the terpenes, the flavonoids,
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant fats, chlorophyll even.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it stresses me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we determine that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you're growing under LEDs and
I'm growing under full sun, that same
[SPEAKER_01]: strain is going to be different.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you dry fast and I dry slow,
the terpene profile might become something
[SPEAKER_01]: completely different than we intended,
depending on how we extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you do ethanol and I do CO2,
it's going to be a different yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then even on top of that, if we both
do CO2 extraction, well, maybe we use
[SPEAKER_01]: different times and pressures and heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's all going to yield something
completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, when trying to figure out
how to standardize that with it not being
[SPEAKER_01]: just the flower, there's so many variables
that, you know, it's exciting,
[SPEAKER_01]: but at the same time, it makes me question
how we can standardize it to the best of
[SPEAKER_01]: our abilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the answer lies in data
collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily we have these things called
computers that love managing variables,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Another complex thing is ourselves and
we're each different, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So once when we were sitting around at our
company, we have these things called 420
[SPEAKER_00]: meetings where it's not a work meeting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like exactly what it is on
Wednesday afternoons where we just vision
[SPEAKER_00]: and imagine what the world could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if we were able to not,
first of all, we do a poor job in our
[SPEAKER_00]: country right now of tracking people's
medical history.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we had a device by which we were
tracking people's medical history,
[SPEAKER_00]: individual, them as an individual,
tracking what they use and its complex
[SPEAKER_00]: parts, perhaps with enough data,
we would start to be able to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: even something as complicated as whole
plant medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Consistency is a really good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural medicine in general is
inconsistent, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even if the same, even if you hold all the
variables the same in a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, there's going to be shifts.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be more rain one year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Less rain, more sun, less fall,
all these different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the drying, you know,
all the terpenes that, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we say that, you know, THC and CBD are
the engine or the cannabinoids the engine
[SPEAKER_00]: and terpenes drive the ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we go with that analogy, well,
those terpenes, those volatile organic
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds, yeah, they're exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: VOCs, it's like a little bit of heat,
a little bit of the way we store them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that will change your composition,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we know also that cannabis has had
miraculous effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I often think of that as winning the
lottery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for some reason your physio and the
strain that you came across created a
[SPEAKER_00]: miracle for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hold that, okay, that that miracle is
out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a way to get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there, as you put a variety of
variables that we can't quantify right now
[SPEAKER_00]: to be able to reliably reproduce that
effect, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would hope that if I had to just
vision, I would say that perhaps one day
[SPEAKER_00]: there will be a medical tracking software
that not only tracks the individual
[SPEAKER_00]: patient, but tracks the products that
they've used and their infinite
[SPEAKER_00]: variability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then over time starts to point
definitively towards these specific things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are in common over time that have
worked for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we need good statisticians to compile
all that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our company, we just now are building
out our data-driven ops, our data-driven
[SPEAKER_00]: ops people, you know, to start to track.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a lot of feedback, a lot of
testimonials.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while that's not a clinical trial,
it's like our products have gone from not
[SPEAKER_00]: using to, you know, we had a lady in
Richmond say that, you know, she hadn't
[SPEAKER_00]: been able to walk upright for the last
five years, started using our bomb.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, well, I know it's effective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, whoo, you know, there's a huge
placebo effect going on with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: right now that that also corrupts the
data, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of newbies that come in
and it's almost like their resistance
[SPEAKER_00]: turns into a positive because the placebo
effect just completely, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: miracles are being created.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to, you know, part of me as
a business person is like, yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: put that one up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as a scientist, I just want to be
like, wait a minute, like, slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we need to like be able to recreate
these experiences before we can highlight
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So data is key, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and definitely in the black
market day, data was not a thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you're building a business data is
not your first thing to get, but like,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, and we, we are in a nascent industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even in analytics around market share
and stuff, you know, we struggled to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: BDS because we're like, do we really need
to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or do we just need to continue to stay on
shelf?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do need to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do need to encourage people who are
gathering data, whether it's at the
[SPEAKER_00]: register, whether it's at the clinician
level, because without that, we can't make
[SPEAKER_00]: educated future decisions.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's data on every piece of the
puzzle, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Growing, extraction, drying everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to ask a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said you had a hemp farm in South
Carolina.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you able to start to work towards
different cultivars that will produce more
[SPEAKER_00]: oil rich products or are the regulators
still trying to hold the different
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars to more agricultural style hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: South Carolina is amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: My, my, my hemp varieties are 22% CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, their minor cannabinoids are
upwards of 5%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we're absolutely able to,
to reach out of that restriction zone a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's due to the way that the
regulations were written, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at only Delta nine, you know,
giving that opportunity that if you do go
[SPEAKER_01]: over 0.3%, but you're under 1%,
you can remediate in some sort of way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has given us a huge opportunity in
terms of breeding, you know, not being
[SPEAKER_01]: afraid that, you know, having that leeway
of pushing it a little bit, but also not
[SPEAKER_01]: being scared that you're going to lose
your life savings in this farm because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to burn it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, South Carolina, a few of the
other southern states have been really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really great in helping us to be able to
expand on that and to not just be stuck
[SPEAKER_01]: with these two varieties that everybody
else in the whole, you know, us is growing
[SPEAKER_01]: and get really creative, you know,
terpenes up, you know, above 2%.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's really, really great
environment for, for working with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's important just to,
to note that that that's awesome because
[SPEAKER_00]: I, that was not the answer I was expecting
to be quite honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just important for everybody to
know that there is a way to grow CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars that are federally legal,
but you know, kind of like I said in our
[SPEAKER_00]: panel, I don't really use the hemp word.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just, it's all cannabis to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this one plant and there are
different varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're talking about producing
medicine, you should be looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: right varietal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're talking about producing cloth,
you should be looking at that right,
[SPEAKER_00]: right, uh, correct varietal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good that the state is giving you
the latitude to grow the crop that you
[SPEAKER_00]: need for what you're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and yeah, and with the farm bill,
that means that, you know, perhaps I can
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a call and get some of that
because our 50 state product right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: we source it actually out of Oregon and
uh, we have used the cherry CBD and the F
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer strain, uh, out of Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and then one of the questions,
you know, my next question would be,
[SPEAKER_00]: does it wash?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I don't know if you've done any
solventless, uh, production, but we are
[SPEAKER_00]: desperately looking for that CBD cultivar
that we can do our ice water extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: with, um, and get, you know, a clean
solventless extract that can be used as a
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, right now it typically the yields it's
possible of course, but the yields are so
[SPEAKER_00]: little that it's not economically viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that has to do with the cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, well, I can say this, our Bayox
produces great teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So haven't, haven't tried ice water hash,
um, but would love to work with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
