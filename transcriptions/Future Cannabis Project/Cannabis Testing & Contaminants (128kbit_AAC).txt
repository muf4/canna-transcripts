[SPEAKER_00]: Testing changed dramatically the skill
level of the operator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prior to testing, there was really no way
to ascertain what was on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of the varieties in cannabis
today, if one wants to chemically drive
[SPEAKER_00]: them, nutritionally speaking, into a very
high level of production, they become very
[SPEAKER_00]: hypersensitive to environmental issues
such as mold, and funguses, and pathogens
[SPEAKER_00]: such as pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you find is that the amount of
cannabis that was chemically treated might
[SPEAKER_00]: have been maybe 88, 90% of the total.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we started to really get into
testing, you started to realize that the
[SPEAKER_00]: predominant amount of cannabis grown,
not just in Humboldt, but in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: in general, was actually contaminated with
products that were meant for horticultural
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes, not edible purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So ornamentals, things you would use to
control the shape of a mum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so these pesticides and fungicides and
growth regulators, they all started to
[SPEAKER_00]: reveal that we had an educational
deficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that what you really got to
see was that the growers in Humboldt
[SPEAKER_00]: County, a lot of them, were able to start
to realize that they would not have an
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to exist in the future if they
didn't start to change their practices in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of how does one work with this on a
regulated level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was tough because we don't know
what to use as a regulated level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we did was we took Oregon's
standards, because Oregon pretty much had
[SPEAKER_00]: a pretty comprehensive coverage,
and it was pretty restrictive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So probably three, four years ago,
we started looking at Oregon's levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: what they were trying to put into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Oregon helped us really start to
understand better what was the new
[SPEAKER_00]: allowances of what could be used,
what was legally allowed to be used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you started to see cultivators start
to really get into best practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: The integrated pest management concepts
took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beneficial insects took off.
[SPEAKER_00]: People made a huge change into organic
methodologies of cultivation because
[SPEAKER_00]: organically driven plants typically have
less problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's interesting, but the testing
changed the production methodologies,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just that customers get cleaner pot
now, but there's also a cleaner production
[SPEAKER_00]: methodology in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole knowledge level increased
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why I always give Samantha Miller
such a shout, because Samantha Miller went
[SPEAKER_00]: on a one-woman show driving the importance
of testing, why you use this, how you use
[SPEAKER_00]: these testing methods to improve your
production, and now to keep us alive in an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry that's highly regulated,
meaning that if your product doesn't pass
[SPEAKER_00]: the lab test, you can't sell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for so many people who didn't
really take that initiative early,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to have to make the changes
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for a lot of people at Humboldt,
they really made the changes, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: made the changes because they would get
the lab results back and they would see
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it started to make an awareness that
people don't understand residual,
[SPEAKER_00]: so they don't really understand half-life
of nuclear products, and they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: understand residual contamination from
pesticides and fungicides, and exactly how
[SPEAKER_00]: long it takes for that material that was
sprayed on your cannabis plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: dissipate to a level that's considered
safe or non-detectable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of a sudden, it was an incredible
education, and people started to realize
[SPEAKER_00]: that they not only were selling cannabis
that was saturated and toxic, they were
[SPEAKER_00]: living in saturated and toxic production
zones, because they were the ones applying
[SPEAKER_00]: it, they're the ones using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all of a sudden, the awareness
started to increase dramatically,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you started to see people make better
common-sense decisions just based off of,
[SPEAKER_00]: this isn't good, period.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the testing allowed people to
really start to make educated choices on
[SPEAKER_00]: what we used in production, because prior,
there really was no real information,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone would say, I think it's all
gone, there's no residual left.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with testing, you found out that you
were really running almost toxic levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it started to really key in all
these producers that used it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because I own a dispensary,
well, I have two of them, but they're
[SPEAKER_00]: drop-offs for labs, which means that
people bring me their products and we send
[SPEAKER_00]: it off to the lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab for examination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the nine years that I've been
running dispensaries, I've seen an ungodly
[SPEAKER_00]: number of lab reports.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know from the lab reports that we've
seen an incredible change in what the
[SPEAKER_00]: contaminants are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what kind of drove a lot of it was
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, concentrates became almost 48% of
California's market as of right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because concentrates concentrate all
things present, concentrates started to
[SPEAKER_00]: reveal residuals in a way that flower
testing never did.
[SPEAKER_00]: So flower testing let us understand,
was it clean as flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: But concentrate testing let us understand,
is it clean as genetic source material?
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning, were your moms clean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You had to go all the way back to the
material used to create the material you
[SPEAKER_00]: used to create your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the extraction process
concentrates to such a degree that it
[SPEAKER_00]: pulled non-detectable amounts from the
flour and made it clearly detectable and
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly non-allowable for consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the concentrate industry is what
really started to force people to fix the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems in the back end of the business,
because the flour production they have
[SPEAKER_00]: clean, but the mothers have been
historically so dirty.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for us at the shop, I've been an
organic cultivator for a while,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I would love to use the tools that
other people get to use.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we realized that at some point when
regulations kicked in, everyone would be
[SPEAKER_00]: under such a microscope that if we didn't
really practice completely and understand
[SPEAKER_00]: fully, how do you actually control these
problems to a workable degree?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're not going to get a sterile
system in organics, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a population beneficial
and predator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so both of them pray and they're going
to work on each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so ultimately it's trying to learn
what is the allowable balances and to get
[SPEAKER_00]: customers to understand this, to get
people in the real world to understand it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemical, pesticide, fungicide,
growth regulate issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really created an artificial world of
an unattainable appearance and
[SPEAKER_00]: unattainable production amount and
unattainable ability to have certain
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars in certain climactic situations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it allowed people to get around a
tremendous amount of true agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: skill and practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that a lot of the humble guys
really, really practiced and went up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all in all, testing changed this
area dramatically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
