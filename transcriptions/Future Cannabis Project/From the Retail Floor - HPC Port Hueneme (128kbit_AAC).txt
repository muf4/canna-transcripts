[SPEAKER_02]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Sean, a manager here at HPC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to give you a kind of walk
through on how everything's laid out in
[SPEAKER_02]: the shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Starting here is going to be one of our
edible sections.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100 milligrams cap on all of our products,
gummies, chocolates, cookies, hard
[SPEAKER_02]: candies, kind of a variety of different
types of products going on here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Moving on, we're going to come into our
cartridge section.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have full grams, half grams,
multiple different types of battery packs,
[SPEAKER_02]: a large variety of different types of
products here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then moving on, we have our flower
section.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have everything from top shelf to kind
of budget shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't cater to one kind of category of
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We like to have everyone shopping for
whatever they kind of need.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also have a variety of pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have single pack pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have variety pack pre-rolls,
kind of anything that anyone's looking
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then moving along, we're going to have our
tincture, our balms, our rubs,
[SPEAKER_02]: anything for pain that anyone's looking
for over on this side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, we have our CBD section.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyone who's not looking to feel the
THC effects, we have a CBD side here to
[SPEAKER_02]: where you can get the medical benefits
without feeling the high effect of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it illegal to do hemp-based CBD out
of a dispensary?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just lower THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not very high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, hopefully he's not
incriminating himself right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing some completely illegal shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, we're going to have our
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the dabable, if you will,
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have everything from crumble,
wax, shatter, sauces.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just got in some moon rocks that have
been really popular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hash, so any of the old school smokers
that like the hash, we have that also
[SPEAKER_02]: inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like temple balls?
[SPEAKER_02]: Temple balls, powder hash, everything kind
of included there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's start there.
[SPEAKER_02]: What hash brands are you carrying?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have... And what do you like to
smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: For the hash, I like our Biscotti company
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got a nice powder hash here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very good for topping off your bowls.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can smoke it by yourself, by itself,
if you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of my favorite companies for
the hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And where are they based out of?
[SPEAKER_02]: Biscotti, I believe they're located out of
the LA area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's probably like indoor hash.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we do have a few more
concentrates, more of our top tier stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: in the fridge over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the products need to stay at a
cooler temperature to preserve their
[SPEAKER_02]: turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: 710 Lab, some of the Raw Gardens products
are up in the shop over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's like a lot of the live resin
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that stuff popping off the shelves?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is one of our top sellers in the
whole shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: So give me a category.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's like the category that's exploding?
[SPEAKER_02]: So top three is going to be flour,
then concentrates, then cartridges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes cartridges outweigh
concentrates, sometimes concentrates
[SPEAKER_02]: outweigh the cartridges.
[SPEAKER_02]: It kind of varies kind of week by week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how long have you guys been open for?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been open about a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_02]: April 20th was our grand opening last
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just over a year and a half now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are... And what's declining?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as product or... Like categories,
kind of like... Like if something's
[SPEAKER_01]: increasing, something else happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be decreasing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, kind of.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I would say if anything,
it'd be some of the... Or it's growing
[SPEAKER_02]: less fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the tinctures... Some of the
tinctures, maybe stuff like that that
[SPEAKER_02]: people haven't been, I guess, pleased with
the way that they worked out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say something like that would be
the most decreased.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, the tinctures is not a one size
fits all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone has a different type of ratio
that they kind of need to fulfill the
[SPEAKER_02]: benefits that they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk about, you guys have a lot of
product on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are other shops where it's
like very minimalist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So kind of what's the decision making
process of how to lay out the shop?
[SPEAKER_02]: So here at HPC, one of our huge,
I think, advantages, we like to have a
[SPEAKER_02]: large variety of product.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to overwhelm the customer.
[SPEAKER_02]: We feel that our bud tenders have a very
good knowledge so that the overwhelming
[SPEAKER_02]: feeling can calm down once it's explained
to them and they can feel comfortable with
[SPEAKER_02]: any kind of purchase that they got going
on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you intentionally overwhelm them and
then you throw them the life raft.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of an educator to hold their
hand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then again, back to the one size fits
all, there's so many different types of
[SPEAKER_02]: flour, different types of cartridges,
different types of concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone needs a different type,
either indica, hybrid, or sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we like to have a huge variety so that
they can try multiple different types and
[SPEAKER_02]: find out exactly what works best for them,
as well as what they enjoy the most.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we like to have that huge variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always like bringing on new,
different products so that when they come
[SPEAKER_02]: in one week, maybe the next week,
they're going to have something that they
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't seen before and we can offer it to
them as a good substitute or an even
[SPEAKER_02]: better product than they've tried.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's an example of a newish product
that you like?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just started carrying the moon
rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a moon rock is going to be a nougat
flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be soaked in an oil and then
it's going to be rolled in keif.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is something that will burn for a
very long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not going to be just a one hit kind
of deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to keep on lasting for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What brand is this?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is by, give them a little shout out
here from Caviar.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a sativa, hybrid or indica
option for you so you have all of your
[SPEAKER_02]: bases covered with the moon rocks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you in charge of onboarding brands?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm part of the purchasing team.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of do a lot around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have many hats, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk about what it's been like as one
of the few dispensaries in all of Ventura
[SPEAKER_01]: County just getting overwhelmed with
brands that want to get on your shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is an issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: You must be a popular guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Shelf space is an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you can see, everything is full.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have grown out of our space,
if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: But one thing that we kind of look at
numbers, make sure that if there is
[SPEAKER_02]: something that might not be moving quite
as quick, we will kind of substitute
[SPEAKER_02]: something that we want to try to get in
that might move a little bit better back
[SPEAKER_02]: to we always want to have something new on
the shelf for people to kind of check out
[SPEAKER_02]: and just give them a variety of awesome
new products.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's kind of your mix of like small,
scrappy, upstart brands and the big,
[SPEAKER_01]: like are you carrying, I see like Foria,
Candescent, like Papa and Bart,
[SPEAKER_01]: are you carrying Candescent?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have some of the Candescent
pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have their flower currently in
stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to have their flower in the shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: They sold pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their pre-rolls definitely are a killer
hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we decided to kind of stick to what was
really, really well working for our shop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a really small brand that you want
to show some love to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any product category.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say we'll start with these guys
here that have been pretty popular,
[SPEAKER_02]: moving in pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the Dr. Rob's pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know him well.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys have done a really good job in
our shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a five pack of pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very affordable price.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys are killer for on the go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each pre-roll is independent.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're individually wrapped.
[SPEAKER_02]: So once you open the box, only the one
joint that you open up individually is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really smart on their point,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were to get into the mind of the
consumer, like you've kind of articulated
[SPEAKER_01]: some reasons why you think this is
resonating, like the price point,
[SPEAKER_01]: the fact that when you open it,
it's not like you don't need to smoke them
[SPEAKER_01]: all immediately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct, correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, there's some of the companies with
their packs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you open up the pack, it's all
getting aired out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You better smoke them all fairly quickly
or they're going to get dried out.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're going to kind of wear down on you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a really good job on how they
packed their products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we move, can you talk about kind of
the flower mix between your consumer?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they love their indoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they love their outdoor?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say our top sellers are kind of
outdoor budget shelf, if you will,
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have a very affordable price
range on our products, anywhere from 20 to
[SPEAKER_02]: 80 for an eighth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, we cover all categories.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a connoisseur and you want the
top shelf connected, Alien Labs,
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies Brands, we got it for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the budget shelf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, if you don't have the money to kind
of spend that much, we got you all covered
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So our budget shelf does a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does a lot of movement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which implies you have a budget conscious
consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a consumer that appreciates sun growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is like, I can't believe this stuff's
so cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, and honestly, most of the flower
there is actually decent.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not something that you're going to
come in and shake your head to and pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a lot of really good strains in
that budget shelf there for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your typical, like typical resale
to markup is 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you guys doing like, if you buy
something for 10, are you selling it for
[SPEAKER_01]: 20?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you selling it for 30?
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't markup anywhere near as much as
the other shops around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We would rather sell more products than
sit on products and have it make us our
[SPEAKER_02]: money.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want everyone that comes into the shop
to be benefited by the price.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's our main focus.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'd rather you not drive out to LA and we
want you to come here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll have the most affordable prices
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how many shops are in Portland,
even?
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe currently there is five.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is another one opening up soon,
kind of down the street from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think there'll be six in total in
Portland, even.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you must sense you're kind of an oasis
in the middle of a cannabis desert.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you probably get people driving from
30 miles away.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, Ventura County has been becoming
more and more of a destination for lots of
[SPEAKER_02]: different people from all over the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're only 10, 15 minute drive down
Victoria.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're one of the closest, if not the
closest.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got people coming from Santa Barbara.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have people coming from Woodland Hills.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of foot traffic around here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can see up to 700 people on a weekend.
[SPEAKER_02]: During the week we average probably around
500 people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we see a lot of people daily here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's been the reaction of people who are
taking kind of high dose, edible or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever when they now like max out at 10
milligrams?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the edibles have changed over the past
few years here with the cap being at a
[SPEAKER_02]: hundred milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that a few years ago you can get a
thousand milligram type of edible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone has their own dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people that can have 3000
milligrams in a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know people that can take five
milligrams and feel a little woozy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have the capped at a hundred
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't have the highest
tolerance, it's perfect to get a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: milligram bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can dose yourself out as needed to
either help with your sleep, help with
[SPEAKER_02]: your pain or to get through your day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like, are you getting complaints from
like the cancer patients who are like,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is ridiculous?
[SPEAKER_02]: We do get a lot of people that are upset
with the new ways, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of agree with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not the best to, when you used to buy
that thousand milligram bar and you could
[SPEAKER_02]: eat half of it and feel as good as you
needed to, you would have to buy a few
[SPEAKER_02]: more bags in this case now to get up to
that milligram dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're eating a lot of chocolate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that because of certain people
were not necessarily overdosing,
[SPEAKER_02]: but feeling too high off of those types of
products is why they decided to drop it
[SPEAKER_02]: down to the hundred milligram cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we go check out the fridge?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just quickly, since we just passed the,
like the pods and the 510 thread stuff are
[SPEAKER_01]: like pods, like what's the, you can go
ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's kind of the reaction to pods versus
the open source kind of 510 thread?
[SPEAKER_01]: The proprietary packs pods, like with
their own unique battery versus the 510
[SPEAKER_01]: thread traditional vape.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that most people go for the
510, the C cell based batteries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like, I have all types of batteries.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are certain strains that I like more
for the packs pen.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some that I like more for the 510.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's honestly, I just go down to basically
the strain itself and the oil that's in
[SPEAKER_02]: the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't care what battery it's used for.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I got to get a new battery and I like
that, that pod, I'm going to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So show me what you're currently smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So currently right now, this is the
Scherbinski's pod or cartridge here,
[SPEAKER_02]: the Jello Gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is one of my favorites from them,
if not my favorite.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a very potent, a very tasty,
clean, smooth cartridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is it like a CO2 extraction or?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is going to be a full spectrum CO2
based cartridge there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what you're hitting right now.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just a straight up 510 thread.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like a pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just a C cell base, any battery with
a button that cartridge will work for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, let's go check out the fridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here we got our fridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some of our chocolate,
the Kiva bars in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some drinks, sodas.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some of the concentrates that need
to be kept at that cooler temperature to
[SPEAKER_02]: preserve the turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people might not realize that if you
have your concentrates in a warmer
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature, it is kind of going to
degrade the quality slightly as far as
[SPEAKER_02]: your flavor and your experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for those people, we like to keep them
at a very cool temperature so that when
[SPEAKER_02]: they get home, they are going to enjoy it
just as it left the manufacturer there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk about some of the
extracted products that you're carrying
[SPEAKER_01]: and what you like and what's new to the
market?
[SPEAKER_02]: My favorites are going to be the 710 Labs
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just do a phenomenal job on the live
resins, their batters, their water hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people don't like to smoke anything
that's been extracted with a solvent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have their water hash that's going
to be solventless to give you a really
[SPEAKER_02]: good clean smoke.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's actually some of my favorite,
the water hash also there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just a super tasty, very potent type
of a high there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the highest selling brand you have
right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just in any category, what brand is
crushing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like where people are literally coming and
asking for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mostly back over to that budget flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a company called Houseweed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They offer a very affordable flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every single day, that's going to be our
top seller.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are they selling by the ounce?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's by the eighth.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the eighth, okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, like I said, daily people from 9
a.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: to 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_02]: people are in here looking for that
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're out of it, they're a little bit
upset, but we get it weekly so they might
[SPEAKER_02]: have to wait a day or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where is that grown, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is going to be up north, kind of
Emerald Triangle kind of area up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically they're hitting the budget
conscious person with quality at a
[SPEAKER_01]: reasonable price.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's starting to resonate where
people are coming in and specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: asking for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean there's some of the budget flower
that can be up into the higher 20% and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's some of the top shelf that can be
maybe around 23%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd say the main difference is it's going
to be just that smoothness, that taste
[SPEAKER_02]: that you get from more of that top shelf
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not necessarily the high is what everybody
goes for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people really enjoy the chirpings,
the flavor that they get from the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's usually why you go for a top shelf
type of product.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my opinion, that's my experience with
it, but there's some of the budget stuff
[SPEAKER_02]: that can have a really high potency that
if you just had a bad day, you want to get
[SPEAKER_02]: really high and take care of your kind of
worries there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's some of your favorite top shelf
flower right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say we have the Connected Flower,
the Gushers is a really good strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Connected is indoor, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct, correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's going to be one of my
favorite strains by far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cookies has a really good line also for
their indoor flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have a really good strain lineup.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Icy Collective, they're from up north.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do a really good job on their product
also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that also indoor?
[SPEAKER_02]: That has to be indoor also, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're an indoor enthusiast.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in the industry for about 12
years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I consider myself a slightly
connoisseur, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do like my top shelf flower for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Top shelf indoor?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people who grow up in Humboldt and
Trinity and Mendocino may have a different
[SPEAKER_01]: definition of what top shelf is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is true, that is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you guys are super busy,
which surprised me as a little shop on a
[SPEAKER_01]: third floor of a sort of script mall
complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, today's Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to see between 600 and 700
people today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our staff is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't rush anyone out of here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always like to cater to everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't want to sell anything to anyone
that they're not going to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always tell the budtenders, if you don't
like it, do not recommend it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Offer them something that you really
enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they come back and they have a
conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: A, what you offered me was amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to try something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have anything else that you've
tried that you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're here for the patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want everyone to feel taken care of and
wanting to come back for their next aid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of at any one time, I see Henry's
and Absolute.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you kind of peak at like two vendors
at a time, given the limited space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll peak up at three, believe it or not,
we can get three tables set up here with
[SPEAKER_02]: different PADs going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wednesdays through Saturdays are the days
that we have PADs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just going all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually between 11 and seven.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll kind of break it up like 11 to two
and then one from like two to five.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'll change the brands in and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are they all fighting to get those
slots?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we daily get companies contacting us,
trying to get in here for a PAD.
[SPEAKER_02]: We book out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they paying to do it or are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, we want them here as much as they
want to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they're here, their product moves
quicker, which means we can get another
[SPEAKER_02]: order in and get the product moving as
quick as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say that it benefits us as much as
it benefits them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, so I imagine, I mean,
because it seems like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're a ton of brands fighting for
limited retail space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any brands that stand out in
terms of supporting you guys as a vendor?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, definitely Henry's Original.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've kind of been here from the
beginning with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're supposed to be here from 11 to two
every Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: They offer a BOGO deal when you buy their
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also offer a BOGO deal even if you
don't buy their product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will give you one of their products,
which is one of the only companies that
[SPEAKER_02]: does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I walk out of here, Rick,
is it Rick or Rich?
[SPEAKER_03]: Rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rich will hook me up with some Henry's.
[SPEAKER_01]: With any purchase in the shop?
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to pry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got it, got it, got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: We love HPCC.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is top of the shelf store in the
state.
[SPEAKER_05]: We love coming here every Friday,
11 to two.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you for the partnership.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're the founder's dad, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm one of the fathers of the founders.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you retired?
[SPEAKER_05]: School teacher.
[SPEAKER_05]: My son, Rocco, asked me to do demos at
some shops because I live in Santa
[SPEAKER_05]: Barbara.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, do you want to smoke weed and
talk to people all day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That comes from the big fish.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, I've been doing that for 40
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, in the classroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, they show a lot of support.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, 11 to two.
[SPEAKER_02]: But don't be surprised if you see Richard
here till three or four sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we have to kick him out.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's relentless.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's an animal.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't want to stay retired.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So any peanut gallery questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: Lance is usually so talkative.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know why he's so shy on these.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long, I've been traveling for
the last three weeks of the convention
[SPEAKER_00]: circus.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you call like BDS
analytics or headset.io or new frontier
[SPEAKER_00]: data.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, some of the companies aggregate
data on sales and trends, but typically it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like 50% of the sales are flower,
50% are let's just call all concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you starting to see a pivotal shift
for you guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you have a great flower selection,
but you also have a pretty good
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate selection too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say, like I said, I think I
mentioned earlier, it kind of teeters.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are certain days where concentrates
are the number one seller.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of the time though, it's the
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of people that haven't
quite experienced or ventured off to the
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of concentrate or cartridge side yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is growing and growing though daily.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people come in, they want to try
a cartridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: They want to know kind of what the hype is
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually very convenient as far as
the smell, as far as what you have to take
[SPEAKER_02]: with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need to bring a pipe and a
lighter and your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can just take your battery with your
cartridge and you're good to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, it is very, very growing,
very fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the concentrates, like what
percentage of people, obviously you have
[SPEAKER_01]: people who smoke concentrates coming in to
buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like when somebody has never done it
before and is like, how the hell would I
[SPEAKER_01]: even smoke this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, are you selling a lot?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you introducing a lot of people to
concentrates?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the most part, I'll start them with
kind of something on that hash side or the
[SPEAKER_02]: crumble side.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something that you can very easily
top your bowl off with.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can kind of put a little bit on top of
your weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't need to buy any additional
hardware.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely more for the connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't need your torch and dab rig or
your puffco or your ghost.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would, again, I would say that's kind
of more for the connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_02]: That likes that the high of just the
concentrates more than combining it with
[SPEAKER_02]: their flour or just a top off,
something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly, connoisseur.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then for the older demographics,
since we know the fastest growing is
[SPEAKER_00]: really like the 50 and up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing that more or so attracted
to the edibles, the tinctures,
[SPEAKER_00]: the topicals, the transdermals?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we'll see the 18 year old kid that
just got his card wants to come experience
[SPEAKER_02]: a shop and we'll see the 80 year old
grandma that comes in here that has hit
[SPEAKER_02]: problems and needs a good rub or a good
solve to help out with their pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day we'll see a mixture of
everything there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to help you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to redo that where you're not
going to see the 18 year old kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: With their medical card.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah, with their medical card.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: 18 year old with a medical card is only
accepted in our shop here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us about that so a lot of people
don't know what happened with the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: segue into 64 for Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how did that position the medical
patient?
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us here in Port Wright,
every city kind of has their own,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, way they want to go about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have a tax exemption for medical
or recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the same price for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main difference is going to be the
state is equal opportunity with its tax
[SPEAKER_02]: rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have your medical card,
the main benefit, you can get more of a
[SPEAKER_02]: quantity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Leave us up to eight ounces of flour you
can get with your medical card.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're just recreational, you can get
up to only one ounce.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you do find yourself needing more
than just that ounce, you're more than
[SPEAKER_02]: welcome to go to a doctor and get your
card so that you can get more for yourself
[SPEAKER_02]: and your needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about your do you dream of metric?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have nightmares about metric?
[SPEAKER_02]: Metric has been quite a challenge here.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is not the most fun thing to go through
at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is very necessary, though, if we want
to stay in business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we are close to being on top of metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been about two weeks now that we've
been converting over to metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not been fun, but it's something that
we know.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two weeks, so since mid September,
you guys have been taking metric very
[SPEAKER_01]: seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say by another two weeks,
our shop will be fully metric integrated
[SPEAKER_02]: and fully compliant with all of the new
regulations that have to do with metric
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say Lori Ajax of the BCC is
watching this video.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there anything you would like to say
that is kind of frustratingly ridiculous
[SPEAKER_01]: as you deal with metric?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very tedious work that needs to
get done in order to have everything in
[SPEAKER_02]: place and to their standards.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not really trying to complain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely feel like there's some steps
that can be possibly altered or shifted
[SPEAKER_02]: around to make it a little bit more
beneficial for the actual shop here so
[SPEAKER_02]: that we're not necessarily wasting time,
but we're still moving along in a timely
[SPEAKER_02]: fashion as opposed to having to stay
working late hours trying to get
[SPEAKER_02]: everything in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was very diplomatic, very gentle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk to me about the consumer's reaction
to the tax rate when they see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do your taxes show up as one line item or
like multiple line items on their bill?
[SPEAKER_02]: We, I like to say we absorb most of the
taxes at our shop here.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you see tax wise is the local city
taxes on your receipt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is what in?
[SPEAKER_02]: 8.75%.
[SPEAKER_02]: 8.75 in port planning.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that is the only tax rate that you will
see on your receipt.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is only what we charge you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, we're here for the customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want them to feel, we don't want them
to feel like they've paid too much for
[SPEAKER_02]: what they bought.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we only charge them that local city
taxes on our products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just talk trade samples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before Metric, it was actually fairly easy
for a vendor to come by and give us
[SPEAKER_02]: samples of their product so that we can
try and see if the price point,
[SPEAKER_02]: the quality is going to work out in our
shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dealing with Metric now, it's been a lot
more tedious of an effort to get the
[SPEAKER_02]: product in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to create its own manifest just to
get the product into the shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which means on the vendor's side,
they have to create the manifest for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to accept it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to put it into our system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not a quick and easy come on by,
drop it off process.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to schedule appointments and stuff
like that for just to get a sample of a
[SPEAKER_02]: product so we can see if it's going to
work out in our shop or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you try that sample, doesn't the
vendor technically have to pay what the
[SPEAKER_01]: sales tax collected on that product would
have to pay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's definitely a little bit more
pricey of a process now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the small brands you deal with,
how are they handling that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's a big expense for a small
brand that's not well funded.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's actually pretty tough for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know that they have to, like I said,
kind of eat a little bit of their profits
[SPEAKER_02]: there just to get us in the shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for the most part, any of the vendors
that are in our shop have noticed an
[SPEAKER_02]: increase in their sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: After the fact.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it is somewhat of a risk, but it
usually pays off in the end for them no
[SPEAKER_02]: matter what.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically with knowledgeable but time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct, correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, good, good.
Good, good, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, good, good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good, good, good.
