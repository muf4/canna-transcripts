[SPEAKER_00]: From the very beginning we started as
indoor growers and at that time we used
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand watt high-pressure sodium and
metal highlight lights We've soon Soon
[SPEAKER_00]: after you know building out a couple of
indoor grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We decided to abuse the Sun and move into
greenhouse so We still use indoor lights,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we've moved from thousand watt
high-pressure sodium to 200 watt LED LED
[SPEAKER_00]: lights and the difference has been amazing
if you take a light spectrum, and you put
[SPEAKER_00]: it under a 2,000 watt light It's or a
thousand watt high-pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's off the charts as far as the lumens
Then you put that light put that same
[SPEAKER_00]: light spectrum under an LED light And it
barely shows up however a side-by-side
[SPEAKER_00]: between a high-pressure sodium and an LED
light is amazing So basically you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting a full spectrum of the Sun
under some LED lights not all whereas The
[SPEAKER_00]: lumens aren't as bright as a high-pressure
sodium, but kind of what we saw whenever
[SPEAKER_00]: we were kind of You know testing to see if
we wanted to switch to an LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did a side-by-side We took plants the
same Genetic that's looked identical in
[SPEAKER_00]: health size And we put some under a
high-pressure sodium I mean this
[SPEAKER_00]: high-pressure sodium was 18 inches off of
these plants So they're getting the most
[SPEAKER_00]: intense light we could possibly give them
There are a thousand watts they put off a
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous amount of heat so we have to
duck them we have to air cool them and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we had a LED light a 200 watt LED
light For five feet over the plants that
[SPEAKER_00]: put off.
[SPEAKER_00]: No heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the lumens Of a
high-pressure sodium, but for some reason
[SPEAKER_00]: under we had under our LED light We had
plants that looked like outdoor plants the
[SPEAKER_00]: leaves were bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were greener they didn't have as
stretchier nodes of growth and All because
[SPEAKER_00]: of the spectrum so what we're learning is
that it doesn't matter the intensity of
[SPEAKER_00]: Lumens what matters is the spectrum of
light so all propagation is done indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: all of our breeding operations are done
indoor and all of our R&D plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so we'll We'll take a bunch of
different genetics and basically just
[SPEAKER_00]: flower them indoor so that we can test
them so that we can see what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenoids what levels of THC what levels
of CBD and Eventually, you know extend the
[SPEAKER_00]: research on discovering new new
cannabinoids for production We're either
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor or we're in greenhouse we do have
supplemental lighting in our greenhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: and Ultimately all that does is extend the
photo period of vegetative state until
[SPEAKER_00]: we're ready to flower so we want them to
veg to a certain size before Before we
[SPEAKER_00]: flower them out for many different reasons
Right now we are moving into LED lights
[SPEAKER_00]: for that because they don't grow under
that supplemental light That's not what
[SPEAKER_00]: it's for it's just to keep it in the
vegetative state We are kind of phasing
[SPEAKER_00]: into LED lights, but it takes time LED
light Setup is twelve thirteen hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars where a high-pressure sodium setup
is 200 bucks Especially for an indoor for
[SPEAKER_00]: a greenhouse setting We are all hundred
percent organic in our pesticides Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: has Has a list of things that you can use
and a no-no list of things that you cannot
[SPEAKER_00]: use so Everything that we use from from
mold to pesticide is a hundred percent
[SPEAKER_00]: organic treatments one of the products
that we use that that does wonders for
[SPEAKER_00]: spider mites and russet mites is a Product
called green cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the the good list.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something That we can use it's
something that you can use on tomatoes and
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries up to the day of harvest
there and then there there Pesticides that
[SPEAKER_00]: are on the no-no list that if you use even
as a clone Doesn't matter if that that
[SPEAKER_00]: same clone that you use this particular
pesticide It can grow 12 feet tall it will
[SPEAKER_00]: still show up in the final product The
reason why is because cannabis in general
[SPEAKER_00]: is fibrous And especially when it grows
those flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a sponge it holds on To everything
and you can detect any pesticide at any
[SPEAKER_00]: time of using We've been messing around
with drip systems since the beginning and
[SPEAKER_00]: we finally found one that we like and it's
it's a slow drip system And it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: work with big pots and we've discovered
that we can grow with this particular drip
[SPEAKER_00]: system We can grow five pound plants out
of a 20 gallon pot You know we've always
[SPEAKER_00]: thought the bigger the pot the bigger the
plants and that was the way to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow Huge plants and have a great yield
we're learning that it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: different whenever you can keep a steady
drip you not only save water you keep your
[SPEAKER_00]: microbic activity by keeping the soil wet
and You're constantly feeding your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately the drip system will save you
15 to 20 percent on your water because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a constant drip You don't have any of
the overflow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's typically when you hand water a pot
you have overflow You have drainage
[SPEAKER_00]: through the bottom and that's a lot of
that's all wasted water with a drip
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're You're not seeing all that excess
Water so you're saving about 15 20 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: on water through a drip system and you're
keeping it wet all the time A plant
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't like to go dry and then wet and
then dry and then wet so you're keeping a
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy medium and you're keeping Microbic
activity in the soil which overall gives
[SPEAKER_00]: you a better plant gives you a better
yield and Saving water on top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are aeroponic systems that grow
pound plants and they literally have the
[SPEAKER_00]: root structure of the one gallon pot and
the reason why is because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: Constantly feeding it they don't have to
have the root structure as long as they're
[SPEAKER_00]: uptaking the nutrients that they need to
grow There's there's so much you can go
[SPEAKER_00]: into with with root structure I mean if
you're it depends on if you have three
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and you have 60 gallon pots and you
want to grow huge plants you can do that
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can grow huge plants and They will
have the capability to do that with such a
[SPEAKER_00]: huge pot and that much soil But however,
you're not going to be feeding Them as
[SPEAKER_00]: continually as you could be in a smaller
container.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go through a lot of water and in one
day for Right around 1,100 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go through about 1,800 gallons of water
a day drip system would take that to about
[SPEAKER_00]: 1,100 1,200 gallons so you're still good
you'd still be going through the water,
[SPEAKER_00]: but Whenever you hand water a plant and
you have all that drainage and it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: out the sides of a velvet pot You don't
have that with drip system it Constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbs you're cutting out all that extra
water that's going to waste we get it
[SPEAKER_00]: through hydro gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Locally owned shop that's outside
of Colorado Springs To move into a solar
[SPEAKER_00]: energy energy-saving system it takes time
It's not something you can just do
[SPEAKER_00]: overnight as you as you know eventually
we'd love to have solar but in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: have solar and green energy it takes it
takes a good good amount of capital to To
[SPEAKER_00]: implement those type types of systems
Absolutely absolutely We have something
[SPEAKER_00]: that we call a climate battery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Some growers have been using it for
you know tropical trees and greenhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically you dig a big hole and you
put a bunch of French drain in the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: and you attach it to a bunch of French
straight like Trying to think irrigation
[SPEAKER_00]: tunnels that you would see under roads
like the big plastic Corrugated pipes so
[SPEAKER_00]: you attach the French drain to that And
you have a big tube where you pull the
[SPEAKER_00]: heat of the air from the greenhouse into
these tubes And it goes through the French
[SPEAKER_00]: drain you have to insulate the ground
first and on the other Side on the exhaust
[SPEAKER_00]: you get cool air so you're pulling in hot
air bringing it into the ground the heat
[SPEAKER_00]: exchanges in the ground and you get the
cool air so basically you're cooling your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses in the day and You're turning
your your greenhouse pad into A heat pad
[SPEAKER_00]: and it saves us about 30% on propane so
the air exchanges in the ground You have
[SPEAKER_00]: heat come into the ground everything is
insulated on the ground what you have
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out is it feels like
air-conditioned air Well however that heat
[SPEAKER_00]: is trapped in the ground and that seeps up
at night So basically you're turning your
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse pad into a heat pad It's
insulated on the bottom and on the sides
[SPEAKER_00]: so that heat has nowhere to go but up So
because the cold ground below if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have that energy Insulated will pull all
that heat down into the earth through
[SPEAKER_00]: conduction So this with the insulation is
the only way that this will work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you can still cool your greenhouse
Just fine you know you're basically just
[SPEAKER_00]: exchanging the heat in the ground and
you're insulated that heat has nowhere to
[SPEAKER_00]: go but up So and it's from what we from
what we can tell before we have this
[SPEAKER_00]: climate battery where we're saving about
about 30% on propane, which is still a big
[SPEAKER_00]: number.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're also cooling our greenhouse in the
day our green our greenhouse that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the climate battery is Consistently
about eight to ten degrees warmer all the
[SPEAKER_00]: time, so it's a big difference All for the
price of running four fans About four
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago So and we have not built any
other greenhouses after that but any any
[SPEAKER_00]: other greenhouse that we build will have a
climate battery And to put it in
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective we have a indica greenhouse
and a sativa greenhouse In our indica
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, which is where we have this
climate battery our plants are
[SPEAKER_00]: consistently Three four feet taller than
our sativas, and it should be the other
[SPEAKER_00]: way around Sativas are taller bigger
plants however.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're creating a better environment with
this climate battery cooler temperatures
[SPEAKER_00]: and Heat at night typically the heat at
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's better for the roots In our other
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have that climate battery our
heat is over the plants So we're not
[SPEAKER_00]: getting that heat underneath so ultimately
that's kind of killing us in our sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse They still grow and they're
still big plants, but they they don't do
[SPEAKER_00]: with the conditions in our
state-of-the-art greenhouse with this
[SPEAKER_00]: climate battery We test everything we have
our own equipment to be able to test you
[SPEAKER_00]: know levels of THC levels of CBD
pesticides different things like that that
[SPEAKER_00]: we We want to be sure I mean if we take it
to to some random lab And they're finding
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we're not then it raises
some questions You You You You You You
