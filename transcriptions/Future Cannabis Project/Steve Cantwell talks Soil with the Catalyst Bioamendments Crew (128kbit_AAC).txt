[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's how they describe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, Bill from Logan Labs yesterday,
and I've been hearing it's a new term
[SPEAKER_03]: that's been thrown around like the last
few years, so I'm a little bit aware of
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, if you talk to an agronomist
about soil, they relate to particle size,
[SPEAKER_03]: sand, silk, clay, organic matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you talk to like an Elaine Ingham
student, that's the definition of birth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you add biology to it,
now you have soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so now these agronomists, so they're
saying, I say using words like engineered
[SPEAKER_03]: soil, or super soils, or all these old
words that we used to use, they're
[SPEAKER_03]: starting to use the word soil-less medium
based off of the lack of certain particle
[SPEAKER_03]: sizes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's becoming a really common word.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yesterday Bill was giving this dope
ass presentation on how to read a soil
[SPEAKER_03]: report, and he started using the word
soil-less medium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sitting in the back of the room,
and I just watched half the room check
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_03]: They heard soil-less medium, they're
thinking hydra.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're thinking corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he wasn't the only one, though.
[SPEAKER_03]: But he wasn't the only one.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was the only one that spoke up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was watching the rest of the room from
the back, and I'm telling you,
[SPEAKER_03]: the whole room kind of went like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just had to say, I went up to Tyler,
I was like, hey man, Bill's talking,
[SPEAKER_03]: giving some valuable information,
and he just lost half the room by using
[SPEAKER_03]: the word soil-less medium.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I explained to Tyler real quick what
it meant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, if you want, I can explain
this real quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's when Tyler, after the break,
was like, hey, see, Steve has to explain
[SPEAKER_03]: something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm glad I did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so if you ask a soil agronomist,
the definition of soil, or a soil
[SPEAKER_03]: agronomist will explain soil depending on
particle size, sand, silk, clay,
[SPEAKER_03]: and organic matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: To them, that is soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: To a soil biologist, that's the definition
of dirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: You take that dirt, and you add biology to
it, and now you have soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now you have an ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you talk to an agronomist,
when they look at an engineered soil,
[SPEAKER_03]: if they don't see sand, silk, clay,
they see this base.
[SPEAKER_03]: To them, that's not a soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a soil-less medium.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, we might be inoculating them with
life.
[SPEAKER_03]: We might be trying to do as much as we can
to replicate nature in that medium.
[SPEAKER_03]: But to an agronomist, without those
mineral sizes, it's not a soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when he said that, the whole room
checked out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, then to indoor growers, or hydro
growers, soil-less is- Yeah, so exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what you just said, on the growing
community, when we hear soil-less medium,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're thinking rock wool, cocoa core,
bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: So everybody's looking at it, and I'm
like, hey, we're all living soil people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a living soil summit.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about hydro.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sitting there watching this
unfold, and I'm like, oh my god,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's a train wreck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I gotta help.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this
[SPEAKER_05]: is my take on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm growing in an engineered soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I have a heavy mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nowadays, they go heavier on the paint
moths for shipping purposes.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a little bit lighter.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want the old school, huge three-part
mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: The 30, 30, 30 heavy compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't use the Malibu's compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did pumice, and then peat moss.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heavily amended, we used the clay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't remember the exact clay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't looked at the recipe in a long
time, but we did add the clay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since then, I've added clay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've added sands.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've added all these different particle
sizes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just green sands, but other sands,
too, for drainage.
[SPEAKER_03]: My first, after about five cycles,
I started getting a heavy layer of
[SPEAKER_03]: castings.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a little worried about it,
because I wasn't getting the penetration
[SPEAKER_03]: of the water as fast as I wanted to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no problem ever since.
[SPEAKER_03]: I consider my engineered soil a soil,
because I do have those particles in my
[SPEAKER_03]: mix.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I see both sides of it,
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: If someone wants to be called a soilless
medium, or I'm gonna shoot you,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, it's a fucking soilless medium.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to fight over it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's mostly just vernacular.
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as we both know what you mean by
whatever word you're saying, I get what
[SPEAKER_06]: you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday, that was the confusion.
[SPEAKER_03]: They weren't on the same page.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not confusing at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's even take it a step further,
though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I probably hit this in my speech tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most people growing in living soil,
if we're being honest, aren't growing in
living soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're only focused on their cast crop,
the plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're growing in a dying soil using life
support to keep it alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think until producers start focusing on
the life of everything in their ecosystem,
[SPEAKER_03]: their protozoa, their fungi, their
bacteria, their companion plants,
[SPEAKER_03]: if they don't focus on the life cycle of
all those organisms, again, they're
[SPEAKER_03]: growing in a dying soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a dying system, a dying soil,
on life support.
[SPEAKER_03]: In order to be a living system,
you have to consider all of those living
[SPEAKER_03]: organisms that make that complete
ecosystem, like Elaine.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't have certain numbers of
certain organisms, she wouldn't even
[SPEAKER_03]: consider it a full ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have dirt to her.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has high standards before she will
call you a living soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get that dirt away from her.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's funny on that topic, too,
though.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people, at the end of the season,
especially outdoor, will be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: cut the plant down in pieces on the pots.
[SPEAKER_04]: You take all year long, you're putting in
compost, you're doing your extracts,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then you just walk away from it at the
end of the season and just let it rot to
[SPEAKER_04]: die in the sun and dry out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a dying soil on life support.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you're going to go back next year and
dump all that same energy back into it and
[SPEAKER_04]: then leave it again.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep plants in that system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Keep things growing so that your hard work
is still being used.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that evolution of yours?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I love that conjure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think Elaine was the one who really put
that into motion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got word of it to Scott from back in the
day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made the big switch because I was having
trouble with the clover indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just hard, too much pest,
that high nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets too solid sometimes, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just the high nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just lighting a fire on any pest
that made it into the building.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were on the clover and they were
blowing up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was causing more problems than
solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We culled all the clover.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was looking for a new ground cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted brown mulch for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I literally backed off companion plants
like a cycle, too.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was actually worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had more pest pressure down our plants
at that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, that backfired.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we learned about the Dichondra,
so we started pulling Dichondra.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't really serve much of a purpose
other than it's just a fucking ground
[SPEAKER_03]: cover.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not really the hottest plant in my
bed as far as pest pressure goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing really wants to eat Dichondra.
[SPEAKER_03]: Things will linger on it if it's their
only option, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_03]: no one's excited about Dichondra,
pest-wise, that I've seen.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a safe cover crop to cover the soil
with the living mulch, putting roots into
[SPEAKER_03]: your soil, pumping sugar and organic
matter into the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, I'm spending a lot more money on
light than the outdoor guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: If my plant doesn't catch that light,
I want to make sure something does.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to transfer that into sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to put it back in my soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to waste any money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dichondra also has established connections
with mycorrhizae fungi, so when you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have plants in there, it's holding that
mycorrhizae in the ground, so the next
[SPEAKER_04]: time you throw a plant in there,
it can start branching and re-pairing with
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant you're putting back in.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the Dichondra is all at this level,
so do you have other stuff hitting
[SPEAKER_05]: different levels?
[SPEAKER_03]: I look at more of the roots than the
tropics.
[SPEAKER_03]: I look more at that below the soil zone,
root depths.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Dichondra is probably shallow,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more shallow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't say they're shallow,
but they're definitely more shallow than
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the other ... I'll plant grasses
for deeper roots and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, considering root depth,
I think occupying soil space for roots is
[SPEAKER_03]: a key component, am I correct?
[SPEAKER_08]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's your opinion on cereal grass?
[SPEAKER_08]: I've heard from Jimmy Myers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you ever used cereal grass for pest
control?
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't say I've ... Paraphrase the
question.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of you guys, because he doesn't have a
microphone.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: My experience with cereal grass and its
pest resistance?
[SPEAKER_08]: Being a pest drawer.
[SPEAKER_03]: A pest drawer, it's like a trap plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not sure if I've used that actual
cereal grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've not used rye, I've used barley.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say I've ever used it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never used that actual species of
grass.
[SPEAKER_07]: For that purpose though?
[SPEAKER_03]: I use it more just because it's a quick
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I have a really thick crop and it
knocks the back of my Dichondra and I have
[SPEAKER_03]: exposed soil, at certain times of the year
I will go brown mulch heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to try to keep roots in my soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll throw a grass down to get deeper
roots really fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: It germinates really fast.
[SPEAKER_03]: Quick grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's kind of my thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it dies off if it gets shaded.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you gotta be careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, gotta know what season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ganja Gill actually told me to be careful
planting grasses because his farm is
[SPEAKER_03]: aphids.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has a type of aphid that attacks
grasses.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're just keeping a food resource
around for the whole year?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you just gotta be careful on what you
plant and when you plant it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you have a population that's going to
be bad and summer's going to be worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, I try to mix it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dirt companion plants will put different
sugars in, attract different microbes,
[SPEAKER_03]: occupy that root space with as much roots,
or that soil space with as much roots as
[SPEAKER_03]: we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of my approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do things a little bit different as far
as everything to me is a system.
[SPEAKER_03]: You see a beautiful garden, you see plants
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: People just think I'm going around just
throwing seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But no, everything has a place and a
reason.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Einstein.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't judge a fish on how well it can
climb a tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: You gotta put something in the proper
spot, in the proper role.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he said that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like, don't quote me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't quote me quote him.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not going to put a cactus as a
companion plant and judge it as companion
[SPEAKER_03]: plants are bad because I put a cactus in
the wrong place.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that really plays a role in
making these systems efficient.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if I have marigolds, for example,
I got them planted all over my room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Marigolds, they can be a banker or they
can be a trap plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: For my case, they're more of a trap plant
for thrips.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I have marigolds all over my grill,
I'm just feeding the enemy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I do, I just place them in the
corner of my beds where I walk by them the
[SPEAKER_03]: most.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's an easy to monitor system.
[SPEAKER_03]: It used to be in their own pots when I put
them in the middle of a room.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's Clover.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similar technique, I like to pay
attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I just put the marigolds in the corner
of the bed, in the main aisles.
[SPEAKER_03]: That way when you're walking by them,
you can't help but see them.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you see a pest pressure on them,
cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Throw it down, blow torch it down,
trash can be done with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we don't want to create systems that
create more problems than solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be breeding thrips or
whatever the problem may be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to be controlling them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't control them, you just go ham.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, throwing seeds everywhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to give us what we wanted
people to take away from your
[SPEAKER_06]: presentation?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then these guys can ask questions as
if they were there watching your
[SPEAKER_06]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_08]: I did get to catch some of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, the large scale alfalfa farm up
in Montana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, the big takeaway, what we were
trying to put out is there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: different ways to use the tools that we
use when we're consulting.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are pretty heavy on compost extracts,
compost teas, solid amendments.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just showing that there's such a broad
way of using all these tools and getting
[SPEAKER_04]: that extract out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, it's like, now I'm all
tongue tied, but trying to summarize.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like kind of activating it before you're
actually putting it out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's something huge that we've
learned.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our players use the word Bavaria bassiana.
[SPEAKER_08]: Talking Bavaria bassiana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talking Bavaria bassiana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we kind of develop, I don't know if
anybody else is doing it yet or not,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we use it because it is a spore when
you buy it in a packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's putting that into a tea and actually
waking it up before you put it out to use
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can drastically reduce the amount of
it that you have to use because when
[SPEAKER_04]: you're using it in powdered form,
putting it in liquid and spraying it out
[SPEAKER_04]: immediately, a lot of that hasn't woken up
yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you're trying to overextend this
out there to make sure enough of it wakes
[SPEAKER_04]: up that it deals with your pest problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: But by putting it in a tea ahead of time,
you're waking it up and so it's already
[SPEAKER_04]: active when it goes out and you're going
to have a lot more success rate so you can
[SPEAKER_04]: use a lot less of it in that mix and save
yourself a ton of money in the process.
[SPEAKER_04]: For 250 gallons.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like six cups or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you look under the microscope though,
when you see a spore that's germinating
[SPEAKER_03]: versus spore that's not, just look at the
size difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if you're throwing that, say that's a
bullet, you have a lot more surface space
[SPEAKER_03]: to hit something too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead of at a pinpoint, then it's got a
web out like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a net.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also just using the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we're adding the Bavaria bastiana
spore to the extracts, we see them
[SPEAKER_00]: actually wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know they're germinating into the
microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think so much of what we were trying
to get across was when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: living soil, everyone uses living soil,
regenerative practices, permaculture,
[SPEAKER_00]: all these terms are pointing to the fact
that we're growing microbes, that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: working with microbes, which are
invisible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the fact that we have a microscope
to check ourselves, like that is so much
[SPEAKER_00]: what we're trying to help people
understand is that you don't have to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientist or be highly trained to be able
to use a tool to check your own work and
[SPEAKER_00]: to identify the different ecosystems that
are not available for us to look at with
[SPEAKER_00]: our eyes and our growing systems,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, you can put your mulch
underneath a microscope to see if it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: good biological activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your soil, your extracts, your biological
inoculums, for goodness sake.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one person I really want to go back
and speak to because I was left their
[SPEAKER_00]: sample with a note and they didn't tell me
what the sample is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's a soilless medium of some
kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a texture I've never recognized
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe there's a high percentage of
biochar in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I run it between my fingers,
it's very gritty and it leaves a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit of a black trace.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it also has a bit of a wood,
like a wood dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look to it, it's dry, but it has very
little life, but it has all the functional
[SPEAKER_00]: groups spread way out, which isn't
typical.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually when we see a lot of, you know,
propozoa present, you're going to see
[SPEAKER_00]: bacteria aggregating.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see, you know,
fungal hyphae around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in this sample, it's almost as if
somebody's spread everybody way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks like a different kind of
ecosystem, yet there's life throughout it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're looking at it under the microscope.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not typical of things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm wondering, I'm like,
is this what, you know, active biochar
[SPEAKER_00]: looks like?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not as active as a typical soil or a
compost that I would look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: More, just more space.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, and then we had a lot of people
bringing samples, but they just
[SPEAKER_00]: accidentally made fantastic compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really rare that it happens,
but there's been three or four different
[SPEAKER_00]: samples at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just put some stuff together in the
backyard and it just turned out good.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it does happen, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've seen some soil samples that look,
you know, fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look just like our compost does,
which is really the goal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What we would like to do in our living
soil system, they should look far more
[SPEAKER_00]: rich and vital than any compost products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because, you know, the compost reality is,
like, there's nothing growing in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking microorganisms, we're taking
organic material, we're mixing them
[SPEAKER_00]: together, they're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't even touch what a plant
can do with the microorganisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking the sun's energy and feeding
it specifically to microbes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited for the day when I start
getting soil samples that look better than
[SPEAKER_00]: our compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I'm looking forward to in the
future.
[SPEAKER_03]: I use soil to make tea sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, if I have a room that's,
you know, in an early stage of its life,
[SPEAKER_03]: at the veg, plants are pumping sugars,
room's nice and warm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm seeing mushrooms everywhere,
good looking soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll take a handful of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll scope it first, obviously.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll do a brew from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I have great results doing that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like you're re-inoculating with what
your plants have already grown in that
[SPEAKER_04]: soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're putting it right over
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you should have an easier transplant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'll put a room that's awake,
and I'll put it to a room that just is
[SPEAKER_03]: waking up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll use it to wake a room up.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a starter culture.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's like what we do with our
compost as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, we keep a little bit of every pile
we've ever made on our compost lot is in a
[SPEAKER_04]: pile.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's inoculating.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we take some of that pile,
and we put that pile back into every
[SPEAKER_04]: single pile we make.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's like this endless back loop
feeding of all of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You learned that from Elaine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, the thought came from sourdough
bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before we found Elaine, we were
obsessed with fermentation of food
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people in this industry got
started with bread, I find.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's yeast and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the mother culture, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's the idea of growing out
microbes to serve a function in our lives,
[SPEAKER_00]: to make something more nutrient dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And easier to consume.
[SPEAKER_03]: More flavorful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know you guys were on the bread
train.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't know that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes I'm not on the carb train.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys start kidding when you said you
got culture on me.
[SPEAKER_06]: My brother and his wife have a yogurt
company.
[SPEAKER_06]: And one of the byproducts of making yogurt
is whey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whey.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which they have in like gallons.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, I get five gallon buckets from them
to play with.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I want to start introducing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, like, what would you do if you had
like a gallon of whey?
[SPEAKER_04]: I would make some lacto-fermented soda for
myself to consume.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there any benefit to the garden that
that could create?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, lactobacillus is like a great
facultate of anaerobic, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, it's really good at mitigating
anaerobic environments, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, like, this is what you have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Guys, I'm going to throw kombucha and whey
for yogurt baking as your two secret
[SPEAKER_06]: ingredients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you're out there on a grow set.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are you going to do with that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, god.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could use it for powder mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whey would be, you know, you could
mitigate powder mildew with whey.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use milk all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't hold for a long period of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have enough of it, you know,
you have plenty since you've got these
[SPEAKER_00]: five gallon trumps.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're from Maine?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd also be you could use the whey if you
had a compost pile that had went,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, horribly off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you've got your recipe smelling
really bad, spraying it with a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: whey.
[SPEAKER_04]: I imagine you could do the same thing with
a soil, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just derinching a soil with some whey
might bring an anaerobic pile back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've never heard anybody including whey in
their gardening practices You said that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, where's he going with this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Kombucha, though, on the other hand,
I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might be a little bit risky spraying
kombucha.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you would have to dilute it a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so how I've used it before is I do
like JLF bucket tech kind of, and I'll add
[SPEAKER_07]: like a schmil from a little like beer,
if I can get it.
[SPEAKER_07]: The Maibou Kashi recipe I'll use in our
brain if I can access some of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll take the kombucha mother and I'll
dilute it a little bit, even like some raw
[SPEAKER_07]: apple cider vinegar.
[SPEAKER_07]: The mother for that, too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that'll end up in my bucket.
[SPEAKER_07]: And these buckets can sit weeks,
months, you know, if they're fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you put kombucha and apple mother in
the same container, one would eventually
[SPEAKER_06]: outcompete the other.
[SPEAKER_04]: You would imagine so, yeah, because
they're both super strong.
[SPEAKER_04]: They both are like two things that like to
dominate their environment, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're basically like, good luck.
[SPEAKER_07]: The same with the beer, too, like thick,
thick ale or something like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You wouldn't want to add that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You would want to dilute that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dilute them all.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then mix them together because you
don't want any of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like if you have like this is just all
theory, you know, and I've seen positive
[SPEAKER_07]: benefits in adding them rather than not
having them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there are things to experiment with and
for people like you guys to put them under
[SPEAKER_07]: the microscope and see what's going on.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just from like a home gardener and
enthusiast point of view, definitely will
[SPEAKER_07]: give people some merit to it because I've
seen some success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is interesting even when you're
looking at these different KNF preps and
[SPEAKER_00]: compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of these microorganisms,
although the way that we make the preps or
[SPEAKER_00]: the compost can be very different,
the organisms that come out on the other
[SPEAKER_00]: side can be quite similar, especially when
you're looking at, you know, the DNA of
[SPEAKER_00]: the compost, you can actually suss out
everything that's in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that we do have a lot of the
lactic acid bacteria in the compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under the microscope, you see it when
you're actually driving the compost sample
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I put our compost in a test tube and
then let it sit for a couple of days,
[SPEAKER_00]: or I put it in a jar and add some food
resource and let it sit overnight,
[SPEAKER_00]: the next day I'll see those big rectangle
shaped bacillus rods, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: soaring through the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see them in great diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They look like they fly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have, when they move, they move
like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they look like, if you've ever seen a
little kid draw a bird, you know.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love like stock ciliates.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah, those are the coolest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a windmill.
[SPEAKER_06]: So do you see then like different,
if you took different soil samples from
[SPEAKER_06]: all the people who brought stuff and then
you let them all go anaerobic,
[SPEAKER_06]: you'd see like different starting
facultative microbes based on like what
[SPEAKER_06]: exists in that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Specific soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I spend a lot of time driving soils
anaerobic to understand, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: both sides of the reality.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the thing that always blows my mind is
the more aerobes I see, the more diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: of aerobes, the more diversity of
anaerobes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as like it is our goal to grow aerobic
microorganisms on our compost,
[SPEAKER_00]: at the same time, somehow seemingly like
magic, on the other side of things,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's anaerobes there present too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as soon as it gets, you know,
overloaded with food resource,
[SPEAKER_00]: or lack of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's trippy is that those are like
actual parallel universes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, you know, we talk about parallel
universes and it's like those microbes in
[SPEAKER_06]: certain situations, these ones are all
alive.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it switches and like they may go dead
for a thousand years, but like these ones
[SPEAKER_06]: have like a million years and then they're
like in micro time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, however long.
[SPEAKER_03]: And where you have to be, I just spoke to
us, actually, you don't really hear
[SPEAKER_03]: anybody talk about this, this is something
from personal experience, but where you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to be careful, like she said,
there's facultative microbes everywhere
[SPEAKER_03]: and they serve a purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like they're back, even
anaerobes, they serve a purpose.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the problem with facultatives is that
facultatives have enzymes that both work
[SPEAKER_03]: in the oxygen-rich environment or
oxygen-reduced environments and
[SPEAKER_03]: oxygen-rich environments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so they go both ways, we know that,
just for people who didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, why that's a problem in the regulated
cannabis industry and where a lot of the K
[SPEAKER_03]: &F guys are gonna struggle, it's because
we all know K&F is heavily, not all,
[SPEAKER_03]: but there is a lot of facultative microbes
used in the preps and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so you get a facultative microbe,
it can survive on a leaf surface really
[SPEAKER_03]: well because it does have the enzymes for
the oxygen environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can also survive, but what I'm getting
at is you cut that plant off, you take
[SPEAKER_03]: that for testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, they're gonna take that plant,
they're gonna put it in a Petri dish.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what a Petri dish is?
[SPEAKER_03]: That is an anaerobic environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: With a lot of sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're not counting, they're not
looking for anaerobes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when that facultative microbe grows
inside that Petri dish, you're gonna get a
[SPEAKER_03]: fail.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now even if you try to then fight that
failure, like, hey, I wanna retest,
[SPEAKER_03]: has a false positive, doing some whatever,
QPCR, I wanna see the DNA, that still
[SPEAKER_03]: costs you extra money per pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in Nevada, we have five pounds per
lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I have to spend an extra 500 pounds
to get a lot tested, that's $100 I just
[SPEAKER_03]: took a hit on per pack.
[SPEAKER_06]: So even if they- This is something you
were talking about years ago, so this is
[SPEAKER_06]: still an issue in the state of Nevada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Worst of what people don't understand is
we're growing cash crops now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so like if you're using KNF to grow
almonds and whatever, walnuts and all that
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff, cool, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're having good success,
and this isn't a does it work versus
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't it work.
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't USDA validated processes,
because if you're using KNF, and there
[SPEAKER_03]: might be, so if someone out there can
correct me and help me find this,
[SPEAKER_03]: please go ahead and send me the
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: If there's USDA validated KNF processes,
please let me know, because if there's
[SPEAKER_03]: not, people can't do them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you can grow whatever little
regular crop you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a produce farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't get regulated at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the Department of Agriculture out
one time, and they didn't ask a whole lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't care.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're growing a cash crop,
they suddenly care.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you're showing them, hey,
I'm making whatever, even if you're making
[SPEAKER_03]: a compost, you can make a compost,
whatever type of technique you wanna do.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't show that your compost was
made using a validated USDA method,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you don't track every parameter of that
pile, you're using death to grow stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now it's a consumer.
[SPEAKER_06]: That certainly makes making your compost a
lot less fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Tell us about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the way Elaine teaches it,
you're like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, we have to like, for our compost
lot, we have like books of records of
[SPEAKER_04]: every single day, what the temperature
was, what the moisture was, what the
[SPEAKER_04]: outside, you know, and then how much
compost leaves our lot, how much compost,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's insane, the regulations we have
to go through just for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can imagine, that's why we called
you guys and we started going through it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're local to Grass Valley.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just like right up, we're the only
permitted composting facility in Nevada
[SPEAKER_04]: County.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nevada County doesn't even have one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are highly, and we are like mom and pop
size too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like we're not one of these mega
industrial spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even receive waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we buy all of our ingredients when
we're heavily regulated.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I was getting at with that whole
thing is, it's not a hey, soil food,
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever is better than K&F.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's have this big gang fight about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's quit arguing about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's quit arguing about it and let's be
more proactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: The K&F guys got things that work and we
need to work to make sure that those
[SPEAKER_03]: things get validated if they want to use
them.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some hybridization that can go on
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not saying spray biology on your
flowers by any means.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_07]: But perhaps, what is your opinion just
through a vegetative?
[SPEAKER_07]: So just quickly, you guys can all smoke
right now, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, my problem isn't even with K&F,
does it work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't it work?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen beautiful plants around K&F.
[SPEAKER_03]: My thing is more or less, can it work in a
regulated market?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it more risk than reward?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to get in trouble if you use
the non-validated process?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because every single thing I do,
I have to have the SOP for.
[SPEAKER_03]: My cover crop plants, I have SOPs for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cleaning my floor, cleaning my brewer,
cleaning every single thing that we do,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have to have an SOP for.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't think people realize that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They see this beautiful thing and the
thing just happens to be like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But every single thing has a piece of
paper behind it and it's tracked.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what they want to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you can't show them every single little
everything, they want quantitative,
[SPEAKER_03]: not qualitative data.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, some of the rules are just rules to
be ruled.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't even understand the facultative
anaerobic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just happened to be on a list of a DNA
sample or something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: They don't even understand if it actually
is going to do anything wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just think it could be.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're like, OK, that's excluded
and now you fail.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's what I'm curious about.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is that not happening with the compost
extracts and teas?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if I were to say, take the compost
tea that we make and to put it in an
[SPEAKER_00]: anaerobic environment and feed it,
those anaerobes would wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like our tea isn't exclusively just
aerobes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you deal with that with your
current processes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you failed or had issues with that at
all?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I've never had any issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: I try to make sure I brew everything,
keep it as aerobic as possible,
[SPEAKER_03]: acknowledging what you just said.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I got to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_03]: I drench the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I spray and veg a couple of teas.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't spray a flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Never once.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'll fail for good, guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, back in the day when we first
started, they removed this test.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a TAC, total aerobic test.
[SPEAKER_03]: They didn't count or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They literally counted any microbe.
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted sterile.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first couple years of me growing
and living in soil, I got prepared for
[SPEAKER_03]: that test.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you think the first week or week and a
half you could get away with?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, the first two weeks, the first 10.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, pretty much before the pests will
show up.
[SPEAKER_07]: But for my homegrown, that's how I go.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm thinking for production,
too, with the facility I work at.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually it's 10 to 14 days is a cutoff
mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: Certain strains are going to start to
pistol out at 10 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most are going to go at the first two
weeks is a stretch period.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're still in a vegetative stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're transitioning to a flowering
stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're stretching.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would say any time between 10 to 14
days is where your cutoff is going to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then how you keep them from failing
the test is you set the stage.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I have high humidity, if my
temperatures are off, now I'm setting the
[SPEAKER_03]: stage for whatever God knows.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I keep that sweet spot,
I'm setting the stage for the sweet stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm good.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a concern because I hear people
still arguing, does it work?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not even the question anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just that if you want it to work,
we've got to be proactive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys got to make sure you're talking
to the regulators and just making this an
[SPEAKER_03]: official thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, but how about this, in a world where
the regulators had sensible regulations as
[SPEAKER_06]: they relate to the microbes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which world is that?
[SPEAKER_06]: You would use probably some Canada
practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't exclude them completely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similar to using an extract versus a tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: A tea is a little bit more dangerous,
a little more volatile.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's harder to repeat over and over again
versus an extract.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like there's certain things in the
US here where they are looking out for.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you do more extracts now?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I do more extracts and teas.
[SPEAKER_06]: But way back, did you do more teas?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that was tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, I had over growing everywhere,
smelling like death.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Started from the bottom, now we're here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't remember where I was going.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't even smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's why I don't smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's in the tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are bad examples.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it was, are you using more extracts
and teas?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, then K-neft inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not hating on the inputs, but my thing
is, like I say, thermophilic composting is
[SPEAKER_03]: a safer way to mitigate the risk of
pathogens versus other non-USA validated
[SPEAKER_03]: processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: K-neft type stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I would tend to use, I'm thermophilic
junkie.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's a reason that's selected
by the scientific community as the way to
[SPEAKER_03]: compost.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's the safest way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm going to probably always stay heavy
on that side regardless of what other
[SPEAKER_03]: preps or JDAM this, whatever that I might
use.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just saying, my foundation is going
to be thermophilic compost always.
[SPEAKER_03]: There might be some of the little cool
things I could do.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I was on Mars and I needed to bring
dirt and Mars to life, yeah, the Matt
[SPEAKER_03]: Damon movie where they're just pooping and
stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think about food.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cook most of my food, but I do pickle
some of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: But the majority of what I eat is cooked.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of it's fermented, but not the
steaks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, not everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't ferment my steaks and my chicken.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I think K-neft's cool,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know people who are really successful
with it outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I haven't seen too many people successful
with it indoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know people who do hybrid versions of
it, soil food, web approach with some
[SPEAKER_03]: camera preps or IEM or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, we're all still learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ask me in 10 years, I'll probably have
different opinions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, you'd be pickling everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're open to changing your opinion
whenever it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I'm presented with new information,
absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's a bad idea to be stuck in one
area, especially in an industry so new.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are just like... Usually you're
just in a little box smoking by yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: This guy thinks I have germs.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did that, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want more of it?
[SPEAKER_04]: You want it down?
[SPEAKER_06]: I need to see that stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which can?
[SPEAKER_06]: Downome,
[SPEAKER_04]: yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, he's got like four alpacas on farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking to him about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't actually get to smoke his herb
though.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, you didn't smoke it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was in the air.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we were smoking.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: we've actually held some workshops and
stuff at Daniel's farm because he's local
[SPEAKER_04]: to here, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: Fun things you've seen under microscopes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many fun things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think my favorite thing that I've seen
under a microscope is... I'm showing you
[SPEAKER_00]: the nematodes, which are round worms in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started to observe... It looked like the
nematodes were tied together by their
[SPEAKER_00]: tails, so a medusa head.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be a ball of living nematodes
writhing through the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Each one of them, like a snake,
is just pulling the ball around,
[SPEAKER_00]: thrashing through the sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all tied together by the tails.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single nematode is a different
species.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them were predatory, some of them
were bacterial, some of them were fungal
[SPEAKER_00]: feeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I asked Elaine Ingham what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, I've observed this a lot of
times.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've asked plenty of nematologists what it
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody really knows what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an unknown happening in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what makes this occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've shared over and over and over again
these images online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody told me about a rat king.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really know how it happens,
or if it's real, but these rats end up
[SPEAKER_00]: with their tails knotted, tied together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 20 rats, all their tails are knotted
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's super weird.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's called a rat king.
[SPEAKER_00]: It reinvigorated me to start researching
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: With some clever Google search,
I realized that it is actually a bacterium
[SPEAKER_00]: that lives in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lives in the soil all the time,
and it's activated and woken up whenever
[SPEAKER_00]: it's flooding.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is it makes the very tip of
the nematode's tail sticky.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're swimming through solution,
they touch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they try to get away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes the ball move.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have these writhing nematodes that are
alive and stuck together, getting bigger
[SPEAKER_06]: and bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That bacteria will like to eat nematodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eventually, it dissolves them and eats
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll be a ball like that, and there'll be
like 50 nematodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all facing out trying to get away
from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just can't.
[SPEAKER_06]: It basically starts multiplying and eating
all of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know that Steve's going to talk later
about the bottom spot, so I don't want to
[SPEAKER_07]: spoil it.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you had just finished your
presentation, that was a fantastic
[SPEAKER_06]: presentation.
[SPEAKER_06]: No one watching this, because this will be
posted after 5 PM tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I was just saying, the bottomless pots.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I would just smoke them out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Actually, now you can smoke with us,
because we're after your presentation.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I am.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's triggered.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just kind of my idea.
[SPEAKER_07]: I stumbled upon it.
[SPEAKER_07]: At work, because they're watching.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're seeing what you're up to.
[SPEAKER_07]: High Striker Farms has also been doing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: My boss, Joel, shout out to Joel at
Aquanaut.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's been using the grass roots beds in
the bottomless pot on their living soil.
[SPEAKER_07]: As we close the man's soil, the biochar
added to it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was excited to hear you speak and hear
what you were going to talk about in
[SPEAKER_07]: regards to your success in not disturbing
the soil mass.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it started off with just trying to
save labor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was kind of an accident.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had an overgrown plant, a seed plant,
and then in a black pot, just a regular,
[SPEAKER_03]: standard, veg pot with some holes in the
bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I meant to plant it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I set it on a bed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got busy, forgot about it, came back a
week later, and that yellow plant was
[SPEAKER_03]: green as can be.
[SPEAKER_03]: I went to grab it to transplant it,
and it was stuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, that's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I immediately pictured a rock-wool cube
with a little rock-wool cube, a big
[SPEAKER_03]: rock-wool cube with a little rock-wool
cube.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, all right, this could work
because the gear is rolling.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I started doing it one bed at a time in
a room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't say nothing for a year because
people look at me and when I do something,
[SPEAKER_03]: people tend to follow sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was really hesitant to introduce this
new technique and have everybody in the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry bomb doing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did it for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started off with just the black pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: I literally just cut the bottoms off.
[SPEAKER_03]: You set it on a saucer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You fill it up with soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: You plant your plant in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once you give your plant two to three
weeks to fill that soil space,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's usually going to get a nice little
crown on the bottom of the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you can just easily pick up that pot
without any soil dropping out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you just set it on top of the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, a little more labor.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is more for scale.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because digging a hole, one, you're
disturbing the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of not really our deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're trying to avoid that as much as
possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not disturbing the soil,
but you're not digging holes and making a
[SPEAKER_03]: mess either.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can pull that dirt out and do
whatever they're going to do with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then transplant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you got to refill all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then you got to clean the mess up you just
made.
[SPEAKER_03]: It usually takes us about two days to
plant a room.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it takes us two growers half a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because you're just moving the pots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: They just set them and they're done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was originally thought out that
we're just going to save time and labor.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we ended up seeing over time was
that they're growing faster now because
[SPEAKER_03]: we're not shopping.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not transplanting them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just setting them down and they're
just continuing to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had way faster growth rates.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing you'll notice when you switch
over to bottomless pots is your plants are
[SPEAKER_03]: going to be six inches bigger day one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they're in a pot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for the vertical guys, it might not
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only time I tell people to be
hesitant.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they are running a vertical system and
they are a little tight on space,
[SPEAKER_03]: it probably isn't the best setup for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you got the headroom space and
you're on a commercial scale, I can't find
[SPEAKER_03]: a single reason why you shouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You might need to buy some more soil
because you're not replacing that soil no
[SPEAKER_03]: more.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to actually buy some more soil to
get this style started.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a game changer.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to go less labor,
more yields, game over.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've been seeing great results.
[SPEAKER_07]: And to touch on, you said you put a plant
that wasn't doing so good on.
[SPEAKER_07]: We had one row at the very end.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a few cells were not the best plants
that ended up in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And two weeks later, they're on par with
the rest of the room.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm super stoked to see people use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I've seen people make their own
little tweaks to the system, to their own
[SPEAKER_03]: little styles.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, oh, that's kind of
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm curious how that turns out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes it's like, tried that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's better to learn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they're small now.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as they're learning their startup,
they're going to be getting their cuts
[SPEAKER_07]: better and better and better.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what you showed me before.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you guys doing out there?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, with the heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard you guys got some pretty strict
ones out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's medical and rec.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's a little backwards.
[SPEAKER_07]: To be honest, I think that recreational
has a lot more stricter testing than the
[SPEAKER_07]: medical market requires.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's how it's been.
[SPEAKER_07]: So then that's not necessarily a problem
for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we do the testing, regardless,
for the medical garden.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we make sure that we're doing good
with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're working with Coast of Maine Soil
Company.
[SPEAKER_07]: Who has all of their numbers beforehand.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they work with us for what's going to
happen after each run.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can send our soil for testing and for
reinventing for the rest of that team.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what was your favorite part of this
presentation?
[SPEAKER_04]: Really think about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Honestly, the bottom was hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's probably the last thing in memory
for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: The most influential thing he said.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, from what I can remember,
the bottom was hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So far.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I ask you guys a question?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just being on to the microbes.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is your guidance stands on my
aspergillus testing on flower?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because to me, I think it's the most
stupidest thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no rhyme or reason behind it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I put 10 lots, I had 99% pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have no problem failing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to throw that out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if I take 10 flower samples from 10
different lots, I'll go to the same room,
[SPEAKER_03]: save my miss X.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll get 50 pounds tested, 10 lots.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will have one pop for aspergillus,
and none of them will.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's no rhyme or reason for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it goes both ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to take it back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll have three pop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just for example, I'll have three pop for
aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_03]: They test for four aspergillus strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seven of them will come back squeaky
clean.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then three of them will fail for three
different aspergilluses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, think about the way spore works.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're probably breathing it in right now.
100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these guys are testing for a
potentiality.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if they happen to capture a spore on
that one leaf that you have, and they put
[SPEAKER_04]: it in that petri dish, and now it grows
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: They're literally farming aspergillus at
that point, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't really make sense in that
terms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because spores are abound.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you find similar mushrooms on
every single continent.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's because those things can get into the
atmosphere and travel around.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't think there's, unless you're
operating in a sterile environment,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's always going to be that
one off where you're going to fail for it,
[SPEAKER_04]: even though you're never seeing signs of
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're never having an issue with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you think it's a public safety concern?
[SPEAKER_03]: Aspergilliosis?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, obviously, if it's like your crop
is going and you walk into a room and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything is covered in it, yeah,
it's probably not very good for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's something the industry
needs to focus on right now, too,
[SPEAKER_03]: is we need to just get rid of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We all need to kind of just together
disagree that it's stupid to get rid of
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the issue... Push on regulators?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, you probably have companies
like medicinal genomics that are putting
[SPEAKER_03]: out these essays for aspergillus,
and they're trying to sell them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're trying to make money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're the ones, not just them,
but there's other groups like that that
[SPEAKER_03]: are really the pushers above this.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're scaring people.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, get boosted, get this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they're the ones pushing hard on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just feel like we need people,
educated people that know the system,
[SPEAKER_03]: that understand microbes, to start pushing
back and letting people know that,
[SPEAKER_03]: hey, you know, I'm going to get sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like example, I could fail for aspergillus
in Nevada, and they will allow me,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I don't, but they will allow
cultivators to radiate their cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's a live or dead test.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's toxins left behind.
[SPEAKER_08]: But here's the point.
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the worst?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they're saying is it's okay to
smoke dead aspergillus if it was killed by
[SPEAKER_03]: radiation, but I can't light it on fire
and kill it as I smoke it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's really no rhyme or reason
behind the thought process.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just think, you know, like we're
trying to fix things like, hey,
[SPEAKER_03]: how do I pass aspergillus testing?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I pass aspergillus testing?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do I pass head metal testing?
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem isn't how do you pass.
[SPEAKER_03]: The problem is how do we fix this stupid
testing and these stupid regulators and
[SPEAKER_03]: have them better understand what's going
on so we can actually all have,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, sustainable business models?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if I'm writing a business plan,
I got to account for, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: an unaccountable thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Draw that into my finances.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not really an ideal situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's unfortunate because most of these
rags come from people like, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: like who just like dip their powdery
mildew weed in water and then try to sell
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, so you don't see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's like a lot of this stuff is in
place because of that, but then they
[SPEAKER_04]: don't, they don't ever go back to like
reassess these things and be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: okay, did we step over too far?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is this actually something that this
test is actually valid even?
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like once it's in place, going back to it
is not something they're going to do
[SPEAKER_04]: without like a heavy pushback.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I would say too though, like if
you're smoking a joint, you're going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: pulling a bunch of that spore in like
through the entirety of the joint.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because the stuff at the tip is getting
burnt, but all the extra stuff that's
[SPEAKER_04]: getting pulled through there, probably
not.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, depends on the molds you're
talking about and the quantities,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why that all comes down to,
because quite literally right now you have
[SPEAKER_04]: probably inhaled some type of aspergillus
in the last hour where you've been out
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the likelihood is that you've inhaled
one of these things, but it's just not in
[SPEAKER_04]: an amount or in a form that's actually
going to affect you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's quantity, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now you're being overrun with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tapping it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely don't recommend smoking moldy
weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: But let's also look at the history of
cannabis though.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've all smoked moldy weed.
[SPEAKER_09]: The consumer can't spot moldy weed unless
it's really, really moldy, until probably
[SPEAKER_09]: they've grown moldy weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen stuff on shelves and they're
like, that should not be on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen people look at powdery mildew
weed and be like, wow, how much crystal is
[SPEAKER_04]: on here?
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, that's powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not so great white.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not so great white.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all state.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all aligning.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're all aligning.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like they're all going over
tomorrow night and having the same exact
[SPEAKER_03]: relation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's like a group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know what it's called?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: All these state officials, there is this
little group where they all get together
[SPEAKER_03]: and they sort of talk about these
regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: The Nevada guys.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's his position in Nevada?
[SPEAKER_10]: He's the director.
OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the California equivalent would be the
Department of Cannabis Control,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So he's your equivalent of whoever runs
the Department of Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're saying all those people are
talking to each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, the big thing is they write these
huge bills.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in order to save time, they'll just
grab the other states.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they go through it and they kind
of form fit a little bit, change a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit of verbiage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they don't have to pay somebody a
million dollars to rewrite a 150 page
document.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we need to start talking to those
people standing in their ear.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just need to start making changes at a
political level now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because again, none of us like to go and
talk to these type of people where we want
[SPEAKER_03]: to be your hands in the soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to put ourselves in this
uncomfortable position.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I love when a Lori Ajax would
come to kind of want to like the hippie
[SPEAKER_06]: camp events.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she'd be sitting there with farmers
and hearing directly what their issues
[SPEAKER_06]: are.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we need.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stuff like that, where that person is
like, those people are like, looking
[SPEAKER_06]: around here, these are pretty good people.
[SPEAKER_06]: I could help them by doing this one simple
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this industry, though, we don't like to
put ourselves in positions where we're not
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: We make this comfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't like to be uncomfortable,
to be honest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes we've got to put ourselves
into those uncomfortable positions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to put ourselves in those rooms
full of politicians who don't know this
[SPEAKER_03]: industry, those regulators who don't know
this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't just sit back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just don't get high first.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can't just sit back and expect them to
do what we do, to know what we do,
[SPEAKER_03]: without us working with them.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to be in the room.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got to put ourselves in an
uncomfortable spot if we want to make
[SPEAKER_03]: positive change in the story.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm down with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I tried.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like on a Friday morning, we had a... So
they're going to go with whoever's... And
[SPEAKER_03]: it's what are they going off of?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going off of the existing business
model or existing model.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the big one that they go off of isn't
alcohol and tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually the food industry,
like with regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: When they're walking through your
facility, you have someone who's worked in
[SPEAKER_03]: the restaurant facility or industry for 20
years.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's just walking through your facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they're six inches off the ground.
[SPEAKER_03]: You got hot water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your appliance is working.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's the minimum you have to be ready
for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because that's really the primary
inspectors.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where they come from primarily,
I would say.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you go and turn up your fucking hot
water heater?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's
insane, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's just a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, people aren't talking so we think
that it's his problem or it's my problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want people to know my problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all of our problems.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you don't start talking and getting on
the same page... No, that's why I love
[SPEAKER_06]: breaking silos.
[SPEAKER_06]: You live in a Nevada bubble of shit you
have to deal with, whereas someone else
[SPEAKER_06]: lives in Maine or wherever.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you guys talking to each other
and then...
[SPEAKER_06]: I tried to get Nicole Elliott,
who is Governor Newsom's cannabis czar.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know what the actual word is.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's probably not what it's called,
cannabis czar.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's come on the YouTube.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not even like, let's pre-record it and
then if I say anything I don't want to
[SPEAKER_06]: say, you can edit that part out.
[SPEAKER_06]: She was like, I'll come on a live show.
[SPEAKER_06]: She's come on live shows and I wanted to
connect her with the Mendocino people who
[SPEAKER_06]: are dealing with the issues there.
[SPEAKER_06]: For her to hear from their mouths,
this is what we're dealing with.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to know this and start working
with us to make it sensible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think because we're all in Cali... Well,
we're in California.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Nevada, Maine, whatever.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's unique in Maine.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a real grassroots medical
community.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all caregivers, small mom and pop
caregivers.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have allowed, I think, eight
dispensaries and three or four of them are
[SPEAKER_07]: like big money.
[SPEAKER_07]: Green Tank.
[SPEAKER_07]: Green Tank's awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: His store is a recreational store,
but I think he's getting a cultivation in
[SPEAKER_07]: medical.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're talking about eight medical stores
are open in Maine, like medical only.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, so like you could buy maybe 10 years
ago, I can't remember.
[SPEAKER_07]: They allow anybody who's a Maine medical
caregiver to like develop a business and
[SPEAKER_07]: get a store at Brown Point via dispensary
without having to pay a dispensary
[SPEAKER_07]: license.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the caregiver community is a good perk
of grandfathering.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the caregiver community is allowed to
do business with all of each other too and
[SPEAKER_07]: collaborate on projects and gardens and
put each other's products in each other's
[SPEAKER_07]: stores without much unfolds, which is
great.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think there's like 3,000 registered
caregivers in Maine and only eight of the
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary storefronts are like the
dispensary licenses that were
[SPEAKER_07]: grandfathered in a while ago.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then the hundreds of other stores are
like mom and pop shops.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_07]: The way it should be.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, the recreational market is a little
bit more difficult and pricier to get into
[SPEAKER_07]: because of the testing restrictions and
the rules to jump through.
[SPEAKER_07]: More recently, they've allowed it now
anybody can really get a Maine caregiver
[SPEAKER_07]: license wherever you live.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you could live in Hawaii and be a
Maine caregiver.
[SPEAKER_07]: Also recently, I believe there was a
canopy restriction, like collectively like
[SPEAKER_07]: not limited canopy depending on different
caregivers that are under one LLC.
[SPEAKER_07]: They can instead of have like limited
canopy from like 500 to 1,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be like a team of like minded
individuals that have like a farm or
[SPEAKER_07]: something like that, you know,
which is really cool.
[SPEAKER_07]: Definitely letting opportunity there for
collective collaboration in that regard.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's a Maine Crab Caregivers
Association that they all, they meet with
[SPEAKER_07]: patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a couple of patients, a couple of
doctors, a couple of caregivers.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have constituents just like
representatives, but I guess throughout
[SPEAKER_07]: the Maine community and issues are brought
to them and they're talked about.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then like they try to have a
legislative session that works with this
[SPEAKER_07]: team, I guess.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Hawaii, Jason, I don't care why my
audience came up to meet him last
[SPEAKER_07]: September, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: He kind of developed a few relationships
with some of the people in this
[SPEAKER_07]: association and they're trying to model
what they're doing out there in Hawaii off
[SPEAKER_07]: of Maine's like medical system.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're having trouble right now due to
the things that we're talking about with
[SPEAKER_07]: like heavy metals and microbiology and
like the legislative process not really
[SPEAKER_07]: knowing what to do and just like
constituents with maybe money coming in
[SPEAKER_07]: and having their consultants kind of
driving them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nevada is very different, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: They protect their dispensaries like no
other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every single law that gets written,
you can tell that they're dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know how to put it in.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're getting things written in their
favor.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have lobbyists that they're doing
their job.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're good at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd be honest, I think Nevada has the best
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not saying it's perfect, but I think
looking at all the other models,
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely think Nevada has the best
one.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not the biggest fan of the CCB style
of regulation right now, but I still think
[SPEAKER_03]: the industry is holding it down pretty
damn well.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, it could always be better.
[SPEAKER_03]: The regulations could be better.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're, I mean, the only Nevada
dispensary I know is Planet 13.
[SPEAKER_06]: As far as retail goes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry to be plugging them right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you can think of a different
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm going to be honest, I love
Planet 13, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody moves more weight than Planet 13.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of your stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: Of just anybody's stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: They move a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: They did Vegas big.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vegas has a style.
[SPEAKER_03]: You do Vegas.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's very Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they've been very good to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're definitely one of our favorite
dispensary partners.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do really good deals during the week
for locals and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they move a lot of weight.
[SPEAKER_03]: Back to do we have retail stores?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they do not give out retail stores
very easily in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are the retail stores that exist,
are they allowed to cultivate?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, they're fully vertical, most of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have retail production and then
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: They won't give out any more production or
dispensary licenses or any license for
[SPEAKER_03]: that matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: So does that imply that their ultimate
goals would be to grow enough in-house
[SPEAKER_06]: that they wouldn't need to buy from
outside vendors like you guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's what a lot of them are
hoping to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think that's not how this community
or this industry really works.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I mean, I know like when we were
first opened up, again, we're just a
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivator and we just got a lounge
license to be clear.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have kind of a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, they just gave out lounge licenses.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's like the best kind of license.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just gets better.
[SPEAKER_03]: It depends what the regulations look like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you sell in the lounge?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no we can sell.
[SPEAKER_03]: But single serving.
[SPEAKER_03]: A single serving direct to the customer in
your building.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you make lockers for people there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Potentially.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you have to cut people down?
[SPEAKER_06]: A bong, bong lockers.
[SPEAKER_03]: All those are great questions and all
those are the reason I don't want to be
[SPEAKER_03]: first.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we were the first cultivator and
we paid a tax.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was good because we got the exposure of
being first.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we also had to pay to train the state
to do their job and have all these,
[SPEAKER_03]: jump through all these loopholes that
after we jumped through them, the state
[SPEAKER_03]: realized that's a really dumb loophole or
a really dumb loophole.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll start another one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we jumped through it and spent a lot
of money jumping through it because we
[SPEAKER_03]: were first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as the lounge is go,
I want to be last.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want everybody to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see good models, bad models.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to see the regulations changed.
[SPEAKER_06]: But that doesn't mean you need to open
doors next week.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're going to give us timelines.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to have to play it smart
and drag our feet as we can and get
[SPEAKER_03]: extension after extension after extension
until they say I can't have any more
[SPEAKER_03]: extensions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're looking, we currently have a bunch
of ideas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the cannabis farm, we have the
produce farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a small town so it by itself will
generate a lot of profit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I want to create a destination spot
because we're between Vegas and Death
[SPEAKER_03]: Valley and we get a lot of traffic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm trying to do a farmer table
restaurant lounge so we can eat
[SPEAKER_03]: organically grown food on site and then
smoke flour grown from the same process.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm trying to get the property right
next to my produce farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it would be a new property.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yes, got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I'll be honest, my grove is in the
middle of the town.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a destination.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one from Vegas is going to stop at my
warehouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: The other spot would be like a restaurant
right off the side of the highway.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I live on one of the, there's three
main roads in Pahrump.
[SPEAKER_03]: The highway 160, there's 372 and arguably
the third biggest road feeds the south
[SPEAKER_03]: side is Homestead.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the road I live on.
[SPEAKER_03]: It happens to be the Cool Kid Street.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where the winery is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where the dispensary is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where one of the main casinos are
and that's where the two whore houses are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it just makes sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is all in Pahrump?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a good demographic area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So is the guy law supporting businesses?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I think that's where... Pahrump's
going vertical.
[SPEAKER_06]: There was hemp farming out there too,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Hemp was huge in Pahrump for a minute and
then fell on his face.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this guy was starting one of those hemp
farms.
[SPEAKER_06]: I forget who, I could dig up his name.
[SPEAKER_06]: But evidently he's not doing hemp there
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happened?
[SPEAKER_06]: Was it just that it was competitively
cheaper to grow elsewhere?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no fentanyl in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't even need to test it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only thing I've heard from
people in the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But my opinion is a combination of that
and then did everybody see what 90% of the
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp farmers were doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just horrible practices.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've seen people planting 100 acre fields
in early September.
[SPEAKER_03]: They grew little popsicles with bloods of
100 acres of hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had generators out there with lights,
like parking lot lights, trying to keep
[SPEAKER_03]: them...
[SPEAKER_03]: Trying to give them extra hours?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm watching this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then they had people out there hand
harvesting and hand trimming those
[SPEAKER_03]: popsicles.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've watched all of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a block away from my house.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_03]: Popcorn every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I remember in Ventura County, someone came
to me being like, and this was probably in
[SPEAKER_06]: like September.
[SPEAKER_06]: They planted a ton of acres of hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they were like, do you know any big
warehouse spaces we could dry all this
[SPEAKER_06]: stuff?
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, you guys in September are
just asking... You're just thinking about
[SPEAKER_06]: what you're going to do next?
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have a spot to harvest and dry
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you got the stories like you're
saying, the wet baling, you got sugar cell
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers that grow hay, just wet baling
hemp and it molds out and now they don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have a single cast.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it was funny as there are farmers,
but of other crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, even like hay farmers, they have
chemicals they can spray to bail wet,
[SPEAKER_04]: which would never pass a hemp rig.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they probably just did their same thing
that they do with hay.
[SPEAKER_04]: But usually when they're pailing hay,
they can spray chemicals on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an issue we run against when we
compost.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't buy that kind of hay.
[SPEAKER_03]: See, I didn't even know that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I should be looking out for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I find most... I don't usually really
mulch on my indoor, but on my outdoor,
[SPEAKER_03]: we'll buy like a Sudan grass or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they can spray preservatives on that
shit to keep it from molding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you putting seeds down or what are you
putting down?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: For mulch, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, you're putting hay down, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we can talk about bail taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think a couple of months ago we scored
some Sudan grass, some big bales of Sudan
[SPEAKER_03]: grass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It looked really good, so we got it,
but I didn't know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sudan grass at scale in Nevada?
[SPEAKER_03]: I imagine it was grown there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't imagine anybody trucking that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was too heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a big round?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those massive rounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they weren't round.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were actually square.
[SPEAKER_03]: The giant square.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five strings.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't count them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I just grew Sudanese sorghum, and so it's
like things that are drought resistant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, Nevada is known for drought
resistant.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you guys exploring stuff that's kind
of more drought resistant as climates
[SPEAKER_06]: change in California?
[SPEAKER_03]: What microbes have you guys seen that are
more drought resistant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they able to operate?
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're actually looking at DNA
analysis, we work with biomakers from time
[SPEAKER_00]: to time, and we'll get analysis from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll tell us of the known
microorganisms, the species that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: information on, what percentage are
drought tolerant, what percentage are salt
[SPEAKER_00]: tolerant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't really see that underneath the
microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as growing grains for our compost,
we use whatever's growing in the pasture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really economical to come and
till up the perennial pastures and put in
[SPEAKER_00]: new seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're letting whatever grows each year
just grow, and we do see it change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the natural seed bank is popping up
with different plants all the time as
[SPEAKER_00]: we're getting more or less rain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are you at?
[SPEAKER_04]: You're down in LA?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where it's warm and cozy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know about cozy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's warm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's quite windy.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is hemp licensing like out here?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it similar to cannabis power?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know in Nevada it's really easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a regular business license.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just go apply for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know you have to have water rights out
in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the only thing you have to prove.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as you show water rights from
right here, it's not really an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know anything about it in
California.
[SPEAKER_04]: California hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: County by county.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ventura County is doing more down by San
Diego.
[SPEAKER_04]: California's MO.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you need to show water rights or
anything like that?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's water there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm from the desert.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a big deal where I'm from.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Reno.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now I feel more pressure than ever.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's probably the best you've shared on
bottom of the spots in the entire shoot.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was definitely.
[SPEAKER_07]: The in depth knowledge on bottom of the
spots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well thank you Peter.
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate you doing the job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you for having us.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let me grab a.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you.
