[SPEAKER_00]: And really, by focusing on grading,
you can take something that was garbage
[SPEAKER_00]: that farmers used to sit on and turn into
extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can take bees and turn into some
beautiful live resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not only working with the
farmers, but making sure that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: gaining the most of their dollar by
working with them and working with other
[SPEAKER_00]: partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead of them approaching them
individually, it's us grading and making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure the farmers also help plan for what
the future is, what strains to grow,
[SPEAKER_00]: what to focus on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, we focus on being that partner
and helping them navigate this as us being
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Boy, there's a lot of good information up
here right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: My head's just spinning.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, I forgot seed to soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my cannabis licensing name.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then soil king and everything else
goes under that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what is going on currently under seed
to soil?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do the pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do, like I said, an array of different
options and try to help other
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beesle, for instance, for them,
they make their product, take it over to
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're a distro, we can go ahead
and test it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can get the results for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can bring it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we sticker it and package everything
and send it out to their distro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a service from a distro to a
distro from a manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different things like
that, like fields, extracts, and turpogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a beautiful ice water hash room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're washing all them flakes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You walk in my facility, it's like off the
hook.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a candy store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so with that also, we fill vape pins
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't do the BHO blasting because I'm a
type 6.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that product is then sent over for
packaging and then sent out to code
[SPEAKER_01]: distributors or through my own
distribution channels, however it ends up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most important thing with soil
king and everything we've been,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been around for a while, a minute,
in this industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my passion.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first time I was ever in Hank House
was 11 years old growing pot in a pine
[SPEAKER_01]: tree in my backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, like Casey says, grown vegetables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything that grows, to me, is
tremendous value.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with soil king in the market,
I have soil king production TV,
[SPEAKER_01]: for those of you that know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run marketing company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with that, my mission is to grow
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Changing the world one plant at a time is
my mission statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more so is us growing together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're missing that element.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're a farmer, you're a farmer,
you come to me, it's just as important for
[SPEAKER_01]: me to show my brand and me tell your
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I vet my farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's farmers that come out all over the
place and say, hey, I got the,
[SPEAKER_01]: you hear it all the time, the baddest weed
on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You hear that all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, well, what's your story?
[SPEAKER_01]: I could care less about your weed right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, I really want to know who you are,
what you do, why you do it, how long
[SPEAKER_01]: you've been doing it, what's your passion?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you do charity?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you community?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are important things to vet a
farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I take that farmer and I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, we're going to market you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to take you with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to do this as a team.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to take it all through the
channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it sounds easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Distribution model in the retail sector
is, you know, it's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we're promoting outdoor, sun-grown
products, it's difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just say it's challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no doubt about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's rewarding when you tell that story
and you make believers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're up against a brick wall that
we've got to smash down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can't do it alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to do it together as a community.
[SPEAKER_01]: I walked into this event today and started
crying because Casey knows, a few of you
[SPEAKER_01]: out there know we used to do this
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I walked up here and I haven't had
this feeling in two years till I stepped
[SPEAKER_01]: ground out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's unity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the message we need to
transpire, develop, create, storytell all
[SPEAKER_01]: the way down through California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's changing the world one planet
at a time, getting that message.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't do it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't do it without you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a cultivator, I don't want to
suppress you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need your voice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need you to hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need the people to hear your story.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I am not producing your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're producing your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just taking your cannabis down the
channels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the trust and believe of my consumers
are trusting that I'm going to bring a
[SPEAKER_01]: superior product with a story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, and that's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's always health before wealth.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say health before wealth, then comes
wealth.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we haven't seen that lately.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all health, health, health,
poor, poor, poor, spend, spend,
[SPEAKER_01]: spend, bleed, bleed, bleed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, that's what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for me, it's like, thank you for
being here, listening to me gabble.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're super stoked you came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know people always say that their
herb is the best.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in Nevada County, it's actually true.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the questions that I have about
distribution, it's mandated by our state
[SPEAKER_02]: statutes and regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's something that's not mandated in
other legalized states.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has this potential to be really
awesome and be really awesome for farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you guys give us some of your
opinions or your perspective on how
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution and the distribution
component itself is something that can be
[SPEAKER_02]: helpful for farmers or manufacturers,
but any supplier, like anybody that's
[SPEAKER_02]: supplying product to the market,
how could it be utilized in a positive way
[SPEAKER_02]: in California?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I see distribution as kind of the
front door, if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of sales, we've got access to what's
happening out there on the retail side of
[SPEAKER_03]: the market, on the Southern California
side of the market, if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's very different cultures in the
North and the South, as we all know that,
[SPEAKER_03]: especially when it comes to cultivation
and many other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: But distribution, it's a bridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So while we're working, we're helping
educate farmers what's happening out there
[SPEAKER_03]: on the supply chain, on the sales end,
whether it's strain trends and these fresh
[SPEAKER_03]: frozen trends and different ways that they
can fit into the supply chain,
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it's hooking up with a brand or
another distributor or growing for
[SPEAKER_03]: extraction for oils.
[SPEAKER_03]: So creating that bridge right there and
educating all of the constituents and all
[SPEAKER_03]: of the stakeholders in the supply chain as
we go, everyone's figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: No one has it figured out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if they tell you they do, they're
lying.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I work with so many industry
people and licensees, and everyone will
[SPEAKER_03]: have a different opinion about the same
subject, the same regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's interpreted in many ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's very much a cooperative space
right now and educating each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at the same time, I think it's the
distributor's responsibility to educate
[SPEAKER_03]: the consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I heard what you said about the sun-grown
cannabis and how that's not necessarily
[SPEAKER_03]: valued in a way that indoor is,
per se.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then distillate is not valued in the
same way that a full spectrum cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_03]: profile oil is.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as a distributor of that middle piece
in the supply chain, with branding and
[SPEAKER_03]: marketing and the brands that we release
and the farms that we are supporting and
[SPEAKER_03]: marketing out there, educating the
consumers on why there's a value add for
[SPEAKER_03]: sun-grown, why clean green certified,
biodynamic, B Corp, veganic, all of these
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainability certifications are the same
trends as whole foods and organic food and
[SPEAKER_03]: fair trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the conscious consumer base in
California is quite large.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do think that globally, people are
waking up to that trend of sustainability
[SPEAKER_03]: and whole body wellness, if you will.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope that as distributors are in the
space, they really play that role in
[SPEAKER_03]: educating not only the farmers and the
manufacturers, but also the consumers so
[SPEAKER_03]: that they can learn why to value the
pioneer industries, why to value sun-grown
[SPEAKER_03]: and not these ridiculous gigantic
companies that are basically just bleeding
[SPEAKER_03]: the earth of even more resources.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I hope we can support in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for distribution, it's about
finding the market for the supplier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's putting everything into
buckets.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I mean by finding the market,
I feel like we don't educate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't educate the market ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can show them why it's value.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll find the value.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard to find.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find the people that actually look for
sun-grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, how do you identify them?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you capture them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, the retailers, some retailers
focus on them, like soul out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: basketball.
[SPEAKER_00]: But others don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's finding the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a retailer, I think Fulcana's done
a good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: A few other guys creating the value there,
getting the market space in the retail,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then telling that story.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's finding the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the buckets is, when you work
with a farmer, I think it's just making
[SPEAKER_00]: sure everything's used.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything goes to where it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I keep going back to that, but I think
it's extremely important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because really, a lot of farmers have been
strung along.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of farmers haven't been given
the value that they're worth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because distributors haven't been
able to find the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll see a lot of distributors going
at lower pricing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some distributors doing direct-to-consumer
are trying to figure out, how do we fight
[SPEAKER_00]: this whole pricing issue that the black
market is beating us at?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the distributors, it's finding the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're all struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why we're all struggling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's finding the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's the big task that a
distributor can help solve for every
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to remind everybody of the question
I'm asking is, how can distributors help
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers be successful, or manufacturers?
[SPEAKER_02]: But how can distributors help suppliers be
successful?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm going to say it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of integrity left in our
industry at this point, especially on the
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution model.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sitting up against some good people
right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But working with a lot of distributors
here, as a cultivator, I'm a cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also believe that I have one of the best
distribution contracts, because I'm fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: We write things that I know you want to
see as a cultivator and that I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: see, because we're building a community
and a relationship for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I'm going to put marketing dollars into
you, I want to put marketing dollars in
[SPEAKER_01]: you in five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to build you up, and then you
run to the next guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what it's about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about us building together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not saying that you can't share with
other distributors, because I think the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest mistake in our industry is signing
a contract that has exclusivity to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the biggest mistake as a
cultivator you could possibly make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as a small brand supporter,
I want 50 pounds of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want your offsets, 20 pounds of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever you've got in flavors,
I don't want I don't need 100 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't plan on telling you I want you to
grow this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need six months worth of supply of
just one flavor, even though the retail is
[SPEAKER_01]: asking for that and all the other
distributors is pushing a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, I want your unique varietals and
your varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want your unique cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want to be able to package them up
and show that whole thing down to the
[SPEAKER_01]: retail to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it difficult that way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it totally is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Integrity, I said it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I question my integrity at times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's been hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really has.
[SPEAKER_01]: This hasn't been an easy road for a
distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: A distributor takes all the brunt,
all the pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get all the finger pointing at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But let me tell you, I was expecting the
retail to kick up, and I was expecting the
[SPEAKER_01]: supply chain to kick off.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was expecting this ungrown message
to be in more volume with more of us
[SPEAKER_01]: sharing it and our consumers hearing it
more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not a lot of us are driving those
channels of information to the consumer at
[SPEAKER_01]: this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And distribution's been a shit show.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're stabilizing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: The best thing I think I did, and I've
made a lot of mistakes, but the best thing
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I did is I phased everything in.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we went to cultivators, and I'm going
to take this much product in phase one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And everybody sitting at my board says,
you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would you just take that much?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's not a big deal.
It's not a big deal.
