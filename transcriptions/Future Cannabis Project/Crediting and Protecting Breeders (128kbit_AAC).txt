[SPEAKER_01]: the abilities to be able to get yourself
contractual protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think with community protection and
support is really just trying not to screw
[SPEAKER_01]: each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, fundamentally, man, choose not
to burn the guy you're doing business
[SPEAKER_01]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that seemed to work for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, to me, it's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that, you know, in my
perspective from someone who traffics
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, what I want to be able to see
is, and what I've always done is I've
[SPEAKER_01]: always given credit to the people whose
cultivars I use or material I use or
[SPEAKER_01]: information I use, because what happens
then is you promote, just like Jason was
[SPEAKER_01]: promoting Nat and Gene saying,
hey, man, I ran your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was killing.
[SPEAKER_01]: My friends run your stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a courtesy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't have to say it, but he wanted to
say, hey, you know, you guys are some are
[SPEAKER_01]: some guys that I respect and I appreciate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what it does, it adds a level of
legitimacy that you can't add yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had this discussion with someone today
about the Internet saying the Internet
[SPEAKER_01]: guys tell you this is how you promote
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, nobody really gives a shit
about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just banter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crap coming out their mouth
perpetually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you just turn it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you want is you want other people to
validate what you're doing in an honest
[SPEAKER_01]: way, because that resonates in a way that
you know is true, because they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: getting paid for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not a shill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's part of it is
that, you know, you recognize other
[SPEAKER_01]: people's farms and you commend the product
when it's legitimate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't have an ability to move
your product, but you know someone who
[SPEAKER_01]: could move product, you push that product
and you make sure that person gets credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the breeders, you know,
don't pirate their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, what you had a funny one,
because Gene's a meme king, but he was
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about how they were renaming these
varietals so they could just get rid of
[SPEAKER_01]: the breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was this whole meme about how
the breeder was diminished, minimized and
[SPEAKER_01]: wiped out so that we can name anything we
wanted.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's it's such a true statement
because you're so you're so desirous of
[SPEAKER_01]: your own success that you forgot how you
got there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think when it comes to what the
breeders that if you can keep their alive
[SPEAKER_01]: in the conversation all the time in a
courteous sense where this is the material
[SPEAKER_01]: I got from Jason.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I used.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to buy more, you can go to
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you got questions, you can go to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You become in this incredible referral
network.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the thing that protects
you from shit in life most is money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your own money makes you pretty safe
because you can afford infrastructure,
[SPEAKER_01]: tools, connections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really what we've been deprived
of right now is liquidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have to kind of pull up our
skills until we can rebuild our liquidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: But hopefully this bout of poverty teaches
us how to behave a little more
[SPEAKER_01]: intelligently in a communal form so that
when we do we rise up again as a craft
[SPEAKER_01]: culture, you're able to actually take the
education that we just got about how you
[SPEAKER_01]: better stick together.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to die and then use it to
create the models of protection so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you end up having individuals that can do
the work so that all you have to do is do
[SPEAKER_01]: your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of people would rather just grow
and farm than have to spend all their free
[SPEAKER_01]: time breeding too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean that's my opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to be honest with whose work
you're pirating and make sure you kick
[SPEAKER_01]: back credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd agree with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kevin, I'm sure you guys have had it
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've had it happen where groups get ahold
of your work and they rename it as their
[SPEAKER_02]: own and they don't give credit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I feel like the history and the story
is a big part of why things are appealing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I always try to be as forthcoming
and factual with all the information that
[SPEAKER_02]: we put out there about what we're working
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's companies out there that are
just getting rid of the names altogether
[SPEAKER_02]: where all the history of hundreds of years
of people carrying these plants just wiped
[SPEAKER_02]: away and now it's just a whole new way of
categorizing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't know really how I feel about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like people being inventive and being
unique, but I'm also very connected to the
[SPEAKER_02]: history.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's something that might not sit
so well about just totally renaming
[SPEAKER_02]: people's stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe if you come up with a name for a
specific phenome, that could be okay,
[SPEAKER_02]: but still it's the whatever phenome of
this strain from this person.
[SPEAKER_02]: And still be honest about where it came
from and you can still name your phenomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as far as protecting your genetics,
I think the open cannabis project or
[SPEAKER_02]: somehow documenting the genes as open
source, that's the only really other
[SPEAKER_02]: alternative.
[SPEAKER_02]: To trying to patent your stuff and keep
other people from having it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want other people to grow it,
but I don't want people to grow it and
[SPEAKER_02]: then take it from me and say, I can't grow
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's crazy and that's literally
something that could be going on right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a number of cannabis patents
that have already been issued that are
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna be problematic in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm sure there's gonna be challenges
to them, but I think one of them is any
[SPEAKER_02]: one-to-one that doesn't have mercy in it
is technically under patent right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's some very broad cannabis patents
out there right now and I'm sure there's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be more down the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: And documenting your genetics through
groups like the open cannabis project are
[SPEAKER_02]: a way to combat that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anybody that didn't hear that he was
saying chemo type data is as or possibly
[SPEAKER_02]: more important than the genetic testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can be hopefully a discussion all
unto its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to delve deeper into that and
how we can protect the community's work as
[SPEAKER_02]: a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I wanted to touch on is when you
talk about you're saying you're gonna go
[SPEAKER_02]: try and sell your product, people assume
self-interest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they always take whatever you say
with a grain of salt.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they overhear it from their friend
that says, no, no, his stuff's dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that or I like this type.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're gonna take that in maybe a
little more deeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm trying to say is support your
community and the other people.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you see something that you like,
let people know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hopefully others are gonna return the
favor to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's I feel how we build the
community together and help each other
[SPEAKER_02]: survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely I think people take it into
account a little more when they hear it
[SPEAKER_02]: through somebody else or through the
grapevine or I heard that this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how hype builds is people overhear
from somebody else that oh, that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, there is something that's
genuine to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's reasons behind why those things
got built up.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can't all just be pure advertising.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's got to be some human element to
why something becomes successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, just support your neighbor.
[SPEAKER_02]: When they're doing good, let people know
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that from all of us that came
from the era where you didn't rat on
[SPEAKER_01]: people, which seems to be a foreign
thought nowadays, ratting out on people,
[SPEAKER_01]: screwing people over isn't ratting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when he's saying make sure you
support, make sure you also call out
[SPEAKER_01]: things that you see are wrong because if
they're screwing him, they're gonna screw
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And by the time they get to you,
there might not be anybody to protect you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a lot of it is if you're seeing
unscrupulous stuff, you don't have to get
[SPEAKER_01]: out and broadcast it on the general world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can tell your friends,
man, I get asked all the time about would
[SPEAKER_01]: you do business with this person?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I try not to screw anybody in a way
that would cause problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately, if I know that you have a
history of piking people, I always just
[SPEAKER_01]: say the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would be cautious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what that means is that I can't give
you a recommendation and that you should
[SPEAKER_01]: do your homework.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't have to go too deep into it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it just says that I can't vouch for
you, but I'm not gonna throw a rock at
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's throwing a rock at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's important because someone said,
would you work with that distributor?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say, I would be cautious.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they realize that there's some
reason because I'm not in a business
[SPEAKER_01]: against them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So therefore, why am I having trepidation?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's because I saw something or heard
something and I'm just like, look,
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't need to get screwed either.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have to go and shish kabob
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if people are doing good work,
make sure you let people know and if
[SPEAKER_01]: people are doing stuff that are unethical
in a way that's gonna really cause
[SPEAKER_01]: problems, they're not gonna hold back
against you either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people hold back because they're
afraid of ramification.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back in the day, it was they're afraid
they're gonna lose all their teeth.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, now that that's not one of the
tools, and I don't really think it should
[SPEAKER_01]: be a tool, but it was a very effective
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be able to use financial.
[SPEAKER_01]: And financial is to protect each other and
make sure that the people that are doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this work aren't getting beat to death and
that they're still around for you to
[SPEAKER_01]: utilize as a resource.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have to preserve as many of these
resources as possible because without it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you end up having a shrunken population of
partners to do stuff in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, for what I've done my whole
career, I've needed the people around me
[SPEAKER_01]: because I only can do so much myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my success was really built off all
these relationships I made with other
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the course of time, we did better
than we did worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't anybody screw you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes, I believe so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then what you could do is if you did a
licensing agreement with the breeder,
[SPEAKER_01]: you could also bring material that you
have and do collaborative projects.
[SPEAKER_01]: That material would then be able to be
jointly promoted.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'd be able to have stock that was
unique to you because all the material
[SPEAKER_01]: from the cross would be held.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two of you could figure out what was
the cultivar you wanted to release into
[SPEAKER_01]: the public as production material,
not as a cultivar unless you're building a
[SPEAKER_01]: nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're building a nursery, then you
say, hey, Nat, I want to work with you on
[SPEAKER_01]: a project.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love to take some of the stuff
you're doing, put it with something I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's find a cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's put it into the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's both be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did the shit work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a good one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then now both of you can do combined
breeding and you can do licensing that
[SPEAKER_01]: allows you to be able to use your
respective IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can then find individuals
that you can license the clone to because
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the problems is overproduction of
varietals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you end up out competing the
success because you got too much of the
[SPEAKER_01]: same material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's crucial, but I think a
lot of us just need more legal help with
[SPEAKER_01]: that where we need to have more people
like Beth come in and attorneys that were
[SPEAKER_01]: present.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was great to have an attorney present
yesterday because he could kind of say,
[SPEAKER_01]: listen, this is how we see this happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're able to get a better idea
because I don't think any of us are at
[SPEAKER_01]: least 95% of us have been involved in
patent protection of genomic material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I'm someone who mess around with
it all the time, but that's not what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have lawyers that I work with
because I don't have time to go to law
[SPEAKER_01]: school and I don't want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not my thing, but I need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think licensing is cool because
really a license is just a contract
[SPEAKER_00]: between you and your associate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly it's not as binding as
something like a patent, but it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: voluntary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do encourage folks to do that kind
of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at Gene's pre-roll line.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a way, that's good for everybody
because that pre-roll person might not
[SPEAKER_00]: have had quite such a namesake or
following.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's good for their pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's cool for Gene because he gets
credit, all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just one more thing, I keep hearing
everybody, we're all a little scared and
[SPEAKER_00]: we all know that these big powers that
have deep, deep pockets are coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you might sort of react to it and do
something that you might not otherwise do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get rid of all your purple strains or
something dumb like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just remember that when booze became
legal, there wasn't a Jim Beam or there
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't Budweiser or Coors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those kind of evolved out of their being
quick, and successes, but then in the
[SPEAKER_00]: mid-90s, all of a sudden there was this
thing that came out, it was like
[SPEAKER_00]: microbeer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I never thought in a million years
that there'd still be breweries opening in
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt County that are thriving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just the same with wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it takes a while for that to kind of
mature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you don't go into the gas station
down over at Piercy or whatever and stick
[SPEAKER_00]: your nose up at the new microbeers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you do at the, maybe you do or maybe
you don't, but at the Coors, I like PBR,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that stuff hasn't had a chance to
really like the PBRs and the Coors and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Budweiser's of cannabis, no one knows that
that's who they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's gonna take at least probably
like another year, maybe two before that
[SPEAKER_00]: really develops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what I'm really confident about
is that the regenerative and the small and
[SPEAKER_00]: the real craft actually then starts to
have its days in the sun, pun intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's the same with strains
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, God, remember how fricking long it
was just impossible to, like you just had
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow OG and then you grew a bunch of
this really cool, awesome stuff for your
[SPEAKER_00]: head.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you just always kind of had to grow
OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that that's gonna change too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's just remember that we are
pioneers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I think what me and Gene said
about like, well, I'm not ignoring the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that the market's saying one thing,
but I'm also not giving up on where my
[SPEAKER_00]: fricking roots are and where my
convictions lie and stuff like that.
So thank you very much.
