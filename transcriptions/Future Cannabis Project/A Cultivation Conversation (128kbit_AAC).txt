[SPEAKER_00]: I've noticed that it seems like the
industry is really in a stage of trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: just get by and that's kind of the main
focus for most people when they're
[SPEAKER_00]: starting cultivation sites is I've seen
the mentality switch from like what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: best site we can build to what is the
minimum we can build to get started and
[SPEAKER_00]: trying I see a lot more technologies
coming in that are scalable and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: start at a lot smaller set up so that
people can just actually establish revenue
[SPEAKER_00]: and get moving before they try to like
build out this massive project that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not sure if they're actually going
to be able to make any money operating
[SPEAKER_02]: that's cool actually so you are seeing
scalable where you can kind of start from
[SPEAKER_00]: the beginning at a lower budget I'm seeing
that I'm seeing that's what people are
[SPEAKER_00]: going for more so and that there's a lot
more tech coming to the market that
[SPEAKER_00]: enables people to do that I'm not so sure
that's still exactly the best approach I
[SPEAKER_00]: think you get a lot more efficiency by
building everything as one unit especially
[SPEAKER_00]: on the HVAC side just having integrated
systems that can share heat loops and
[SPEAKER_00]: actually like move heat between different
spaces and you know I've seen these like
[SPEAKER_00]: massive water loop systems where they're
just pulling heat out of every every unit
[SPEAKER_00]: inside of all the different spaces so that
you know even if you're running on
[SPEAKER_00]: different timers or if you have different
dehumidification needs and your reheat
[SPEAKER_00]: coil is not sizable enough you can still
be pulling heat out of these other spaces
[SPEAKER_00]: to make sure that you have enough to be
able to dehumidify inside the space and
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway the point is that there's this
there's always these little band-aids
[SPEAKER_00]: being created in the industry right now to
just kind of like make it easier for
[SPEAKER_00]: people to get started I think it's
probably just because there's so many
[SPEAKER_00]: projects that have just not really
finished and so people are trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: address this need because people are a
little more timid about dumping a ton of
[SPEAKER_02]: cash into a project now yeah that's kind
of the hard part having the well for one
[SPEAKER_02]: having the cash to dump in right investors
are getting a lot more frugal finding
[SPEAKER_02]: companies now that are saying you give me
your capital this is what I could do we're
[SPEAKER_02]: not profitable yet or we haven't even
started yet we're still in a full startup
[SPEAKER_02]: phase but we're gonna need five million
dollars to build out our cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: facility those are not to say it was ever
easy but it seems like it's getting
[SPEAKER_00]: substantially harder now than it was well
I think people have learned a lot from the
[SPEAKER_00]: lessons of the past few years of the
industry and what's been going on with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Canadian markets definitely I created a
lot of scare and hysteria in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm so sure that it really applies
that much to what's really happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: the US but it's definitely changed the
atmosphere a lot but I I definitely think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's much better for people to actually
have a proof of concept done before they
[SPEAKER_00]: try to invest five million dollars into a
project and at least have demonstrated on
[SPEAKER_00]: some small scale that you can produce a
product and you can get it to market or
[SPEAKER_00]: you can at least create some sort of
distribution system and or relationships
[SPEAKER_00]: with retailers that actually works and
then try to scale up your system but I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not I'm still not convinced that you know
trying to build one building with in
[SPEAKER_00]: sequence and just setting up individual
rooms one at a time is the best approach
[SPEAKER_00]: just because of the efficiency losses
you're gonna have in the long term for
[SPEAKER_02]: your HVAC systems yeah the HVAC is a big
one with that I know that you know I can
[SPEAKER_02]: remember with us when we originally
started out you know it was kind of always
[SPEAKER_02]: that way where you'd grow in a basement
and then you'd move to a new house in a
[SPEAKER_02]: new basement and you knew it was gonna
take a certain amount of time before that
[SPEAKER_02]: basement was gonna start yielding you're
gonna have to figure out your space in
[SPEAKER_02]: your environment and then went from a
basement to you know a small you know
[SPEAKER_02]: 2,000 square foot shop and those lessons
were multiplied we're like whoa I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: building rooms now I don't have the
regular my HVAC system in my house isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: what's keeping the house warm and there's
different airflow tracks and humidity is
[SPEAKER_02]: different and and that's expensive and and
then to look at somebody who's figured
[SPEAKER_02]: that out in a in a shop and say now you
need to go to vertical racks automation
[SPEAKER_02]: LED light you know find efficiencies
everywhere from trimming all the way
[SPEAKER_02]: through how you mix nutrient scare people
to death a lot of times and I get it like
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not like you can just make a mistake
and go to the bank and have a cushion loan
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah it's a hard commitment for people and
I sympathize because you know but I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: always talking about this is what you got
to do you have to like you said we have to
[SPEAKER_02]: build it efficient from the start because
the amount of money that you lose trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to shut everything down and the shelf
space the problems you can run into when
[SPEAKER_02]: you completely revamp and relearn that
whole lesson that's that's a difficult
[SPEAKER_02]: thing to do if you're self-funded but what
what do you do yeah it's a it's definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the biggest crux for for the
small entrepreneurial cultivator yeah I
[SPEAKER_00]: can definitely see how it's it's hard to
adapt to that new model and I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: that that model of you know what you're
talking about vertical racking and LEDs
[SPEAKER_00]: and really efficient equipment that's
certainly not been the standard and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly not what people are accustomed
to and I'm not sure it's really complete
[SPEAKER_00]: yet the ideas and concepts that are really
going to be effective in that space but
[SPEAKER_00]: there's there's still just so much
research that has to be done and I really
[SPEAKER_00]: wish there were more people that were
interested in uncovering what truths we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have yet in terms of cultivation and
what are the most efficient practices
[SPEAKER_00]: we're really relying on a lot of
assumptions that are being fed to us by
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment manufacturers and there's
there's not you know due to its its status
[SPEAKER_00]: as a narcotic for most of the world you
know this is mostly about cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation can you talk about either some
research you have done or are doing or
[SPEAKER_01]: that other people are doing that you've
been following that you find interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: sure there's not a lot what I was gonna
say was because of its status there's not
[SPEAKER_00]: been a ton of opportunity for academic
institutions to really dig in on crops and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand dig in on this crop and
understand how to best grow it and what
[SPEAKER_00]: are the little nuances about it and that's
been done with many other crops and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: they're kind of boring at this point
because they've just been researched so
[SPEAKER_00]: much so we don't really we don't really
have any more questions about what light
[SPEAKER_00]: spectrums right for them or at least in
maybe we have curiosities but we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: really turn them into something that's
going to be that effective in the industry
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just a few little details that we're
wondering about now but me personally I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been really fixated on nutrient research
for cannabis just because there's not you
[SPEAKER_00]: know when I first got started I just like
found every single nutrient product I
[SPEAKER_00]: could get my hands on in the industry
found out everything that was inside of it
[SPEAKER_00]: found out followed all their feed
schedules looked at what the PPM for every
[SPEAKER_00]: single nutrient was for every week by week
that they recommended and what what what
[SPEAKER_00]: was the phosphate levels they thought
should be going on in week four why did
[SPEAKER_00]: they add in this other mix and what level
were they aiming for and there's not one
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient brand that's the same as the
other they're all totally different from
[SPEAKER_00]: one another so I just started doing my own
trials where I was buying every single
[SPEAKER_00]: individual salt nutrient calcium nitrate
potassium nitrate magnesium nitrate MKP
[SPEAKER_00]: potassium sulfate everything all the
micros and just making my own blends and
[SPEAKER_00]: see in testing them testing different
ratios of each nutrient together trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: find what ratios people were going for in
different products and seeing what
[SPEAKER_00]: actually worked and it really doesn't need
a lot of nutrition is what I found it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty light feeding crop in general I
mean you can push it but you tend to
[SPEAKER_00]: create more issues for yourself when you
push it if you feed it a ton of nitrogen
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to get it to veg out a lot faster
than you end up putting on tons of little
[SPEAKER_00]: more nodes they're trying to branch out
and so you have to deal with a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: pruning and you end up kind of making the
plant more susceptible to Pest infection
[SPEAKER_00]: in my opinion when you're overfeeding the
plant You see a lot more water damage So I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean that's that's kind of I was focusing
on mostly just nutrient research and I
[SPEAKER_00]: found you don't really need near as much
potassium as what most people are doing
[SPEAKER_00]: for like tomato crops and pepper crops
where they're feeding these like 2 to 2.5
[SPEAKER_00]: to 3 to 4 EC levels with like 300 PPM
potassium you know you can be more down to
[SPEAKER_00]: like 150 like it doesn't need to be that
high in your nitrogen to potassium ratios
[SPEAKER_00]: can be pretty close to one another the PPM
levels can be pretty close to one another
[SPEAKER_00]: it's it's not unlike that for many crops
but a lot of the information that's
[SPEAKER_00]: available has when I really started
digging into some of the publications it's
[SPEAKER_00]: from fertilizer manufacturers saying you
need this much potassium and it doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really make a lot of sense I'm not sure it
really works it just ends up in the
[SPEAKER_00]: groundwater really so and that's another
issue is just the eutrophication effects
[SPEAKER_00]: that come from overfeeding these plants
and then going back into the groundwater
[SPEAKER_00]: into our municipal water systems and so
that's where I saw a ton of gas caps and
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and you know we talk about a lot
about light spectrum these days and I see
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people doing light spectrum
research I'm not sure I've seen a ton that
[SPEAKER_00]: really made me learn that much more than
what I learned in schools I mean I went to
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a master's in horticulture and so I
studied a lot photobiology I was doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: project about growing plants in the
International Space Station and you know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of interesting things to see
but there's not a lot of interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: changes that have happened over the past
10 years far-red lights been really
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting people are talking about
adding far-red light to the mix and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: because there was I think it was some work
being done at UGA where they were just
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at different effects on the
different photo systems and how it changes
[SPEAKER_00]: based on the red to far-red ratios and I
think they're calling the Emerson
[SPEAKER_00]: enhancement effect was this old paper that
came out a long time ago and they were
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of bringing back shedding light on
how far-red light was relevant for
[SPEAKER_00]: photosynthesis and there was some good
findings there but I haven't seen it
[SPEAKER_00]: really integrated in a light that's being
heavily commercialized yet but it's also
[SPEAKER_00]: quite available in other types of lights
besides LEDs but you've mentioned kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: growing with kind of salt-based nutrients
and stuff are you oh yeah do you explore
[SPEAKER_01]: like I'm actually I have my YouTube
channel open where the most recent videos
[SPEAKER_01]: Korean natural farming topic are you doing
any kind of stuff that explores like
[SPEAKER_01]: adding microbes and yeah fungal you know
I'm not a big believer that and I prefer
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow an indoor environments greenhouse
environments I love outdoor production but
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you kind of you got to be fortunate
with a good piece of land and it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not that easy to find a good place to
grow cannabis it's it's you know there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people are really fortunate have a
great place to grow of good weather good
[SPEAKER_00]: soil that's it's awesome they should keep
doing it but a lot of people they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: deal with pretty hard harsh climates and
it's a lot easier just to do it indoors or
[SPEAKER_00]: in a greenhouse I do use a lot of
microbial products but I primarily just
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on like composts compost blends of
vermicomposts I don't think you can really
[SPEAKER_00]: effectively cultivate microbes or mycelium
or mycorrhizae in a pot in such a short
[SPEAKER_00]: life cycle of a plant so I think it's
you'll get some but I think it's just kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a waste of money so what I try to focus
on just producing a really get really good
[SPEAKER_00]: vermicompost make it make a tea or extract
out of it and just apply it to the roots
[SPEAKER_00]: so that there's a living ecosystem of
microbes being added to the mix and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: also using salt nutrients but I try to
keep it really low and I take time to just
[SPEAKER_00]: feed them plants just water and
vermicompost tea to try to keep a living
[SPEAKER_00]: population of microbes growing in the soil
but I'm not going to be dependent on an
[SPEAKER_00]: inoculum for that I'm going to be
constantly adding this living solution to
[SPEAKER_00]: it so I'm not there's no lag time for me
to wait for it to colonize my roots or to
[SPEAKER_02]: get acclimated to the new zone right you
know when we were working at eco on kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of looking at nutrient I was coming we
were coming at it from a little different
[SPEAKER_02]: angle which I found really interesting we
had a resource to be able to take our
[SPEAKER_02]: plants take our matter in from the plants
at week one week two whenever we wanted
[SPEAKER_02]: and be able to test leaves and the
nutrient nutrient content of the leaves at
[SPEAKER_02]: the different stages and the different
plants and it got really interesting you
[SPEAKER_02]: know because we were working closely with
an automation system for our for negation
[SPEAKER_02]: and so they were actually designing a
system for us so that we could down to the
[SPEAKER_02]: milliliter track exactly how much nutrient
was going to exactly which plants and then
[SPEAKER_02]: we could tie that into our cultivation to
look like over time exactly how much our
[SPEAKER_02]: yields were in comparison to our feed
programs as it went up and down and then
[SPEAKER_02]: when we started playing with the nutrient
and testing those levels in the plants for
[SPEAKER_02]: mobile and semi-mobile we found cool stuff
like same room same environment we've got
[SPEAKER_02]: pineapple kush here and we've got the
flave here and we're feeding them the same
[SPEAKER_02]: regiment and the flave is holding 150 ppm
of phosphorus and the pineapple kush is at
[SPEAKER_00]: 3000 yeah and it was like totally
different uptake mechanisms yeah and then
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to play with within that uptake
what does it want does the flave want to
[SPEAKER_02]: be at 3000 or does it want to be at 150
and what being able to track through our
[SPEAKER_02]: yields and then obviously economically
track through how much nutrient we're
[SPEAKER_02]: using and when slowly but surely you could
get to that point where you can start
[SPEAKER_02]: documenting this plant likes to eat this
for its maximum yield or its maximum
[SPEAKER_02]: potency and if I'm making a live resin
versus a joint yeah and you know it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: long project but I like sure yeah it's
great and I really wish people were more
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on that right now and some I've
really been digging in on and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand as much as I can yeah it's and
how do those things change with different
[SPEAKER_00]: environments is also interesting you know
if you if you upgrade your lighting system
[SPEAKER_00]: and now you've got much more PPFD in the
space how's your nutrients how's your
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient regime gonna change in response
to that and is it just a matter of like
[SPEAKER_00]: this plant likes this level of ratios of
nutrients and all you got to do is scale
[SPEAKER_00]: it up when you when it's under a more
intense environment or does it stay the
[SPEAKER_02]: same and it does more with less like yeah
through that grower curse or at least I do
[SPEAKER_02]: all right I've gotten better at it but the
throw too many things at once yeah we've
[SPEAKER_02]: done one experiment it liked it now let's
change the temperature let's change the
[SPEAKER_02]: light spectrum no hold on how about we
just do the same experiment two or three
[SPEAKER_02]: times and get like a nice field of data
and then change one thing yeah and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: painfully slow but that's what it takes
and that's that's why we need a lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: people doing it and talking about it and
because we're waiting a lot of resources
[SPEAKER_01]: by not getting these answers just Jesse
just quickly with you had mentioned can
[SPEAKER_01]: you be specific about like a cultivar that
you grew and what you may have done
[SPEAKER_01]: different if you knew you were growing it
for flower versus extraction so we were
[SPEAKER_02]: just starting that when we had sold the
company and then when we exited that
[SPEAKER_02]: endeavor in what is now a multinational
lawsuit so super fun to watch all that
[SPEAKER_02]: research kind of go down the drain but we
were just getting to the point to where
[SPEAKER_02]: yes we were not going to deal with putting
it with all these other plants where it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't react the same but you couldn't
see it with the naked eye like the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: was happy and healthy with six other
strains in the room created great flower
[SPEAKER_02]: sold just fine but economically once we
started to keep track of that data that
[SPEAKER_02]: was where we started to realize there is a
different methodology to how we need to
[SPEAKER_02]: consider cultivation for our efficiencies
so that we're not once again wasting
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient and power because I need to boost
it up for you or bring it down for you
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah and you know they'll tolerate a range
of you know when you're overfeeding them
[SPEAKER_00]: or underfeeding them they have a tolerance
in which they'll deal with that but you it
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a lot harder to really track the the
small effects that lead to macro scale
[SPEAKER_00]: effects later on the plants growth because
it's all compounding you know if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just kind of five percent hurting it
because it's getting overfed this one
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient will buy an eight-week cycle
that's it adds up to a lot even if it
[SPEAKER_00]: seems like a minor stress you can't
identify with the naked eye there's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that can be monitored just
through analytical equipment and actually
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention and doing structured
research but I think it always needs to
[SPEAKER_00]: stay very applied for this industry right
now because there's just a lot of catch-up
[SPEAKER_02]: to do yeah yeah and that you know was one
of the things I loved about the automation
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment which I've I've had people in
the past kind of reference to me like
[SPEAKER_02]: you're taking away jobs and you know to be
clear we're not taking away jobs I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: actually just refocusing that's there's
nothing better in a farm when your farm
[SPEAKER_02]: labor doesn't have to mix nutrient yeah
they can be working with the plant rather
[SPEAKER_02]: than working with the nutrients or working
with the feed system they just head in do
[SPEAKER_02]: a little programming and then they get to
go actually observe the plants all day and
[SPEAKER_02]: if need be prune if need be transplant
that interaction with the plants it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: a refocus of job yeah and it gives you
more time for scouting if you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: issues in the space and then maintaining
cleanliness at a much higher rate as well
[SPEAKER_00]: which is one of the most important things
of all cultivation is cleanliness
[SPEAKER_00]: especially in nursery yeah so easy to let
it slip to yeah so easy yeah it's is it
[SPEAKER_01]: Josh your friend yeah so what's something
you and him like either today or in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past couple days we're just like dorking
out on what kind of mad science are you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys talking we were going in about when
you move plants under different light
[SPEAKER_00]: sources the stress like you know is it
better to go from a metal highlight to an
[SPEAKER_00]: HPS from veg to flower or LED to HPS and
like what what's an okay transition and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's not and just you know nerding out
about the mechanics of chloroplast
[SPEAKER_00]: movement and the leaves and just just
trying to understand that a plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: always adapting to its environment at all
times you know when it's when it's
[SPEAKER_00]: building a leaf it's gonna it's gonna
expand it's gonna expand out it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: move chloroplasts around and align them
within the leaf structure it's where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're optimally positioned to absorb
light wherever that light source is coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from or whatever type of light source that
is you know we talked about these pigments
[SPEAKER_00]: today and the presentations and those
pigments are selected based on the light
[SPEAKER_00]: source that the plant is receiving and so
when the light source changes it has to
[SPEAKER_00]: adapt all that and sometimes it's very
difficult for the plant to make drastic
[SPEAKER_00]: adaptations to a different light source so
that's it's just the things you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about when you're making these
transitions as to why it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult or easier for the plant to make
a transition more quickly so yeah you've
[SPEAKER_00]: got to really pay attention to the fact
that the plant is building itself as a
[SPEAKER_00]: receiver of its environment and it if you
change it it has to change with that and I
[SPEAKER_00]: went further with it and was saying that
temperature and humidity can have really
[SPEAKER_00]: stressful effects as well when it's
fluctuating you know eight to ten percent
[SPEAKER_00]: humidity in the grow room or you know
going outside of two degrees Celsius
[SPEAKER_00]: fluctuations like in a small amount of
time I think it's fairly stressful to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants to deal with it to deal with those
changes just on their transpiration rates
[SPEAKER_00]: and the amount of energy they have to
spend altering their stomata maybe I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: wrong I don't really have any data to back
it up it's speculation and research that I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to see answers to and I don't care if
I'm right or not and to him he thinks that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's such it takes so long for a plant to
respond to a change in temperature in the
[SPEAKER_00]: space that by the time it's by the time
it's really realized that something's
[SPEAKER_00]: changed that it's it's probably gonna have
reached equilibrium again in the space
[SPEAKER_00]: there's just like these deliberations that
go back and forth about the micro
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanics of what's happening in a plant
when you get people around each other that
[SPEAKER_00]: both know a lot about it what are some of
your favorite cultivars to grow I am
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly and why well I prefer plants that
are shorter I'm not I love cannabis but
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not super well versed on the genetics
that have been around I have was not from
[SPEAKER_00]: California I'm not from a state where it's
like been really prevalent I grew up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Georgia and Tennessee so it's you know
I've been learning a lot about the
[SPEAKER_00]: different cultivars and genetics that are
available but I just really like the the
[SPEAKER_00]: vertical racked intensive growth model
with small plants that are put that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a long veg time and are placed in
placed into this production model and can
[SPEAKER_00]: be turned over really fast rates just
trying to explore what possibilities are
[SPEAKER_00]: available in that space of it's doing
extremely close canopy to canopies that
[SPEAKER_00]: are really close to the lights that plants
that aren't allowed to grow very tall so
[SPEAKER_00]: just like trying to see how we can make
really small plants that we can grow a
[SPEAKER_00]: massive amount of like individual plants
up to create one big canopy they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: see a green model but just shrinking the
plants down more and more and more but I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I get that mentality just from like
studying how to grow plants for space
[SPEAKER_00]: transit when I was in grad school so I'm
just like always and what did you learn
[SPEAKER_00]: about plants in space it's very hard it's
very hard to water plants in space yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it's thought of that you can't else you
can't outsmart it I think it's the system
[SPEAKER_00]: they have right now there's a production
module called veggie there's two of them
[SPEAKER_00]: actually on the space station I think they
just launched up the advanced plant
[SPEAKER_00]: habitat which is one that's a lot more
versatile but the veggie was the one I was
[SPEAKER_00]: working with and the way the irrigation
system works it's just like it's a piece
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a piece of foam not well the one on
the one on the space station is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: different it's it's just like a reservoir
that has a wet surface on it and then you
[SPEAKER_00]: have these little packets that have a
porous membrane on bottom they sit on this
[SPEAKER_00]: wet surface they're full of like a clay
medium with slow-release fertilizers in it
[SPEAKER_00]: and it just wicks up water out of the out
of that wet surface because there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: restriction to capillary action where
water will climb something in space it's
[SPEAKER_00]: only like limited by gravity pulling it
down so water will just climb stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: indefinitely in space so we had this like
genius model of you know letting the water
[SPEAKER_00]: just wick up so that there's no there's no
free water moving at any point it works
[SPEAKER_00]: okay it dries out sometimes there's also
been an incidence incident of water
[SPEAKER_00]: climbing up the plant and kind of getting
on the leaves and coming out of the root
[SPEAKER_00]: zone so there's that there was that aspect
as well so it's just it's hard and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the state the spaces are they're
conditioned for human comfort and human
[SPEAKER_00]: and we don't really have really good ways
of scrubbing co2 that are really effective
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're still just kind of running
it through like a sieve bed that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: to change out so the co2 levels stay
really high on the space station that was
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of what I focused my research on
because I happen to get a crop that was
[SPEAKER_00]: extremely sensitive to high co2 levels and
had a real drop-off in productivity when
[SPEAKER_00]: it was what crap was that Chinese cabbage
real fun like bok choy type stuff yeah it
[SPEAKER_00]: looks just like bok choy it was um called
Tokyo Bikana it's a real leafy soft
[SPEAKER_00]: Chinese cabbage we also did dwarf tomatoes
but they were we were just seeing so many
[SPEAKER_00]: issues with the production system and it
was like it was a three-month crop to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: who's like we need to figure out some of
these other issues first because we saw a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of similar stressors on the tomato
crop as we saw in Chinese cabbage which
[SPEAKER_00]: led me to kind of question the entire idea
of co2 injection like and whether it was
[SPEAKER_00]: really beneficial which it definitely
increases yield that's definitely been
[SPEAKER_00]: concluded for most crops but there's also
some stressors that it creates some going
[SPEAKER_00]: through a lot of the literature of like
greenhouse tomato co2 enrichment studies
[SPEAKER_00]: you know they mentioned they're like yeah
but our co2 plants enriched plants had a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of lesions on their leaves and they
were turning yellow and brown and like
[SPEAKER_00]: there was clear stress from from that
being the only different variable so kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of led me to have a much more conservative
approach to co2 injection I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: you should go over 800 ppm in a cannabis
grow room I just don't think you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting much more for injecting any more
than 800 Jesse what are your thoughts yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: you know that's it's as far as co2
injection I'm not gonna weigh in on plants
[SPEAKER_02]: in space so apologize but but you know as
far as co2 injection and and I mean even
[SPEAKER_02]: going all the way back to favorite
cultivars and plants I don't I get asked
[SPEAKER_02]: that question a good amount of time and I
think the real answer is all of them you
[SPEAKER_02]: know there's there is something really
awesome about standing next to a 20 foot
[SPEAKER_02]: tall cannabis plant you know that has a
diameter of 45 or 65 feet like those thing
[SPEAKER_02]: is just so impressive to watch what that
plant will do in such a short time frame
[SPEAKER_02]: if taken care of or conversely being able
to grow for efficiency and look at what
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of strains can we put in and at what
height and what level and what we can veg
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know we found really cool stuff
that was just kind of oddly interesting
[SPEAKER_02]: like you said about switching environments
where okay we're not gonna go cradle to
[SPEAKER_02]: grave in the same rooms it's not efficient
so we're gonna have to move them and are
[SPEAKER_02]: we gonna build a facility where it's the
we can monitor the environment so closely
[SPEAKER_02]: that we bring everything to that point and
what is the ROI on that to think that we
[SPEAKER_02]: could gain how much if we're right we gain
an extra point zero three percent on the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants yield and so over a 36 year period
we're gonna see an ROI on being able to
[SPEAKER_02]: balance our environments through the
hallways you're not gonna not gonna do
[SPEAKER_02]: that right so being able to look at
figuring out things like we were growing
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously vertically in the flower rooms
and we're growing vertically in veg but if
[SPEAKER_02]: you took in veg our plants have had trays
and our plants in flower had trays but
[SPEAKER_02]: they didn't take up the entire rack system
because it moved over what was a graded
[SPEAKER_02]: floor so the light in flower from all the
way up top would still filter through the
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy in small spaces and wind up getting
to the plants on the lower end so if we
[SPEAKER_02]: took our plants that were in veg that were
underneath where the light really wasn't
[SPEAKER_02]: filtering from up high in the same way and
we put them on the bottom where light was
[SPEAKER_02]: now filtering from high in the flower they
would they would be a little more stressed
[SPEAKER_02]: out not terribly but it would take them a
little more time to bounce back yeah so we
[SPEAKER_02]: started learning that our bottom row veg
had to go to our top row in the farm or at
[SPEAKER_02]: least in the flower side and so going back
but looking at looking at giant outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: plants versus I was always a huge fan of
kind of the old school like super silver
[SPEAKER_02]: haze yeah Hawaiian snow like I love the
structure of those plants I love the smell
[SPEAKER_02]: of those plants I love the size that
they'll get whether it's indoor or outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: but always being able to see those new
cultivars that come out where you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: calyx color changes at a certain time or
their pigments change at certain times or
[SPEAKER_02]: they produce very specific terpenes at
certain times I just I kind of dork out
[SPEAKER_02]: about all of them yeah so you know but
like we're talking about when looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: efficiencies and that's that's where I
think I will sit around for days and talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about it and try to figure it out because
just like when we were growing in
[SPEAKER_02]: basements and it was like you could see
almost like a kinship where you'd be in
[SPEAKER_02]: Home Depot in the plumbing aisle and
you're grabbing this little piece and that
[SPEAKER_02]: and you're in your brain creating like an
engineering mastermind of how you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to get this system to work and while
you're doing it you'd realize oh you're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing the same thing you do right like oh
I know you like you just get that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: look and I always wondered if the Home
Depot employees are like yeah there's like
[SPEAKER_02]: six growers over in the plumbing aisle
like I always really appreciated that but
[SPEAKER_02]: you know this industry right now is built
off of people that that for a lot of us
[SPEAKER_02]: that has been our lives and so being able
to graduate that up to where you know it's
[SPEAKER_02]: just an advancement of whether it's
standing in the Home Depot plumbing aisle
[SPEAKER_02]: and bouncing back and forth between that
and the irrigation section or it's you
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting with an architect and a footprint
of a building and starting to consider how
[SPEAKER_02]: many footsteps it takes and what the
environment will be for the plant in that
[SPEAKER_02]: transition and how many square feet and
you know even yesterday I was talking to
[SPEAKER_02]: someone about you know now we're looking
at cylindrical where the lighting isn't
[SPEAKER_02]: you know which isn't new but we're looking
at vertical stacked where you use
[SPEAKER_02]: cylindrical lighting and then create a
circle of plants around that are growing
[SPEAKER_02]: into the light and we were talking about
that efficiency and once again there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem because you have dead space
between every circle yeah so that square
[SPEAKER_02]: footage where I could have a plant squares
work better than circles in that scenario
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah and so I just love being able to
really sit down and and go through that
[SPEAKER_02]: because I've had that question before when
speaking where people say like well so you
[SPEAKER_02]: got to $189 a pound for indoor cultivation
and you said you could get lower how did
[SPEAKER_02]: you do it as if I'm got like some well
here let me draw you a picture and here's
[SPEAKER_02]: the answer like it's not it's all those
little pieces and I think it's no
[SPEAKER_02]: different harmony growing and you're
feeding plants right like the root zone of
[SPEAKER_02]: a plant and the way a plant uptakes
nutrient we have somewhat recently figured
[SPEAKER_02]: out might as well be the bottom of the
ocean right we're still making a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: theory like we're just realizing in the
last decade or two that we don't know as
[SPEAKER_00]: much about plants as we thought we did
sure and then you know people always show
[SPEAKER_00]: you that nutrient availability graph by pH
it's like oh well at low pH this this
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients I'm like I love that like that
think that's for like outdoor soil I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know if that really applies to cocoa husks
right and I can remember following that
[SPEAKER_02]: and being like I don't understand I'm in
the green zone why is it not taking up the
[SPEAKER_00]: calcium yeah yeah well maybe there's too
much iron or too much phosphorus sir right
[SPEAKER_02]: and then there's those random times that
you know I can remember hey we didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: realize the HVAC unit went down and the
plants spent all day today at 109 degrees
[SPEAKER_02]: like it ramped up slowly and it didn't
kill him but man I went downstairs and
[SPEAKER_02]: there was you know water dripping from the
fixtures and I was certain that you know
[SPEAKER_02]: bulbs were gonna explode and oh my god and
you wind up with a 40 percent gain in your
[SPEAKER_02]: yield you can never duplicate it and it's
like what was it was it the temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: mixed with the nutrient was it the
humidity was it the stage was it the
[SPEAKER_02]: there's you know it's like the end it's
like the end endless question that growers
[SPEAKER_02]: always have because we've all hit those
crops where we're like yeah I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: what I did I can't I can't tell you we had
a lucid dream which was one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_02]: strains to grow because it's really really
purple but it would also produce really
[SPEAKER_02]: well and I had a great flavor and a great
smoke and kind of a black licorice smell
[SPEAKER_02]: to it almost barbecue sauce sometimes
which was really interesting but uh it was
[SPEAKER_02]: always you know 15 to maybe 19 percent was
it's kind of THC range which is I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: that's kind of right what I would like and
I hear that a lot more now right thank God
[SPEAKER_02]: um but we grew it one at one point in time
and had a heat issue in the room or no not
[SPEAKER_02]: a heat issue I'm sorry a light issue not
heat because that plant got really
[SPEAKER_02]: sensitive to heat if you overheated it it
would grow tiny little popcorns and then
[SPEAKER_02]: morph out and be a big problem but we'd
had a like a nutrient or a light issue
[SPEAKER_02]: where I think we had the timers off and I
don't remember what the exact problem was
[SPEAKER_02]: but that crop came out and tested it like
28% wow and we could never duplicate it
[SPEAKER_00]: again yeah and we were keeping good notes
but you saw an all-new genetic potential
[SPEAKER_00]: in this plant that you thought was one
thing you know it's we always talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars but I'm you know I'm always
saying okay let's take your cultivar let's
[SPEAKER_00]: grow it under blue-red LEDs let's grow it
under broad spectrum LEDs let's grow it
[SPEAKER_00]: under a metal halide let's grow it under
an HPS let's grow it outside and then tell
[SPEAKER_02]: me which one's your cultivar yeah yeah you
know we had that fun game with uh SFV and
[SPEAKER_02]: uh I'm gonna butcher this no yeah we had
that SFV and OG so we brought you know we
[SPEAKER_02]: had a grower that came in the facility and
he's like I got us SFV and it's so it's so
[SPEAKER_02]: dope and then I got us OG Kush and I'm
super stoked and then we put him in the
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms and started growing them and a
little bit of time went by and I was like
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't these the same plant it's just
one's grown by the ocean and one's grown
[SPEAKER_02]: in the valley right isn't SFV San Fernando
Valley and OG Kush is ocean-grown am I
[SPEAKER_02]: like making that up and no no I think
you're right and we kind of researched it
[SPEAKER_02]: like maybe we are no that's that's yeah
that's what it is well then what happens
[SPEAKER_02]: when you put them in the same indoor
environment and I can tell you it takes
[SPEAKER_02]: about a year they become the same plant
yeah like it was amazing to watch where
[SPEAKER_02]: you're like you would get people that were
like oh yeah I'll take the SFV not the OG
[SPEAKER_02]: and you would watch harvest after harvest
where they got closer and closer in
[SPEAKER_02]: similarity to where it was like well which
one do you want to get rid of because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're the same plant yeah it was cool
it's very adaptable and we definitely
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped paying attention to that there's
but there's there's so much effect that
[SPEAKER_00]: comes from the grower and from the
cultivation side and from the company
[SPEAKER_00]: actually producing the flower you know
people are very often from the dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: level like oh we need this strain and we
need this strain it's no you need this
[SPEAKER_00]: grower this brand these people that are
producing products for you because that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what's really that's where the value comes
from and I think we'll get there oh yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just a matter of time but you know
necessity is what winds up breeding all of
[SPEAKER_02]: that creation and it was an interesting
thing I was in talking to some growers
[SPEAKER_02]: here in California about a year ago a
little over a year ago and they were oh
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah we sell all our flower for 2800 a
pound all day long it's gonna be at least
[SPEAKER_02]: three years market strong wreck is taken
off I was like well be careful because I
[SPEAKER_02]: can tell you from Oregon lessons that
things can change fast and now you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at the slowdown in regulation epic
crops for outdoor season and all the over
[SPEAKER_02]: taxation which is driving people who are
sitting on a maybe license can't get their
[SPEAKER_02]: CUP and you're looking at taxation that's
now starting to weigh in where example in
[SPEAKER_02]: example in Santa Barbara they've now said
that you can grow but you can't dry
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's fire hazard well so um who do
you think is gonna pay for that that's
[SPEAKER_02]: gonna go right to the consumer so we got a
cultivation tax before we send it to the
[SPEAKER_02]: dryer and now does a dryer have a tax
before he sends it to the processor who
[SPEAKER_02]: has a tax before they send it to the
manufacturer to put it in packaging who
[SPEAKER_02]: then has a tax before they send it to the
distributor to send it out to the
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary who has a tax for the consumer
and once again now you have a consumer who
[SPEAKER_02]: says you know I've been buying bags from
Jimmy for $40 that are chronic my whole
[SPEAKER_02]: life yep and Jimmy now separates his
strains and I have a total variety and I
[SPEAKER_02]: can still get a bag for $40 or I can run
all the way across town in traffic because
[SPEAKER_02]: we only have eight dispensaries in the
whole county and I could pay $85 for a
[SPEAKER_02]: gram grown by somebody I don't know with
no clue what the quality is because I
[SPEAKER_02]: can't see it in the bag that that and
support med men yeah a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem well you know it 38 cents a share
might have been a poor endeavor basically
[SPEAKER_01]: talking drying curing and then
presentation to the end consumer and so I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like in a modern dispensary that
lonely eighth sitting on a shelf by itself
[SPEAKER_01]: as a grower you're kind of like it's like
the least impressive representation of
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm capable of and that's what people
see with my brand name on it versus if you
[SPEAKER_01]: could pull it out of like a big bag full
of all its friends to hand to someone
[SPEAKER_01]: right before they're about to smoke it so
we're talking right before the camera was
[SPEAKER_02]: on and so years ago many many moons ago we
went through a raid at one of our sister
[SPEAKER_02]: facilities and so the whole panic ensues
oh my god clean everything out you know
[SPEAKER_02]: get rid of this like what happens if and
we were we were running legal but it was
[SPEAKER_02]: still back in the times where medical
facilities were still getting rated and so
[SPEAKER_02]: um so we you know stashed everything we
could stash and panicked and thankfully it
[SPEAKER_02]: was totally fine nothing happened fast
forward a year later I'm in my horse barn
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like moving stuff around I get behind
a door and I find a big old blue bin and
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like what's this doing here thinking
it's a big bin of trim and I pull it out
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's about ten pounds of LA and
blackberry and it's all food savored it's
[SPEAKER_02]: all been cured and it's sitting in its
food saver bags and it's quarter pounds
[SPEAKER_02]: which is how I saved it and I was like
holy crap I lost this weed for a year dude
[SPEAKER_02]: like so we open it up cut them open check
them out smells incredible looks
[SPEAKER_02]: incredible had to we were at the time we
were testing all the time terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoid the whole nine all the
cannabinoids and terpenes went up it
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't convert its THC it was incredible
and it sold like crazy at the dispenser
[SPEAKER_02]: when I brought it out there but it was
kind of that fun game alike as we've
[SPEAKER_02]: discussed curing weed is an art like it's
it is being able to you know once again to
[SPEAKER_02]: dork out and be able to get down to like
the exact temperature and the exact
[SPEAKER_02]: humidity fluctuation in the water activity
in the moisture content for each strain I
[SPEAKER_02]: think that you could really really get far
into that into understanding exactly how
[SPEAKER_02]: to cure your cannabis perfectly so that
actually gets better over time if stored
[SPEAKER_00]: properly sure yeah there there is some
mechanics to pay attention to this isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: the only product that needs to be dried
and cured you know they do it with tobacco
[SPEAKER_00]: beef jerky and dried fruits and I mean
there's there's water activity
[SPEAKER_00]: establishments for those and particularly
on the tobacco route and even certain
[SPEAKER_00]: types of tea leaves that are processed for
long periods of time like you know they're
[SPEAKER_00]: paying attention to enzymatic activity
going on within the tissue as it's as it's
[SPEAKER_00]: losing water and there's a threshold where
enzymatic activity cuts off there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold also where mold growth cuts off
and there's a there's a window between
[SPEAKER_00]: there where you could really slow down the
drying process and let let the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to break itself down and remove
some of these like harsher chemicals in it
[SPEAKER_00]: the just chlorophylls are not that great
to smoke they just are kind of minty and
[SPEAKER_00]: but those will break down with time and
trying really trying to identify those
[SPEAKER_00]: windows where you can extend out the
curing process or even the drying process
[SPEAKER_00]: for a longer period of time once you've
cleared a window where you're gonna where
[SPEAKER_00]: you might cause harm to the crop yeah
there's a lot and there's lots of details
[SPEAKER_02]: there that we really need yeah there's
that once again like add it to the list of
[SPEAKER_02]: projects yeah you know and it's a fun
thing to think of too like we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about with the the lonely eighth on the
shelf versus versus the joint and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's my own little personal thing in
the world but the joint is this little
[SPEAKER_02]: enigma in the space that it kind of drives
me crazy because it's so diverse and
[SPEAKER_02]: people don't the consumers don't realize
it like we're going to very specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: grind up this part of the plant in this
fashion and do an ad back of it that came
[SPEAKER_02]: from that plant in order to fashion this
joint in a way that is mixed down on on
[SPEAKER_02]: sieve tables so that we have the right
particulate to burn and we're going to do
[SPEAKER_02]: it at scale and it's going to be great and
meanwhile this person showed up at my
[SPEAKER_02]: facility and they bought everything that
we weren't even going to send to extract
[SPEAKER_02]: that we were saving up because eventually
maybe we'll we'll burn it down to distill
[SPEAKER_02]: it at some very small amount and see if
it's even worth it because it's the stocks
[SPEAKER_02]: and the stems and sugar leaf and leaf and
you know cannabis that was on the floor
[SPEAKER_02]: and they pick it up and then put it
through the world's largest grinder and
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff it in a joint and sell it for the
same or less price and the consumer
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't know this there's nothing on the
package that lets you know that's what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on no there's a bunch of trim leaves
in your joint yeah that's all you're
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking that's usually not really
communicated on the packaging and so the
[SPEAKER_02]: joint thing is the joint world is really
interesting to me and in whoever figures
[SPEAKER_02]: out how to crack that nut in reaching the
consumer and understanding what's what
[SPEAKER_02]: that joint consists of and I don't know
that it ever happens right like I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: cigarettes are still smoked in America and
the consumer knows what's in them and so I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know that that ever happens maybe
there's always a specific price point and
[SPEAKER_02]: if you want to get up and above then
you're looking at can of guards you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at things that are at that level
but that it's one of the idiosyncrasies in
[SPEAKER_02]: the industry at least on the consumer side
of things that I'm really intrigued by
[SPEAKER_02]: because maybe we grew a product that won't
look great in that lonely eighth on the
[SPEAKER_02]: shelf or when it's getting down to the end
we always like to grind those into into
[SPEAKER_02]: joints and now great it's a pretty joint
it looks good it's good cannabis and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: now competing with everything else that
nobody can identify yeah you're just
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at labels I honestly prefer the
model of all the big jars on the like
[SPEAKER_00]: behind behind the register and like you
get to actually like smell all of the all
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud together and it tends to hold a
lot better smell that way is I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: people have really dialed in airtight
packaging as well as they think they have
[SPEAKER_00]: because you most of jars I've ever come
into possession of where that came from a
[SPEAKER_00]: retail store that were you know cellophane
wrapped were really dry when I opened them
[SPEAKER_00]: and they weren't even that old you know
it's I think there's still a lot of work
[SPEAKER_00]: to do to actually make that jar worth it
as well yeah I can remember we would use
[SPEAKER_02]: the big jars that we could put a half
pound in you know you order them they've
[SPEAKER_02]: got the great screw-on lids this is how
we're gonna store our cannabis we first
[SPEAKER_02]: got into it we put it in the vault when we
first started the vault wasn't temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: regulated and so one of our strains I get
in and see it and when I take the lid off
[SPEAKER_02]: you can see what looks like glue from the
kind of padding inside the lid to seal it
[SPEAKER_02]: is on the lid and it started running down
the sides of the jar and we're like oh my
[SPEAKER_02]: god how much of this if we destroyed and
so we go through this panic phase a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit of like we have to get everything out
of these jars if it's glue and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: start looking you realize wait a minute
look at these other lids there's no glue
[SPEAKER_02]: on here where's this coming from and
that's when I got to learn the lesson that
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes don't taste as good as you would
think when you put them on your tongue so
[SPEAKER_02]: I take that lid and I'm like what is that
glue is it oh god no that's and so it was
[SPEAKER_02]: skunk oil yep really cool to see that the
right packaging like that we were actually
[SPEAKER_02]: getting terpenes to wick out of the
product and on the jar was kind of its own
[SPEAKER_02]: cool unique thing but it was once again
another lesson like well perhaps there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: happening there yeah I mean perhaps
there's a better way for it to be stored
[SPEAKER_00]: at the on site to where it's not that's
not a happening that it's not experiencing
[SPEAKER_00]: temperatures that would result in
volatility of those terpenes you know I
[SPEAKER_00]: always see these charts that say this is
the combustion temperature for this
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene and you know people really follow
that but I'm like but what's the like low
[SPEAKER_00]: threshold of volatility of that terpene
when it starts off gassing you know that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something I haven't really seen a lot of
data for combustion temperature is one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing but you know it seems like it would
be nice if you were if you're providing a
[SPEAKER_00]: brand to a dispensary that perhaps you can
decide how your product is stored at that
[SPEAKER_00]: site and you can you know even like
convenience stores you know like a soda
[SPEAKER_00]: company will have their own cooler that
they keep their products in because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: how they want it to be presented you know
I think that model could be interesting as
[SPEAKER_00]: well just mostly just for how the products
actually kept right but like we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about earlier now you start getting into
that like okay I'm building a cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: facility trim dry cure storage my vault
okay my vault needs a temperature store
[SPEAKER_02]: but wait okay beta mercine starts to be
volatile at this temperature and but
[SPEAKER_02]: pining is volatile at this temperature and
I don't want to store them both in the
[SPEAKER_02]: same vault so how many volts how much
space do I need for storage and then where
[SPEAKER_02]: do I draw that line and and then once
again looking at that enzymatic breakdown
[SPEAKER_02]: process compared to the water activity
which ceases mold production and where
[SPEAKER_02]: that window is and how I can affect my
cure rooms and like we're talking about
[SPEAKER_02]: like you start getting into all of this
and figuring out how to design a facility
[SPEAKER_02]: that either can do this at the time which
is really expensive or can be scaled into
[SPEAKER_02]: it without interrupting operations it's
it's intimidating yeah it is but it's also
[SPEAKER_02]: in my tiny man brain crazy fun that's the
fun part if you have the capital to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: that that it's these are the coolest
projects especially at this time in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world and the industry and the society
that we live in like these are really
[SPEAKER_00]: cutting-edge topics it's I just want to
see more of it I want to participate in it
[SPEAKER_02]: and yeah it's really exciting yeah it's
gonna happen one way or another it's just
[SPEAKER_02]: you know there's going to be someone out
there screaming at their television when
[SPEAKER_02]: they see that you know Monsanto or Bayer
or someone of this nature has solved the
[SPEAKER_02]: riddle of curing blah blah blah and
they're like I've been doing that for the
[SPEAKER_02]: last ten years and no one's I can you know
yeah I can see all of the hard work in
[SPEAKER_02]: some aspects potentially being stolen away
from those who were kind of the creators
[SPEAKER_02]: of it by those who have that clout but and
once again and I think we've talked about
[SPEAKER_02]: this before at least I've talked about it
before but that's where the fight is right
[SPEAKER_02]: like you don't just roll over and say well
one day big corporations and big cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: are gonna tear all this apart and none of
us are gonna be left and it's all gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: horrible go be the big corporation don't
become that person and then just behave
[SPEAKER_02]: accordingly yeah exactly it's possible
yeah that's that's this all can come from
[SPEAKER_01]: there so just quickly can you talk about
your approach to drying and curing like
[SPEAKER_01]: what what what humidity and temperatures
are you in the dry phase and for how long
[SPEAKER_02]: and then like how do you approach curing
yeah I mean well so I will preface this by
[SPEAKER_02]: saying I believe that drying and curing
that is an art that I would say is
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely my weakest and it's only
because it's so meticulous and I didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: get the chance when I was at that level of
cultivation to have access to the tools
[SPEAKER_02]: and the knowledge to be able to start
understanding those breakdown processes
[SPEAKER_02]: really appropriately so like most of us
depending on the strain I like to live in
[SPEAKER_02]: that you know 55 to 65 percent humidity
range that slowly ekes down or up but at
[SPEAKER_02]: the smallest increments possible is to not
make drastic changes and to live right
[SPEAKER_02]: around that 60 degree mark 60 to 65
depending on the strain and the density
[SPEAKER_02]: and once again I would say the biggest
thing that at least it's been my
[SPEAKER_02]: experience is when you accidentally over
dry and so oh my god let's throw a bunch
[SPEAKER_02]: of water on the floor because this is all
gonna turn to dust when we trim it those
[SPEAKER_02]: huge fluctuations in temperature and those
huge fluctuations in humidity those are
[SPEAKER_02]: what cost you your terpenes yeah those are
what wind up where you're like great I
[SPEAKER_02]: saved the crop and it has no smell
whatsoever so in saying that you know
[SPEAKER_02]: curing and drying is definitely an art
form and it's it's something that the
[SPEAKER_02]: biggest lesson I think we learned at eco
was as we built the facility out budgetary
[SPEAKER_02]: wise the last thing we addressed was trim
dry cure we didn't have the money to build
[SPEAKER_02]: it in equivalency to how we built our
flower rooms and it was it cost us hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: percent was a it was a mistake and I
wouldn't say was a mistake in the sense of
[SPEAKER_02]: oh we should have put more money here we
just didn't have capital we just didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we got investors and we got a
sale and everything was gonna be perfect
[SPEAKER_02]: and and of course it wasn't but you know
if you're out there cultivating and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at building a facility that's
definitely not where you need to not sink
[SPEAKER_02]: money but that being said well okay if I'm
gonna have a short fall what do I do I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't have an answer for you like you just
can't have a shortfall yeah I think in
[SPEAKER_00]: industry standard ideal is 6060 that's
what most people are shooting for I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: saying I'm around that range I always try
to drive the temperature down as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible without preventing it from drying
I mean you get more terpene preservation
[SPEAKER_00]: at colder temperatures you're less likely
to overdrive just making sure that you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get it so cold like down below 50
degrees where it's just pretty much not
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna dry at all and then if you do want
to run at those temperatures your HVAC
[SPEAKER_00]: costs spikes intensely to actually be able
to to pull moisture out at that
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature is really difficult because
most of our resides you know dry and
[SPEAKER_00]: liquid desiccant systems which are crazy
expensive and not really user-friendly for
[SPEAKER_00]: most people we really rely on just
condensation of these like cold
[SPEAKER_00]: refrigerants to pull moisture out of the
air and they have their limitations
[SPEAKER_00]: there's some mechanisms that are you know
like anti-freeze mechanisms in the
[SPEAKER_00]: compress and the compressors to but they
have these like anti-freeze mechanisms to
[SPEAKER_00]: prevent the machine from locking up and
you know that's an adaptation but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: still just like trying to create all these
like muscles around a basic concept of
[SPEAKER_00]: just a compressor that's moving
refrigerant through some coils and so
[SPEAKER_00]: there's just limitations to what we can
actually do I think that it's I think
[SPEAKER_00]: something that people are opening their
mind up to is drying and curing kind of on
[SPEAKER_00]: the line like and together trying to
create a room that can also be the that
[SPEAKER_00]: can create some sort of curing process as
well where you you can alter your
[SPEAKER_00]: conditions inside that space to prolong
the breakdown of the crop which could be
[SPEAKER_00]: done by you know dropping the temperature
letting the humidity come up just a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit once the products like you know at a
safe level for the for microbial content
[SPEAKER_00]: through water activity level measurement
and yeah just trying to kind of like put
[SPEAKER_00]: those two processes together to where you
can get a pretty decent product it's ready
[SPEAKER_00]: to go into a package without having to
have these separate compartments in your
[SPEAKER_00]: facility and also important you know it's
all linked pre-harvest treatment of your
[SPEAKER_00]: plant has a lot to do with your dry and
cure out results you know how much it was
[SPEAKER_00]: watered what how much nutrients it was
given towards the end of its life if it
[SPEAKER_00]: was like just dumped full of nitrogen it's
the last few days of its life cycle that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be a long cure if it does it's
it's going to take a long time to break
[SPEAKER_00]: all that down all the nitrate levels in
the chlorophyll spike that occurs from
[SPEAKER_00]: feeding a ton of nitrate to a plant
sometimes they just start putting on new
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers and you get these like little
worms fingering what people have tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: different words for calling it where
there's just these little shoots coming
[SPEAKER_00]: off the flowers late cycle that looks like
it's starting all over and it's mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: from nutrients there's other stressors
that'll do it but you know so knowing
[SPEAKER_00]: knowing what to pull out of your root
system and how to kind of like starve out
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant a little bit towards the end
but then again that's really just talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about smokable flower products is that
really necessary when you're when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just doing it for extracts you know what
questions we need answers to yeah it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: good point and once again it's it's just
another one of the list of projects yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: you know like and that that's where that
whole and not only is a list of projects
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's where that whole consumer
education comes in again too so from
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer being the dispensary to consumer
being the consumer but when you do do that
[SPEAKER_02]: research and we have gotten there and okay
we've put in the time and the money we've
[SPEAKER_02]: created a facility and we've done the
research and we know how to cure each
[SPEAKER_02]: strain perfectly for its terpene
preservation and we can keep it on site
[SPEAKER_02]: and cured in this environment for a year
and then we're going to start selling it
[SPEAKER_02]: like fine wine to who yeah because we
haven't nobody's really figured out yet
[SPEAKER_02]: that to come in and find a perfectly cured
super silver haze that is vintage 2017 and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's 286 dollars a gram because it's like
so perfect that that market doesn't exist
[SPEAKER_02]: yet yeah at least not at a large enough
scale so you get to solve both riddles
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah it's it's definitely a small
community that's after that market right
[SPEAKER_02]: now but you know it'll come around yeah
it's on its way just a matter of time so
[SPEAKER_01]: what consumers value versus what you would
like them to value I feel like people you
[SPEAKER_01]: know bag appeal and numbers is kind of
what drives what people pick in the shops
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah I mean so for one I'd like to say
what what consumers value I want consumers
[SPEAKER_02]: to value what makes them happy right if
what makes you happy as a consumer is to
[SPEAKER_02]: get in and your experience takes you you
know 27 seconds out of your day I just
[SPEAKER_02]: want to grab that pack of joints and go I
don't care to know all of this stuff about
[SPEAKER_02]: it it's just I just want that pack of
joints I that's that is great like I want
[SPEAKER_02]: you to just have the experience you want
and be happy with what exists out there so
[SPEAKER_02]: that being said you know I think that it's
our duty as an industry as a whole to just
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure all the information is there you
know if a consumer comes into a dispenser
[SPEAKER_02]: who's looking for you know a wedding gift
that is very unique and they want to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand like is there something like a
three-year-old cured cannabis does it
[SPEAKER_02]: matter like we are reaching that phase
finally where I just want whatever's got
[SPEAKER_02]: the most THC that doesn't it's not quite
as popular anymore in some of the more
[SPEAKER_02]: advanced markets we are starting to see
people who that's not what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: shopping for you don't go to the liquor
store just to buy grain alcohol over and
[SPEAKER_02]: over and over again but that being said
what are we addressing what is the
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer saying I want the highest THC
number well why because I want to be as
[SPEAKER_02]: high as possible well what is as high as
possible like what do you call as high as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible I want to be so high that I can't
get off my couch for an hour versus I want
[SPEAKER_02]: to be so high that I spent an hour looking
for my sunglasses that were on my face
[SPEAKER_02]: those are very very different strains and
they have very little to do with the THC
[SPEAKER_02]: content necessarily so I think that it's
incumbent upon us to start to get that
[SPEAKER_02]: information out there because right now
the industry so new a lot of consumers
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know that that exists and so they
can't want it because they just don't
[SPEAKER_00]: realize it's there sure and you can't
reliably with it without having a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good company providing the product you
can't reliably find that same experience
[SPEAKER_00]: every time you go to the store it's always
a different harvest it's always a
[SPEAKER_00]: different batch it's always a different
brand being carried you know to actually
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to trace what it is that you're
after is difficult you know so it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: every time you go in there you've only got
so many metrics to go off of and often
[SPEAKER_00]: high THC content is something that people
would use is like well they knew something
[SPEAKER_00]: they were what they were doing while they
grew it I mean you came out at 12 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: you probably think there's a good chance
that you messed something up there's not a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people trying to grow a strain
that's supposed to be 12 percent so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just not what they wouldn't think
that that would be marketable to people
[SPEAKER_00]: but that every week and month that goes by
I hear more people telling me yeah I
[SPEAKER_00]: really like finding more balanced strains
and that just kind of work with my
[SPEAKER_00]: physiology a lot better and make me feel
relaxed and you know and a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: just have been feeling anxiety from
different strains and I wonder why that is
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I would just I would want people to
just be much more aware of what's in the
[SPEAKER_00]: product that they're buying and paying
more attention to where it's coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: and being concerned about that and voicing
their opinion about that to people they're
[SPEAKER_00]: buying it from and you know making that be
more known so that they can actually rely
[SPEAKER_00]: on an experience that they're looking for
yeah and it's it's an interesting thing
[SPEAKER_02]: too because you think of it culturally and
it has been my experience that typically
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're looking at a strain that's you
know in the mid to upper 20 percentile of
[SPEAKER_02]: THC and it's really high in beta-mercine
and maybe even a little high in CBN if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're prone to paranoia or anxiety those
tend to do that I've seen that do that to
[SPEAKER_02]: people who are that way it's a lot it's
substantially less often that I hear
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody tell me about a strain that is
you know 22 percent and smelled like like
[SPEAKER_02]: limes that also gave them anxiety and so I
do believe there's a link there in that
[SPEAKER_02]: beta-mercine but that being said it's it's
kind of like I look at it like tequila
[SPEAKER_02]: like when you say tequila culturally here
in the United States people go to one
[SPEAKER_02]: place in their head which is boy I can't
drink tequila it makes me mean or yeah I
[SPEAKER_02]: love tequila it's great but there's
tequila the word tequila and the thought
[SPEAKER_02]: of tequila has it has like a urban culture
amongst the drinkers the drinking crowd
[SPEAKER_02]: where did that come from there isn't I'm
not aware of a scientific study that I
[SPEAKER_02]: read at some point in time that said
tequila accesses your amygdala in a
[SPEAKER_02]: certain way or your limbic system at a
certain so why does tequila make people
[SPEAKER_02]: mean is is it just over time eventually
it's culturally accepted because it
[SPEAKER_02]: happens so much over time when we get to a
place where people go oh yeah beta-mercine
[SPEAKER_02]: no I don't smoke that yeah I don't know I
don't know how that information gets out I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know how that cycles around I can
tell you from my life as a firefighter
[SPEAKER_02]: when we go when we have gone when I have
gone on calls in the past with people who
[SPEAKER_02]: have consumed too much cannabis through
smoking and they're freaking out I will
[SPEAKER_02]: typically once once we can have a
conversation which just the fact that you
[SPEAKER_02]: have an emergency worker present somebody
wearing a badge that has some sympathy
[SPEAKER_02]: tends to calm people down a little bit
until the police show up sorry guys but no
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just kidding but it tends to be when
you talk to them I'll have a discussion
[SPEAKER_02]: about beta-mercine the strains that they
were smoking and it always turns out the
[SPEAKER_02]: same well you know I like to get really
high THC and you know I was smoking
[SPEAKER_02]: gorilla glue I was smoking and not bad
mouthing any of these strains are great
[SPEAKER_02]: strains and just for them they always tend
to point to high beta-mercine strains and
[SPEAKER_02]: every one of them that I've said hey let's
steer away from that maybe steer yourself
[SPEAKER_02]: towards these type of strains I've never
seen that patient again and maybe that's
[SPEAKER_02]: coincidental or maybe not but there's
something to be said I think for the way
[SPEAKER_02]: and that's not for everybody once again
like some people I'm sure experience high
[SPEAKER_02]: anxiety from CBD or anything random it's
all on your own body chemistry but I do
[SPEAKER_02]: think that there are some as we're
starting to get through this I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: there are some norms out there as a whole
that are starting to kind of pop up yes I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess just like people to realize that
there's a tremendous diversity of how
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis can make you feel depending on
the strain that's the chemo type and how
[SPEAKER_00]: it was cultivated how it was dried and
processed and the overall quality of the
[SPEAKER_00]: production process all plays into the end
outcome of how it's going to affect you
[SPEAKER_00]: and it'd be nice for them to pay more
attention to that be looking for that be
[SPEAKER_00]: asking for that and also be able to rely
on that being you know consistent yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah and that's a responsibility on all of
us right we have to create that we have to
[SPEAKER_02]: create the space where when you go by a
gray goose vodka you know what you're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting every time gray goose exists and
and it's sitting next to kettle one it's
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting next to these top shelves of
vodkas and as we all know that it sits in
[SPEAKER_02]: that place it sits at that level and when
you're looking at the HRD and that night
[SPEAKER_02]: train like they all sit as people need
that yeah there's no problem with that the
[SPEAKER_02]: same company could produce both but it's
incumbent upon us as an industry to start
[SPEAKER_02]: creating those lines for the consumer yeah
it'd be really nice for us to get some
[SPEAKER_00]: some hard categories to start putting
strains into it that is going to be quite
[SPEAKER_02]: the argument oh yes we still can't get
over indica sativa so chemo types yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: perhaps maybe maybe but once again that's
a it's a long path of education right yeah
yeah yeah you you
