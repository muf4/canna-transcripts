[SPEAKER_00]: So just to kind of tell you a little bit
about where I come from I know there's
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a few people in the room tonight
that know my story but for those of you
[SPEAKER_00]: who are new I'll give you a little bit of
history on how I got to where we are today
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I want to talk about the future
of pediatric medicine and where I see it
[SPEAKER_00]: going because it's really exciting and
just medicine in general so for those of
[SPEAKER_00]: you who aren't aware of my past and where
this all began about three years ago my
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter was diagnosed with an optic
pathway glioma brain tumor it's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: rare tumor that luckily has about a 90%
survival rate but it has an 85% recurrence
[SPEAKER_00]: rate so even though our child was given a
good life prognosis the journey through
[SPEAKER_00]: her life was to be possibly pretty
difficult the mass majority of these kids
[SPEAKER_00]: end up in chemotherapy for years and years
and years and when you're dealing with a
[SPEAKER_00]: child who's only eight and a half months
old that's a long journey to have to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about because with these tumors it's the
hormones that are constantly surging
[SPEAKER_00]: through their bodies because of these
growth spurts that feed these tumors and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not until they're around the age of
23 to 25 that when the brain stops
[SPEAKER_00]: developing and puberty is over these
tumors stop growing and then she can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of breathe and relax well from eight and a
half months old to 23 that's a long
[SPEAKER_00]: journey that's a lot of worry in your
heart and to think that we are in the 21st
[SPEAKER_00]: century and the only option we have for
these babies is chemotherapy was
[SPEAKER_00]: devastating for my husband and I and we
thought to ourselves there's got to be
[SPEAKER_00]: something more so I'm not even kidding you
guys I probably didn't change my clothes
[SPEAKER_00]: for an entire week I was disgusting I
smelled wretched and my lap was constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: on fire for my laptop because all I did
was sit there and look and research and
[SPEAKER_00]: try and find answers and oddly enough
through Facebook I kept getting all these
[SPEAKER_00]: messages from overseas going you really
need to try cannabis oil with your child
[SPEAKER_00]: and I thought these guys were high as
could be I was like they are stoned out of
[SPEAKER_00]: their mind who would ever give a child
cannabis because this is way before Sanjay
[SPEAKER_00]: Gupta had come out nobody was talking
about this in the press and media and we
[SPEAKER_00]: just completely dismissed it luckily
through the grace of God another chain of
[SPEAKER_00]: events on social media happened and we
were put in touch with Ricky Lake and Abby
[SPEAKER_00]: Epstein who were at the beginning stages
of producing a film that's now titled Weed
[SPEAKER_00]: the People and it's going to be out later
next year and it was about using cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: for pediatric disease and oddly enough one
of the children that helped to inspire
[SPEAKER_00]: this film had the same kind of disease
that my kid had but the little girl's mom
[SPEAKER_00]: had moved to an illegal state and they
disappeared and what's even stranger is
[SPEAKER_00]: that these tumors are so rare that they
only are there only about five percent of
[SPEAKER_00]: all pediatric brain tumors are these OPGs
and for it to be in a child as young as my
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter's it's even rarer so for me to be
introduced to a celebrity through social
[SPEAKER_00]: media and then for the movie to be
inspired by a child with the exact same
[SPEAKER_00]: condition I was like okay this is
serendipity and I knew that I could
[SPEAKER_00]: actually trust these women I knew they
were not the stoner types that were
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting back doing bong rips or hitting
the dab and and that they were of clear
[SPEAKER_00]: mind and that this was really probably
something I need to take a look at so they
[SPEAKER_00]: started surrounding us with research and
science and what I found was incredible I
[SPEAKER_00]: couldn't find anything negative and all I
found was positive so I looked at my
[SPEAKER_00]: husband and I said well maybe this is it
maybe this is why God made our baby sick
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe this is what we're supposed to give
her and maybe just maybe this is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: save her from all the torture this
chemotherapy is going to put her through
[SPEAKER_00]: and maybe this is the path we're supposed
to be on and that was three years ago and
[SPEAKER_00]: here we are today and I'm here to tell you
that my daughter has performed miracle
[SPEAKER_00]: after miracle after miracle in her body
that medical science cannot explain
[SPEAKER_00]: doctors told us that she was gonna for
100% be blind in her left eye and there
[SPEAKER_00]: was absolutely no way to save it her right
eye was gonna be look most more than
[SPEAKER_00]: likely also blind if not grossly
compromised and to prepare ourselves for
[SPEAKER_00]: full blindness today she has near-perfect
vision from what we can tell she may have
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit of color deficiency because
that is the first thing to go when your
[SPEAKER_00]: nerves are being squeezed by a tumor but
she has no problem seeing whatsoever and
[SPEAKER_00]: she was supposed to be living her life in
the dark and when I started seeing miracle
[SPEAKER_00]: after miracle and her body repair in ways
that her body was not supposed to be
[SPEAKER_00]: repaired I knew that this was a secret I
couldn't keep I knew this was something I
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to get loud about and I've never
had a problem getting loud and anybody who
[SPEAKER_00]: knows me can attest to that and I knew
that this was a path that I wanted to be
[SPEAKER_00]: on and I thought to myself what a gift
would this be if this is why my child was
[SPEAKER_00]: sick and something beautiful can actually
come from it because as a parent to a
[SPEAKER_00]: child who has cancer it is one of the most
grueling roads you can possibly imagine
[SPEAKER_00]: especially when you're dealing with a tiny
infant who is throwing up and having
[SPEAKER_00]: horrible diarrhea and can't sleep I mean
my husband and I would have to take turns
[SPEAKER_00]: rotating every night who slept with her
just so at least every other night we
[SPEAKER_00]: could get a good night's rest because the
chemo was hurting her tiny little baby
[SPEAKER_00]: body so much that she couldn't get us more
than an hour or two to sleep and we needed
[SPEAKER_00]: to have hope we needed an answer we needed
something better and this medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: provided that something better my child
has unfortunately had to go through about
[SPEAKER_00]: three years of treatment because these
tumors again keep growing back and growing
[SPEAKER_00]: back every time they try and take her off
the Western medicine but what the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid therapy has done alongside
this treatment has allowed for us to
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly and continually shrink an
unshrinkable tumor every time they take
[SPEAKER_00]: her off treatment if that tumor comes back
we start her back on a new treatment
[SPEAKER_00]: alongside the cannabis and it helps kill
it unlike anything that chemo is supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to do so through this understanding of
this plant and what its capabilities were
[SPEAKER_00]: and through all these connections that I
had found on social media other moms other
[SPEAKER_00]: dads other parents and caregivers who were
experiencing the exact same thing my
[SPEAKER_00]: family was we decided that we had to do
more it wasn't a question of whether or
[SPEAKER_00]: not we wanted to we had to there wasn't a
lot of good oil makers in California there
[SPEAKER_00]: were very few there still aren't a lot out
there there's more today than there was
[SPEAKER_00]: then but back then there was probably two
and only two that I trust in the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: state with my child there wasn't a lot of
really good lab-tested medicine and there
[SPEAKER_00]: was very poor dosing guidance nobody knew
how to dose children my child was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: the very first pediatric patient ever
taken by her oil makers at the time and
[SPEAKER_00]: they had been in business for five or six
years at this point they had only serviced
[SPEAKER_00]: an elderly community so we really were the
guinea pigs my child was the guinea pig
[SPEAKER_00]: but through watching her body and
understanding what her disease was doing
[SPEAKER_00]: and also understanding what the cannabis
was doing we have been able to continually
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust her dosing in order to service her
needs we originally started Sophie out on
[SPEAKER_00]: a two-to-one or a one-to-two you know I've
been told now that you're supposed to put
[SPEAKER_00]: the CBD first THC second even though I was
trained wrong for years so it was a
[SPEAKER_00]: one-to-two and we started her out on that
and then moved to a one-to-one and as
[SPEAKER_00]: these growth spurts kept happening and
happening we're like okay maybe it's time
[SPEAKER_00]: to adjust this dosing and try something
else now she's on a three-to-one higher
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD to THC and a THCA overlay which is a
non psychoactive THCA or THC product for
[SPEAKER_00]: anyone who doesn't know you basically soak
the flour in an olive oil bath over low
[SPEAKER_00]: heat and extract all those terpenes and
cannabinoids and flavonoids out of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and and then you can give that to
the patient and they don't get stoned the
[SPEAKER_00]: reason we went with a higher CBD is
because that can help stop lay down the
[SPEAKER_00]: cells it'll stop it from laying down new
blood flow so we thought to ourselves okay
[SPEAKER_00]: let's not worry so much about shrinking
the tumor because we already kind of have
[SPEAKER_00]: that down let's now stop the growth of the
tumor and that's when we adjust it and
[SPEAKER_00]: that just goes to show that you really
have to look at every patient as an
[SPEAKER_00]: individual now when you're thinking about
treating a disease whether it be an adult
[SPEAKER_00]: or whether it be a child one thing that is
misunderstood by layman's like ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: is that just because you're diagnosed with
pancreatic cancer doesn't mean that the
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations that live within that cancer are
the same as another person that has
[SPEAKER_00]: pancreatic cancer that's the same age race
weight and everything in between they
[SPEAKER_00]: could have different mutations and what
happens when you have these different
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations in your disease you could fail a
chemo that may otherwise work for the
[SPEAKER_00]: other patient and in order to move into a
place with medicine where we are treating
[SPEAKER_00]: a patient from the inside out and not from
the outside in we have to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: personalized medicine approach now here's
the kind of messed up thing is that
[SPEAKER_00]: technology already exists and has existed
for some time but hospitals aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing this my child for example
optic pathway glioma brain tumor she has
[SPEAKER_00]: what's called a BRAF fusion mutation now
there are other children that have BRAF
[SPEAKER_00]: that don't have fusion now if we'd have
known this when we first started out and
[SPEAKER_00]: had they taken Sophie's brain tumor sample
that they resected from her to test her
[SPEAKER_00]: her tumor when she was very little had
they actually genomically sequenced that
[SPEAKER_00]: sample they would have been able to look
at all the different chemotherapies that
[SPEAKER_00]: work for her mutation specifically and
they would have been able to personalize
[SPEAKER_00]: her care therefore we wouldn't have had to
try specific chemotherapies that failed
[SPEAKER_00]: her and have to go through all of the
potential damage that that tumor could
[SPEAKER_00]: have caused so with cannabinoid therapy
what's exciting about what we're doing and
[SPEAKER_00]: where we're going because of how my
daughter's journey has inspired me is
[SPEAKER_00]: we're starting to take that personalized
medicine approach because that's how we
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be treating our bodies on a
genetic level now the hope is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: hospitals are going to get on board with
this it's expensive they have to have more
[SPEAKER_00]: labs you have to take more time with the
patients and it's a cattle call inside
[SPEAKER_00]: these hospitals they treat every patient
the same regardless of what kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: mutations they have based on weight that's
how you get your medicine and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: always a first-line approach if you have
an OPG you start with bencristine
[SPEAKER_00]: carboplatin it does not matter what kind
of mutations you have in your disease even
[SPEAKER_00]: though some mutations aren't going to
respond positively to that that's that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what you get and that's what you're stuck
with with cannabis what we're doing with
[SPEAKER_00]: our research with Israel which is very
very exciting where they can legally study
[SPEAKER_00]: this is they're actually not looking at
okay this is this cancer A and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer B and this is cancer C let's just
throw a bunch of stuff on top of it and
[SPEAKER_00]: see what works they're actually looking at
the mutations inside the cancer like what
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been explaining and they're looking
to find what which combinations of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids terpenoids and flavonoids
which are all the ingredients that make up
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis are responsible for blocking
those mutations in other words Cary if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're driving down the road and you hit a
roadblock and you can't go any further
[SPEAKER_00]: then you can't get to your friend's house
to tell them the gossip you just found out
[SPEAKER_00]: from your boyfriend down the street kind
of the same thing with the brain tumor you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't it can no longer communicate with
itself therefore causing apoptosis and
[SPEAKER_00]: cell or cell suicide so as the research
evolves what we are looking to do within
[SPEAKER_00]: Canakids and you know with our
pharmaceutical partners is to create
[SPEAKER_00]: medicines that are going to be geared at
genetic mutations in patients and also
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at how a patient is actually
metabolizing cannabis and how it's
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolizing the other drugs that are also
going into that patient's body you can be
[SPEAKER_00]: a slow metabolizer a medium metabolizer or
a fast metabolizer and how you metabolize
[SPEAKER_00]: those medications will help to determine
if you need a little bit of cannabis or a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole lot of cannabis or if this opioid is
actually going to cause you more pain and
[SPEAKER_00]: irritation than is actually going to
relieve and really taking that
[SPEAKER_00]: personalized medicine approach one of the
exciting things about what's going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: our industry especially with peas is also
looking at the level of pain these
[SPEAKER_00]: patients are are in and how to stop these
opioids being delved out to patient after
[SPEAKER_00]: patient after patient and as as a mom
who's had to experience what it looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: for a little child to go through these
kinds of excruciating moments it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: something you ever want to see someone
that you love and care go through and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's great about kind of where we are
with cannabis in this day and age is that
[SPEAKER_00]: we know it can't kill you so this approach
to clinical research with within the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis structure is very different than
if you were bringing a pharmaceutical to
[SPEAKER_00]: market normally when you're testing a
pharmaceutical you have to go through all
[SPEAKER_00]: these different phases to find out where's
that level of toxicity where's that kill
[SPEAKER_00]: rate at what point does a patient start to
succumb to the medicine because it's too
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic for their bodies we get to skip that
phase we get to completely go over that
[SPEAKER_00]: because we know that cannabis we can't die
from it now there have been some instances
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been reported where it has
created drug interactions and the other
[SPEAKER_00]: drugs because of the interaction with
cannabis caused serious problems and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why if you're dosing and you're on
a lot of pharmaceuticals you really have
[SPEAKER_00]: to work with someone who understands how
those metabolize in your body in order to
[SPEAKER_00]: get that dose that's going to be right for
you going into clinical trials which is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the things that we're in the
planning phases of right now that pain
[SPEAKER_00]: entry point for hospitals is going to be a
really good easy open door for us to walk
[SPEAKER_00]: through I say easy it's not easy it's very
difficult but it's a good entry point
[SPEAKER_00]: because when you're dealing with let's say
end-of-life pain you know this is a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient that really doesn't have a lot of
hope so we're starting our clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: research through that end-of-life pain
approach or as an adjunct chemotherapy
[SPEAKER_00]: approach because we know these are areas
where we can find relief and hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: save a life and imagine how amazing it
will be to start a trial where you know
[SPEAKER_00]: that not only you're going to help try and
not only you're going to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: alleviate a lot of the pain that this
patient is going to feel but the
[SPEAKER_00]: possibility of actually saving that child
and getting them off of the end-of-life
[SPEAKER_00]: list we have a patient named AJ and when I
was thinking about the kind of trials that
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to do and what would be a good
entry point and what would be easy to pass
[SPEAKER_00]: through these hospitals without fear
because there's a lot of fear that still
[SPEAKER_00]: surrounds cannabis I thought to myself you
know what how do we get in and I thought
[SPEAKER_00]: about AJ and AJ came to us and he had 22
tumors all throughout his bones
[SPEAKER_00]: osteosarcoma they never could get him into
remission this kid had been through so
[SPEAKER_00]: many surgeries he had a cage that at one
point had been built around him to hold
[SPEAKER_00]: him together and he was in so much
excruciating pain he was taking handfuls
[SPEAKER_00]: of opioids every day and literally was
given zero chance to survive so he really
[SPEAKER_00]: came to us and we said okay let's try and
make him as comfortable as possible never
[SPEAKER_00]: in a million years did we think we were
gonna save this boy's life and within 90
[SPEAKER_00]: days of him starting on cannabinoid
therapy with little little more than that
[SPEAKER_00]: to live this kid was cancer-free and not
only was he cancer-free but that was a
[SPEAKER_00]: year and a half ago and he's still
cancer-free today I mean this boy got to
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrate his 18th birthday and go out and
have a big old party his mom took him out
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean really did it up for this boy and
he is alive and breathing and getting to
[SPEAKER_00]: celebrate the holidays with his family
well otherwise he shouldn't be breathing
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is something that we are able to
replicate time and time and time again so
[SPEAKER_00]: what we have decided to do is take all of
these anecdotal patients that we've been
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking for the last year and a half that
we've been in business we've meticulously
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at every single patient age weight
height disease genetic mutations
[SPEAKER_00]: seriousness of the condition life
expectancy pharmaceuticals you know what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of issues are they having and every
time they come into us we track everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that we give them how many milligrams what
ratios like this is the kind of data that
[SPEAKER_00]: we need in order to really kind of figure
out and map anecdotally what these
[SPEAKER_00]: patients need to be given so that when we
go into these hospitals and we have these
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible opportunities to start up
something amazing like this we can hand
[SPEAKER_00]: over our data and see look what we've done
look what we've collected now let us
[SPEAKER_00]: replicate this in a studied environment so
that we can turn this into a
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical the hopes and goals that we
have in front of us are very attainable if
[SPEAKER_00]: the new political movement doesn't stand
in our way which hopefully it won't
[SPEAKER_00]: fingers crossed that we'll continue to
practice medicine the way that we always
[SPEAKER_00]: have but the the the quick quickness of
the point that we're getting to and how
[SPEAKER_00]: fast we're getting there is absolutely
remarkable if you look at where we were
[SPEAKER_00]: just three years ago and you looked at how
patients were being treated and you looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at how they were being dosed and you
jumped three years forward and you look to
[SPEAKER_00]: how that's evolved and how many nurses are
getting involved we get calls from nurses
[SPEAKER_00]: almost every single week wanting to come
in and help us treat patients because they
[SPEAKER_00]: see what this medicine can do not only for
these kids but for these adults how it can
[SPEAKER_00]: save them how it can give them this this
quality of life like Erin was talking
[SPEAKER_00]: about and that's one of the things that we
believe is so powerful about cannabis when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're so sick if you have a quality of
life if you're able to eat if you're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to nourish your body and keep that food
down the ability to actually fight that
[SPEAKER_00]: disease because you become that much more
successful and to be able to see how this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry has emerged and now to see all
these scientists getting on board and
[SPEAKER_00]: these medical doctors stepping up and
saying we want to be a part of this we
[SPEAKER_00]: want to go down this pharmaceutical avenue
with you we want to create these medicines
[SPEAKER_00]: that we know are going to help to
eradicate disease on so many levels it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: very very powerful place to be so for
those of you who have businesses who have
[SPEAKER_00]: a stake in the game whether it be
recreational or medical track your
[SPEAKER_00]: patients data be able to analyze that on a
daily basis look for the trends because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're there I mean we've got leukemia
patients that we have seen one after the
[SPEAKER_00]: other with these incredible incredible
miraculous recoveries we have one little
[SPEAKER_00]: girl named Aria and she I love this family
so much she goes to Children's Hospital
[SPEAKER_00]: with my little girl and when I first met
her and her family she was so sick this
[SPEAKER_00]: child was skin and bones she had lost
about I think it was between 10 and 15
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds and she was little she was like
five six years old had a feeding tube in
[SPEAKER_00]: was was bedridden was an unable to walk
she completely lost ability to walk had
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped smiling and just wasn't she wasn't
alive she was just laying there in front
[SPEAKER_00]: of me dying and I'll never forget I took
the medicine to the hospital we donated
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine to their family and I sat there
and I helped administer that little girl's
[SPEAKER_00]: first dose and it wasn't but probably four
hours later the text message started and I
[SPEAKER_00]: start hearing from a mom and this little
girl who has hasn't had a plate of food in
[SPEAKER_00]: three months is asking for chicken tenders
and wanting french fries mommy I'm hungry
[SPEAKER_00]: and and can you order me some food mommy
and this little girl had literally you
[SPEAKER_00]: guys not eaten in almost three months had
been being fed this terrible terrible
[SPEAKER_00]: feeds that that are not very nutritious
and that was all she was surviving on and
[SPEAKER_00]: then the next text messages I started to
get was she's sitting up Tracy she's
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting up and she's wanting to play she's
wanting to do arts and crafts with me she
[SPEAKER_00]: smiled at me for the first time she looked
at me and said mommy I love you for the
[SPEAKER_00]: first time in months and this is a single
mom doing it all by herself and then a few
[SPEAKER_00]: days later I start getting more text
messages Tracy she's wanting to walk again
[SPEAKER_00]: she's trying to get out of bed she wants
to walk again she's eating she's already
[SPEAKER_00]: put on a little bit of weight just in the
last few days they're talking about taking
[SPEAKER_00]: the feeding tube out and this is on low
doses of cannabis you guys I mean this was
[SPEAKER_00]: three days in tiny tiny low doses of
cannabis within two months this little
[SPEAKER_00]: girl had put on eight pounds the feeding
tube was gone she had totally figured out
[SPEAKER_00]: how to walk again and was back in school
playing with her friends enjoying life
[SPEAKER_00]: rosy cheeks hairs growing back it's no
longer falling out and we have seen this
[SPEAKER_00]: in child after child after child and
because of patients like Aria and because
[SPEAKER_00]: of looking at her dosing meticulously and
and having their parents allow us to speak
[SPEAKER_00]: about them and and use that information to
further this research the lives that are
[SPEAKER_00]: being saved are plentiful so for anybody
here who's wondering what do I do do I how
[SPEAKER_00]: do I get into cannabis what path do I go
down I can tell you that the medical path
[SPEAKER_00]: is one that is so rewarding and fills you
with so much joy I always get around with
[SPEAKER_00]: my friends that I have to shave my legs a
lot because I always have the chills my
[SPEAKER_00]: hairs growing it is really the most
rewarding thing that I've ever ever ever
[SPEAKER_00]: could have imagined in a million years and
to watch my little girl today after all
[SPEAKER_00]: the hurdles that she's been through and
after ever everything that she's gone
[SPEAKER_00]: through from brain surgery to nine blood
transfusions got probably around 17 MRIs
[SPEAKER_00]: numerous hospital stays staph infection I
mean the list goes on and on what her body
[SPEAKER_00]: has gone through but then also look at
this list of positives she's never had
[SPEAKER_00]: neuropathy she's never lost her hair since
the first time she started getting chemo
[SPEAKER_00]: when she was a little girl she's always
had a full head of hair she's always
[SPEAKER_00]: maintained weight her tumor that wasn't
supposed to shrink keep shrinking she runs
[SPEAKER_00]: plays laughs developing beautifully and
has this beautiful full life and to know
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis gave that to her and through
her all these other people are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: helped and saved it's a really wonderful
wonderful industry to be in it's so
[SPEAKER_00]: fulfilling to be a part of this and to
know that we're just at the beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: we're at the beginning where we are today
and where we're gonna be in 12 months and
[SPEAKER_00]: then in 24 months and then 36 months I
can't even imagine because if you'd asked
[SPEAKER_00]: me where we're gonna be a year and a half
ago I would have never imagined that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would be up on this stage I would never
have imagined that we would have treated
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 500 patients in a year and a half
time and we've barely done any marketing I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean literally the word of mouth power of
this medicine when you save one hundreds
[SPEAKER_00]: come and has really been incredible and
for these children and because this
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine is so expensive I want to invite
all of you as the close to my speech to
[SPEAKER_00]: join us this Wednesday night we have my
husband back there in the corner he's got
[SPEAKER_00]: information we're having an event called
raising monies with funnies every year
[SPEAKER_00]: well this is the second year we've we've
done this event we have a list comedians
[SPEAKER_00]: that come John Cleese's daughter Camilla
Cleese is our our our our gonna be our
[SPEAKER_00]: hostess for the night this woman is
hilarious this is definitely an adult
[SPEAKER_00]: party there will be no kids there and
they'll be a lot of dirty jokes being
[SPEAKER_00]: thrown around we're gonna have a raffle in
a silent auction it's ugly sweater themed
[SPEAKER_00]: you can get a discount for being here at
women grow tonight and bring a toy bring a
[SPEAKER_00]: toy you get 50% off your ticket we're
gonna give a hundred percent of that money
[SPEAKER_00]: to our kids this season we're gonna try
and pay for all of their cannabis oil and
[SPEAKER_00]: give them gifts to supplement their toys
so that can alleviate some of this stress
[SPEAKER_00]: from their families give back and if you
if you don't want to give back to us find
[SPEAKER_00]: someone else to give back to this medicine
is expensive but it's life-saving and it
[SPEAKER_00]: feels good it feels good to do good and
when you do good good things happen so
[SPEAKER_00]: take that with you tonight around the
holiday season remember those of us who
[SPEAKER_00]: are less fortunate who've had a really
hard time who maybe can't you know they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a lot of nickels to rub
together and they really need that the
[SPEAKER_00]: healing power of this medicine go out and
help somebody donate your time you know go
[SPEAKER_00]: and feed the feed the hungry help the sick
volunteer at Children's Hospital or at
[SPEAKER_00]: Kaiser Hospital donate toys somewhere do
something and let's keep this this
[SPEAKER_00]: momentum going let's keep cannabis alive
and I implore you to all use your voice
[SPEAKER_00]: and use your hearts and sing the praises
of this medicine and let's get this
[SPEAKER_02]: legalized once and for all thank you hi my
name is Shane and I applaud you and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything you're doing first of all but
have you noticed anything about the
[SPEAKER_02]: difference between a child's reaction to
the cannabis medicinal portions as opposed
[SPEAKER_02]: to an adult who has the same situation I
have actually one of the things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: find very interesting about children and
anytime anyone asked me how much medicine
[SPEAKER_00]: my child is on and they don't really
understand dosing for kids their eyes
[SPEAKER_00]: about pop out of their head they're like
oh my god you give your kid how much
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine what we have found is that pound
per pound children actually need more
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine and we have two schools of
thought one school of thought is that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have an immature endocannabinoid system
because as you know a child is developing
[SPEAKER_00]: and their body isn't fully formed until
they're finished with puberty and then
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's done growing so we believe
that in order to stimulate their
[SPEAKER_00]: endocannabinoid system they actually need
more medicine to get it going because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: immature the other thing that we believe
is that they have such a fast metabolism
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody who's ever tried to keep up with a
toddler step-for-step it's impossible and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're always going and they're always
talking they're always running and playing
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're burning through so many
calories my husband I always laugh because
[SPEAKER_00]: we joke our daughter literally eats more
than we do but she's skinny as a rail all
[SPEAKER_00]: the time so we really believe that it's
those two factors that cause children to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually need higher dosing the other
thing is pediatric diseases are much
[SPEAKER_00]: different than adult diseases for the most
part now you're gonna have like
[SPEAKER_00]: glioblastoma multiform which is a very
deadly brain tumor those are very similar
[SPEAKER_00]: in children and adults they're the same
kind of genetic makeup for the tumor so
[SPEAKER_00]: the dosing is very similar but again the
child may end up taking just as much
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine as the adult does and it really
varies across the board some kids
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on how they're metabolizing
their medicine as adults as well some kids
[SPEAKER_00]: actually need a little bit less medicine
than maybe a child their same age and same
[SPEAKER_00]: weight because of how they metabolize
things again going back to that
[SPEAKER_00]: personalized medicine some of the testing
that's going to be available that's coming
[SPEAKER_00]: online and a few labs have it available
others are coming online this year is
[SPEAKER_00]: you're actually going to be able to do a
saliva and blood test to look and see how
[SPEAKER_00]: much cannabis is actually concentrating in
the blood and some of the R&D studies that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to be doing when we we're
doing our trials is looking at just this
[SPEAKER_00]: and understanding the metabolization rate
of cannabis going into different patients
[SPEAKER_00]: and why you know one might need a little
bit more than the other yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: hi did you guys do any testing to see
whether your daughter responded or any
[SPEAKER_04]: other children responded to sublingual
administered medicine as opposed to just
[SPEAKER_00]: orally swallowing it well the thing is
with little ones it's very very hard to
[SPEAKER_00]: get them to hold cannabis in their mouth
they're just not going to do it my
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter started cannabis when she was
nine months old so we would rub it on her
[SPEAKER_00]: gums or put it on her pacifier when we
were really just first starting out now we
[SPEAKER_00]: give it to her in a one ml syringe and and
it's with a mct carrier oil or or a
[SPEAKER_00]: fractionated coconut oil again she's still
too little to get her to hold it in her
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth we are coming out with a new thin
film pretty soon that goes into the buckle
[SPEAKER_00]: cavity of the jaw and it's going to go
into the jaw you just pop it up in between
[SPEAKER_00]: your gum and cheek this actually goes in
through the mucosal lining and bypasses
[SPEAKER_00]: the liver and what we have seen in some of
the R&D studies with that is that it
[SPEAKER_00]: actually increases the half-life by about
three to four hours and the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: actual active ingredient that gets into
your bloodstream is around 75 percent
[SPEAKER_00]: versus 25 to 30 percent when you're going
first past liver so because of these types
[SPEAKER_00]: of studies that haven't been done on
cannabis but have been done on other
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals through our pharmaceutical
partner we do know that the buckle cavity
[SPEAKER_00]: is one of the best delivery methods one of
the other delivery methods that I that I
[SPEAKER_00]: do believe can be really good but I do
caution people about that are
[SPEAKER_00]: immunocompromised is rectal because when
you go rectally that bypasses a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: psychoactivity keeps you from getting high
but you also have to worry about
[SPEAKER_00]: introducing infection which can onset
sepsis which can kill you essentially now
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't heard of anyone getting sepsis
from a rectal suppository but I have heard
[SPEAKER_00]: of people with brain tumors it's failing I
know that it works really well the branch
[SPEAKER_00]: breast cancer and the absorption through
the rectum can be a lot higher than going
[SPEAKER_04]: first past liver as well just one more
thing sure did you play with any strain
[SPEAKER_04]: specifics or did you find that one strain
work better than the other not with my
[SPEAKER_00]: daughter and I'll tell you why I don't
have that data yet and then I'll tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: how I'm getting that data with Sophie the
problem with cancer is that your scans are
[SPEAKER_00]: every two and a half months and in that
two and a half months you may change
[SPEAKER_00]: strains a couple of times now with can of
kids what we do is we co2 extract our oil
[SPEAKER_00]: or it's like a supercritical
pressurization and it ends up stripping a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the terpenes out anyway so we intro
reintroduce our terpenes back in after we
[SPEAKER_00]: have done the co2 extraction so we have
the same blends time after time and those
[SPEAKER_00]: blends in our THC or chemotherapeutic
anti-tumoral anti-anxiety and appetite
[SPEAKER_00]: stimulating with our CBD it's an AC DC
blend because we know that works really
[SPEAKER_00]: well for seizures and it's also very good
for cancer so with Sophie you know I've
[SPEAKER_00]: kept her on those same strains are those
same blends if you will for really long
[SPEAKER_00]: time and they've continued to be
successful people have said oh you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: change it you got to change it that's not
actually the case what we're seeing in
[SPEAKER_00]: Israel is that one strain that kills
pancreatic cancer by a hundred percent may
[SPEAKER_00]: only kill breast cancer by fifteen percent
so it is very strain specific and it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: even strain specific it's a recipe within
that strain so part of the research that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing now is to look at what are the
percentages of cannabinoids terpenoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoids in that medicine that are
responsible and and that could be anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: from three to twelve not a hundred and
sixteen to a hundred and twenty two
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids or over four hundred
flavonoids it's not all of it that's
[SPEAKER_00]: creating this synergistic effect what I
have done to help my daughter is in April
[SPEAKER_00]: of this year I hand delivered her brain
tumor sample to Israel she has already had
[SPEAKER_00]: her brain tumor genomically sequenced we
are working on for helping them to forward
[SPEAKER_00]: their research there financially once that
happens and the contracts are done the
[SPEAKER_00]: checks are written my daughter is gonna be
the first pediatric patient in the world
[SPEAKER_00]: that I know of that's gonna have
cannabinoid sensitivity tested on her
[SPEAKER_00]: exact sample so that's where I'm going how
I'm trying to fix that
[SPEAKER_01]: okay so you brought up an interesting
point Tracy about taking it through the
[SPEAKER_01]: buckle of there and it bypasses the liver
what about somebody that has liver
[SPEAKER_01]: condition is it better than to take it
sublingually or the or is that even being
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at it's wait is okay so working
that's a good question now cannabis can
[SPEAKER_00]: help repair the liver and we know this
because a lot of people who have severe
[SPEAKER_00]: liver diseases have found a lot of healing
properties using cannabis through that
[SPEAKER_00]: administration if I had a patient that had
a liver condition but really wanted to get
[SPEAKER_00]: as much of those actives into the body
using a strip I'd probably rotate them
[SPEAKER_00]: honestly that would be my recommendation
and these like I said we don't have these
[SPEAKER_00]: strips out yet there they've been
developed we it's just about rolling them
[SPEAKER_00]: out to the market because it's expensive
to roll out a new product but I would I
[SPEAKER_00]: would do both honestly because it can like
cirrhosis of the liver for example I've
[SPEAKER_00]: heard a full reversal in cirrhosis of the
liver and it can be very very healing and
[SPEAKER_00]: also you know when you're dealing with
chemotherapy there's a lot of toxicity
[SPEAKER_00]: that happens within the liver so if that's
a patient that is having a lot of those
[SPEAKER_00]: issues I do I'd switch them out because
the great thing about going through the
[SPEAKER_00]: buckle is that you need a lot less
medicine so then the medicine becomes a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot more cost-effective and that's one of
the real problems and challenges that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have right now is affording this medicine
one of the reasons I created candy kids is
[SPEAKER_00]: because I could only afford to give her
that much medicine for so much longer
[SPEAKER_00]: without you know having my own available
so I didn't actually have to pay for it
[SPEAKER_00]: the company would pay for it so I would
rotate them in those in those situations
[SPEAKER_00]: really try and kill the cancer and get as
many actives as you can and then low dose
[SPEAKER_03]: for the liver thank you so Tracy I'm gonna
just ask you one last question you stay
[SPEAKER_03]: right there so you do sound like a doctor
thank you and what I mean by that is what
[SPEAKER_03]: do new parents who discovered that their
child is sick how do they go about
[SPEAKER_03]: learning about this stuff what is sort of
their first step okay well first of all I
[SPEAKER_00]: call myself a momcologist just so
everybody knows that's why we built saving
[SPEAKER_00]: sophie.org which I really didn't touch on
that much tonight I really wanted to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about more the future of medicine one of
the biggest problems that my husband and I
[SPEAKER_00]: had when Sophie was first diagnosed was
finding quality information that I could
[SPEAKER_00]: trust and there were so many articles and
so much out there trying to digest that
[SPEAKER_00]: while trying to digest the fact that your
loved one had just been diagnosed was very
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult so if you go to saving sophie
.org we have built this incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: resource center that has eight different
categories we have one section called
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis studies there's probably close to
around 90 articles in there now we have
[SPEAKER_00]: summarized those articles to make them
easier to consume with a link to the full
[SPEAKER_00]: article where you can go and look at all
the research that's disease specific it
[SPEAKER_00]: talks about the endocannabinoid system
talks about various breast cancers brain
[SPEAKER_00]: tumors the future of of you know research
and it's all searchable we also have seven
[SPEAKER_00]: other sections that include cancer
definitions fundraising advice different
[SPEAKER_00]: charities if you need money and and you
don't know how to fundraiser you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: good at it you want people to give you
free money holistic approaches diet
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrition all of those different things
that we use to save sophie so if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: just getting started go to our website and
we have taken a lot of those that heavy
[SPEAKER_00]: lifting away for you and we're adding new
articles every week that's great all right
[SPEAKER_03]: so I'm gonna let Tracy go off and if you
guys want to talk to her afterwards I know
[SPEAKER_03]: she's gonna be available but please let's
give a round of applause for Tracy Ryan
[SPEAKER_03]: thank you you you you you
