[SPEAKER_00]: I'm 53 years old and in May of 2017 I was
diagnosed with uterine cancer stage 4b.
[SPEAKER_00]: So about as close to the last degree that
you would want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was sent into shock and numbness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fear all at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there was a strong immediate
feeling of wait I haven't done everything
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do in my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I haven't touched as many people or
experienced as many things as I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't have this stop now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not ready for this to stop now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably anybody who's been in my
shoes feels the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Immediately it's an incredible shock to
the system that you may be checking out
[SPEAKER_00]: sooner than you wanted to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went into panic and I also went into
research also at the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started looking for help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I didn't know where to go aside from I
had an oncologist at that point saying he
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted me to start my chemo treatment
before surgery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that the tumors could be reduced as
soon as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I discovered through this wonderful
book by Dr. Kathleen Turner called Radical
[SPEAKER_00]: Remissions which was sent to me by a
friend who learned that I had just gotten
[SPEAKER_00]: this diagnosis of a woman named Dale
Figtree who had helped herself cured
[SPEAKER_00]: herself through nutrition after she had
been sent you know through chemo and
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation 30 plus years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she shared stories when I reached out
to her she's still in practice in Santa
[SPEAKER_00]: Barbara of her clients and how well
they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that she recommended
I do was check out California providers
[SPEAKER_00]: and get myself doing CBD oil while I'm
going to go through treatments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said it was well vetted by her and
it's the only recommendation that she
[SPEAKER_00]: would make for that type of medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think all of us in this position
you're overwhelmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are coming at you from all
different directions telling you what they
[SPEAKER_00]: think you should do or you shouldn't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of my friends didn't want me to do
the chemo.
[SPEAKER_00]: My family wanted me to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it got difficult to know what was the
truth for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And having Dale Figtree be the first point
of reference that felt like somebody I
[SPEAKER_00]: could relate to and I could trust.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just decided to go with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I also because the diagnosis happened
and then the opportunity to start chemo
[SPEAKER_00]: happened so close to that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was only three days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Myself and my family had no time to
prepare for what I was about to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everyone was leaving town.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Memorial Day weekend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Konechny said somebody needs to be
with Hillary observing her because who
[SPEAKER_00]: knows how she'll respond to this chemo
treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I called you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reached out to California providers when
I first came home from that first round of
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was in quite a bit of pain but it
was a pain unlike any that I had known
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like my bones were in pain like a
fever that just wouldn't break.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically they say that you don't
experience that unless you're given a
[SPEAKER_00]: white blood cell boost shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I did have pain in my bones and it was
non-ceasing pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you sent Patrick the C2B-D oil and
the cannabis oil, shipped it overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a friend had given me some cannabis,
edible cannabis that I took with me for my
[SPEAKER_00]: first round of chemo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which really helped me relax because I was
quite anxious as anybody going through
[SPEAKER_00]: this experience is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet I was so grateful to be informed
that when you're using products that can
[SPEAKER_00]: come from any number of places they may
not have the same stringent quality
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there might be pesticides or residue
or petroleum emulsifiers which is also why
[SPEAKER_00]: Dale Victory said you were the only
reference that she would feel comfortable
[SPEAKER_00]: giving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it felt good to know that I was taking
in something that was not aggravating an
[SPEAKER_00]: already toxic overload to my system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a lot to ask of that medicine
even to help that first round of chemo was
[SPEAKER_00]: quite strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't get sick the entire time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was through that first round.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no nausea and I was told I would
have incredible nausea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also was relieved that although
nothing sounded appealing I was hungry by
[SPEAKER_00]: three in the afternoon each day and needed
food.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt I needed food not intellectually
but physically.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was able to eat the food that
people were bringing to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was able to sleep because I was
tired from both what I was going through
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think the assistance of the cannabis
oil was helping me have sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would also share that right when I
started the treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: My doctor Dr. Godfrey Konechny who's an
incredible oncologist was very receptive
[SPEAKER_00]: when I informed him I'm going to try
taking cannabis oil and CBD oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been told that it might be beneficial
and he said absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: He left the room and came back with a
script for that prescription without
[SPEAKER_00]: hesitation and without judgment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said he'd had enough other patients
mentioning it to him that he was open to
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing you know if this will help
absolutely try it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having the blessing of my oncologist
for that was very helpful as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't feel guilty or anxious about
counter indicating what I was doing from
[SPEAKER_00]: the Western standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as that first round waned off in its
side effects it took about four or five
[SPEAKER_00]: days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would attribute the CBD oil with helping
me also have less fear about this road I
[SPEAKER_00]: was starting on because I knew I had five
more rounds ahead of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew that my hair was going to fall out
shortly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was unclear how well I would do through
this experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: My prognosis was not great at the time and
the level of ease with which I was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: live out those first five days after the
first round of treatment surprised me and
[SPEAKER_00]: surprised my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was able to be somewhat released
from an overwhelming sense of doom and
[SPEAKER_00]: fear because my anxiety never got sort of
the better of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was told to take Advil for the pain
that was happening in the bones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I tried to balance that with the Advil
and the CBD oil by day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it didn't touch it and I didn't like
the idea of taking the Advil because my
[SPEAKER_00]: liver was already taking such a hit from
the chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started utilizing the cannabis oil
which was specified for evening only
[SPEAKER_00]: during the day when the symptoms were
really acute.
[SPEAKER_00]: The higher THC level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it really helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taking the higher THC level during those
four or five days where you've just come
[SPEAKER_00]: home from your round of chemo as opposed
to just taking the CBD oil in the day
[SPEAKER_00]: really helped mitigate the pain and it did
intensify the munchies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was experiencing some symptoms of
being high or being stoned as it said in
[SPEAKER_00]: common vernacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of judging that or being
anxious about that I allowed myself to
[SPEAKER_00]: just accept it and surrender to it because
I knew that this medicine being natural
[SPEAKER_00]: was going to have no negative side effects
on my body and therefore I didn't need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be worried about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just needed to allow myself to use
whatever I had available to me to help me
[SPEAKER_00]: get through without tensing my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: As my sister who is a nurse said,
Hillary you need to do whatever you can
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're in pain to help ease the pain
because otherwise you're adding more
[SPEAKER_00]: cortisol to your system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the blessings of even my family
and friends I continued to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: medication, the cannabis oil and the CBD
oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the intensity of the chemo rounds
left by the end of the first week I had
[SPEAKER_00]: two more weeks to start rebuilding myself
until the next round.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I was okay to just resume using
the CBD oil by day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really helped with still keeping an
appetite because as anyone going through
[SPEAKER_00]: chemo knows you lose your appetite and you
become very finicky about what sounds
[SPEAKER_00]: good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the finicky wasn't really ever able to
be overridden.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was difficult to know what I was going
to be hungry for in any given moment and
[SPEAKER_00]: something could sound really good and my
friend could bring it to me and then I'd
[SPEAKER_00]: look at it and I'd think I can't do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the hunger was always there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for sure by two in the afternoon
thanks to the CBD oil I had a very strong
[SPEAKER_00]: appetite and so I was able to put weight
back on within a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went from 127 down to 117 by the time I
started my first treatment from the way
[SPEAKER_00]: the cancer was taking the muscle tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within a month's time with the CBD oil
and the acupuncture and the supplements
[SPEAKER_00]: and the protein powder I was back to 125,
126.
[SPEAKER_00]: So feeling my body weight come back and
feeling my lack of anxiousness really
[SPEAKER_00]: helped my mindset feel like I actually am
going to survive this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once I had that thought and I felt my
body resoundingly support that thought I
[SPEAKER_00]: think I held on to that and that's what
got me through the next five rounds is
[SPEAKER_00]: just trusting that I am going to get
through this and that there's something
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from my going through this that I'm
going to be able to pass forward to others
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's going to open me up to a new life
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was taking the CBD oil not in a
tincture during the day but thankfully you
[SPEAKER_00]: sent it to me in capsules already measured
so I didn't have to guess at what I
[SPEAKER_00]: needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You also sent me the cannabis oil to take
at night in three different gradients of
[SPEAKER_00]: strength to build up slowly and a tincture
if I ever needed to add a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by day I would take the capsule of the
CBD oil titled Sunrise which was very
[SPEAKER_00]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes you need it spelled out for you
and then just before going to bed I would
[SPEAKER_00]: take the cannabis oil but this was that
was the regiment in the two weeks prior I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean the two weeks after my first round of
chemo or second or third or fourth but
[SPEAKER_00]: during the first week after any round of
chemo I was often taking the cannabis oil
[SPEAKER_00]: in the day as well to help with the pain
that I would experience in my bones from
[SPEAKER_00]: the chemo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the CBD oil I would take in the morning
sort of religiously and then I would take
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis oil often in that first week
coming home from chemo around 12 or 1
[SPEAKER_00]: after I'd gotten some food in my system.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just to be clear there were three oils.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunrise is a 3 to 1 oil and that's
predominantly a raw oil so it's THCA and
[SPEAKER_02]: CBDA.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBDA is the first number that's the three
and the THCA is the second number that's
[SPEAKER_02]: the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're all cannabis oils but one of
them is a 3 to 1 raw oil that's the
[SPEAKER_02]: Sunrise.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one is the Anytime which is the
Tincture which is a 20 to 1 oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then the third one is called Relief and
that's a 1 to 3 oil so that means that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's 1 CBD to 3 THC so that's the
nighttime oil.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Relief is generally the nighttime
oil even though you found it effective
[SPEAKER_02]: during the daytime immediately following
the chemotherapy and then you found the 3
[SPEAKER_02]: to 1 oil to be effective through
throughout the course of your
[SPEAKER_02]: chemotherapy.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found the 3 to 1 oil to be beneficial
every day throughout the chemotherapy
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the six months and then I found
the evening oils, the relief oils that I
[SPEAKER_00]: would take before bed to be very
beneficial during acute pain in the
[SPEAKER_00]: daytime which was usually just for about
the first four or five days once I was
[SPEAKER_00]: home and then I would just resume taking
the relief oil in the evenings starting
[SPEAKER_00]: with 12.5 milligrams through a whole
bottle and then graduating up to 25
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started noticing that I was having much
easier time of going through the chemo
[SPEAKER_00]: than others in the infusion rooms when I
would show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew that there were multiple prongs
of things that I was doing as I said I was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing nutrition sort of a ketogenic diet
more so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing intermittent fasting right
before my chemo and just drinking
[SPEAKER_00]: vegetable broth during chemo.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was doing acupuncture and I was doing
the cannabis oil and the CBD oil and I
[SPEAKER_00]: would start to have conversations with the
infusion nurses and they started sharing
[SPEAKER_00]: with me that they were curious because
they were seeing how well I was doing and
[SPEAKER_00]: how my body weight looked and how my
temperament was and my appetite.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I started sharing my experience and
what I knew and my resources with some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the other patients on the floor with me
who were open to it and receptive to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of them didn't know where to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: To find cannabis oil or CBD oil and they
were intimidated to just go to a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary down the street or friends
would bring them buy things or bake things
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it felt so good to be able to tell
them of a product that was created by a
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer stem cell researcher and where it
was absolutely imperative that all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: ingredients were clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it was emulsified with an organic
ingredient and that it was set up from the
[SPEAKER_00]: standpoint of being interviewed by you and
learning what my experience was what my
[SPEAKER_00]: needs were and then getting sort of a
customized treatment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That made such sense to me and it made me
feel so good that I wanted everyone who
[SPEAKER_00]: was going through this situation as I was
to have that benefit as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again I felt lucky because my
oncologist did not have a stigma or
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance to me doing this medicine and
neither did my family or my friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I started to get a little bit on my
soapbox because other people who thought
[SPEAKER_00]: it was okay just to smoke wherever they
got something or who were just offered it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really wanted them to understand that
they might be taking something into their
[SPEAKER_00]: body that may have pesticides or
herbicides on it and that it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: important that they really get access to a
safe source of the cabinoids of the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that smoking was not an option
for me is the cancer had metastasized to
[SPEAKER_00]: my lungs and to my liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the idea of putting smoke into my
lungs felt completely wrong and I know
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's hard on your lungs regardless if
you have tumors in them or not that hot
[SPEAKER_00]: dry smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was relieved to also be able to have
it be edible for that sake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know that I didn't have to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was only five or six years ago that a
dear friend of mine who went through an
[SPEAKER_00]: ovarian cancer experience didn't have
access to safe cannabis and just smoked
[SPEAKER_00]: what her friends brought for her on
occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: She felt a lot of relief and the two of us
from the symptoms as you were saying and
[SPEAKER_00]: she didn't have metastases in her lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as whether or not it was
actually helping mitigate her cancer or
[SPEAKER_00]: halt the growth or the spread,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But both of us commiserated and said,
I don't know how anybody got through this
[SPEAKER_00]: without the cannabis assistance because
it's I think the reason I can safely say
[SPEAKER_00]: that others either fell off their
conviction of surviving the treatments or
[SPEAKER_00]: gave up is because it's so hard to be sick
to your stomach and feel wretched and lose
[SPEAKER_00]: your hair and lose your muscle and lose
your eyelashes and your eyebrows and your
[SPEAKER_00]: confidence and not have a day where that
isn't the case.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have something like the
cannabis oil, staving off the nausea so
[SPEAKER_00]: that you can eat so that your body can
stay stronger and your building muscle
[SPEAKER_00]: again and your feelings of despair are
also softly absolved because you're not in
[SPEAKER_00]: a state of fight or flight or fear
continuously because you're more relaxed
[SPEAKER_00]: as a result of the cannabis oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have moments where you can have
perspective and you can realize,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are cases of people who survived
stage four cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a death sentence any longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of those factors are why I feel so
strongly about giving this testimonial
[SPEAKER_00]: because my prognosis five years ago
probably would have been we're just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to try to give you some quality of life
for however long you can get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But both the Western cancer treatments
have come so far luckily for me and the
[SPEAKER_00]: integrative approach with Eastern and
Western medicines have become more
[SPEAKER_00]: acceptable that it no longer is a death
sentence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instead, it's maybe a rebirth really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that the nutrition,
the meditation, the acupuncture,
[SPEAKER_00]: the supportive oncologist and the cannabis
oil all played a part in why I'm doing as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as I am right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a 95% response to the chemo in 99%
shrinkage to the only tumor that still
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be seen on my lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know if it's dead cell or a tumor
marker.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my CA 125 markers last week are down
to six.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they started at 232.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just, I'm going to keep going and I'm
going to keep using the CBD morning
[SPEAKER_00]: sunrise oil to work on the inflammation,
which is happening now as a result of the
[SPEAKER_00]: immune therapy that I've now started.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'll continue to do the relief
oil in the evenings to try to approach
[SPEAKER_00]: supporting my immune system and halting
the development of the cancer spread.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have started taking immune therapy as
my next tier of this regimen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a new, relatively new in the
oncology world medicine that in effect
[SPEAKER_00]: goes in and helps your T cells register
that the cancer cells that they might be
[SPEAKER_00]: finding are in fact cancer cells that need
to be eradicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holds them together like a staple in
effect so that your T cell stays attached
[SPEAKER_00]: long enough to then do its business and
take care of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The side effects, which aren't nearly like
chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't lose your hair.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have nausea.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to the Western medicine world,
it seems like you don't really have side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects, but in fact, I've been
experiencing a lot of inflammation and
[SPEAKER_00]: arthritic symptoms in my joints and if I
compound and go running or stretching too
[SPEAKER_00]: enthusiastically, I've actually incurred
injury and then the injury is very slow to
[SPEAKER_00]: heal because of the inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the anecdote to the Western world is
take a leave or take some oxycodone when
[SPEAKER_00]: you first experience these symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I herniated my back just recently and
the side effects of the immune therapy
[SPEAKER_00]: creating this hyper inflammation in my
body, it's become very challenging to heal
[SPEAKER_00]: the herniation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taking longer and it's painful
because of the hyper inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been utilizing the relief oil by
day as opposed to the oxycodone because
[SPEAKER_00]: the oxycodone not only did I notice after
taking it three nights in a row that I
[SPEAKER_00]: felt worse in the daytime emotionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I also didn't like the idea that I was
taking something that I was potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: going to get physiologically addicted to
and I didn't like the sleep that came from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were weird dreams and it was a bit
restless once I'd wake up around three or
[SPEAKER_00]: four in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I decided to not use the oxycodone any
longer and I resumed taking the evening
[SPEAKER_00]: prescription of the cabonoid cannabis oil,
the relief, by day to help with the pain
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's helped.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm still having to do the physical
therapy to heal up, but it turns out that
[SPEAKER_00]: immune therapy does have side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can cause hyper inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can also be hard on your thyroid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to need to approach this with
nutrition and supplements and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine to help my body get through this
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: A time because I will be on the immune
therapy potentially for a year could be
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's such a new medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know how long to put patients
on it is one year enough is two years
[SPEAKER_00]: enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't know yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm sort of one of the guinea pigs of
this new medicine, but it's quite exciting
[SPEAKER_00]: because it really is allowing your own
immune system to go after the cancer
[SPEAKER_00]: cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although unfortunately the side effects of
the inflammation are the same issues that
[SPEAKER_00]: created a comfortable situation for the
cancer to develop in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to weigh that out myself with
what feels right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, I'm really grateful to be able
to have safe access to the cannabis oil to
[SPEAKER_00]: assist me with the pain safely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't drive when I'm under the influence
of the stronger relief dose in the
[SPEAKER_00]: daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I'm taking the sunrise dose,
I'm very clear.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel altered.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any side effects of
stoniness.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as long as I am good about my diet and
eating sort of every couple of hours
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the day, I tend to also be fine
without strong case of the munchies by the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the afternoon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really been a huge help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want everybody that I know that's
going through this to have the same
[SPEAKER_00]: access.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the same reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what have been just as you've gone
through this experience, incorporating
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis into your recovery regimen,
your conversations with your doctor,
[SPEAKER_01]: with other cancer patients, your meeting
when you go to whatever various clinics
[SPEAKER_01]: and facilities you go to with the nurses,
can you talk about that with my doctor?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he was open, but he's quite busy
and he was receptive and respectful.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly enough, it was the
fellow working under him who wanted to get
[SPEAKER_00]: the information from me so that she could
pass this on to her patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: She had more time to spend with me in the
room.
[SPEAKER_00]: She asked for the website.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave it to her because she was
impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said, you know, really, you're doing
exceptionally well from where you started
[SPEAKER_00]: to where you are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think as a result of how well
I've responded to the chemotherapy and how
[SPEAKER_00]: well I've gotten through this whole six or
seven months, more of the nurses also on
[SPEAKER_00]: the infusion floor are asking me as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can I share?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the things that I need?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know have been beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they too have asked for the information
and for the website for the California
[SPEAKER_00]: providers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just this last week, when I was
getting my last round of immune therapy,
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the nurses on the floor asked if I
would be open to speaking to a group of
[SPEAKER_00]: women that collect once a month that are
called mothers with cancer down in the
[SPEAKER_00]: South Bay to share what I've learned and
what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it makes me realize how specialized
this is and how few people actually do
[SPEAKER_00]: have access to this information and how
lucky I feel I am that I received the
[SPEAKER_00]: input from the different people I did
along this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nurses are impressed and asking
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the sea change is happening
because my oncologist did ask enough
[SPEAKER_00]: questions about the acupuncturist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is a little bit more comfortable
probably for him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he is now referring patients to her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the first several months of going
in and espousing how well I feel like I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: doing as a result of the cannabis and the
acupuncture, he was polite, but I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: think he was impressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the end, seeing my results,
he's now impressed enough that he's
[SPEAKER_00]: starting to make referrals.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the proof is always in the
pudding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why I think more people are
asking me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm also being more vocal about
wanting to offer information when I see
[SPEAKER_00]: people on the infusion floor and I know
intimately what they're going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know how hard, no matter what time of
life it is for you, no matter what your
[SPEAKER_00]: age, how frightening and alone you can
feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love being able to approach these
people and ask them if they're interested
[SPEAKER_00]: in learning some of the things that I've
learned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if they are, then I share with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I've been received with
thank you so much, you know, I didn't know
[SPEAKER_00]: where to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, oh, somebody had mentioned that I
should start taking some of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: and didn't know where to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think nine times out of 10, any cancer
patient is now become aware that people
[SPEAKER_00]: are suggesting or mentioning or having
stories of somebody else that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: benefited by using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in this particular ilk of people,
cancer patients, I think it's the more
[SPEAKER_00]: common new conversation in terms of
helping you get through it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, it's access to knowing where to
find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For most people, they just don't know
where to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the idea of just going down to a local
dispensary is very overwhelming or
[SPEAKER_00]: intimidating or non doable for many
reasons, probably for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was encouraging to me to see that my
doctor was open minded to it, that
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously he's heard enough of it now that
that's changed how he perceives it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was really supportive, which was
really encouraging.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the 20 to one oil, the dropper,
when or did you find that to be useful?
[SPEAKER_00]: So with the dropper, the 20 to one oil,
I've just recently found it to be more
[SPEAKER_00]: useful since going through this herniated
back and not wanting to take a leave or
[SPEAKER_00]: ibuprofen to help reduce the pain and the
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've on occasion just given myself small
drops under the tongue and in probably 30,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40, 50 minutes or so, I start to feel a
lightening of the intensity of pain around
[SPEAKER_00]: the herniated area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm able to stand up a little bit more
upright and work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was able to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a landscape designer by trade and I
had a job that I had to do and it was
[SPEAKER_00]: painful to drive out to Silverlake to do
the job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was just taking the tincture with me
and just dosing myself very lightly,
[SPEAKER_00]: very minimally a couple of times a day
while I was on the job site.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helped tremendously.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't have to take ibuprofen or Advil,
which I didn't want to do for my liver
[SPEAKER_00]: because I also had metastasis in my liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just gave the slightest bit of
relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I thought was interesting is I didn't
ever feel the high from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just felt the pain relief probably
because I was taking such a little amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not quite sure, but it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just became my pain management.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really was helping.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the level that was in the tincture
really was helping with the inflammation
[SPEAKER_00]: evidently because it really helped with
the pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a common response, especially
with back pain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a lot of patients who respond
really well to the 21 tincture from back
[SPEAKER_02]: pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: As well as the one to three formula,
the relief formula that they take at night
[SPEAKER_02]: because they can sleep through the night.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they wake up and they have a good
night's sleep and the pain isn't as
[SPEAKER_02]: bothersome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frequently, they don't take anything
during the day as far as cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: except for that nighttime dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your response is not unusual.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say one thing that I would suggest
to anybody using the cannabis oil and the
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD oil is I became aware that I needed to
increase my fluids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could feel somewhat dehydrated in the
morning after taking the relief oil at
[SPEAKER_00]: night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that ended up being a benefit anyway,
because you want to be taking in a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more fluids when you've gone through
chemo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Therapy to help flush out those toxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're just good about drinking some
water first thing in the morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: a cup of warm water with lemon or just
some water by your bed and then drinking
[SPEAKER_00]: more water than normally throughout the
day, that really adds to the benefit of
[SPEAKER_00]: all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't be just one tool that will
help me heal from the cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily in Los Angeles, and I hope
broader, there are integrative approaches
[SPEAKER_00]: that are becoming more and more available
and more common.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I knew that I would need nutrition
from the assistance I got from a
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritionist that I consulted with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I would need the supplements and
the acupuncture.
[SPEAKER_00]: I knew I would need the CBD oil and the
cannabis oil, and I knew I would need the
[SPEAKER_00]: chemo.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of them together and the
meditation and the clean water played a
[SPEAKER_00]: part in me re-aligning myself and my life
and healing my body, letting my body heal
[SPEAKER_00]: from the inside out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so I don't think we can succeed in
getting ourselves well again from
[SPEAKER_00]: something by using just one tool in the
toolbox, because it wasn't just one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that got us that sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more that we can start to
understand that the Eastern and the
[SPEAKER_00]: Western are here for a reason and that
together those two fields are what will
[SPEAKER_00]: give the optimum holistic approach to
healing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nothing can do it all by itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you find that the cannabis helped you?
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are afraid of the
psychoactivity, frequently because they've
[SPEAKER_02]: never experienced it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if they have experienced it,
they've experienced it to too high of a
[SPEAKER_02]: degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're fearful of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then if they feel it coming on,
then they're like, oh, that doesn't work
[SPEAKER_02]: for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there is a ramping up or a titrating
of the dose that helps you to reach a
[SPEAKER_02]: maximum tolerated dose that if it's done
correctly, you don't really experience
[SPEAKER_02]: what some people would consider an
overdose of cannabis, which is not a
[SPEAKER_02]: lethal overdose by any means.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more than you're mentally capable of
handling at that point in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so this is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is probably one of the primary
reasons why I was such a fan of you and
[SPEAKER_00]: what you guys are creating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when I was given some cannabis oil
edible from a friend for my first round of
[SPEAKER_00]: treatment, it was from some dispensary in
Venice and it was 10 point something
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not being used to eating that much
oil, cannabis oil, I was unprepared for
[SPEAKER_00]: how strong it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had experienced being stoned earlier in
my life, so I wasn't afraid.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's a really good point that anyone
who hasn't experienced being high,
[SPEAKER_00]: it could be intimidating if they just went
straight into it without gradually
[SPEAKER_00]: building up a tolerance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once I spoke with you and you sent the
capsules in there gradated, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: gradually from 12.5 to 25 to 50
milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was surprised it took about three or
four days for me to get used to the 12.5
[SPEAKER_00]: in the evening, because I was also taking
it a little bit earlier on in the evening
[SPEAKER_00]: because I was still wanting to deal with
the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the time I was done midway through the
bottle of the 12.5, there was no problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wasn't experiencing heavy duty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was waking up, rested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was not having the pain in the same way
during those weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know if I'm answering the
question appropriately, but I've strongly
[SPEAKER_00]: encouraged people to call you because when
other people have told me about having to
[SPEAKER_00]: go to a dispensary and guess what the
amount is that they'll need, or when
[SPEAKER_00]: they've tried to figure out if they're
doing it in drops, how many drops they
[SPEAKER_00]: need, and they can overdose themselves,
it can be, especially if you're older and
[SPEAKER_00]: this is not a common experience for you,
it can be super intimidating and you might
[SPEAKER_00]: just throw the baby out with the
bathwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having it come already in gelatin
capsules, measured out with the right time
[SPEAKER_00]: to take it, because midway through
chemotherapy, you really need it to be as
[SPEAKER_00]: simple as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having it say sunrise and having it say
evening was very helpful when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: fumbling around for bottles in the middle
of the day or in the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, I think that most people have
experienced an altered state to one degree
[SPEAKER_00]: or another, whether it was through
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all maybe knew what it was to have
too many beers when they were in high
[SPEAKER_00]: school or college, or too many margaritas,
or maybe they know what it's like to have
[SPEAKER_00]: taken some other type of recreational
drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think one of the things that's
unique to people going through cancer is
[SPEAKER_00]: you're already in such a state of
surrender when you're going through
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapy treatment by virtue of you
have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your life is on the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're willing to do whatever it takes,
including taking incredibly toxic drugs
[SPEAKER_00]: into your system, intervening continuously
with the hopes that this is going to save
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're a lot more receptive to trying
things that you would not have previously,
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe, when you're going through
something where you're fighting for your
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the more you can just be in surrender
and the ease you feel of taking something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know is natural and for a change
is not harmful to your body, into your
[SPEAKER_00]: body to help.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so some of the side effects,
if you're feeling some of the stoniness,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually can come as quite a relief as
well because it can help you relax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I found, it also helped me have
more of a perspective about what I was
[SPEAKER_00]: going through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had moments where I got so
quiet and so meditative and so
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciative of the natural world around
me again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer can give you a timeout button from
your life, and it can help you reintroduce
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself to what it is about living that
you knew as a child that you'd forgotten.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you feel more inclined when you're
under the influence, I felt, of the CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: oil by day or the relief oil by day if I
needed it to be outside, which I also
[SPEAKER_00]: think is a hugely therapeutic part of
healing for anybody is to be in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: You end up finding that you feel more
drawn to the things that are more natural
[SPEAKER_00]: to you by virtue of the experience of
slowing down and being relaxed and being
[SPEAKER_00]: open minded, which the CBD oil seems to be
conducive towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: So any of the anxiety about being out of
control or not feeling in control that a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people experience if they get too
much of anything that alters them,
[SPEAKER_00]: is mitigated by you creating the capsules
according to who they are and what they
[SPEAKER_00]: need in such a way that they just know,
I just need to take that one capsule that
[SPEAKER_00]: says sunrise in the morning and one in the
evening, and I'll gradually work my way
[SPEAKER_00]: up, but I won't ever be out of control.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's helpful to know that you can be
called, that I was able to call either of
[SPEAKER_00]: you at any time if I needed to to ask
questions, was also tremendous comfort
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's a lot of questions
sometimes that come up in your mind about
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're doing and what might work and
what might not work and to have somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: on the other end of a phone who's kind and
thoughtful and receptive is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
