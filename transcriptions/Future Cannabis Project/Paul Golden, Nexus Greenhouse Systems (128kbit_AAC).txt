[SPEAKER_00]: Today we presented on the benefits of
growing in a climate controlled hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse and one of the major focuses of
the conversation that we had was to kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of give people an idea of what a advanced
hybrid greenhouse can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are state-of-the-art greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're no longer ground structures or
high tunnels.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have all the environmental controls
of a warehouse environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we call them a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a mix between greenhouse and
warehouse, but they have the benefits of a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse in that they're much more
cost-efficient in terms of producing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, mainly because you have sunlight
coming in and that's the primary source of
[SPEAKER_00]: your costs in a warehouse environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Additionally, not running all the lights
that you would run in a warehouse
[SPEAKER_00]: environment, your cooling is much lower
cost in a greenhouse environment and that
[SPEAKER_00]: was one of the major focuses of the talk
was how much light there is and how easy
[SPEAKER_00]: it is to cool in the southwestern
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically speaking, as you get into a
climate that's drier, we're able to use
[SPEAKER_00]: more evaporative pads technology or kind
of like a swamp cooler more or less to
[SPEAKER_00]: cool these environments and it's basically
the most efficient way to cool a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse or cool any structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe about a tenth the cost of it would
be to run HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, a pad fan system is basically a
swamp cooler on one side of the structure
[SPEAKER_00]: where the air moves in to the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll always insect screen that pad system
so there's no concern about outside
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens making it into the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We typically do what's called anti-virus
screening, which is done 150 microns,
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's thrift level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing bigger than a thrift can make it
through and that's basically the smallest
[SPEAKER_00]: pest you're going to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next to a mite, which we don't have too
many mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll move that through the pad system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll drop the temperature right there at
that pad system by maybe up to 25 degrees
[SPEAKER_00]: and then we'll exhaust that air through
the greenhouse from the pad wall to the
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust fan side and it may pick up some
temperature on the way through the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, maybe up to five degrees or so
and then we'll ultimately exhaust out the
[SPEAKER_00]: exhaust fans.
[SPEAKER_00]: With cooling in a greenhouse environment,
we're definitely doing a better job at
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing your carbon footprint using the
pad system as opposed to a warehouse
[SPEAKER_00]: environment where you have HVAC systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, every three watts of power
used for lighting in a warehouse
[SPEAKER_00]: environment requires about a watt or watt
and a half of HVAC to cool it and to
[SPEAKER_00]: dehumidify the warehouse environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: A warehouse might be as large as $10 a
square foot in electricity for HVAC.
[SPEAKER_00]: A greenhouse environment is probably less
than a dollar square foot, give or take,
[SPEAKER_00]: for cooling.
[SPEAKER_00]: A warehouse environment will probably be
about $15, $20 a square foot in lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: A greenhouse environment is probably about
a third to a quarter of that, so a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant energy reduction in a
greenhouse environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one was how much you save in
light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically speaking, in a warehouse
environment, you might get about 30 moles
[SPEAKER_00]: a day of power in your crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a greenhouse environment, you'll get
more like 40 moles a day per meter squared
[SPEAKER_00]: of power in your crop and that's all free
for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 85% of the year, you're going to hit
that target DLI and you're not paying for
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, you're going to have to
supplement a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis has a number of unique features,
mainly because it's been grown indoors for
[SPEAKER_00]: so long and there's certain strains that
just don't have the strength of an outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the resiliency.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant would prefer a high level of
control than a typical greenhouse would
[SPEAKER_00]: offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our state-of-the-art cannabis greenhouses,
though, they offer all the levels of
[SPEAKER_00]: control of the warehouse, humidity,
CO2, light levels, temperature and
[SPEAKER_00]: cooling, as well as insects exclusion,
which minimizes your risk of any kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: pest getting in there and breaking out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest thing, though, is that
traditional crops didn't tend to use as
[SPEAKER_00]: much light deprivation equipment as
cannabis crop needs for guaranteeing your
[SPEAKER_00]: 12-12 light cycle, regardless of what time
of year it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the Nexus structure, what we've ended
up doing is we've integrated a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: flashing for the light deprivation
equipment right into the structure itself
[SPEAKER_00]: and we do a better job at guaranteeing
there's no light penetrations on that
[SPEAKER_00]: crop, preventing it from self-pollinating
or causing any kind of total crop loss
[SPEAKER_00]: from light getting in there during the
flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one of the biggest things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in the industry prior to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was used a lot in chrysanthemums,
for example, but it just didn't have the
[SPEAKER_00]: degree of control we have now and it's all
automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it all comes through the environmental
control, which is the brain of the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It monitors the light level inside the
greenhouse and switches on and off lights
[SPEAKER_00]: as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It monitors the light level and the heat
inside the greenhouse and closes and opens
[SPEAKER_00]: shade systems as needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it also knows whether it's going
to be going into flower or not and
[SPEAKER_00]: automatically closes the curtains at,
say, 7 o'clock at night to guarantee that
[SPEAKER_00]: you get that 12-12 light cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that Nexus does when it
designs its cannabis greenhouse is we
[SPEAKER_00]: fully integrate the controller with all
the equipment that's inside the structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one example of how this might take
place is when you start to go into
[SPEAKER_00]: blackout, say at 7 o'clock at night,
our controllers automatically know,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, as you start to go into blackout,
the plants still transpiring, the humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: levels are going to increase, so we need
to do some things to reduce humidity as
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going into blackout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because basically what happens is when you
go into blackout, you close that shade
[SPEAKER_00]: system and you shrink the envelope inside
the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: The shade system's kind of hung from the
trusses and it's a smaller volume of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants are still transpiring,
so the humidity levels raise inside that
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse if you don't do anything at
all.
[SPEAKER_00]: The controller's smart enough to know that
it says, hey, I need to vent out a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: amount of air.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to close the shade system slowly
and put these plants to sleep and also
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe raise the air temperature to keep
this plant from reaching its dew point
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature on the leaf, because basically
what happens is when you close the
[SPEAKER_00]: blackout system, the leaf is constantly
radiating out infrared radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So leaf temperature's always cooler than
air temperature, which means it's easy for
[SPEAKER_00]: that leaf temperature to reach the dew
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this happens all the time in warehouse
environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why a lot of warehouses will have
outbreaks of powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the HVAC system's sitting there
running and running and running trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: control the humidity, but what it's doing
is it's actually lowering the temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's bringing that humidity level
closer to the dew point temperature,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're going to ultimately have an
outbreak on the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a greenhouse environment, we'll set the
controller to pulse, ventilate,
[SPEAKER_00]: and heat and bring in fresh outdoor air,
maybe at a low relative humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it's at high relative humidity,
but we'll heat it up and keep that plant
[SPEAKER_00]: from reaching its dew point temperature as
we're closing the shade system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all we're basically guaranteeing is
that the relative humidity's stay stable
[SPEAKER_00]: right around that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll also do additional mixing of air
to guarantee that the leaf stays dry and
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's no dead zones inside the
structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all done basically through
automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the big benefits of a greenhouse
environment is obviously that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: getting so much natural light,
which is to anyone that's growing cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: will realize it's a watts per gram kind of
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That has direct relationship to how much
output you're going to have out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: crop is how much light it's receiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a greenhouse controller monitors the
amount of light that's hitting the crop at
[SPEAKER_00]: the canopy level and basically will
regulate up and down the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: lighting that goes on inside the structure
to guarantee that it has a steady amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of light throughout the day at the proper
quantities for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you won't have variations from
season to season.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your fall crop won't be so much smaller
than your summer crop or your winter crop
[SPEAKER_00]: won't be so much smaller than your fall
crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to have constant production year
round all four seasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we'll do is we'll monitor that
with our controller and basically just
[SPEAKER_00]: switch on and off the lights only as
needed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way it doesn't have any higher cost
of operation than necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with a number of different
lighting manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We typically, I'd say about what we see in
the field is about 90% of our
[SPEAKER_00]: installations are HPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just one of those technologies that's
been tried and true in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do work with a number of different LED
manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of cutting edge technologies
coming out there, certainly being
[SPEAKER_00]: developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with Lumigrow technology or
Healer Spectra technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course we still work with the old
tried and true Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_00]: as well and PL lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we kind of work across the different
manufacturers there just depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the customer was looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some customers have worked with LEDs in
the past and they might be coming out of a
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouse environment and they like the
spectral properties that LEDs offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other guys have been horticultural growers
for years and they've been using HPS for
[SPEAKER_00]: other crops, let's say tomatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're fine with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they say, OK, well, we're just going
to keep doing what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the most interesting thing about
the LED technology in a greenhouse setting
[SPEAKER_00]: is the ability for dimming to modulate the
amount of light output continuously as
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to having just large chunks
turning on 300 micromoles per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared or 600 micromoles per meter
squared supplementation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can do it continuously all the way
from zero micromoles up to 600 micromoles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then depending on how much light is
coming through the greenhouse glazing or
[SPEAKER_00]: the shade system, they can say,
OK, we have to turn on and off these
[SPEAKER_00]: lights to a certain degree as opposed to
turning all on or all off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of an interesting approach
about the LED technologies that are out
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look back to the warehouse growers
and a lot of the people that came out of
[SPEAKER_00]: the basement, they were measuring light in
a very non-scientific fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times they're using terms like
locks or foot candles to measure how much
[SPEAKER_00]: light this plant needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the science has evolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what the plant needs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what its ideal instantaneous light
levels are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know what its daily accumulation
light levels should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant basically saturates itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't produce any more growth once you
hit 1,500 micromoles per meter squared per
[SPEAKER_00]: second apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we call the photon flux
density.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very high level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most crops don't allow themselves to keep
growing at that level.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a greenhouse environment, typically we
try to hit 1,000 micromoles per meter
[SPEAKER_00]: squared par.
[SPEAKER_00]: And par is really the amount of light
that's in the spectrum between 400
[SPEAKER_00]: nanometers and 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the light that the plant can
use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Any light outside that spectrum is really
kind of wasted and heat on the crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just heats up the crop, and that's all
it goes towards.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of infrared does some stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a little bit of UV helps the resin
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, it's the par that dictates the
growth of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, if you think of the PPFD,
which is the photon flux density of par,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how many droplets of light are
hitting a surface, a square meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other important aspect about
growth is how much it accumulates over the
[SPEAKER_00]: course of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you think of light as raining down
on the crop, how much rain is hitting it
[SPEAKER_00]: right now is the PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other important number is the DLI,
the daylight integral, which is,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you think of light raining down the
crop, then the DLI would be the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: rain that's inside the rain gauge over the
course of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 40 moles a day per meter squared seems
to be about the perfect number for this
[SPEAKER_00]: crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still well within its limits for
PPFD, a 12-hour light cycle, about 1,000
[SPEAKER_00]: micromoles per meter squared PPFD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we'll measure all this inside the
greenhouse environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll use sensors, such as an Apogee light
sensor, to read at the canopy level how
[SPEAKER_00]: much light's falling on that crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll supplement only as needed
to guarantee that we're still hitting
[SPEAKER_00]: those target numbers that we're shooting
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's to keep your crop from being
smaller one season from another season,
[SPEAKER_00]: or less productive one season from another
season.
[SPEAKER_00]: We adhere to pretty strict industry
standards for greenhouse cooling and
[SPEAKER_00]: heating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically what we will do is we'll
size all of our equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll make sure all of our equipment size
properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The proper amount of airflow through the
greenhouse is what dictates how cool the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse will be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the proper size pad wall system will
dictate how cool you can get that
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the southwest, where we are,
right now it's not very humid.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pad system is very functional because
the lower the outdoor humidity,
[SPEAKER_00]: the closer you can get to what's called
the dew point temperature, which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: theoretical limit for how cool you can get
a greenhouse using pad systems,
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple degrees within that dew point
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in this area, let's say the hottest
time of the year is about 105 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give or take that's about average high
temperature out here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dew point temperature or the wet bulb
temperature at that point is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: right around 70, give or take.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can get maybe within five degrees of
that, 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's say it was a very inefficient system
or it wasn't being ran properly,
[SPEAKER_00]: people aren't cleaning the screens,
this, that, any other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we're getting within 10 degrees of
that, 80 degrees.
[SPEAKER_00]: But 80 degrees is still a pretty good
temperature for the cannabis crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the best climates to
grow in a greenhouse because you're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even though it might be 100 and something
degrees outside, typically speaking,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can get a 20 degree reduction,
25 degree reduction inside the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: in this climate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also size the greenhouses so they
have the right amount of airflow through
[SPEAKER_00]: them that helps keep it cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also size a shading system that goes
into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to reduce the amount of light to just
the right levels inside there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the greenhouse isn't getting any hotter
than it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of our covering that goes in the
greenhouse will actually filter out the
[SPEAKER_00]: light that's not useful for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's not contributing towards heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then lastly, we'll just keep the
greenhouses short.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times we'll keep our greenhouses
less than 100 feet long for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: because they want that high degree of
control over temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the shorter the greenhouse,
the easier it is to maintain the
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature inside of it.
Thank you.
