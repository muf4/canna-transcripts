[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited for a conversation on a topic
that we don't talk about enough,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is talking about opioids and
cannabis, and tonight in particular in
[SPEAKER_00]: professional sports.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give you a little background on me
before I, Michelle shares a little about
[SPEAKER_00]: herself.
[SPEAKER_00]: My background is as a healthcare
regulatory lawyer, I've been working for
[SPEAKER_00]: about 26 years in healthcare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the first lawyer in California to
start doing regulatory work around
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis back in 2009, and even earlier
doing work for maps on issues around
[SPEAKER_00]: psychedelics, and trying to sort of work
for more rational drug policy and advising
[SPEAKER_00]: clients on how to navigate a complicated
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a book actually coming out tomorrow
morning, tomorrow, The United States of
[SPEAKER_00]: Opioids, published by Forbes, which talks
a little bit about cannabis and a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about my sort of deep dive personally into
overdose response and some of the other
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges that we're facing with regard
to the opioid crisis, and hopefully what I
[SPEAKER_00]: hope we'll talk about tonight is the
extent to which cannabis holds out
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible promise as a potential solution
to a crisis in which as of the last year
[SPEAKER_00]: we have data for nearly 50,000 Americans
died.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I'll just turn it over to
Michelle just to introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my name is Dr. Michelle Ross,
and I just want to start off too by
[SPEAKER_01]: acknowledging the opioid crisis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my little brother actually died from an
alcohol and Oxycontin overdose almost 10
[SPEAKER_01]: years to this day, actually on Wednesday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a drug addiction neuroscientist,
this topic is really, really, it really
[SPEAKER_01]: means something to me to do this work and
to be able to bring cannabis in to save
[SPEAKER_01]: lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are good?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually started off as a cannabis
scientist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was studying the effects of heroin,
cocaine, cannabis, all these illegal drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: and what they did to the developing brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually my very first paper was on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, when you look at the
benefits of cannabis as opposed to the
[SPEAKER_01]: negative harms of cannabis, you don't get
any more funding for your work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I had to wait a couple years to
actually start studying the benefits of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis until I basically moved to
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I ended up founding the first nonprofit
for cannabis and women's health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was partly because of my
relationship with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as a scientist, I ended up having
endometriosis and all these other
[SPEAKER_01]: different health problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was on pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was even on morphine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as an addiction scientist,
I didn't realize how horrible these drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: were, how addictive they were.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you are not addicted to them,
you are still dependent on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I became dependent on morphine,
ended up getting all these off these drugs
[SPEAKER_01]: with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm happy to say now, despite all the
things that have happened to me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm only on cannabis, but I really
dedicated my life to helping other people
[SPEAKER_01]: get healthy with cannabis and to start
living their life.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you're on opioids,
you don't have a life.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are depressed, you're sick,
and it's just really hard to manage your
[SPEAKER_01]: chronic illness when you're on those
drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I actually founded a online health
network that helps people get off of
[SPEAKER_01]: opioids and antidepressants and treats
other medical conditions with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go to your doctor, they don't
know anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go to the dispensary,
you might find a gem of a dispensary that
[SPEAKER_01]: actually has educated bud tenders.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, in most places, they're sort
of like your cashier at Target instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: a pharmacist, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you shouldn't be having those
conversations with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a long-winded story there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really am just very excited to talk
with you because you know so much about
[SPEAKER_01]: opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's so much that we can
discuss today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to, before, I want to ask you
some questions sort of biochemically to
[SPEAKER_00]: set the stage for contrasting cannabis and
opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's all right, I just want to take
a minute to frame the opioid crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mark the opioid crisis, most people
mark it from about the late 90s or early
2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right around 2000, the opioid that sort of
signaled a real change in the overdose
[SPEAKER_00]: death rate in America was OxyContin,
which has been getting a lot of attention
[SPEAKER_00]: because of its manufacturer, Purdue
Pharma, and the founders, the Sacklers,
[SPEAKER_00]: who made billions.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the story, when you think about the
opioid crisis, the way I would encourage
[SPEAKER_00]: people to think about it in broad terms is
as really three interwoven problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is an overdose death rate that has
quadrupled in the last 20 years from
[SPEAKER_00]: roughly 11,000 people overdosing on all
opioids, prescription opioids,
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal forms of opioids, heroin and
fentanyl, and then to about 40,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 49,000 in 2017, the last year we
have data for, going up about at least 10%
[SPEAKER_00]: a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of the problem is overdose deaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we get to the second issue around
the opioid crisis is addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when we talk about professional
sports, that's gonna be a big part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: equation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have roughly 20, more than 20 million
Americans who suffer from some form of
[SPEAKER_00]: substance use disorder or addiction,
about two thirds of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: About 12 million people claim some kind of
misuse of opioids or an opioid use
[SPEAKER_00]: disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally, we have the problem of
chronic pain we're gonna talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: tonight, which is 50 million Americans,
50 million adults complain that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last six months, pain has been a severe
limitation in their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 million of them say that it has limited
most or all work or life activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're talking about three problems,
overdose deaths, addiction and pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I would, the other piece that I
talk about in the book is there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: underlying root, which is all of the
emotional and social issues, whether you
[SPEAKER_00]: identify it as stress, as isolation,
as despair, there's a whole set of issues
[SPEAKER_00]: that are driving the crisis, both with
respect to all three prongs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, when we talk about the opioid
crisis, that's the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about all three pieces of
the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanna come back to the biochemical
side of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering if you can explain why
opioids have been such a powerful source
[SPEAKER_00]: of treatment in medicine and for treating
pain and talk about the biochemical
[SPEAKER_00]: process that leads to their risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So opioids are very, very effective for
pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because we supply them in these little
milligram tablets, they're absorbed pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: evenly by each patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why the healthcare system likes
to prescribe that as opposed to cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: where if you smoke it, you eat it,
et cetera, it's very different,
[SPEAKER_01]: it varies for pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So opioids are very effective for pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the ways that opioids works is
it actually activates your immune opioid
[SPEAKER_01]: receptor, and then that helps actually
relieve pain by reducing the heat signals
[SPEAKER_01]: in the spinal cord and brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a lot of other things that
opioids do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we know that opioids can cause
some of the symptoms of clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: depression actually at their lowest dose.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an interesting fact.
[SPEAKER_01]: So five milligrams of oxycodone,
which is the lowest dose of opioids,
[SPEAKER_01]: will actually cause clinical depression in
the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of things that opioids do
that we don't really think of when we're
[SPEAKER_01]: prescribing opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And doctors don't think about that,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't think that we're causing
depression when we prescribe opioids to
[SPEAKER_01]: patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't tell them about the risk of
addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't tell them about the risk of
overdose, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason why people can overdose on
opioids is because there's opioid
[SPEAKER_01]: receptors all throughout the body and the
brain, and especially in the area for the
[SPEAKER_01]: area that regulates breathing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can overdose on opioids because
you're activating opioid receptors in the
[SPEAKER_01]: area that can cause respiratory depression
and death.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so in other words, people are
basically, the higher doses that people
[SPEAKER_00]: take as they become dependent is leading
them to essentially suffocate themselves,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to asphyxiate themselves with
lower and lower oxygen intake.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I mean, there's a lot of opioids
that the LD50, right, like the dose that
[SPEAKER_01]: you need to overdose is actually very low
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how effective that drug is for pain
versus how many you need to take to die
[SPEAKER_01]: from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, so for example, there's opioids
like tramadol, right, that you can take
[SPEAKER_01]: just like one or two extra pills on and
then you can actually overdose from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's more and more stronger opioids
being prescribed now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fentanyl, for example, something that you
cover quite well in the book about how the
[SPEAKER_01]: addition of fentanyl in both legal and
illegal drugs that are illegal opioids
[SPEAKER_01]: that are available on the market actually
contributes to the opioid crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so that's another, thank you for
bringing it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's actually a fascinating piece of when
you, just again, thinking about what the
[SPEAKER_00]: opioid crisis is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really from about 99, 2000 to about
2010, the driving piece of the overdose
[SPEAKER_00]: death rate going up was physician
prescribing, right, and actually I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: excited to talk with, to hear Kasim talk
about it because I remember getting calls
[SPEAKER_00]: in the late 2009, 2010, 11, actually from
NFL teams and they were getting calls from
[SPEAKER_00]: the DEA because the NFL was just full of
doctors prescribing very loosely.
[SPEAKER_00]: There would be team trainers giving out
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really, really troubling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, so in that period we were
talking about physician prescribing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is that what we saw was that
the DEA cracked down on physician
[SPEAKER_00]: prescribing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They continue to do so, but around 2010
the crackdown was big enough from the DEA
[SPEAKER_00]: and state medical boards that we began to
see black tar heroin filling the void and
[SPEAKER_00]: Sam Kinones, who wrote the book Dreamland,
talks about the way that basically the
[SPEAKER_00]: traffickers who were getting shut out of
cannabis turned to black tar heroin and
[SPEAKER_00]: then we saw, so we saw from about 2010 to
2013 a huge spike in heroin usage
[SPEAKER_00]: including, there's been reports of a lot
of NFL alumni and other professional
[SPEAKER_00]: athletes turning to heroin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's absolutely terrifying.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the book I tell a story of somebody who
I know personally who turned to heroin
[SPEAKER_00]: when her doctor cut her off and so then we
get to this third phase of the opioid
[SPEAKER_00]: crisis that we're in now, which is what
you talk about, which is the fentanyl
[SPEAKER_00]: crisis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fentanyl is both a legal prescribed drug,
but it's also an easy to manufacture
[SPEAKER_00]: illegal form if you have the right
precursor chemicals in a lab and people
[SPEAKER_00]: are, and it's cheap, so that what's
happening today is that a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: overdoses of those deaths are people
thinking they're getting one drug,
[SPEAKER_00]: but actually getting fentanyl and it's
absolutely frightening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard a story this morning of a teenager
who thought he was taking an
[SPEAKER_00]: antidepressant and he, it was really a
counterfeit fentanyl because fentanyl is
[SPEAKER_00]: so cheap that it's just proliferating.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, so to get back, I want to get back
to this, the question of thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: pain, opioid treatment of pain and
cannabis treatment of pain from a clinical
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wondering if you can describe
sort of the difference in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy for treatment of pain between the
two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so there's actually a lot of overlap
between cannabinoids and opioids,
[SPEAKER_01]: so the U-opioid receptor is found in the
same location as the CB1 and CB2 receptors
[SPEAKER_01]: and so that's actually why when you take
THC and you take an opioid, you actually
[SPEAKER_01]: need less of the opioid and it's actually
called an opioid sparing effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because these receptors are located in
the same place, when you take
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, they actually make the
opioids more effective and so you would
[SPEAKER_01]: think maybe, okay, it makes them too
effective, you might overdose and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it actually makes is that you get
more pain relief without having to use
[SPEAKER_01]: more opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these cannabinoid receptors are located
on these neurons that actually control how
[SPEAKER_01]: much endorphins, for example, are released
and endorphins are your natural opioids
[SPEAKER_01]: just like we have these natural
endocannabinoids like enandamide that are
[SPEAKER_01]: in our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabinoids can actually increase the
amount of endorphins or natural opioids
[SPEAKER_01]: that are released, they can actually make
the opioid pathways more effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of different ways that
they work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabinoids don't cause the same kind of
inflammation that we see in the brain when
[SPEAKER_01]: you use opioids, so there's some
mechanisms that are very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So THC and CBD are also very different
from each other, they're not the same
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids, not all cannabis products
have CBD in them, not all CBD products
[SPEAKER_01]: have THC in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So THC and CBD work a little bit
differently and we won't go too much into
[SPEAKER_01]: it, but CBD can actually have effects that
are slightly different from THC and can
[SPEAKER_01]: actually reduce anxiety too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Work on serotonin receptors and that can
actually relieve pain in a very different
[SPEAKER_01]: way than just opioids which are not really
treating some of the stress and mood
[SPEAKER_01]: issues that you see with chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're using cannabinoids,
not only are you treating the pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're also treating some of the other
underlying mood issues that contribute to
[SPEAKER_01]: pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're more stressed out, if you're
more depressed, if you're more anxious,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're actually going to perceive your
pain as worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of things about
cannabinoids that really treat the root of
[SPEAKER_01]: the problem as opposed to just masking the
pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just touched on something that for
me was some learning that happened as I
[SPEAKER_00]: was writing the book, which is talking
about pain both as a physical sensation
[SPEAKER_00]: and an emotional reaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came across, I cited in the book a study
which candidly I didn't really understand
[SPEAKER_00]: from Dr. Ethan Russo who's a prominent
researcher and he talks about the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that cannabis may be, he sort of says even
if there's not research to support
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as being, the efficacy of
cannabis on certain pain issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: it clearly affects emotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just sort of explain the
difference between treating pain as a
[SPEAKER_00]: sensation versus pain as an emotion?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so treating pain as a cessation,
that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you obviously have a whole bunch of
different brain structures, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have brain structures that process
pain, you have brain structures that
[SPEAKER_01]: process emotional pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's sort of interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the amygdala, for example, in the brain
is your area that processes fear and some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these negative emotions, including how
we respond to pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's nice about cannabinoids is it
can actually turn off that signaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can also help us forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabinoids are very, very good at
binding to receptors in our hippocampus
[SPEAKER_01]: and in our amygdala and shutting off these
memories that we don't want to have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a lot of people that are in
chronic pain, they are depressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of depression is reliving some of
these painful memories or even memories of
[SPEAKER_01]: being ill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you're able to shut off some
of these negative circuits, you're no
[SPEAKER_01]: longer experiencing those physical
symptoms of pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And literally, depression, there are some
people that experience sort of what we
[SPEAKER_01]: think of typical depression as sadness,
loneliness, despair, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's other people that actually
exhibit depression as physical pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: back pain, neck pain, gut pain,
all sorts of different pain, even joint
[SPEAKER_01]: pain, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the fact that we can use cannabinoids
to treat emotional pain does actually
[SPEAKER_01]: increase our ability to treat the physical
pain as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's just so much that is going on
between treating pain with cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_01]: versus treating pain with opioids,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking about opioids actually is
causing inflammation, causing some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these clinical symptoms of depression.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's obviously working on different
pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to go back to the, because years
ago I had a, I sprained my back maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: three years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I went, I decided I'm not going to
get painkillers.
[SPEAKER_00]: By the way, I'm curious when I come back
to this, at the end of this question on
[SPEAKER_00]: where the place of non-steroidal
anti-inflammatories, like the Motrin's and
[SPEAKER_00]: ibuprofen's, all the naproxen,
where all that stuff fits into the pain
[SPEAKER_00]: circuitry in our bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'll just share a personal experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sprained my back.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was very nervous about taking an opioid,
which was what my doctor prescribed for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went actually to see Dr. Alan Frankel
and got a recommendation and used a
[SPEAKER_00]: sublingual spray to take it with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do remember that there was,
what I remember just from it was that it
[SPEAKER_00]: was, the pain didn't go away, but I was
just, I was tolerating it better,
[SPEAKER_00]: meaning I noticed that it was still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just wondering on a more basic
level, does it make a difference?
[SPEAKER_00]: What I noticed personally was that it was
treating the pain differently,
[SPEAKER_00]: that sensation was completely different
than the pain going away, but it was more
[SPEAKER_00]: a sensation that I was okay with,
with feeling that pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wondering if you can speak to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it ultimately make a difference if
people can tolerate pain just because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're emotionally calmer with it and not
being, I'm just wondering if you can speak
[SPEAKER_00]: to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where do, and I also, sorry to throw a
lot at you, but where do NSAID's
[SPEAKER_00]: non-steroidal anti-inflammatories fall in
the, sort of in the process?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, so a lot of times we'll talk about
what is the ability of cannabis to bring
[SPEAKER_01]: down really significant pain, to talk
about on a pain scale from one to 10,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 being the worst pain, like ER level
pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are pain patients that can take
cannabis and they can be dropped to a
[SPEAKER_01]: level six or five and those patients will
say, like you said, well I still know that
[SPEAKER_01]: the pain's there, but it doesn't bother
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's basically cannabis is helping
distract them or being able to cope by
[SPEAKER_01]: reducing the anxiety that's around their
pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chronic pain patients really sort of
sometimes hyper-focus on their pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That hyper-focusing actually increases
their, or actually decreases their ability
[SPEAKER_01]: to deal with that pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're so focused on it, you can't
really do anything else and you make that
[SPEAKER_01]: pain worse.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're able to sort of compartmentalize
it and not deal with it, you're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with that pain better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now opioids on the other hand will,
can, you know, depending on the doses,
[SPEAKER_01]: completely knock out that pain and I think
that's also part of its abuse liability,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's able to completely knock out the
pain and it's able to make us feel good in
[SPEAKER_01]: so many different ways, well then you're
like I want more opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one that is getting the relief from
cannabis and saying it's distract me from
[SPEAKER_01]: pain is like I need to be even more
distracted.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me more cannabis, more cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we don't have that kind of drive
within us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people will actually titrate their
cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the better things about
using it for pain management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you mentioned OTC pain relievers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now naproxen, some of these NSAIDs,
the way that they work is actually by
[SPEAKER_01]: blocking an enzyme called COX-1 or COX-2.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are enzymes that actually help
produce prostaglandins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are inflammatory molecules that
are in our brain, in our body,
[SPEAKER_01]: and make us feel like crap.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the ability for naproxen to be able to
stop the production of these inflammatory
[SPEAKER_01]: molecules and stop pain is really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, they have a lot of nasty side
effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like for example, if you take these drugs
too often, you're gonna end up with a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of stomach upset, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's interesting about some
cannabinoids, specifically I believe it's
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD-A is actually the raw version,
the uncarboxylated version of CBD and that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid can actually inhibit COX-2,
which is important because that one
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't actually, basically drugs that
inhibit COX-2 are not going to mess up
[SPEAKER_01]: your gut or things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you want to be able to reduce
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that there's a lot more
potential for drugs to be able to treat
[SPEAKER_01]: pain and inflammation more than just CBD
and THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to look at the CBD-A, THC-A.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there are some different
clinical trials out there that have looked
[SPEAKER_01]: at these COX-2 inhibitors.
[SPEAKER_01]: For different types of pain and even for
anti-cancer effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's so many things that we haven't
even touched on in terms of cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine and pain relief.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd love to get some of your thoughts on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, as a lawyer, one of the most
exciting things that happened was the farm
[SPEAKER_00]: bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people followed that passed in
December, which basically finally stopped
[SPEAKER_00]: the DEA from treating all hemp sourced
cannabinoids as schedule one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just share a quick story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was in Washington DC meeting with
policymakers in late October and I met,
[SPEAKER_00]: I sat, spent a day with the head of policy
from the DEA.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I literally, it might as well have
been a conversation that I had with him in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1980 for the level of like progress
thinking around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a little bit depressing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the same old conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I asked specifically the question,
when are we going to see movement on hemp
[SPEAKER_00]: sourced CBD?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was actually, his answer was,
good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's never going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not happening anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, two months later,
we saw that Congress passed a farm bill
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually changed the status of all
the non-THC cannabinoids from hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was a huge development.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm wondering, I'm curious if you can
contrast, you mentioned CBDA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm curious if you can talk a little bit
about where the most, in terms of THC
[SPEAKER_00]: still being we don't have access to THC
outside of schedule one of the Controlled
[SPEAKER_00]: Substances Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to be, sorry, as a lawyer,
let me just explain that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think everybody understands it,
but at the risk of saying the obvious,
[SPEAKER_00]: putting it on schedule one of the
Controlled Substances Act, which is where
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis still sits today, means that
there is no accepted medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doctors in states that decriminalize it
can recommend it, but they can't prescribe
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The significance of putting it on schedule
two is schedule two is a list of
[SPEAKER_00]: prescriptions that are prescribable,
drugs that are at a high risk of abuse as
[SPEAKER_00]: far as the DEA and the government are
concerned, but are still prescribable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the most dangerous and most
powerful opioids, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: fentanyl, in its prescribed forms are on
schedule two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now hemp-sourced CBD, CBG,
all these other non-THC cannabinoids are
[SPEAKER_00]: on schedule two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm curious if you can talk,
other than CBDA, if you can talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the opportunities that the
hemp-sourced cannabinoids offer and where
[SPEAKER_00]: you think the most promise is with respect
to pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are just at the tip of the iceberg.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really don't know what these other
cannabinoids do, or even some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the cannabinoids, the minor
cannabinoids that can be found in hemp,
[SPEAKER_01]: and also some cannabis products include
cannabigerol, CBG, CBC, CBN, THCV is even
[SPEAKER_01]: found in hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Small amounts in some hemp strains.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that because of these
cannabinoids being found in such low
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts, we don't really know what they
do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of them are suggested to have promise
for cancer treatments, some are effective
[SPEAKER_01]: for seizures, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some are being studied by some of the big
pharmaceutical companies right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: like CBDV, for example, has been studied
by GW Pharma for epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're just learning about these rare
cannabinoids right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, until some of the,
you know, well, I guess if we can get them
[SPEAKER_01]: from hemp, we can study them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was going to say, you know, we can't
really study them, but the rules just
[SPEAKER_01]: changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although it's still hard getting some of
these cannabinoids into, I think,
[SPEAKER_01]: the academic research pipeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: As somebody that worked with some of the
universities, I used to live in Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really hard to be able to study
these compounds, and you would have to get
[SPEAKER_01]: them actually imported in from the UK or
Canada, which seemed ridiculous when they
[SPEAKER_01]: were being sold everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, there's actually a lot of
products on the market that we're starting
[SPEAKER_01]: to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, for example, Levelblends has
specific cannabinoid products in tablet
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you're seeing now just CBG tablets
on the market or a TGV or CBN products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sort of interesting because they've
been rolled out, and we don't even know
[SPEAKER_01]: what would happen to a person if they
take, say, a CBG every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like, it's sort of crazy that
these cannabinoids exist, but we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know what they do, you know, in isolation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or together.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that there's a lot of promise,
but there's also, like, a lot of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, maybe we should take a step back
and make sure that we know that these
[SPEAKER_01]: things are safe before we're rolling them
out to everyone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I just would share just another
story.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking to a fairly prominent
research university a couple months ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was before the Farm Bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the comment was from the head of
policy at this university was that we have
[SPEAKER_00]: many, many researchers in our system who
are asking to do this research.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is that, like most
universities being federally funded,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can't figure out a way to do it where
we don't put our federal funding at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do think that we're really on the
brink of a huge opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not sure, you know, I candidly
can't say how many universities have
[SPEAKER_00]: really seized on the rescheduling of
hemp-sourced cannabinoids to pursue the
[SPEAKER_00]: research, but I do think that we're going
to see significant movement on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I really do hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of universities that
have, you know, cannabis and even hemp as
[SPEAKER_01]: advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think Colorado is one of the first
movers in terms of, I think, even
[SPEAKER_01]: accepting money from, say, hemp companies
to do research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what the policies are,
but I know UCLA wouldn't accept cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: money, for example, for research studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping that they allow hemp-funded
studies because, again, the research is
[SPEAKER_01]: great to do, but without funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the federal government really
hasn't been huge on funding this research.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're finally starting to put,
like, maybe, like, $5 million here or
[SPEAKER_01]: there for opioid research looking at
cannabinoids, but, I mean, we need a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more than that to be able to make a dent
in the opioid crisis and also,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, be able to establish how
effective and safe these different
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis products are.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot more than just vaporized or
smoked cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's topical cannabis, which we haven't
even talked about, but there's cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: creams that you can use for pain,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's patches, there's gels,
there's all these different forms of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, and yet we're just starting,
like, hey, let's study what a joint does,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much more that we can be doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I was gonna actually,
so you raised an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first of all, there's this whole,
we talked a little bit before the program
[SPEAKER_00]: today about the contrast between,
you know, to me, I get a lot of flak.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do a lot of work in the addiction
treatment world and a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: in which a lot of people have very
negative attitudes about cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so, you know, usually my response is
twofold.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one is we have a lot of research to
do that we just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There clearly are some concerns to have
around cannabis, but number two,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't have a cannabis crisis to match
the opioid crisis, meaning we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: 50,000 Americans dying of cannabis
overdoses, and so I'm just wondering if
[SPEAKER_00]: you can talk about the sort of,
the concerns, you know, how do you,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a neuroscientist, how do you address
the concerns that people have around
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone usually has that kind of
emotional reaction that people that have
[SPEAKER_01]: an opioid addiction shouldn't be treating,
you know, the opioid addiction or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, people in recovery shouldn't be
using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's usually a good reason for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's usually very emotionally tied.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that I've met that have been so
against it have been, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: they've had this kind of crazy story,
like, okay, my father, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: got high one day and left my sister in the
bathtub and she drowned.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, that's why they're so angry about
people using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, these very, very, you know,
very tragic stories but not things that
[SPEAKER_01]: are, you know, medically based,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can be neglectful with any type of
substance or any drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, think about how many people use
opioids and probably have some kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: child neglect, you know, incident,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we don't mention those kind of things
all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually faced a lot of stigma as a
former drug addiction neuroscientist that
[SPEAKER_01]: ended up researching cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I went back to my old lab in
Dallas, Texas, which was one of the top
[SPEAKER_01]: drug addiction labs in the country and I
actually went back to my mentor that I did
[SPEAKER_01]: my PhD under and she was, you know,
talking to me and she goes, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is okay if it's for those babies
with epilepsy but it'll never be okay for
[SPEAKER_01]: anyone else to use it because it's an
addictive drug and you shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_01]: treating one addiction with another
addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, well, we know how many
people have died from heroin overdose and
[SPEAKER_01]: these other types of drugs or alcohol,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But no one is dying from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the stigma attached to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's still, like, I feel like it's
almost like trying to convince someone who
[SPEAKER_01]: is anti-cannabis sometimes is almost as
hard as trying to convince a Republican to
[SPEAKER_01]: become a Democrat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, sometimes people have these
ingrained biases and there's a part of me
[SPEAKER_01]: that says, okay, you know, where can you
devote your time and energy?
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to devote my time towards being
able to convince people that are open to
[SPEAKER_01]: change and there's some people that just
aren't, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think the flipping point comes to
when somebody who was very, very staunchly
[SPEAKER_01]: against cannabis either needs it
themselves because, oh no, I got diagnosed
[SPEAKER_01]: with breast cancer or my child has
epilepsy, something like that happens and
[SPEAKER_01]: then they go, okay, now it's time for me
to reevaluate my, you know, very,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, biased view of cannabis as a
treatment because, oh no, now I need it,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or now someone I love needs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I found that really the science,
hitting somebody over the head with
[SPEAKER_01]: science sometimes is not so effective,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I always talk about science plus heart
is really where I live because without
[SPEAKER_01]: those stories of people actually really
benefiting from cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can hit them on the head with all the
data in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, unfortunately, the facts are
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The facts have been there for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you know, THC was discovered in
1964, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, Dr. Moshul has been doing studies
on cannabis and seizures for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's been doing all these studies and,
you know, we knew that cannabis was useful
[SPEAKER_01]: for so many different things, but the fact
is that the fact that it was a schedule
[SPEAKER_01]: one drug for so many years since the 60s
has really stigmatized this drug in a way
[SPEAKER_01]: that it's really hard to come after it
with logic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, people were like, well,
if it was actually not harmful,
[SPEAKER_01]: it wasn't something that, you know,
my teenage son just gets high and,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like it's just like lazy stoner
type of stigma associated with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would be living in a different world
where we wouldn't have to convince people
[SPEAKER_01]: of its effectiveness if it was just legal
already, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There are so many challenges with it being
illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we're starting to see
countries like Canada, which has
[SPEAKER_01]: completely federally legalized cannabis,
there's going to be less stigma when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a completely legal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hoping for the day that we turn
around in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you said a couple of things I want to
follow up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So first, you know, you actually touched
on one of the most interesting responses
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to, you know, as I've gone around
the country talking about the opioid
[SPEAKER_00]: crisis and trying to call attention to the
fact that it's a structural systemic
[SPEAKER_00]: problem and not just one of strictly of
greedy drug makers and deceptive
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of longtime people in the addiction
treatment community have thrown back at me
[SPEAKER_00]: that alcohol is, alcohol is a much bigger
problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the numbers, I've heard numbers as
high as 90,000 Americans dying every year
[SPEAKER_00]: from alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's, you touched on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if you have anything else to
say about that, but it really,
[SPEAKER_00]: the more that I, you know, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people have said to me,
once we, you know, again, this is in the
[SPEAKER_00]: addiction treatment community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once we take on opioids and call a,
you know, fully sort of get awareness on
[SPEAKER_00]: opioids, the next target is alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just wondering if you can say,
if you have anything else to say about
[SPEAKER_00]: that contrast.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the scientist world, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: People's passions and what they were
studying was actually based on how much
[SPEAKER_01]: funding there was for different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, there was a lot of stigma
against cannabis because a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: research funds were going towards cannabis
use disorder research, which was how to
[SPEAKER_01]: stop people from becoming addicted.
[SPEAKER_01]: To cannabis or, you know, you know,
all these different treatments that you
[SPEAKER_01]: can give them and pills you can give them
to get them off of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, you know, when you flip it and
try to tell them that cannabis is helpful,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very confusing for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no flip with alcohol, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not like, please drink your alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a good thing for your different
diseases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're never going to see that,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really clear cut to say alcoholism
is bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alcoholism causes all these problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yet alcoholism isn't that sexy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, as a drug addiction scientist,
you're like, well, I don't really want to
[SPEAKER_01]: study alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I drink alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel bad about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, you know, alcohol is good for me,
but not everyone is sort of funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most scientists have, you know,
a pretty blousy opinion about alcoholism,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though it's, you know, one of the
biggest killers out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, though, the major problem
when we talk about substance abuse
[SPEAKER_01]: research and treating these substance
abuse problems is that the problem really
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't substance abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem is these underlying reasons
why people take drugs or they drink,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's lonely to this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's despair.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's trauma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, we are holding onto so much
trauma, and it's harming our ability to
[SPEAKER_01]: function.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harming our ability to hold down our
jobs, to keep families together.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're literally living in a broken
society, and we're putting on the
[SPEAKER_01]: band-aid, whether it's alcohol,
whether it's hard drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some people, it's even cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: As much as I hate to say it, some people
use cannabis in a respectful manner,
[SPEAKER_01]: and some people abuse it, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a very real thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we need to be treating is not so
much substance abuse.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we need to be treating is really the
loneliness epidemic and the depression
[SPEAKER_01]: epidemic, because without that,
we're not going to be able to fix the
[SPEAKER_01]: opioid problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a very important point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the research I did for the book,
for United States of Opioids, the study
[SPEAKER_00]: that actually shocked me the most,
this came out in September of 2018 from
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Pittsburgh Medical Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said at the beginning, we talk about the
opioid crisis as a 20-year phenomenon.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the University of Pittsburgh
researchers found, and I'm happy to send
[SPEAKER_00]: anybody the link if you want to see this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think this is a very important study.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that there's a 40-year
exponentially rising overdose death curve
[SPEAKER_00]: in this country when you take all the
sub-epidemics of drugs and put them
[SPEAKER_00]: together, with the notable exclusion of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you add together the
barbiturates, and the PCP, and coke,
[SPEAKER_00]: and crystal meth, and all of the opioids,
you end up with this exponentially rising
[SPEAKER_00]: curve of deaths.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the conclusions from that are a few
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one, that the government's
effectiveness in terms of pushing down on
[SPEAKER_00]: any one drug is absolutely meaningless,
because the problem pops up someplace
[SPEAKER_00]: else.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like whack-a-mole.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, exactly to your point,
if the market there's a hyper-efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: market of people who are trafficking in
illegal drugs that are killing people,
[SPEAKER_00]: and people who are looking for them,
then the answer is not in drug policy on
[SPEAKER_00]: focusing on any particular drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on the social causes underneath.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the isolation, the stress, the trauma,
as you say, there's a lot of different
[SPEAKER_00]: ways to frame it, but that's the core
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you see cannabis as a, where does
cannabis fall when thinking about that
[SPEAKER_00]: social crisis in America?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so if the real reason why people are
depressed, right, is stress, and they
[SPEAKER_01]: reach to drugs or alcohol to relieve their
stress, and that's causing all these,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the substance abuse and all
these other issues like DUIs, overdoses,
[SPEAKER_01]: deaths, etc.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is the one healthy way that you
can deal with stress, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you can't overdose on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually going to relieve your
stress, relieve your pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there are people that are using
cannabis for stress, and they don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: realize that they actually have chronic
pain until after they stop using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, oh wow, I did actually have
back pain, whoops, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are using cannabis, and it's
actually making them healthier,
[SPEAKER_01]: making them less stressed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: People that use cannabis in relationships
are less likely to actually show domestic
[SPEAKER_01]: violence towards their partners,
and it's actually, those benefits are
[SPEAKER_01]: increased when both partners use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas, you know, if you talk to any
couple, you throw alcohol in with one
[SPEAKER_01]: partner, both partners, you're going to
get domestic violence.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of things that cannabis
can do, both medically, but also
[SPEAKER_01]: emotionally and spiritually, and I think
that there's a lot of people that are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually using cannabis to overcome
trauma, and I'm involved with a
[SPEAKER_01]: documentary called This is Jane that's
actually exploring how cannabis actually
[SPEAKER_01]: helped rape survivors, and other women
beat different forms of trauma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that there's a lot to do with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, nobody is taking OxyContin to
overcome trauma and come out the other
[SPEAKER_01]: side better, but we're seeing this with
cannabis, and I think that there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really think that cannabis can help heal
us both physically, mentally, emotionally,
[SPEAKER_01]: spiritually, and that's not a very
scientist thing to say, but as somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: who is a patient themselves and who helps
patients, I mean, cannabis is really this
[SPEAKER_01]: catalyst where they're using it for one
thing, like, okay, I'm using it for pain,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then they start realizing,
hey, there's these other pieces of my life
[SPEAKER_01]: that are making me feel comfortable,
and I need to work through this.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there's people that have started
cannabis for pain, and then they realize
[SPEAKER_01]: that they need to go see a therapist and,
like, work through some of their trauma
[SPEAKER_01]: and things because they're ready to,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a catalyst for growth in a lot of
ways, and that's something that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't numb you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opioids numb you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis does not numb you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis helps you feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like I have to play devil's
advocate here because while I agree with
[SPEAKER_00]: the potential here, working in addiction
treatment, the fear that a lot of people
[SPEAKER_00]: who work in addiction recovery have is
that, you know, the most promising pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: for addiction recovery is sort of two
elements, is psychosocial community,
[SPEAKER_00]: where people feel like they have a
connection to other people who have been
[SPEAKER_00]: through the same experience, and a
spiritual path that gives them a sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose and meaning, and that's not the
only solution, but those are, when you
[SPEAKER_00]: spend time in addiction recovery,
those are the two elements that really
[SPEAKER_00]: characterize social model addiction
recovery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, a lot of people who I talk
to who, you know, either who have come
[SPEAKER_00]: into recovery post-heavy cannabis use or
parents who are struggling with what their
[SPEAKER_00]: kids should do, worry that cannabis use
can be an isolating factor that some
[SPEAKER_00]: people get stuck using it, so I'm
wondering if you had to, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: you said some very, you know, bold things
about cannabis' spiritual potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just wondering if you wanna frame it,
or if you would sort of contextualize it
[SPEAKER_00]: within the broader thinking about what
recovery looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so I mean, everything is context,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Context, frequency, your intention with
use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I talk actually a lot to groups that
focus on young people and depression and
[SPEAKER_01]: what the difference is between using drugs
to numb yourself versus using drugs to
[SPEAKER_01]: elevate yourself, and again, cannabis
being one of those drugs that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: either have this very negative thing where
it can be isolating, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you smoke every day on the couch by
yourself and you never get out to
[SPEAKER_01]: socialize or do anything like that,
you're just home playing video games every
[SPEAKER_01]: day, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That might not be the healthiest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do want people to be able to use
cannabis and actually go outside,
[SPEAKER_01]: go for hikes, play sports.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually one of the most
fascinating things for me, and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's actually really relevant because of
what we're gonna be talking about next
[SPEAKER_01]: with the panel, is that there's so many
people that were chronically ill,
[SPEAKER_01]: dependent on opioids, that then switched
to cannabis, and before, when they were on
[SPEAKER_01]: opioids, they were so sick and so
depressed and just so victimized by the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole situation that they didn't work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were too sick to ever be able to be
anything but a sick patient, and now we
[SPEAKER_01]: see these patients that have gone off of
opioids and onto cannabis, and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually able to work out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis actually helps them be able
to be able to do yoga or to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: exercise or to be able to go outside and
do things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have motivation to go exercise,
so I think that there's some pieces there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about how you use cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You can use any substance for harm or for
good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think cannabis, it's about informing
the patients about how to properly use
[SPEAKER_01]: this, and I don't think any doctor out
there, by the way, is like, please smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: this joint and go take a hike.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your bartender might be giving that advice
instead, but that's one of the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we really explore as health coaches,
is being able to do that, and I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a very different model than traditional
recovery.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are different conversations we're
having about using this substance and
[SPEAKER_01]: about where you should be using it,
what you should be doing with it,
[SPEAKER_01]: and be able to use basically the altered
state of consciousness, which normally
[SPEAKER_01]: people that work in recovery don't want
you to go for altered states of
[SPEAKER_01]: consciousness, but here it's reframing the
high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a different type of high,
and again, it's about the context where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're able to engage people better
when you're on cannabis and be able to be
[SPEAKER_01]: more social, that is really, really
important, and for a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_01]: are abusing drugs, they're very isolated.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not able to connect with others,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe sober, they're still not able to
connect with others, and I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: people that feel they can explore cannabis
safely and not feel like they are breaking
[SPEAKER_01]: their sobriety and are supported by others
that have used cannabis successfully,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's something really
exciting there, and I really applaud the
[SPEAKER_01]: groups that have explored using cannabis
or allowing cannabis, say, in a rehab
[SPEAKER_01]: facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some groups here that are,
you know, in Los Angeles that are allowing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis use, but to be able to say,
are you still sober if you're using
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, is an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'll just share with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the big issues in addiction
treatment today has been
[SPEAKER_00]: medication-assisted treatment,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The primary medication that's being used
to combat opioid addiction these days is
[SPEAKER_00]: buprenorphine, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in Suboxone, Subutex, Sublocate,
all of these products that are being given
[SPEAKER_00]: to people who are addicted to opioids,
and the point of these drugs is that you
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially help people bypass the pain of
withdrawal and the discomfort of
[SPEAKER_00]: withdrawal because you put them on these
drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The addiction treatment community,
the long-time people who have been
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in social model, abstinence-based
addiction and recovery are very leery of
[SPEAKER_00]: buprenorphine as they are of methadone,
which has been with us longer for heroin,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they essentially, it takes away
the pain point that drives people to seek
[SPEAKER_00]: out community and to find a spiritual
path, and so it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to tell you, I am seeing one of the
things that's very exciting is that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing a beginning of cannabis being used
in recovery because of the promise for
[SPEAKER_00]: getting people off of opioids,
but at the same time, I think it's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: be a slow adoption.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're seeing is that essentially the
federal and state government are
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially forcing the addiction
treatment community to come to terms with
[SPEAKER_00]: buprenorphine and medication-assisted
treatment by saying you can't discriminate
[SPEAKER_00]: against people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a major case, the federal
government pursued in Virginia at a
[SPEAKER_00]: chronic pain clinic called Selma Medical
Associates, where the government actually
[SPEAKER_00]: came in and sued under the Americans with
Disabilities Act for a pain clinic that
[SPEAKER_00]: said to a patient in chronic pain who was
on buprenorphine, we're not going to treat
[SPEAKER_00]: you because we don't deal with people who
are taking a form of MAT, of taking
[SPEAKER_00]: suboxone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I actually think that there's a lot of
promise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny, this is a challenging issue
when I speak to people in addiction
[SPEAKER_00]: recovery in the addiction treatment
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are not excited about this push by
the government for MAT, but I actually
[SPEAKER_00]: think that what your comment really made
me think is that we are likely to see a
[SPEAKER_00]: growing acceptance of cannabis as a form
of medication that helps people make a
[SPEAKER_00]: transition off of a far more dangerous
drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, and I think it's very
interesting that we've seen actually
[SPEAKER_01]: people that have been involved in the
opioid industry actually go into the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, people that were involved with
releasing OxyContin then invested and
[SPEAKER_01]: launched companies, cannabis companies in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also seen, and I'm totally blanking
on the name of the drug, but there was
[SPEAKER_01]: someone else that was involved in creating
a medication for opioid addiction abuse
[SPEAKER_01]: that ended up working on a cannabis
product to treat opioid addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny, a lot of people that came
out looking to try to solve the opioid
[SPEAKER_01]: addiction problem are now turning to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the one thing that I have to note is
should we give the reins of that to people
[SPEAKER_01]: that caused the problem in the first
place?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they creating cannabis products that
are going to help, or are they going to
[SPEAKER_01]: create another cannabis product that's
more harmful, that could even be abused?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's a lot of ethical
issues in the opioid industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have to be careful about how these
products are being used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we creating products that might have
more abuse liability?
[SPEAKER_01]: THC by itself is not exactly as safe as
the full plant extract, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you actually triggered, this was
something that you said earlier that I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to pick up on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're at this very funny point right
now where we have a whole series of more
[SPEAKER_00]: than 30 states that have decriminalized in
some form and we have a whole set of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid cannabis products coming out
in these states, here in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have the FDA kind of standing down,
other than with respect to the three
[SPEAKER_00]: approved cannabis drugs, Marinal,
C-Summit, and Epidiolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even Sativex, which has been approved in a
number of other countries, still going
[SPEAKER_00]: through the FDA process here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm wondering if you, in this period,
you made a reference earlier to not quite
[SPEAKER_00]: of the questions about different products.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you suggest that people navigate
the, I mean, this question of products in
[SPEAKER_00]: the states that are not fully,
having gone through FDA approval and are
[SPEAKER_00]: making claims that may or may not be borne
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have any thought about that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, if your CBD water says it'll cure
drug addiction, probably don't buy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that sounds like a joke, but I mean,
three or four years ago, there were
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that were advertising these
things, like literally, drink this water
[SPEAKER_01]: and you'll cure your PTSD and addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to be really careful with the
products that are on the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technically, I worked in nutraceutical
formulation compliance before I worked in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as part of the industry,
and there's certain things that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: say with nutraceuticals and there's
certain things you can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even though we're not a completely
legal industry, I still tell companies,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, please, act like you are,
is a nutraceutical, and follow the rules
[SPEAKER_01]: that say you can't be treating medical
conditions on the label.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some people that have products
that are marketed for opiate addiction,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's like, you can't say it unless
your product was actually involved in a
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical study, and you have the validated
results that say, my product went in a
[SPEAKER_01]: double-blind study.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are some clinical trials right
now with products that are going through
[SPEAKER_01]: that, and only those companies can claim
that their product does that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But a lot of times you'll see this,
we saw this in the nutraceutical world,
[SPEAKER_01]: where people were just jumping on the
published results of another company,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're like, well, that's not even the
same substance, it's not the same dosage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't say that that result is what's
gonna happen if somebody takes your
[SPEAKER_01]: vitamin or your supplement.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that right now, it's sort of
buyer beware.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're trying to work with different
products, really work with a professional
[SPEAKER_01]: that knows what they're doing,
that can steer you towards quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: tested products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have, unfortunately, met a lot of people
that are looking for high-dose THC
[SPEAKER_01]: products to get them off of heroin,
for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can't get thousands of
milligrams, they can't afford the products
[SPEAKER_01]: that are in the dispensaries, so they go
to a caregiver or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're talking, there are patients all
across the country, some of them are not
[SPEAKER_01]: even in legal markets, and they're going,
well, my brother's gonna die of heroin
[SPEAKER_01]: overdose, so we don't care where we get
this RSO or Rick Simpson oil or something,
[SPEAKER_01]: we just need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that they'll be able to get off of
heroin by themselves, and you're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is a little dicey and a little
dangerous, and that's because a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: products that are available on the black
market are available from growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes aren't even what they say,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There was actually people that thought
they were buying Rick Simpson oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is really high-potency THC oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns out, it didn't even have any THC in
them, it was actually CBD oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: very little, and it had a bunch of other
gross things in it, and that's why we need
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need high-quality products because
getting somebody off of drugs is not an
[SPEAKER_01]: easy process.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is why we have detox centers,
this is why we have rehabilitation
[SPEAKER_01]: centers, and to think that there are
people, because of whatever the laws are,
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever the supply is out there,
that they're going through these back
[SPEAKER_01]: alley sources to be able to get off of
opioids is very dangerous and very scary,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's something that we don't want
anyone to die, but we also don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: die from the treatment, and so I think
that there's a lot of cool things that are
[SPEAKER_01]: happening in terms of plant-assisted
treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually know someone who started a
facility in Maine where she actually has
[SPEAKER_01]: professionals that are trained in
addiction treatment actually be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: watch people go through the heroin or
opioid detox, and they have a real program
[SPEAKER_01]: there, and they are able to give them
cannabis and watch them go through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They even have a therapy program where
they teach them how to grow their own
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, so that when they're out of rehab,
that they can actually afford their
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment because they're growing their
own medicine rather than trying to spend
[SPEAKER_01]: thousands and thousands of dollars on
high-dose THC products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that there's responsible programs
out there, there's responsible brands out
[SPEAKER_01]: there, but then there's a lot of,
unfortunately, still a mishmash of things
[SPEAKER_01]: that shouldn't be out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really hope that more brands and more
dispensers really try to establish
[SPEAKER_01]: programs to help opioid abusers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see this in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was actually a lot of study studies
in Canada looking at how we can use
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis to help opioid abusers,
and we haven't seen the same in the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States, and I really hope that the
dispensary systems become sort of maybe a
[SPEAKER_01]: first step in opioid abuse care rather
than the last step.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you guys want to take a couple
questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: That sounds great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does anybody have a question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say the, for example, NFL Players
Association hires you as a strategist.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are a lot of sports leagues,
but I feel like the NFL is kind of a
[SPEAKER_02]: laggard in the sense that it's almost
forcing prescription painkiller addiction
[SPEAKER_02]: on its employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have decades of systematic handing out
of pills and slapping on the ass and
[SPEAKER_02]: saying, get back out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the NFL Players Association hired you,
what would your chief strategist go?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, I'll just tell you,
my own background on this issue is I was
[SPEAKER_00]: contacted by three different NFL teams.
[SPEAKER_00]: Technically, I was hired by a criminal
defense lawyer in two of the cases who was
[SPEAKER_00]: working with teams, because what we saw
going on in the late 2000s, early 2010,
[SPEAKER_00]: 2011 period was that you had a bunch of
doctors affiliated with NFL teams who were
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit wowed by the celebrity of
being around NFL players, and what we saw
[SPEAKER_00]: was just all the rules went out the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secure sort of storage of prescription
medications, Vicodin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk about pill mills being places
where doctors were just giving out the
[SPEAKER_00]: opioids.
[SPEAKER_00]: They weren't selling them on NFL teams.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were just giving them out and putting
them in the hands of players and not
[SPEAKER_00]: practicing medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were basically just enabling a bad
culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if the NFL Players Association wanted
to work with me, what I would say first
[SPEAKER_00]: and foremost is the conversation needs to
get outside of just talking to Goodall's
[SPEAKER_00]: office.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bottom line is the commissioner and
the league have been so myopic and so
[SPEAKER_00]: locked down on the potential for cannabis
to be a difference maker and also to the
[SPEAKER_00]: destructive role that opioids are playing,
the role in which they're masking pain
[SPEAKER_00]: serious nerve damage, and leading to a
physical dependency that's leaving so many
[SPEAKER_00]: players both still in the league and
retired really suffering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think this needs to be a national
conversation, and I think that the Players
[SPEAKER_00]: Association needs to take that message to
the American public.
[SPEAKER_00]: The American public has stood with NFL
players on the concussion issues,
[SPEAKER_00]: on their concerns about concussions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a deep sympathy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone was shocked when Nike created a
campaign that was really heroic around NFL
[SPEAKER_00]: players.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it was divisive, but I'm saying
that was heroic around players standing up
[SPEAKER_00]: for what they believed in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the NFL Players
Association should go to the American
[SPEAKER_00]: public and really make an advocacy
campaign that will get this away from
[SPEAKER_00]: Roger Goodall and in the hands of,
and make this a concern that the league
[SPEAKER_00]: understands that viewers are unhappy that
the league is essentially perpetuating the
[SPEAKER_00]: opioid crisis and missing a huge
opportunity to offer a new therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that starts with awareness,
and that starts with players sharing their
[SPEAKER_00]: stories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm excited to hear from Kasim,
and I really think hearing from players
[SPEAKER_00]: currently dealing with the stress on the
human body of playing football and alumni,
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans who are living with the effects
after, the extent to which people are
[SPEAKER_00]: sacrificing their bodies, and the role
that opioids are playing, I think would be
[SPEAKER_00]: just mind-boggling for, and I think people
would, people care, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember 1996, I was just a baby lawyer
back then, but when Brett Favre was
[SPEAKER_00]: addicted to Vicodin, when that came out,
that just like blew my world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was amazing to me to think back how
that didn't register with everybody,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was just another story of one person's
addiction, we didn't think about it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: systemic way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I would say to the Players
Association is, you've got such an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity, this moment in time,
we're really just beginning to wrap our
[SPEAKER_00]: heads around how big this crisis is,
and to take people who so many Americans
[SPEAKER_00]: look up to, my own kids, I have four kids,
who are really like their heroes,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't wanna be unpopular in LA,
I'm from Detroit, I'm a Detroit Lion fan,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, Cassima, I know you spent a year
or two there, but to be able to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's an issue that gets through
to people, and that would move the needle,
[SPEAKER_00]: and getting away from just letting the
league tell its own story on this would be
[SPEAKER_00]: all the difference in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you both very much, I appreciate it,
and we are gonna continue the conversation
[SPEAKER_02]: and change gears with little, some people
who have felt pain and kind of how they
[SPEAKER_02]: dealt with it, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, thanks, I really appreciate it.
Thank you.
