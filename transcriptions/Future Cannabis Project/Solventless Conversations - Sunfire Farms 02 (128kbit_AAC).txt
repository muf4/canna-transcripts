[SPEAKER_03]: All right, so did we we went through the
lineup, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I think I have like two more.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I just say it now, but the Wi-Fi,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, just like two more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this one's kind of low,
but this is papaya lava cake with the
[SPEAKER_02]: papaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a There's like this is actually
papaya og mixed wash with lava cake both I
[SPEAKER_01]: got as a clone gifts in that this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah both goddess clone gifts and So the
papaya og isn't like that papaya fino that
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's like washing that has like that
super like Papaya turf, but it's still
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty prevalent then mixed with the lava
cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got a little bit of like a gassiness
to it But yeah, I don't think I've tried
[SPEAKER_02]: the papaya before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah But it's still there like you can
still sense that like tropical kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: vibe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we need to tropical that hit it I'm
never good at describing like flavors,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, it's like a tropical like a
punch Right, right like juice tropical
[SPEAKER_02]: juice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like tropical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I wish I kind of I was like kind of
just wanted to wash up a pie on its own
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of bummed I didn't but what's
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, these are both Wi-Fi cookies right
here Just like different like
[SPEAKER_01]: consistencies I thought you're gonna see
that was more papaya.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah That's the last of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, the papaya was just one big
full-term plant this year's angle them
[SPEAKER_01]: this way like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Okay, 70 to 190 so pretty much
everything but the one well 189 yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so everything with the 190 bag and then
the 40 it did not include.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the 40 right here though separate
But yeah interesting the Wi-Fi this one's
[SPEAKER_01]: been in the fridge for like a month and a
half I haven't dabbed out of this in a
[SPEAKER_01]: minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's crazy It's like it always changes
while it's in the fridge a little bit like
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know Does it like crystallizes or
it gets like more wet or sometimes it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: like get less wet but more like Yeah,
it does like when you say that's improving
[SPEAKER_03]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I feel like it improves like not the
fresh press like the fresh press stays the
[SPEAKER_01]: same in the fridge But the like the stuff
that you make into like wet batter and
[SPEAKER_01]: like you cold cure before.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's this one?
[SPEAKER_01]: The Wi-Fi cookies Which is another one
that I was like hunting through this year
[SPEAKER_01]: from from clone to like and that was a
good hasher This is almost like minty or
[SPEAKER_01]: like uplifting yeah, yeah It's kind of
more happy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just smelt like the terpenes if you
just like keep smelling them No,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that's it Yeah, this is just a
full spectrum right here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that bad boy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, this is the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I already showed you the 90 This oh,
this is a little hash press.
[SPEAKER_01]: I made this dude I can barely really last
but I didn't really make the full thing
[SPEAKER_01]: but I had a little bit of help but I made
the little implosion kind of and I
[SPEAKER_01]: connected it I Made the I pushed out the
little press.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so that for just like flattening
hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Oh like like like full melt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah like this Press out some hashish
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's that melts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is So nice never pressed out hash
before this is already pretty greasy but
[SPEAKER_01]: Take out a bit here Wow, super greasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a straight hat.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a lot Yeah, it's a nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are two gram two gram jar So a nice
little p5 or so For us, I mean you could
[SPEAKER_01]: finger press it like you don't need the
right to do it But it's nice to kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: get it nice and thin and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like there's a finger press But
that's like super thick we can press it
[SPEAKER_01]: into more dabs and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get the little press You can just use a
dab or two and like a flathead dab or just
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't want to get it too high.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really barely need any heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just flash with the torch This this
press is pretty small.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of right kind of shitty,
but it works for it works small batch
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's mini, you know It's portable I
used to have this really nice like resin
[SPEAKER_01]: extract press.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like this big like flat like this
Why they could just like so sorry this
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff you just put in there is basically
like right before you would press it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then you're pressing at the last
minute instead of pressing in advance,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'm just kind of pressing out press
Yeah, it's pretty much like just being
[SPEAKER_01]: pressed out and flattened into a patty
with like Minimal heat instead of actually
[SPEAKER_01]: being like pressed where like the rosin
oil is secreting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just still the live heads Dude,
my my cap is being so sketch right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, put that in there It's an expensive
cap to break you don't want that to break
[SPEAKER_01]: I should really put that on the right who
made that one again Um, this is binary
[SPEAKER_01]: mothership binary.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like their carb cap series that
they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, here's the house pressed out He's
cut a line, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah or a flag people call it flags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, it's a good way to Yeah,
but yeah, it's all good I'm up for a
[SPEAKER_02]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Take a fat flag and coach.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will really put you in the zone for
sure Yeah, I don't press too much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I don't smoke too much full melt
like this, you know Yeah, and it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: such a it's like so nice to like play with
like beautiful resin like I love like just
[SPEAKER_01]: playing with it and like looking at it's
like Very cool
[SPEAKER_03]: By the way being super high and trying to
keep up with you with the camera Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry, haha.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take this down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Should I not?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll take it and you guys can take those
as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hold it Yeah, so hold it there Okay,
should we go with the background with like
[SPEAKER_01]: that All right Cuz back in the day before
people were pressing rosin like this was a
[SPEAKER_01]: this was like the thing to do like press
out your hash You know like cut your
[SPEAKER_01]: flags.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the the tradition the vibe
Hopefully that doesn't fall off I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: like to I don't like to use these little
beads when I'm smoking full melt Kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: annoying and why is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um When you're q-tipping it like it's hard
to get all the hash off the bead and I
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of I don't know kind of Stays
hot longer than the banger does I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like it can kind of scorch your hash at
times It's kind of get I get better temps
[SPEAKER_01]: just like without it so
[SPEAKER_03]: I still love that you said you walk around
pretty much everywhere with that ice box.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I do if I'm going somewhere to sesh or
to go go smoke it's only if I have Like if
[SPEAKER_03]: I thinking maybe I'm gonna like,
okay, so now like in your regular day of
[SPEAKER_03]: like yeah grocery store, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Definitely not the backseat of the car.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Don't like you guys actually emergency
kit.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a little hash on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I was like, dude, I feel something
I just saw it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just that's literally hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a GMO What the hell Sorry,
[SPEAKER_02]: but yeah, I used to carry One just like
that around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you fit a full pack in it But I fit
the torch right a rig the hash and that
[SPEAKER_01]: was my daily man Like if I'm going to sesh
with just my buddies locally like I'm not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna bring this cooler Maybe if I'm going
somewhere like farther away or maybe I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: meet some new people that maybe you want
to grab a couple fresh grams I'll like
[SPEAKER_01]: have a nice little cooler to keep around
or if I'm going somewhere for a couple
[SPEAKER_03]: days is rare like I respect You're giving
me so much right immediately cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, totally got to keep those trips
fresh for the people For nice smoke what
[SPEAKER_03]: you did.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah in its best form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, you know people are very it's
like It there's a lot of quality out there
[SPEAKER_01]: and people are like very it's competitive
and people are very like judgmental I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like but it's it's cool to like Do your
best, you know, no matter what people most
[SPEAKER_01]: people Will enjoy when you're doing your
best.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I don't know High thoughts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It shows, you know, it truly shows.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks Yeah, my hash didn't last it always
went fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just smoked it right away,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I never had time to experiment with like
cold curing keeping it in the fridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have one jar I'm leaving in there now
and see what's up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: See how long you stay in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely It's like that cold cure thing
is a really broad term because most people
[SPEAKER_01]: who are Cold curing aren't actually curing
it in the cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like just a room temp curing it
and Calling it cold cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like but it's pocket not hot here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know room temp cure So do you go a
little longer this is a pretty fat dad
[SPEAKER_01]: will probably go like 145 Sorry,
that's how long you're letting it cool
[SPEAKER_02]: down for yeah The banger which is for some
time this looks kind of long, you know One
[SPEAKER_02]: minute is usually what I have mine,
but they're all every glass piece is
[SPEAKER_02]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so they say what temperature is it
like heat it with the torch for The
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature that this nail was when I just
dabbed it was probably around like 580
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees I believe my buddies have like
that temp tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a little gauge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're they're saying one or the
other one that goes underneath Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used them both I guess like their
temperature reading like on the
[SPEAKER_01]: thermometer You're supposed to like we go
at 380 and then the other one we go like
[SPEAKER_01]: 580 You see you got dial it you no matter
what it says like you just dial it in what
[SPEAKER_02]: your temp is and then use the wrist tech
You know hold your wrist Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still like the timer Timers always good.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no in the glass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah takes a few maybe takes a few hot dab
Right, maybe a few cold dabs.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can always reheat it though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get cold start Do you ever mess with
taking cold start dabs?
[SPEAKER_01]: I do take cold start dabs, but pretty
rarely I don't really like taking them
[SPEAKER_01]: that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know I feel like you have to have
I had one so much of this size,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was a rounded Bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, yeah, no, you can get some nice
cold start dabs for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I'll do it when I'm like,
that's when I was scared to take hot
[SPEAKER_02]: dazzle.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah starts is just guarantee right
sometimes I'll be super tired and like but
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll like Need to like get a little stone,
you know, if I'm like going to sleep or
[SPEAKER_01]: something like dude I need to like I'm so
fucking tired, but I just need to like
[SPEAKER_01]: take a quick dab But I don't want to
fucking torch myself for a minute and a
[SPEAKER_01]: half and then wait a minute process Yeah,
so I'll just be like fucking cold start
[SPEAKER_02]: You familiar with the OG quartz No,
actually, yeah, he supposedly he's like
[SPEAKER_02]: this German glass German quartz,
you know Nice and he has a design to it
[SPEAKER_02]: the cap to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah made like we're talking about
like the emails earlier It's sick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think an email will go with it But
like emails on my list of like yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: I need to have you know, right put that in
the igloo Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call my shed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just feel like if I had one I would like
take too many dabs I don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean for you for you like for me when
I'm working Yeah, yeah, I'll go like four
[SPEAKER_02]: hours straight or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like right same and not like oh but I
think oh snap I haven't dabbed it yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you dab when you wake up in the
morning?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like it's a wake in the bag dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're waking the bake is a normal thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it is for me Yeah, I didn't call it
waking bake the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the kind of cliche We're yeah,
just a normal wake like a a morning sesh
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, like before you get out for
the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you call that waking?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know coffee?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just your cup of coffee.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like waking bake is like you
literally wake up and the first thing you
[SPEAKER_01]: do is like smoke and like I don't like to
do that like I like to water my plants
[SPEAKER_01]: before I before I smoke because like if I
feel like just waking up and taking a big
[SPEAKER_01]: dab is like They're just any dab.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you just so high right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you kind of I don't know I'm
like I can go back to bed right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Yeah, I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, if I got nothing to do and I take a
take a fat dab in the morning Then I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: probably not gonna do nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But usually when I'm like today Actually
today I didn't dab till like 12.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I was busy right out the door And
this is the mindset to you like and I
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't think I didn't realize until I was
dabbing my girl This is my first dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Beautiful I'll take the bigger one
Yeah, you're already got too much going on
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm helping you out.
[SPEAKER_01]: No beautiful I'd say 145 is perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: See I love like This is just heads Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just oil Just a little bit of plant
separated trichomes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah This is ice and water Oh my god,
I almost restarted the time sometimes I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: do that on accident
[SPEAKER_03]: How was that how you was like missing your
stop on an elevator mine was like a little
[SPEAKER_02]: cold, okay Yeah, I'm gonna go a little
little sooner than yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Are we feeling like I'd say 144 is
like no earlier than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are our expectations right now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Full flavor and it'll be cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can prepare the hopefully a little
yeah punch to the chest
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, it looks pretty good actually it
just what's the full melt like if you go a
[SPEAKER_01]: little too hot you can like Hurt the
flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah a little bit you can get more of a
hashy flavor than the turkey flavor But
[SPEAKER_01]: how was it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, this is actually smells More
turkey than hash you so right on the like
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah And it's good to get that you
get that punch to you with the hotter melt
[SPEAKER_03]: dab for sure So when you smoke people out
and like nobody ever had to complain are
[SPEAKER_01]: you like Yeah, I am it's usually like
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one ever really complained.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever had a complaint?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they'll be like came like it's like
Super super rare, but like, you know not
[SPEAKER_01]: like sometimes to be like, oh Like I had a
buddy he was like, oh you should stick to
[SPEAKER_01]: this like these two strains, you know,
the other one I gave it a B.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay, man But no, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we were watching a bunch of strains
like other things are better than others
[SPEAKER_01]: and like you got a you know Not
everything's to be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the process of making things
that everything's gonna be great,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, yeah, it's like you're not maybe
you're really Sit once but you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna continuously release something.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's all part of the the process like
I've only been washing my own material for
[SPEAKER_01]: like six months.
[SPEAKER_02]: So My baby knew this like blazing people
out or smoking them out is the whole temp
[SPEAKER_02]: thing because I don't have like the email
Yeah thermometer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm always worried like oh, is it too hot
because that will taint the flavor and
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll turn someone off Right do your
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So no for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I feel I tried to That's what you got to
educate that low temp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah for a For an ice ash, you know,
right educate them on where it's coming
[SPEAKER_02]: from how it's made to build the value
behind it I think yeah but I think it's I
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's building for sure the market
and the the need right Especially with the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole like vape Epidemic there,
you know, we're calling it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's kind of open the doors and it's
like this about like madness.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah About like people hating like usually
there's always gonna be Haters but like
[SPEAKER_01]: usually they're the your haters are people
that are like doing a lot less than you're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing You know, they're just like watching
and shit I like I like hearing people say
[SPEAKER_02]: like yeah, you know, it's it's great You
know, but it's never gonna be something
[SPEAKER_02]: like that you can do for a living and I
just like smile like I'm crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You live in Iraq.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean people are doing this for living
hashes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely scalable and Yeah,
it's gonna be like we need more guys like
[SPEAKER_02]: you to doing small craft people are and
look for that Just like the beer brewers
[SPEAKER_02]: out there Yeah, I want to go to the beer
brewing place and like right have a beer
[SPEAKER_02]: where they're brewing it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of people like me and a lot of
people like they're not looking for like
[SPEAKER_01]: Tons of money and live this like baller
lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want to have a good living and
growing crops Maybe cannabis and other
[SPEAKER_03]: things like freedom My biggest issue with
how kind of California cannabis played out
[SPEAKER_03]: is that five years ago was all crap people
The husband and wife in their kitchen who
[SPEAKER_03]: were making like yeah tinctures and salves
and bombs You meet them at events and
[SPEAKER_03]: they'd have a booth and they'd be all
proud about what they made Maybe like we
[SPEAKER_03]: just hired our first employee like as a
small business like you yeah hired someone
[SPEAKER_03]: and this is her she's our head of sales
and marketing right and like just the joy
[SPEAKER_03]: Everyone had right and then like it's so
those people were like dear to like Bambi
[SPEAKER_03]: out to slaughter like here comes
legalization and like Yeah, it's really
[SPEAKER_03]: sad Barbarian hordes of yeah I pictured is
like a pig is ripping out all these
[SPEAKER_02]: beautiful plants my garden saying you're
out So my point is it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could have structured the regulations
In a way that was like, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to be an industry like like think
about Alcoholic beverage there.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like two companies that control
distribution and they just buy like
[SPEAKER_03]: anytime a small brain comes up They just
buy them same with Soft drinks like Coke
[SPEAKER_03]: and Pepsi and then like cell phones.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like five companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So California cannabis could have been
like We want to be a mom and pop it
[SPEAKER_03]: because you can you're closed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just one state that can kind of
like set its own course For sure,
[SPEAKER_03]: so they could have been like we're gonna
structure it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So only mom and pop companies can exist
for like five years Yeah, and then I just
[SPEAKER_03]: planted a little rude Yeah, cuz like we
don't need one company owning every
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary like Starbucks owns every
coffee shop for like McDonald's owns every
[SPEAKER_02]: side of highway running talks Lobbyists
and all that money coming in but anyway I
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know what got us on that what got us
on that topic Yeah That hit me in the
[SPEAKER_02]: chest pretty good Yeah, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah sick But yeah, it's crazy like
working out the dispenser like seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: sales reps from I used to be like you were
inside growers actually come in that grew
[SPEAKER_01]: the material and now like having these
sales reps being like This is calm and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the best and like we have the best
flower and it's like I'm just like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my like so cringe people that don't
know it's like I just have to like buy my
[SPEAKER_01]: cuz I I'm really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I'm a nice guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I'm just like Yeah, but it's
like it's to a point where it's like shut
[SPEAKER_01]: up like you're you don't Like that the
hashing in podcast the other day like he
[SPEAKER_01]: was saying like Those people calling calm
and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like ruining people's hard work that
worked to breed like those strains There's
[SPEAKER_01]: like, oh, let's just call like Girl Scout
or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's just call That's you know,
yeah, it's like well Uplift like the least
[SPEAKER_01]: you could do is like strain that it is Way
better because it because it has the names
[SPEAKER_02]: have meaning behind it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like and that's what I mean, that's what I
want Yeah, you don't want to just like I
[SPEAKER_01]: know people need to be like newbies need
to be educated But they could just do it
[SPEAKER_01]: in a different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know Newbies need educated big
time now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I pick when you mentioned like
the bartender I pictured first time smoker
[SPEAKER_02]: gets a job having She's just happy first
time smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, this does make me calm You at
the dispensary we're dealing with both
[SPEAKER_03]: like sales reps replacing the farmers and
then bud tenders who like Are like I just
[SPEAKER_03]: graduated college and I've never smoked a
joint before in my life Yeah, and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: who you're new like the person you're
working with is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like Maybe they they've smoked before
but it's like soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like the yeah, it's It's tough
being next to people that yeah aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: passionate like you are and you're getting
you know Paid a similar price that they're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting, you know, similar rate that
they're getting paid.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like It's like I'm just gonna make
bomb product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, do my own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really stoked that I'm there Thanks,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've been following him on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I don't know how long but like ever
since I've been following I was your first
[SPEAKER_02]: follower We're pretty local.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a lot of people who do it
around us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like someone near me I have a it
was like finding a brother that you didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: know you had kind of I have a brother Hey,
you know, it's so we this is the first
[SPEAKER_02]: time we met but like I've been following
I'm like sweet First time today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah We carpool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so is he just standing on the side
of the road like We like two hours outside
[SPEAKER_02]: it's out Yeah, it's scooped him up with
his cooler.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: One does the guy One time someone grabbed
some hash for me like he came to my house
[SPEAKER_01]: and for some reason like the text
delivered like 45 minutes after he arrived
[SPEAKER_01]: He's like here and like I got the text and
said here 45 minutes ago I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my god, like I looked outside and the
dude was like still there and I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, dude I'm so sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have called you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I felt so bad, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I felt so bad Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so Can I try that papaya dude go for it
man scoop out a dab?
[SPEAKER_03]: I was talking about like like being this
like and the show host for like the
[SPEAKER_03]: solventless hour and then Thank you,
yeah, and we're gonna do the like the
[SPEAKER_03]: flower hour I love I just wrapped that up
and go to studio C and it's like Go wash
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you how it's done.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the live resin show Yeah,
we've got the tutorials coming up next Up
[SPEAKER_02]: next is uh, oh the dry met didn't bring a
tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Did you I forgot it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure it's just like it's normal
baking.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's like it's like seven inches wide
by like 20 For the freeze-dryer
[SPEAKER_01]: freeze-dryer trans right because you
always see those people like posting full
[SPEAKER_01]: trays and like I Feel like a lot of people
think they're like bigger than they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really not that large But you can
fit a lot of hash on there like and it
[SPEAKER_01]: also depends on how thick it is like I can
I've like posted pictures like a full tray
[SPEAKER_01]: of hash that is a lot of hash there's like
a hundred grams or so on there but like
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also seen other full trays that
probably have a lot more because of how
[SPEAKER_01]: like dense think it is yeah, it's like You
can fit so much hash in the end those
[SPEAKER_01]: small freeze-dryers.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how deep is it amazing?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a half inch or maybe three
quarters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very deep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you uh, is there can you not go here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you only go so deep or does it
recommend or I don't know do you
[SPEAKER_02]: recommend?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure there's no hash instructions on
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thinner the better, but like you can
go pretty thick like I've loaded a lot on
[SPEAKER_01]: a tray and it dries perfectly,
you know, so It's just like knowing how
[SPEAKER_01]: long like it takes to dry and also like
depends on a cool it depends on like the
[SPEAKER_01]: Like how much water is in there the the
hash when you put it on the tray,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, right I'm sure you try and like
Wick a good amount of the moisture out
[SPEAKER_01]: before you put it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a lot of it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, almost I want all of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the freeze-dryer you can kind of
like pour wet hash on the shit and it'll
[SPEAKER_02]: dry it but like I'm a little envious on
you guys because you guys just you could
[SPEAKER_02]: just dump it all wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's super easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like it's better to dry it if when you
do dry it out and leave in the bag and
[SPEAKER_01]: like You know wick a lot out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll uh, I would say like 140.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh There's no fucking beat in there 135.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay But I forgot I was talking about So
wait That's the first time that happens
[SPEAKER_03]: good is this a harvest rate tray or is
this a tray made specially for the
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a normal harvest right tray.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're just about what we're gonna bring it
in here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah Yeah, just sounds like a prop you
said maybe bring a prop to show Since he
[SPEAKER_01]: brought the back the cans
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful they got me a little bit by the
boo-boo.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was all for forgetting the tray.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Yep, you're forgiven for giving by the
dams You make me cry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beginning right in the nose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Excuse me Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have some straight lava cake going
right now in the half of the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: It's straight lava cake and I'm pretty
hyped on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's gonna be ready like mid-december,
which is the next crop So that's half of
[SPEAKER_03]: one location.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's half of everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, that is so I have two greenhouses
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm pretty sad.
[SPEAKER_01]: I try to like since there's four beds
technically, there's Six beds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I try to do like pictures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I will for sure definitely So I can
cut to it and be like, okay word.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty well in my pad Oh,
no worries.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, they'd be with the beeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would have helped.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, it's all good Looks so fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a fat puddle all day.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to myself is to keep drinks in the
fridge here Not having a drink for the
[SPEAKER_03]: past hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no As I'm watching you, yeah,
you're like sorry, it's still cold by the
[SPEAKER_02]: way rubbing it in bad dab and Tasty drinks
Probably get one more cue in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, if you wick it Oh, yeah,
we're talking about wicking the moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: out of the out of the hash, which is for
my driving method.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's super important Yeah, you have he
has a super unique drawing method of
[SPEAKER_03]: drawing hash I feel like he's telling me
about his and I want him to tell me about
[SPEAKER_01]: yours Well, okay, I mean mine's like Super
standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like what everyone does but like his
I mean he could obviously talk better
[SPEAKER_01]: about than I do but from my going up going
off of his Instagram posts like It's like
[SPEAKER_01]: an air drying but it's like in a
controlled environment like a beer fridge,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so like it's just being dried in a
very cold like Controlled like I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know if you can control humidity or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I haven't Yeah, I'm sure it's on
point cuz I'm cuz it looks like it dries
[SPEAKER_02]: quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah dry Yeah, I'm sure it's like a lower
but uh Yeah, so it's cool instead of like
[SPEAKER_01]: having to like have a full cold room cuz
like if you want to air dry hash That's
[SPEAKER_01]: like of quality You need to have a cold
room That's like so the hash won't grease
[SPEAKER_01]: and it needs to be dry so the hash can dry
and like having that Yeah, it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: almost like a freeze dryer, but it's like
like having a little space But it's not a
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation other the other day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you start with frozen material or yeah
so like the only material that I Can
[SPEAKER_01]: source and not I kind of only really want
to source is my own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's just all fresh frozen For my
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: I remember they were talking about like
instead of freezing it Five days after
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah harvest like when it's cured.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, take that immediate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you ever tried doing that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't I've wanted to like do
especially with some strains that haven't
[SPEAKER_03]: yielded Because their point is there's
nothing that comes out of the freezer
[SPEAKER_03]: better than one at one in right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it's not like you pull like frozen
carrots out of the freezer or like these
[SPEAKER_01]: are much better than like the fresh Yeah,
it's like I don't know it's a lot of I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like everyone's like I want fresh
frozen only but Like with yields,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would help yields a lot worse
with drying and especially with strains
[SPEAKER_01]: that might not be heavy yielders with with
with being fresh frozen like the trichomes
[SPEAKER_01]: are gonna be way easier to knock off at
that time and like like people should just
[SPEAKER_01]: dry whole plants and like just wash them
instead of washing trim nugs because like
[SPEAKER_01]: you're You're like molesting all those
trichomes when you're trimming it and like
[SPEAKER_01]: if you just have that whole plant that's
like super like
[SPEAKER_01]: Trimming right like when I even when I do
the fresh frozen like I put it in the bags
[SPEAKER_01]: and turkey bags and I try and like When
it's in the freezer, like I don't just
[SPEAKER_03]: quickly with you all your flour goes into
your hash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: like nothing gets dried.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, when I'm prepping the fresh
frozen like I take every family off that
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't have resin on it but like I'll
like leave anything That has resin or I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: like trim around like big elites that only
have a little bit of resin I like trim off
[SPEAKER_01]: the main parts of the leaf and shit I
acquired some like some trim from a guy up
[SPEAKER_02]: in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: He gave me some like some There's some
bomb trim out there for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, this is really good He gave me some
trim and then he gave me some leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice I think I saw that maybe on the gram.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it has recently washed 600 grams of
leaf.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it had the bag You know had
trichomes in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and it did yielded so word That's
why I was wondering if you'd believe or
[SPEAKER_02]: not, you know, the whole plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah some they don't all have trichomes
but some do yeah, totally There's they're
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere and you separate it,
you know, yeah do all the micron bags or
[SPEAKER_02]: by now You probably kind of know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah what range you want to get?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it varies like if I'm washing for
rosin only do a specific from washing for
[SPEAKER_01]: melt Oh, I usually do like all the bags on
the first wash if I'm going for melt,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know for the first wash like And then
because to get like the most filtration to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the meltiest like resin in the 90 and
120 so I'll use like 220 190 160 120 90
[SPEAKER_01]: and I never really use a 70 bag on the
first wash I just kind of let that fall
[SPEAKER_02]: into the 40 right and I use that for like
my rosin So you don't think you just melt
[SPEAKER_02]: in that set like anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, there probably would be melt in the
70 actually but like I don't know there I
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's so much more in the 90
and the 120 like I think I there was like
[SPEAKER_01]: a 4% yield in the 90 you first wash when I
did this John Anna Hmm, which is like
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty day.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like whoa for just the 90.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah for just the full melt So I was like
dang that's awesome I think going back to
[SPEAKER_02]: like fresh rose and then I'll just do two
bags for the rest of everything my bad.
[SPEAKER_02]: No worries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, yeah, just do two bags for the
full for the full spectrum Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah 160 45 whenever I explain that to
people like the full Spectrum like the
[SPEAKER_02]: people someone doesn't know about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I learned to fill Mention like the
head and the tail end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I explained it now like if you
think of like the 220 could be like the
[SPEAKER_02]: head, you know, and then the toes are like
the 25, you know, so the head and tail end
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and so I try to explain to people
like full specs like the main body,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know Yeah, so usually like 160 to like
45, you know But like you I've seen some
[SPEAKER_02]: here like it was a 1a like the 190
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like and especially with like if
anyone's listening to this message
[SPEAKER_01]: directly like people need to listen to
this All these new rosas smokers.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, those people are an hour and
a half into this conversation You did
[SPEAKER_03]: leave a comment nice being like I made it
an hour and a half in that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys have the love that We do that's
sick.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so you were talking about what he
does.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's oh the drying Oh, yeah,
um his drawing process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, bring it way back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, right Yeah, I was just saying it's
it's just like a unique like I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: he's probably the only guy doing it like
the controlled air drying environment You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've seen guys doing big racks and big
rooms Like you're saying yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's just like standard air dries I
feel like once now the war is getting out
[SPEAKER_02]: if this is the word getting out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure I'm not the only One doing it but
like the beer fridge is a great step
[SPEAKER_02]: before the freeze-dryer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah for small batch It's yeah,
and even you can I'm sure you can fit a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot in there too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like you can I have it's I'm sure it's
like less It's not as much as a freeze
[SPEAKER_01]: dryer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a little more less expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so less expensive Yeah, then like I
mean, I got lucky I had to connect through
[SPEAKER_02]: my old job.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I had a connect that guy that had
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'm so like 160 for this like dang
the brand It's called Fogel that I got and
[SPEAKER_02]: it is a beer fridge like, you know,
it's this wide that tall It's one that you
[SPEAKER_02]: see in the liquor store.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know and It's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could definitely customize it to fit a
shitload of racks in there right now I've
[SPEAKER_02]: only touched it once and I have like four
racks for it, you know Yeah, and but yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: what I assume I'm gonna reinvest and like
slowly reinvesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know how that is Yeah, yeah,
no, but if you think about all like the
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff that people pull in it's like
Innovation from some other industry right
[SPEAKER_03]: like oh the light like the three compost
brewing like people always do it in
[SPEAKER_03]: plastic, you know Vortex Brewers,
but you should technically do it in like
[SPEAKER_03]: stainless steel because when you clean a
plastic like all the microbes don't get
[SPEAKER_03]: all up Right the pathogens off like the
plastic has so many ridges and nooks and
[SPEAKER_03]: crannies It's not a smooth flat surface
right like that's why you don't see people
[SPEAKER_03]: doing like yogurt making And you're making
in plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a reason you stainless steel same
thing with the hash, you know That's
[SPEAKER_02]: another good upgrade is to the stainless
steel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah cleanliness is like We talked about
yesterday.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the stainless steel brand not the
two hundred and fifty thousand dollar one
[SPEAKER_02]: But well pure pressure has a line out for
a bucket.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, I'm thinking my eye are on the
beer guys You know, yeah, there's a
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a hash maker up north and we were
trying to think of the name earlier was it
[SPEAKER_03]: so when we were Brewing compost tea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I called up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's like stout tanks,
which is a like crap beer brewer Like they
[SPEAKER_03]: have fermenters.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, can we get one and Then once
we get one, I want to be like,
[SPEAKER_03]: how would we improve this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah based on this use versus,
you know I encourage all those any beer
[SPEAKER_02]: craft like company do they should
definitely step into the hash game because
[SPEAKER_03]: they can just do so there's this guy and I
think He's up and he was in st.
[SPEAKER_03]: Louis and I think he's now up in
Washington State, but he was a hop brewer
[SPEAKER_03]: For it like like like legendary in the hot
brewing world.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was doing hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry hop extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ah Yes, they're the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a hot brewing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like beer making makes beer I was
like that would just be beer making.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so that's a good that's it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry hop extractions for beer making he's
like is he a hash maker now or what uh
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why I want to check in when I met
him he was just making the transition So I
[SPEAKER_03]: want to be like where you at now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Let's bring you in the studio and
smoke what you're making.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but that's using the stainless
steel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Mean everyone's using these right now
you see even like big big names using the
[SPEAKER_02]: the brute the brute fucking trash cans But
I do want to get one of those like kettle
[SPEAKER_02]: Brewers man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think It was like 400 bucks and if
I could pull it up real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I Could tell it shout out to that guy Look
at this camera work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh nice Let's see one man super high three
cameras Knock the power out of this one
[SPEAKER_03]: like 20 minutes in and I was like the fuck
just happened is I'm like trying to figure
[SPEAKER_03]: out why it's off and then I looked down
and the power parts aren't touching Like a
[SPEAKER_01]: Bucket Yeah, it's like there it is metal
bucket.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's gonna keep everything like way
colder and dialed in terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forget his name Obviously, you know the
only thing that I don't like about those
[SPEAKER_01]: you like that how do you just drain it
out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I just love with You can just lift it
and like you see everything so on a
[SPEAKER_03]: typical Beer or pretty much any it goes on
the bottom and you have one on the side
[SPEAKER_03]: one on the bottom So you can kind of do a
bottom one would be better right more
[SPEAKER_02]: cleaning and draining and so this is a
good start You know, yeah, like you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have to dump it all over They have right
they have dip.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they had totally different ones They
have a little like four-legged stand or
[SPEAKER_02]: and it comes right down the bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you know That would be dope.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because then you can rinse it all
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, right, you know, cuz you know,
I actually I have a It gets heavy when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're lifting it, but I just like how do
you do it bro?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like yeah, I struggled.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you know, no, there's a clear slice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's like You just break your back
for five seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean like I don't know everyone's
I think everyone's different like they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like methods I don't know just like I have
a buddy who bags out I'm buddy who has
[SPEAKER_01]: their Their work bag like it's actually a
32 gallon Cooler like I think it's a 32
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon like Well, uh bolt bag set do they
make a 32-gallon?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah mesh only bag and like he just Wits
it up with the fucking like crane or
[SPEAKER_01]: something Oh, that's that's heady.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay was that on your page?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yeah, nice Yes, I mean that for hash
That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many gallons is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll say a big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was Like at least a hundred No,
I think it was smaller because we wanted
[SPEAKER_03]: it as something you can actually pull
around with you So the idea is to do all
[SPEAKER_03]: like small batch brews and be like quick.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm gonna go to zone four And and you can
pull this stainless steel thing behind you
[SPEAKER_03]: and just walk down the rows Yeah,
and then that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just brew another one up for like three
zone twos over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool Yeah, that's another that's an
improvement want to do yeah Definitely is
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah step it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I did get a drain some up with the drains
like Somewhere in here so at least can you
[SPEAKER_02]: like release some of the extra water make
it a little lighter, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna save a little bit of back I
feel back issues It's easy a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bulkhead fitting right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah a simple PVC like little Connection
to a ball valve and then a little 90 at
[SPEAKER_02]: the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just to drain into the bags Yeah,
that's the next step Yeah, I'm excited for
[SPEAKER_02]: that Yeah, the first trip I couldn't find
the right fitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess I was just too high What
does he do that you think's unique oh
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, he's gonna hold a compliment.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's doing the whole single source This is
this is what I like is this is straight
[SPEAKER_02]: farm to table right here and I like that
cuz like literally like that's what I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: wanting to do And he's living it so I'm
like living through him right a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like just getting going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, he's like down the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, oh hell.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'll be right there You know,
so he's growing he's growing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's growing it all he's processing it
himself and it's it's all clean He's like
[SPEAKER_03]: the dude who finishes the marathon first
and then runs back eight miles to come
[SPEAKER_03]: like help you finish Are you coming back
to get me?
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's why I hate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what attracted me Yeah,
he was already doing the vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well sweet and he was right there so in
fact that he has the the freeze dryer is
[SPEAKER_02]: very cool, you know and Yeah periods good
tool actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me hit one lap.
[SPEAKER_03]: What should I do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, so there's a strong in a melt
Yeah, I know you just tried that strong in
[SPEAKER_01]: a rosin though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also and I'll try that cuz this way
Yeah, that's the fool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sit here and take a pick it all in
definitely should be taking off the banger
[SPEAKER_03]: So like that monitor doesn't work so I
like I'm like is it in focus is it not in
[SPEAKER_03]: focus like It's the cable Or no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not the cable because I've replaced
like two cables There's something about
[SPEAKER_03]: either the camera the monitor.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is showing that I know on that but
it's so small And that one nice and big
[SPEAKER_01]: got it Got it Boy, you know anything about
this nail kind of takes a minute to heat
[SPEAKER_01]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all right So but if you had an
email Like have you tried different emails
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're like, I don't like this not
really I mean I have tried a Couple and I
[SPEAKER_01]: have owned one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like this more I like the banger
and like I don't know the emails.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a big setup, you know,
it's like I love it's kind of nice to like
[SPEAKER_01]: have a little hot banger ready to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know I'm used to torching for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can do it all you have the email
ready to go, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a custom.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah dab right here the torch.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's all Yeah, the puff coat it's
like with the puff coat feel like the
[SPEAKER_01]: emails like not super like I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is so immediate.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I want that if I want that
heavy-hitting And this one's like
[SPEAKER_03]: immediate and portable super portable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah, exactly This one's the least
practical.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is like the the I'm having a party
showstoppers Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was very fun though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish we had some tongs to like head
torch those coals up hotter Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: so it's like you do these things and I'm
like I need like a Plate to put charcoal
[SPEAKER_03]: on Like I need tongs for charcoal So you
still got a minute here go like 140 I
[SPEAKER_03]: would say So but basically the glass can
only get up to a certain temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um Yeah, I think it like once I'm torching
it starts getting pretty like glowing red
[SPEAKER_03]: and it just peaks So as soon as you let
go, that's the point from that
[SPEAKER_03]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when I know It's a stop and you
tweak it when you're in like different
[SPEAKER_03]: like if you were in Montreal right in like
the middle of yeah, I'm tweaking it right
[SPEAKER_01]: now Actually, it's kind of chilly in here
So I would be going like five seconds
[SPEAKER_01]: later if I was like in my warm room Yeah,
there's a little bit of air like it's kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of hard Yeah I like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like you spend a lot of time
iteratively improving the art of your
[SPEAKER_03]: personal dad's organic weed Thanks,
man Yeah, that's why we grow to enjoy the
[SPEAKER_01]: act of smoking like the whole reason why I
started like growing and smoking hash or
[SPEAKER_01]: and trying to make my own hashes cuz like
I love it and like I want to have my own
[SPEAKER_01]: to smoke and like just becoming a like
better farmer just like sometimes has like
[SPEAKER_01]: creates opportunity with like having
excess amounts of Resin to like start a
[SPEAKER_02]: little thing with and stuff you want to
grow out this tangy that no one else
[SPEAKER_02]: really wants to grow out because it
doesn't yield much Yeah, you can And you
[SPEAKER_02]: can you know watch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like yeah, I love when you have to do shit
at scale Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like all about the bottom line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Exactly when you have that pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so true.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like If it's a loss, it's like oh,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll just smoke this, you know,
but to his point you can go after like
[SPEAKER_03]: super low yielding Stuff that tastes
amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, like you're like a pro surfer who
travels the world like with the Known
[SPEAKER_02]: storms like right in Panama next that's
what I'm going to South that or Australia
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I like hash making so much because
you can work with you source from a few
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers You know, I enjoy doing that
because I work with a few take a handful
[SPEAKER_02]: of farmers like finding new farmers And
that's the thing buying new farmers is
[SPEAKER_02]: always good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everyone can like and growing your own
Is even better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, like not everyone can be doing like
I want to talk single source thing like
[SPEAKER_02]: like that would be You know, I love to
watch some of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but I try somebody so many things
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, but it's true like not everyone
can do it like single source like there's
[SPEAKER_01]: growers that have to be in the garden 24-7
and like there's hash makers that need to
[SPEAKER_01]: be making hash 24-7 because there's just
that's what they're good at and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what the growers are gonna like not every
grower can like has you know, I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing and I'm crushing that and I'm
extracting and I'm crushing right my
[SPEAKER_01]: garden was ten times the size I couldn't
be making hash, you know Like it's just it
[SPEAKER_01]: has to be scaled small to be able to do
that single source thing Which this is why
[SPEAKER_01]: people like that education needs to be out
there and people do appreciate it But like
[SPEAKER_01]: some people don't know what it means,
you know, yeah, some people don't know
[SPEAKER_02]: what it means There's a lot of work people
see the flower on the shelf in a box and
[SPEAKER_02]: they don't know what's behind it,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so the next time you harvest save
like a cola of flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah for sure I think I'm gonna dry some
on this winter back.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have coming here on Yeah, hopefully a
bigger version of this table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah No, this is a nice table set up dude
Yeah, yeah, so you could put that one
[SPEAKER_03]: under Like when someone tries to pull the
No, no, you you try to pull the tablecloth
[SPEAKER_03]: out and not have anything fall off.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like trying to do that Gosh All
right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm super high banana thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was a good a good what the banana,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah on a straw Nana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah So how many different ones are there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like four or five Starting GMO Korean day
GMO Wi-Fi and sorry the dip.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the different consistencies Yeah,
I think it'd be cool to walk through how
[SPEAKER_03]: you get To each one for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some kind of come out of consistency
easily.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and some you can I mean all you can
manipulate, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, like I Think it's like for me
whether I'm gonna like manipulate it or
[SPEAKER_01]: not like into a consistency just depends
on like How it tastes is fresh-pressed
[SPEAKER_01]: like Recently like I mean also there's
trends like all Like two months ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone was like I want cold-cure batter
all I want is cold like everyone was so
[SPEAKER_01]: hyped on cold care if you made cold care
is like, you know, it's like the hype
[SPEAKER_01]: thing to do but Fresh press is always
awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I feel like people are always stoked
on fresh press.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's what I've been kind of like
leaning towards and if it's but For like
[SPEAKER_01]: it just depends like sometimes the fresh
press won't taste as good as like a cold
[SPEAKER_02]: cure So like I found that myself actually,
you know But I like the idea of giving
[SPEAKER_02]: someone fresh press and say hey you do
what you want with it, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You go cold cure it, you go turn the
diamonds, you want to whip it,
[SPEAKER_03]: leave it in your pocket Yeah, like I
brought it three-quarters of the way and
[SPEAKER_03]: you can bring it in any direction you
want, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of just like the the the grower
would give me flour and I'll make it into
[SPEAKER_02]: this and I could give it back to him but
you can make it to what you want more.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like getting semi-prepared meals at
home.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and like to make the yeah to make
the batter like it's just like I'll just
[SPEAKER_01]: leave it at room temp or I'll put it in a
slightly warmer environment for like a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple days and everything will just you
know change into like a wet batter or like
[SPEAKER_01]: a You know, the turps will go to the top
layer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you see that separation Yeah,
and then right when you when you mix that
[SPEAKER_01]: up, it just becomes that like that Yeah,
so that's that's how the cold cure goes
[SPEAKER_01]: It's only do that that and then I'll do
like the fresh press I like if it tastes
[SPEAKER_01]: good as fresh press I'll definitely leave
it as fresh press and gram it all out
[SPEAKER_01]: individually like baller jars are sick
people like them but like Grahams are
[SPEAKER_02]: buying them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, people do people do but like I
don't know Graham is just like you can
[SPEAKER_01]: proportion your smoke out better I was
only dabbing I was like making myself
[SPEAKER_01]: these big baller jars and like I was
smoking so much more just because I was
[SPEAKER_01]: like taking these big dabs out of the jar
and right now I gram it all out and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like I feel like I'm like I'm taking that
normal sized dabs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not like wasting anything like It's
better, you know, I find that to having
[SPEAKER_02]: this a little jar for your personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You enjoy it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You enjoy but like you can still enjoy all
the mini grams, you know So I guess you
[SPEAKER_02]: don't I don't have a favorite consistency
really yet either, you know, yeah for
[SPEAKER_01]: sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess it just depends definitely
probably more wet batter.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess Yeah, if I had to pick I'd
probably go with the wet batter because it
[SPEAKER_01]: stays as a wet batter Like the fresh press
sometimes the grams you leave it out for a
[SPEAKER_01]: day and like goes to this like dry Butter
and it's like cool, but it's like I'd
[SPEAKER_01]: rather have a wet butter than like a dry
butter, you know, so With the with the
[SPEAKER_01]: cold cure, but you can whip it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it just it's all preference for sure
I'll usually smoke it before it has the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity to like butter out anything
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't last that long to give the cold
cure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Alright, so we hit everything Definitely
hit a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We finished the race.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh Yeah, we tried all this for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah We demoed that We got a lot
accomplished.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah So is this like going on YouTube?
[SPEAKER_03]: It will go on YouTube.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just gonna be titled like Like like a
well-rounded hash sit-down conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a cool well-rounded thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I Guess we could say our like our
Instagram handles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so yeah, my Instagram is a cannabis
cam cannabis dot cam on Instagram and then
[SPEAKER_01]: my My farm page is Sunfire farms just
Sunfire farms Perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah and yours Oh, I'm deal grows that
just like me, you know, not really a
[SPEAKER_02]: brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess it just me growing into the
Cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah started out growing and grew into
washing hash, you know the stories behind
[SPEAKER_02]: that but like it's that's yeah,
that's me deal grows and What uh,
[SPEAKER_03]: what genetics are you running?
[SPEAKER_02]: Really for it's a slur cane Dosey dough
purple punch, which is weird because all
[SPEAKER_02]: those three are kind of like Good thing we
have the mix slurry bomb But uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then the GMO I get that I get a gelato
cake Also an ice cream man cake ice cream
[SPEAKER_02]: cake or ice cream man from compound
genetics, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so I'm very fortunate to work with a
few growers, you know And I get to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: work with a few but one guy my kind of
go-to he has a very good green thumb He
[SPEAKER_02]: has he kind of has that feel for the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: He basically is with the plant,
you know So I like he's growing for people
[SPEAKER_01]: to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I'd be able to pull off some gyms
with just his trim So it's very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like the bangers I like are the GMOs
the slurry cane I love the flavor of the
[SPEAKER_02]: purple punch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are my favorite, but I like the
experiment with all of them I want to get
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some OG in the fridge freezer right
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's next.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like my first actually Would you
call it when you grew the plan out a full
[SPEAKER_02]: term?
[SPEAKER_02]: I get when you when you grow out outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah Full term full term.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, so this is some full term like
sungrown And you're in the same area nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, actually I just I like I think
always sungrown does does good for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an OG So I wonder how it's gonna wash
Yeah, oh geez.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never had good luck with OGs.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just they're very greasy like it's gotta
be cold You gotta like scoop it fast,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, okay, but I don't know Just
that's just my experience with like a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple of OGs that I've washed I work with
the OG KB.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what that sucker is super
greasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you're right That's another that's
another yeah now is it strain cultivar,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, yeah I don't know which term to
use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, either one cultivar to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm used to strain and then I've heard
people using Colton.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but strand It's funny out there yeah
Yeah, my genetics just let it I have just
[SPEAKER_01]: limiting down to four I'm trying to hunt
between a couple others, but it's GMO
[SPEAKER_01]: straw Nana Wi-Fi cookies and then cookies
and cream and then I'm using cream is when
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm seeing a lot more too Yeah,
that's like my favorites Mike my favorite
[SPEAKER_01]: strain to dab like the creamy turps like
the best I think the the female I have did
[SPEAKER_01]: we hit that?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we hit the cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's We didn't hit the cream doesn't make
it to the studio.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would love to try.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's cookies and cream Mix but um,
I don't have any stray cookies and cream
[SPEAKER_01]: yet, but I will soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working on a bunch of it And then the
watermelon bread, so that's new to line up
[SPEAKER_01]: new to the lineup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think like it'll be I'm gonna run
it like a lot in 2020 because it's like a
[SPEAKER_02]: good one another strain coming to my mind
is that tangy the Purple tangy cross with
[SPEAKER_02]: creamsicle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm that the turps on that I have a little
bit here puff coat you guys only hate this
[SPEAKER_02]: Dr. Puff cool, dude Check out the turps on
this Well, you see how it's all like jars
[SPEAKER_02]: nice all weird and greasy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's like kind of That why I saw
that, you know weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this has been here like the longest
but it's not has not been like
[SPEAKER_02]: well-maintained Looks good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's such a weird consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I Know this must not be working.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that's my mom Can't give us a dare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, please try.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah But that the turps on it is is my
favorite man nice, yeah, it smells great
[SPEAKER_01]: it uh, it reminds me it reminds me of this
like Forbidden fruit kind of that I washed
[SPEAKER_01]: like or that I grew for my first ever one
of my first ever plants that I grew like a
[SPEAKER_02]: long time ago this uh Smells good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I first started pressing it was
mostly flour, you know, yeah and and like
[SPEAKER_02]: the the dosy dough press like good Yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the OG KB did a good yield slur cane
did a good yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one didn't get good yield But it was
just like the most overpowering like
[SPEAKER_02]: flavor on right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's usually how it goes and yeah
He's seeing how that is, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it just makes sense now knowing what I
know now But still it's like so it's so
[SPEAKER_02]: worth it even mixing it having a little
bit of this adding to like You know your
[SPEAKER_02]: GMO hit like it's mixing the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty interesting Yeah, that's nice
I've had tangy turps in so long.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really Yeah, hope he keeps that
he's kept it for a long time like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's something And then that compound
genetics ice cream man has a similar
[SPEAKER_02]: profile nice, you know, but I think he
already has a really good Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know for his tangy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what he does.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a mastermind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah We were talking about like the
drying method, you know or no getting the
[SPEAKER_02]: water out quicker and how Like for the
free.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, yeah that huge of a deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah with my method.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like Yeah, yeah for sure dude and
like remember we talked the bags to get
[SPEAKER_02]: the full the full mesh bags So like these
five gallon bags you've seen these This
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't full mesh But for my method when you
dry it when you try to get the water out
[SPEAKER_02]: quicker the full mesh is way better Right
because I'm dumping all this Through the
[SPEAKER_02]: small bags, you know Yeah, is that kind of
how you do it you wash in the 220?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and then I have sauce to tell you
use all three 20 gallon bags, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so all my other bag sets like
they're 20 gallons again Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was kind of wanting to do the tens but
like I Was just I just like the he's a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: like you're saying easy because the Base
is bigger, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you just give it a shake like it
gets the water out faster Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like everything drained like when you
when you have a five gallon like I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: you run the water through and like if
there's a bunch of hash and not the five
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon but like Five gallons are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like what if I was doing like 4,000
grams or 5,000 grams like fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_01]: like it might take a minute for the 40
gallon to like dry, you know Get through
[SPEAKER_02]: all there, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Not dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: The water got me for the fucking water to
drain through so like I don't like like
[SPEAKER_01]: having this full small bag of water like
Waiting for to drain with the with the 20s
[SPEAKER_01]: I can just like give it a shake and the
water goes right through and stuff for
[SPEAKER_02]: sure, but I don't know just like I can't
wait to because I'm gonna definitely
[SPEAKER_02]: upgrade these to the full mesh and Yeah
Because that that does help because
[SPEAKER_02]: because I just saying on the sides too
Yeah, yeah more surface area of mesh.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so the water will go right through
it Like way quicker Because I'll wash it
[SPEAKER_02]: Through here and then I'm like dumping it
basically through something like this the
[SPEAKER_02]: bags here and I'm dumping this whole
thing, you know through that bag Yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: and then I have to set it down and wait
for the bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It gets too full Sometimes it starts to
sink and right right exactly bend the lid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so full mesh It won't have that
issue, you know, you get the water out
[SPEAKER_02]: quicker And then hopefully yeah,
that's about it Well, is that what the
[SPEAKER_02]: bolt bags are?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think they are the I think yeah,
they're Yeah, that's what I used to the
[SPEAKER_01]: bolt bags like here's a 20 gallon bolt
bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 160 right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep 160 yeah, I know that red collar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see I only use I bought the three bag
set Yeah, but I find myself now I'm only
[SPEAKER_02]: using the 220, you know Yeah, I know for
washing in this and I'm still using my
[SPEAKER_02]: first bag said that I got the bubble magic
off of Amazon nice, you know, so your
[SPEAKER_02]: first like my First tester set.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and you know what's super funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was washing with the bags like this for
the longest time So the threading is all
[SPEAKER_02]: in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then who was it man?
[SPEAKER_02]: Another hash company is like yo the bags
inside out I thought for the longest time
[SPEAKER_02]: that I turn them inside out Mike.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes Because I would use this sprayer to
get into all these crevices to get the
[SPEAKER_02]: hash that would get caught Yeah,
cuz it was it was I kept yeah,
[SPEAKER_02]: it would go yeah high amounts of hash can
caught up here and I'd be like better way
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to help each other out,
you know, that's why I believe in that So
[SPEAKER_02]: like once I turn it inside out my life had
a lot easier it drained through a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: quicker, you know And it's so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now yeah, you have to like pour it
through that way Attention to detail.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you don't know these bags don't
come with instructions Yeah, dude,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't say turn it like imagine a new
hash maker like putting like They're like
[SPEAKER_01]: they're I don't know like doing their bags
the opposite way like stacking their bags
[SPEAKER_01]: the wrong way or something Exactly,
and they don't know like it just it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really like for these new because there's
a lot of new people doing it It's like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's important to like I mean,
you're gonna take losses with learning
[SPEAKER_01]: anything, but it's like it's kind of it's
attention to details like the main Thing
[SPEAKER_01]: with making hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you got to know and understand
what's going on and you'll fucking be a
[SPEAKER_02]: good hash maker Yeah, you have that
passion too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of people are gonna start
That's the main thing This is a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's like yeah, I mean I start up
here But after like mid run, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to you know, I'm bringing it down
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see the paddle There's nothing like
that feeling at the end of a good wash
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're just like tired and you just
did a great wash It's like a sport and I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: drying you're like So stoked you're just
like ah, I played sports and it's kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: like it's kind of like a sport You know,
you see yeah, you just go and tackle it
[SPEAKER_02]: get in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's systematic.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you have a game plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I execute my game plan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well today for sure I sit down afterwards
and take a dab I think how long do you
[SPEAKER_02]: work and I improve you see I've been
trying I've been trying to time it more
[SPEAKER_02]: now like I Various for me some I did seven
washes this last wash because it kept on
[SPEAKER_02]: coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, how long do you do each wash?
[SPEAKER_02]: No more than ten minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, you know At least five minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, yo, yeah minor about seven
to fifteen minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay on But I only do about five washes
depending because I think the fresh frozen
[SPEAKER_01]: like Comes off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know what quicker maybe or like it
stops dumping quicker because Maybe it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't yield as good as dry or it doesn't
yield as like Throughout do you know what
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know it like all comes off at once
instead of like coming off I'm gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: faster with the fresh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah So yeah, it's an interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just dump all all the trim in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I put a little bit of ice and water in the
bottom Yeah, all the trim all the ice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I've layered it before you know I
find just now like having a little bit of
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottom with ice and water and then all
the products and then Dilling it with ice
[SPEAKER_02]: and letting it soak.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get like a 20-minute soak nice nice cuz
someone explained to me I asked I'm like
[SPEAKER_02]: man you break up the nugs, you know Yeah,
this is this paddle is from the local
[SPEAKER_02]: brewery Local brewing selling product
company.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make a bigger version.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_02]: They have those brewing kits there too
those big barrels We should do a custom
[SPEAKER_03]: side like I'd love to sit down with them
and be like this This is the perfect size
[SPEAKER_03]: for this purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: This thing would be like gets so cold when
you're washing I'm sure do you work like
[SPEAKER_02]: not it's pretty thick.
[SPEAKER_02]: This whole thing's solid Yeah,
it did my hands don't get cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was using one of these the other
day Helping helping ogre wash and like I
[SPEAKER_01]: was freezing with with this thing cuz I
didn't have gloves Well, I'm sure the one
[SPEAKER_02]: glove my glove broke how cool that the
room's like what 40 degrees probably?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah around there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like 60 degrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I gotta get a cool but Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: My doesn't get like my my room gets about
like 45 to 55 depending on like nice the
[SPEAKER_01]: the how cold it is outside, but I kind of
hung up on The temperature of the room
[SPEAKER_02]: like I feel like if I get it down to 40,
I'll get better yields I don't know like
[SPEAKER_01]: when I I watched GMO the first time I ever
watched fresh frozen GMO I literally
[SPEAKER_01]: washed it in a 65 degree environment fresh
frozen got great yields and Like the only
[SPEAKER_01]: thing I feel like the cool the main thing
I like about being washing in like a super
[SPEAKER_01]: cold environment is like You're scooping
the hash and like yeah that I don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: to worry about it greasing up on the bags
real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like But like the GMO didn't
grease at all in that 65 degree and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: watched chem dog in that same environment
It was like hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like greasy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like right away.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like fuck this sucks and then like
that's when you got a freezing and Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, I'd be just so quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like they would think my spoon that
covered a hash Yeah, I mean I still I had
[SPEAKER_01]: the freeze dryer still so I got it like
just right on the trays but so like when
[SPEAKER_02]: it's all greased up on the bag Do you uh,
I you know, I spray it off, you know Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: like I would be like literally it's so so
greasy that I would spray it and nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: It would just be like like that's the
grease stuff It's just so rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like like the strong Anna GMO Wi-Fi
those are like a breeze.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just like comes off So it's like such a
stable easy to work with resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are the ones to the sprayers pretty
important when you're collecting it,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yes, I use the Talking about Bilbo
soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is this came from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah from Jeremy chafing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah So they're using that filling with
ice and water good pressure and it gives
[SPEAKER_02]: you a nice Nice spray, but I wish it was
shorter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure they have like shorter ones,
you know I can get like closer because I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: like Yeah, but this works man,
this is pretty cool it's all a start right
[SPEAKER_01]: definitely Very nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's it's a it's a process
because It's not for the weak or weary.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you get you got to love it All
right, should we wrap it should we close
[SPEAKER_03]: on that sure good stuff bolt bag I like no
problem.
