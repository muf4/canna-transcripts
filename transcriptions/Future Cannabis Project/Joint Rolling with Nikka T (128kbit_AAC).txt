[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're rolling I'm gonna roll up some
gelato 33 You know, I don't know exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: where this one came from it was grown by
some good friends of mine
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you are about to release a pre-roll
line Yeah, we're actually about to release
[SPEAKER_00]: a pre-roll collaboration I'll set that
aside for right now Yeah, we're about to
[SPEAKER_00]: release a pre-roll collaboration with the
Mona brand essential extracts Alien Labs
[SPEAKER_00]: and Cali kosher Alien Labs is providing
the baklava flour gelato 41 times kosher
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush So we're using dried cured baklava
flour and then We're using Cali kosher's
[SPEAKER_00]: fresh frozen frittles strain Frittles and
this is whole plant fresh frozen frittles
[SPEAKER_00]: is forbidden fruit time skittles has this
amazing candy citrus flavor and We hand
[SPEAKER_00]: selected the material we are hand washing
that fresh frozen and hand rolling these
[SPEAKER_00]: joints and Really proud of the
collaboration the joint tastes amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one gram of flour 0.3 full melt hash
Yeah, really properly hand rolled by
[SPEAKER_00]: myself just like this but with gloves on
and Yeah That should be releasing this
[SPEAKER_01]: June and so just quickly so you have a
little European style going on here talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about so first of all, you're using I'm
using a doubled up crutch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the lefties crutch because I like a
long crutch here helps cool down the smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: helps keep the weed out of my mouth and
Just helps support a longer spliff as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like that longer crutch basically
doubled up rolled up tight We call it a
[SPEAKER_00]: crutch or a filter tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the part I don't condone But since
I was a youth I grew up with European
[SPEAKER_00]: foreign exchange doing European friends
Traveled all over the world and this
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately has stuck with me the
blending of the tobacco or the grabba into
[SPEAKER_00]: the spliff here This is a smoking brown
unbleached roll So build your own size
[SPEAKER_00]: basically smoking brown, you know There's
a few unbleached papers out there on the
[SPEAKER_00]: market right now And I just really prefer
everything that smoking has done over the
[SPEAKER_00]: years I started with smoking blacks and
actually I think smoking eco's which was
[SPEAKER_00]: the hemp one with the dehydrated honey
glue Moved on to smoking blacks and then
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking masters, which is the silver pack,
which is a real thin paper And now I've
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of just been stuck on these smoking
browns And I just like how they burn they
[SPEAKER_00]: taste a little bit less almost woody Or
cellulose II than the raw paper First to
[SPEAKER_00]: me So it's important that I get it real
tight against the crutch there to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about a folding It's not really a
rolling technique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we fold that paper right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get the conical shape here Tuck and a
fold The lick part won't be happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: our pre-roll collaboration either we're
using paintbrush sponges
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a knockbox because I really want the
homogenate homogenization of the hash So
[SPEAKER_00]: we're actually mixing the hash and the
flowers in a cold room And I'm rolling
[SPEAKER_00]: this up in a cold room with the hash in it
So we have full homogenization the hash
[SPEAKER_00]: remains a powder that way we can
completely homogenize it with the flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once it reaches room temperature
it kind of melts out Yeah, so there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: Nicotine style spliff right there This is
a little bit longer a little bit larger
[SPEAKER_00]: than the size But it is a little bit large
larger than a king-size paper is what our
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-roll is so talk about I mean you just
rolled your own joint with amazing flower
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously with a pre-roll it gets a little
stale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk about?
[SPEAKER_01]: How you reconcile like your Coming out
with a brand of pre-rolls Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: and first of all, you know We're really
trying to stick away from the the term
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-roll because I think a lot of the
pre-rolls out there on the market are that
[SPEAKER_00]: knockbox Dried stale trim things of that
nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're using whole buds cured buds from
alien labs We're mixing that in the cold
[SPEAKER_00]: room Like I said with our hash packing it
into the joints like this Then we're
[SPEAKER_00]: actually putting these into a sauna tube,
which is a hemp plastic tube.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're wrapping that With a heat sealed
shrink wrap and then that goes into the
[SPEAKER_00]: box So I think the heat sealed shrink wrap
is how I'm trying to avoid a lot of that
[SPEAKER_00]: stale that stale Flower situation Mixing
the hash in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just I don't know it's it's keeping the
consistency We're seeing a nice shelf
[SPEAKER_01]: stability on it for sure and you're
environmentally conscious with the sauna
[SPEAKER_01]: Plastic bio plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's so much waste out there and
we really James Eichner, you know We
[SPEAKER_00]: really tried to do everything we could to
avoid the waste situation with a pre-roll
[SPEAKER_00]: though I do want the shrink wrap.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want as much of the you know,
keeping that flavor in there as possible
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you know with the compliance and
all the regulation aspects of our industry
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of ways that you just have
to do and it's unfortunate But we're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to go every route we can to avoid
that the hemp tube the recyclable box You
You You
