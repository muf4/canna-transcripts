[SPEAKER_00]: Interesting appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a different appointment than I
think most people were expecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, you know, we all knew that
Matt Whitaker was a temporary appointment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now it's a question of, you know,
getting a real appointment through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone thought Pam Bondi had a really
good chance, who's the current AG of
[SPEAKER_00]: Florida.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've had a new guy named who was
formerly, you know, working for George H
[SPEAKER_00]: .W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bush, who's, you know, kind of most famous
legacy of that administration was that he
[SPEAKER_00]: was the person that championed pardons for
every one of the Iran Contra called
[SPEAKER_00]: criminals or people that were involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you think about, you know,
the reason that he's being appointed,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I don't think it has a great
deal to do with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it has a great deal to do
with criminal justice reform or anything
[SPEAKER_00]: else you'd think an AG might be involved
in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it certainly has a great deal to do
with, you know, the Mueller investigation,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you can expect a new AG that,
you know, what Trump expects this person
[SPEAKER_00]: will do in a specific situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how does that relate to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know enough yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, you know, this shingles was only
floated around probably in the last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It came as a surprise to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought there's three or four other
people that certainly were gonna get the
[SPEAKER_00]: nod before he did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that because H.W.
[SPEAKER_00]: was in the news a lot the last week with
his passing, that people started looking
[SPEAKER_00]: at some people that have been around for a
long time that might be an easy
[SPEAKER_00]: confirmation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that this is at least a
conversation a nomination that will be
[SPEAKER_00]: confirmed relatively easily by the Senate
because he's already been there before.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's had bipartisan support, he's largely
seen as someone that a long time on order
[SPEAKER_00]: guy, but now we've got to think about what
it means for the campus industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know enough yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would expect based on what HW's policy
was towards cannabis and towards drugs in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is a guy that presided during
the Len Bias issue and was the person that
[SPEAKER_00]: escalated the war on drugs probably in a
way that we'd never seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you old enough to remember
what Humboldt County was like in 1989,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was probably the worst pot famine
summer we've ever seen because camp was
[SPEAKER_00]: flying and dropping nets like we've known
ever seen since.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was led by this AG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see, but I can't imagine it's
good for the industry, but I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's any worse than Sessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And give me your reflections on Jeff
Sessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Surprisingly, I'm going to say I didn't
mind him as an AG.
[SPEAKER_00]: I absolutely detested him as a person
going into the position.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought he was going to be terrible for
cannabis when his nomination happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the day he recused himself from the
rush investigation was the day that he was
[SPEAKER_00]: no longer powerful as an attorney general.
[SPEAKER_00]: He no longer had the ear of the president.
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't matter what he wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: He wasn't going to have the ability to get
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was probably the most feckless
attorney general I've ever seen in my
[SPEAKER_00]: lifetime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't really affect the cannabis
industry at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of those things that you had so
much fear and there was so much hype about
[SPEAKER_00]: Sessions taking over as the AG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the worst thing the guy did was repeal
the Cole memorandum.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then never even go after anyone,
never prosecute anyone, never really
[SPEAKER_00]: change anything in a meaningful way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he allowed the industry to continue to
proliferate, which is no different than
[SPEAKER_00]: what Holder did, no different than what
Lynch did, no different than what any
[SPEAKER_00]: other AG has done for the last,
call it 12 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thought Sessions would be a lot
worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm pleased to see him gone,
but I don't think he really had any real
[SPEAKER_00]: effect on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
