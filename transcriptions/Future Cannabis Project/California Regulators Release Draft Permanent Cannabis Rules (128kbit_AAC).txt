[SPEAKER_03]: On Friday, July 13th, Friday the 13th,
the regulatory agencies demonstrated they
[SPEAKER_03]: have not lost their sense of humor by on
this auspicious day releasing the draft
[SPEAKER_03]: permanent regulations that will dictate
the future of the cannabis industry in
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on that day, Friday the 13th,
what happened?
[SPEAKER_03]: What started?
[SPEAKER_03]: 45 day comment period.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many have issued their comments?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody, because we're still reading.
[SPEAKER_03]: Over 300 pages of new regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So today I have brought together,
this is Alexis D'Angelo of CCIA and Dr. K,
[SPEAKER_03]: Pamela Epstein of GreenWise Consulting,
and Sarah Armstrong of Americans for Safe
[SPEAKER_03]: Access.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we wanted to talk about how to compose
an effective comment during this comment
[SPEAKER_03]: period.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a critical time for the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything you hate about the regulations,
this is your last chance to issue a well
[SPEAKER_03]: thought out, professional, specific,
excellently written and argued comment to
[SPEAKER_03]: help the agencies to see the error of
their ways in certain cases, to support
[SPEAKER_03]: some of the decisions that they've made
that you may agree with.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't have to be a negative comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can be a positive comment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it is essential to submit comments
during this period.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a cannabis business and you
want to file a lawsuit later, guess what?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you didn't file a comment, you can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to say something about the issues
at hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just gonna let these guys talk
about it as well, to give kind of some of
[SPEAKER_03]: the salient points of how you go about
approaching the comment period,
[SPEAKER_03]: how you can submit the comments and the
opportunities to do so, and what are the
[SPEAKER_03]: components of a effective comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one of the things that is really
important is make sure that you have an
[SPEAKER_02]: entire statement, but also that you have a
solution for that statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just stating what you want, they're just
gonna bypass that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to go in with a full statement
of what you want and then tell them kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of how they can do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because in actuality, they wanna know how
to do their own job.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're gonna be doing that for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one important thing to note is
what also did not happen on Friday the
[SPEAKER_04]: 13th.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing changed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all of those readopted regulations,
child resistance with all of the packaging
[SPEAKER_04]: that we just saw, all of that stays in
place.
[SPEAKER_04]: So during this period where we're
effectively commenting and telling these
[SPEAKER_04]: regulatory agencies, this is what we would
like to see, at the same time we need to
[SPEAKER_04]: maintain compliance.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because here in California, you can be
dinged for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could cost you your annual permit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You could be affected at the local level.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maintain your active compliance now
with a lens on what will make your life
[SPEAKER_04]: easier in the future when you're
commenting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you're commenting, you wanna ask
a question, provide a solution,
[SPEAKER_04]: make sure the answer to your question is
not a yes or a no, and that you're really
[SPEAKER_04]: facilitating a response.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's difficult with some of us being
vertically integrated businesses or a
[SPEAKER_04]: micro business that you may think that you
can ask all of your questions to the BCC
[SPEAKER_04]: and that you may think logically that
these agencies talk to one another.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes the regulations would beg to
differ since owner seems to be a concept
[SPEAKER_04]: that is not universal.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you need to make your specific
comments to your specific agencies that
[SPEAKER_04]: are in control of that particular part of
the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'm gonna pass it along.
[SPEAKER_01]: When things kicked off in 2005,
we had no one to help us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lawyers were very reluctant, lobbyists
were nonexistent, they in fact would run
[SPEAKER_01]: the other way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're economically in a position to
hire a lawyer to write a letter for you,
[SPEAKER_01]: or you have a lobbyist through your trade
organization, or you have one of the many
[SPEAKER_01]: things that are now available to the
cannabis community and the money to access
[SPEAKER_01]: them, go ahead and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll save you some time, and I promise
you that you will be pleased with the
[SPEAKER_01]: results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you are small business owners who
really don't have a lot of extra money
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things are tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: So go to safeaccessnow.org and write there
on our website, Americans for Safe Access
[SPEAKER_01]: will have all the information you need to
write an effective letter all by yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: State your issue, discuss it, say your
solution, and you're done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget to cite the part of the
regulation that you are talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's over 500 pages of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So put the little section number and maybe
a page number.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you're done, be proud of yourself
because you're now part of the solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's pretty important, but what's even
more important is if you don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: weigh in, people who have interests
contrary to yours will.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are, I think, 11 police fraternal
organizations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have lobbyists, they have lawyers,
and believe me, they will be weighing in.
[SPEAKER_01]: The League of Cities is not always a very
helpful entity either, and they are well
[SPEAKER_01]: supplied with lawyers, lobbyists,
and policy wonks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The minute you start becoming part of this
process, it's addictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Believe me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know it doesn't seem like it,
but the idea that you submitted a letter
[SPEAKER_01]: and then three months later you looked
down at those regs and by God,
[SPEAKER_01]: they took out that really poisonous
section that you were objecting to.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a high.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a genuine high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's what keeps most policy wonks
going, believe me.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have lots of trade organizations here
in LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let them know how you feel about things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure they write detailed letters and
get on with it because, honestly,
[SPEAKER_01]: you are the voice of cannabis in
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people running things up in Sacramento
at the Bureau, they freely admit they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next time you open up those regs
and they want you to have 24-hour man's
[SPEAKER_01]: security, which will double your security
bill every month, and you write in and it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes right out where you want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're not just talking alone,
you are part of a community speaking with
[SPEAKER_01]: one voice, and that's very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that it's hard to look at a
65-year-old woman and think that anything
[SPEAKER_01]: she'd have to say would be terribly
germane.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I am telling you, if you're not at the
table, you're lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in this environment, this highly
complex environment, if you're not at the
[SPEAKER_01]: table, somebody is going to eat your
lunch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please don't slack off.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they don't hear from you,
this time may never come again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where can you comment and how can you
comment?
[SPEAKER_04]: Should probably let you guys know that,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The agencies will take your comments via
email.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can call them or you can snail mail
them comments.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you can attend one of their many road
show, as I like to call them, hearing
[SPEAKER_04]: dates.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one on August 7th in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one on August 14th in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then on the last day that you can
submit comments, which is also important
[SPEAKER_04]: to note, on August 27th, there will be one
in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of your comments must be received by
the agency in whatever outlet you choose
[SPEAKER_04]: to let them know.
[SPEAKER_04]: No later than 5 p.m.
[SPEAKER_04]: on August 27th.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as everybody knows, everybody has set
up here, this is an empowering moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: You are the industry and the industry
needs you to speak up because this is the
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity for you to comment,
not just on the new information,
[SPEAKER_04]: but on anything within the regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is our last opportunity where they
will be evaluating and updating these
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations in full.
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving forward, it will just be one the
regulatory agencies are authorized to do,
[SPEAKER_04]: potentially issue new licenses or you have
to go through the legislative process.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the last time that you can go to
them as the public and they must respond
[SPEAKER_04]: to you legally.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a lawyer, there is a great lineage of
case law in this area that every single
[SPEAKER_04]: comment they receive, they must respond to
and they are not allowed to say comment
[SPEAKER_04]: noted.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you ask a question, if you provide a
solution, they have to address it and
[SPEAKER_04]: respond to it in a meaningful manner as
long as asterisks, it is relevant to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So part of the way to ensure that
relevance is by, as was mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_03]: being specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna wanna cite the actual
regulation that you are responding to and
[SPEAKER_03]: offer the citation of what section,
what part, what is your comment based on.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're gonna wanna explain the problem
that you see with the regulation as
[SPEAKER_03]: written and then you're gonna wanna offer
a solution of how, in light of this issue,
[SPEAKER_03]: you would suggest that they actually
correct it.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you send them a letter that says,
you're destroying the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_03]: please go away, that's not a relevant
comment that they need to respond to.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of the comments that are submitted
become public record.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will be able to be read by the
public.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have to provide a reason for either
why they agree with the comment or they
[SPEAKER_03]: don't agree with the comment and why it
was incorporated or why it wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: incorporated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the locations for these hearings,
each agency is doing their own series of
[SPEAKER_03]: hearings.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Bureau of Cannabis Control,
BCC, will do hearings in Oakland,
[SPEAKER_03]: Los Angeles, and Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Department of Public Health,
which oversees manufacturing, will do them
[SPEAKER_03]: in Brea, Eureka, and Oakland.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the Department of Food and Ag,
that oversees cultivation, will do them in
[SPEAKER_03]: Eureka, Riverside, Santa Barbara,
and Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_03]: As published, the public hearings are only
scheduled to be two hours long.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you are going to give public
comments, I would be prepared to have your
[SPEAKER_03]: comment written so that if they do not
have time for you to go, sometimes they
[SPEAKER_03]: set up stations, they have places there
you can submit but don't only assure that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to be able to make a verbal
comment if you go to one of these public
[SPEAKER_03]: hearings.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's great to submit the comments any
way you can on all channels.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand this is an incredibly
complicated process.
[SPEAKER_03]: The regs are not fun to read.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of the implications are not clear of
what they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I also highly suggest that you get
connected with other people who are going
[SPEAKER_03]: through this process.
[SPEAKER_03]: To have those conversations, to go through
the language and make sure that the way
[SPEAKER_03]: you're reading it is the way other people
are reading it, and to really communicate
[SPEAKER_03]: and collaborate on these things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of you are operating businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have time to sit there and read
hundreds of pages of regulations and offer
[SPEAKER_03]: really well thought out comments.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are trade organizations and groups
and many people going through that process
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you do have a brand you have a logo,
you have a company, you can connect with
[SPEAKER_03]: other people who are writing a large
letter and sign on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have them add your logo if they're
representing a comment that you also
[SPEAKER_03]: support that speaks volumes.
[SPEAKER_03]: The regular agencies can see that the
industry is in accord on certain things
[SPEAKER_03]: and that there's a lot of agreement in
force.
[SPEAKER_03]: As Sarah was saying, that security guard,
there was only a five day comment period
[SPEAKER_03]: in the last update and they slid something
in there and they had to take it right out
[SPEAKER_03]: because the industry response and the
amount of comments that they received was
[SPEAKER_03]: so overwhelming that it was clear that
this was not a good direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is nothing I can say right now
that I can emphasize as much as I'd like
[SPEAKER_03]: to how important this period of time is.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the last train leaving the station
for this industry that gets really
[SPEAKER_03]: complicated after this.
[SPEAKER_03]: The process is laborious as Pamela was
saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a heavy legislative lift.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is slow, slow processes of government
from here on out.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the opportunity for the public to
have immediate and impactful results based
[SPEAKER_03]: on the feedback you give the government.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the fact that I had the opportunity to
watch laws change based on something
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody said that made sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a powerful experience to realize
in the midst of all this bullshit we live
[SPEAKER_03]: in, that works sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: To give you guys some time frame
knowledge, if you have to legislatively
[SPEAKER_04]: lobby to get a bill to change these
regulations once they are effective,
[SPEAKER_04]: those, even if you're able to make that
change that year, it doesn't go into
[SPEAKER_04]: effect until the following year,
the first of the following year.
[SPEAKER_04]: These regulations, because we had
emergency regulations, they must,
[SPEAKER_04]: within 180 days from the last time we went
through this process with the readoption
[SPEAKER_04]: of the emergency regulations, have to have
final regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once those are adopted, they're final.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you don't like that all of your
packaging, for example, must be child
[SPEAKER_04]: resistant and tamper evident at the actual
product versus the exit bags, and that
[SPEAKER_04]: stays because we as an industry support
some of what the Department of Public
[SPEAKER_04]: Health and BCC are saying, then it stays.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it doesn't, and there are others,
out there, law enforcement, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: mothers who are protecting the children
who are, alcohol bottles aren't that safe.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can twist them and open them,
but that is besides the point.
[SPEAKER_04]: They will comment as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not just that industry is
commenting, it is your opposition is
[SPEAKER_04]: commenting as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So nothing that is in these rags now that
you like or you don't like will stay.
[SPEAKER_04]: It can change.
[SPEAKER_04]: So comment, comment, comment, comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I cannot say it enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: No comment is insignificant.
[SPEAKER_04]: As Julie said, if there's ever litigation
in the future, it is administrative and
[SPEAKER_04]: closed looped, meaning that the only thing
that you can argue is what was said,
[SPEAKER_04]: not what was not said.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's no such thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mad lock, smoking gun, all of that does
not exist in the administrative process.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the agency is only responsible to
address, modify what they are told when
[SPEAKER_04]: they are given the opportunity to solicit
information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does anyone have any questions about the
comment period or its importance?
[SPEAKER_03]: The question is that it is very,
what the gentleman is suggesting is that
[SPEAKER_03]: it is also important to understand what
can be dealt with in the regulations and
[SPEAKER_03]: what is embedded into the regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are things that were made
explicit in proposition 64 that the
[SPEAKER_03]: agencies do not have the power to alter.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are certain things that are
hardwired into the rags.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is important to know the value of
your comment will be also affected by
[SPEAKER_03]: whether or not these things are covered by
statute or if they're regulatory.
[SPEAKER_03]: And able to be altered.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a great time to have a reading
party and go back and read Prop 64 and see
[SPEAKER_03]: what people actually voted for and what
elements are hardwired into there that may
[SPEAKER_03]: not be able to be retracted.
[SPEAKER_03]: For example, an excise tax, hardwired into
the system, the amount and the fact that
[SPEAKER_03]: it exists.
[SPEAKER_03]: So something like a comment that says,
I don't like the excise tax, you should
[SPEAKER_03]: take that out.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're destroying businesses and we can't
compete with the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_03]: While true, may, is not something that the
regulators have the capacity to change
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's hardwired.
[SPEAKER_03]: That would require a bill or perhaps a
lawsuit to question why an adult use bill
[SPEAKER_03]: has the power to apply an excise tax to a
medical market anyway.
I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know how that happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a really important clarification
to know what's in statute and what do the
[SPEAKER_03]: regulators have wiggle room oversight on
in the ability to create regulations
[SPEAKER_03]: around.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not barred from from litigating.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're welcome to America.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: What it is is this is an administrative
process and therefore you are limited.
[SPEAKER_04]: In what you can sue over, what claims you
can make, you have to raise them for the
[SPEAKER_04]: agency.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you don't raise an issue during the
administrative process, during this public
[SPEAKER_04]: comment period, you are precluded from
telling the agency that they did not do a
[SPEAKER_04]: good enough job.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why commenting is so important and
why your comments are important because if
[SPEAKER_04]: that's what your lens is, then you need to
make sure that you have fully articulated
[SPEAKER_04]: that to the agency's ability to address
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: For example, if you want to look at what
happened with the lawsuit against the DEA,
[SPEAKER_04]: that was with CBD, that was one of the
major issues that the court had was that
[SPEAKER_04]: they did not exhaust their administrative
remedies by providing the very intricate
[SPEAKER_04]: comment that they were arguing over in the
litigation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's a same or similar industry
situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to comment.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cannot sit back and hope that somebody
else provides the comment that you want to
[SPEAKER_04]: make.
[SPEAKER_04]: You always have to have a building.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are land use related licenses.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every license has a land use component.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now you can be a delivery service that
operates out of a building that's properly
[SPEAKER_04]: permitted at the local level, but you
can't just be, no license can operate in a
[SPEAKER_04]: residence, but you can't have like a PO
box and then a computer in your room and
[SPEAKER_04]: run a delivery service.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a big issue for ASA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We feel patients should have access to
delivery and one of the most glorious
[SPEAKER_01]: moments when I looked at the regs was the
language that would allow you as a
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed provider to deliver all over,
not just in the few jurisdictions that
[SPEAKER_01]: were open enough to allow the sick and
dying to have access to their medicine in
[SPEAKER_01]: their homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want that to stay in the regs,
then you need to write a letter and you
[SPEAKER_01]: need to write a letter now because not
only is the League of Cities very much
[SPEAKER_01]: against this, but retail operators are not
always thrilled either.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where the rubber meets the road
folks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want the good stuff, you have to
fight for it and you have to fight hard
[SPEAKER_01]: because your opponents are well equipped
with lots of money and lots of time and
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have much of either.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you care about delivery,
please write to the Bureau and tell them
[SPEAKER_01]: how important it is to you because ASA
will be writing my trade organization,
[SPEAKER_01]: the Southern California Coalition,
will be very much writing about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have multiple comments,
but they're from different topics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the same agency, can you send them all
in the same thing or you have to separate
[SPEAKER_00]: by topic?
[SPEAKER_04]: In your comment letter for ease of
reference, you want to keep them
[SPEAKER_04]: continuous, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So topic and then all of your points.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as long as it's the same agency,
so if it's the BCC and you're a retailer
[SPEAKER_04]: or a micro business, a distributor or
testing lab, and you have comments on any
[SPEAKER_04]: of those, they can all go in one letter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the agencies have put out some really
great guidelines that's on their website.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to the BCC site, the CDFA site
or the Department of Public Health,
[SPEAKER_03]: they have these little instructions.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Department of Public Health is lagging
on the design aspect, but that's all
[SPEAKER_03]: right.
[SPEAKER_03]: The information is still there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The BCC does a really good job of breaking
down how to do it, how to put a heading,
[SPEAKER_03]: how to make the citation, how to explain
the problem, and how to provide your
[SPEAKER_03]: solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the amazing thing I found working with
the agencies as well and talking with them
[SPEAKER_03]: is they really are amazingly open in this
moment of time to suggestions.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do not know how to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Events, special events, that license type
gets very little attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: It got very little revision.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that if you look at what happened
with Chalice, if you look at the
[SPEAKER_04]: difficulty that is going to be
forthcoming, that the Bureau failed to
[SPEAKER_04]: understand that part of 64 was that the
people wanted to have direct access.
[SPEAKER_04]: That special event license type doesn't
entitle you to be a limited retailer or
[SPEAKER_04]: distributor, and now the only thing they
did change was that you have to have
[SPEAKER_04]: designated areas for that, but then only
retailers can come.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's very convoluted.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very difficult issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is one that is generally important
to the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's one of the ones that people
universally want.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is universally by the BCC sort of the
redheaded stepchild.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you have a brand and you want to be
able to get direct to market without going
[SPEAKER_04]: through a retailer to a special event,
and that's been sort of your mainstay of
[SPEAKER_04]: how you've interfaced with your customers
or patients, there's no allowance for
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I encourage everyone, please reach out
to Americans for Safe Access.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're a tremendous resource and amazing
organization.
[SPEAKER_03]: For any operator in this place,
please reach out to the California
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabis Industry Association,
CCIA, tremendous resource, doing a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: work, writing white papers, writing
comments, helping in this process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pamela Epstein, GreenWise Consulting,
brilliant person.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're here to help.
[SPEAKER_03]: Reach out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for letting us hijack the beginning
of the panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: To talk about this incredibly important
time, who's going to comment?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we will continue with your
previously planned programming.
