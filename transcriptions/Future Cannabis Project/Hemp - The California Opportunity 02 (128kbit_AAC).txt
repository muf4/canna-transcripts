[SPEAKER_03]: I think this is a good segue into the next
topic which would be the environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: component of hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know we hear a lot towards the 25,000
different uses and I think however many it
[SPEAKER_03]: is that one of the things that stands out
is that hemp seems to perform nearly
[SPEAKER_03]: better than any other option.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's that's where some of its
usefulness and utility I think really
[SPEAKER_03]: comes in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of the environmental aspect we
know that it has great benefits to soil
[SPEAKER_03]: and and air quality and putting carbon
back in the earth at the farming component
[SPEAKER_03]: but also let's talk a little bit about you
know limiting waste and reusable products
[SPEAKER_03]: that can come from hemp and most
importantly I think the environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: aspect that inspired you to do your
certain businesses today.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the farming aspect of it right now
anything that you farm that's you know
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis or hemp it basically you need to
farm it organically because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: thankfully nothing no pesticide labeled
for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a way I feel that's going to help
move the industry forward into a norm of
[SPEAKER_00]: farming organically instead of staying
with conventional practices.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know just as far as like the soil
remediation and the you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: biodegradability the fact that you can
grow you know two to three crops of hemp a
[SPEAKER_02]: year instead you know talk about paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know it takes how many years to grow
an acre of trees and you can have you know
[SPEAKER_02]: at least two crops of hemp in this in the
same year for you know less water no
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticides and it's it's just again
there's so much that I could say but I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: go ahead and yeah it's kind of a wonder
crop in that regard.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that the everything that's been
said is true and at the same time I think
[SPEAKER_04]: that it's really important to recognize
that the forces that are driving not only
[SPEAKER_04]: the legalization of industrial hemp but
the growth of the market are not
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily you know the small companies
that are here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's big ag.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only reason why Mitch McConnell got on
board after decades of opposing the
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization of industrial hemp is because
his buddies the Kentucky tobacco farmers
[SPEAKER_04]: were losing money in the tobacco in the
tobacco world.
[SPEAKER_04]: They hit with a couple of bad years and
you know they figured they'd cut their cut
[SPEAKER_04]: their losses and invest in an
up-and-coming crop and once they got their
[SPEAKER_04]: infrastructure together and you know and
was they were able to sort of slow
[SPEAKER_04]: everything down through the earlier farm
bill and do the research and and make sure
[SPEAKER_04]: that it was going to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then they were saying okay we're now we're
ready and so McConnell let it go through
[SPEAKER_04]: and pass and garnered the bipartisan
support which you know had it had had this
[SPEAKER_04]: happened earlier anyway I don't want to
speculate but the point is that I went to
[SPEAKER_04]: some of those test fields in Kentucky and
I saw the research that was happening and
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of the research has to do with
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like well we in this little test
patch we use this pesticide and in this we
[SPEAKER_04]: use this but we're trying to figure out
which pesticide is right for which so
[SPEAKER_04]: there there is even though you know the
this kind of theory is that hemp grows so
[SPEAKER_04]: densely that we don't need pesticides.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reality is that Monsanto is tied in
with big tobacco and they've got their
[SPEAKER_04]: supply chains and their relationships and
everything and they're going to figure out
[SPEAKER_04]: a way to justify you know more pesticides
for hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just that simple and I think and and
not not just the pesticide part of it but
[SPEAKER_04]: the the big agricultural practices as
opposed to regenerative farming practices
[SPEAKER_04]: which can not only obviate the need for
pesticides but can actually contribute to
[SPEAKER_04]: the positive environmental impacts that we
want to see particularly with respect to
[SPEAKER_04]: global warming.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in a way I think what's unique the
unique opportunity here is that the hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer is pretty much different than the
tobacco consumer and so the opportunity is
[SPEAKER_04]: that the hemp consumer can drive the
development of the industry and therefore
[SPEAKER_04]: affect the overall environmental impact
that we have and and so they're there it's
[SPEAKER_04]: both going to come from the top down to
some degree there as long as there are
[SPEAKER_04]: companies like you know John Rulak's you
know re Botanicals who are going to get
[SPEAKER_04]: into every single Whole Foods and whatever
around but they'll they'll still only be
[SPEAKER_04]: one option there's also going to be that
you know drug CBD company which do you
[SPEAKER_04]: know the one of Jeanette?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah GW Pharma Epidolics yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right and I mean you look at they'd send
me some samples at the store and there
[SPEAKER_04]: were these little fluorescent colored
pills and I'm like wait what are these
[SPEAKER_04]: this is CBD this is like the new face of
CB what is this company and I was just
[SPEAKER_04]: like no thank you into the trash so so and
I'm a consumer and I but I'm not just a
[SPEAKER_04]: store owner I'm a consumer so I made that
decision and I made that decision for me
[SPEAKER_04]: and for my the people who come to my store
so anyway so that's that's kind of the
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity is where we can influence how
this industry develops and therefore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Amen and I as far as you know I'm thinking
too with you know paper I've been in the
[SPEAKER_02]: magazine industry I how about you know I
look forward to the day when hemp is grown
[SPEAKER_02]: plentifully enough and the prices drop
enough because we it's very expensive
[SPEAKER_02]: that's why you know even a lot of people
don't have their business cards printed on
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp paper because it's it's prohibitive
but how about how about good job and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know how about the day when you can pick
up a magazine and it's made of hemp paper
[SPEAKER_02]: instead of you know what and an acre of
hemp gives you four four times as much
[SPEAKER_02]: usable you know usable content as as an
acre of trees so which probably why it was
[SPEAKER_02]: illegalized in the first place.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just want to touch on a few quick things
on the paper side you know there's there's
[SPEAKER_05]: a few people in the country making hemp
paper on a small scale one I would want to
[SPEAKER_05]: point out is Greenfield Paper Company down
in San Diego they have I think the most
[SPEAKER_05]: consistent hemp paper on the market right
now that's made domestically but the pulp
[SPEAKER_05]: that they're using I want to say is from
Spain just because there's not a
[SPEAKER_05]: consistent enough domestic source of hemp
pulp for them to be using and then quickly
[SPEAKER_05]: two other things you know we're talking
about Big Ag earlier you know cotton
[SPEAKER_05]: accounts for I think 25 percent of all you
know pesticides used globally so hemp
[SPEAKER_05]: provides a great alternative there and
then for us specifically we're always
[SPEAKER_05]: comparing it to corn because that's what
most bioplastics are made out of and it
[SPEAKER_05]: uses about a third of the water is corn
and grows in a little more than half the
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that that topics really timely too
I just got back from the World Ag Expo and
[SPEAKER_03]: and you could see that there's a lot of
people still using heavy machinery you
[SPEAKER_03]: know just ripping up the earth rippers and
tillers and everything and a small
[SPEAKER_03]: percentage of the market is focused on you
know organics and regenerative farming
[SPEAKER_03]: practices and so it's not just in hemp but
it's also in the Big Ag and then that's
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of a timely conversation as well
because you have labeling and
[SPEAKER_03]: organizations like US Hemp Authority that
are trying to put some some self
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations on labeling and identifying
the product and some of the dialogue with
[SPEAKER_03]: in the industry is about well sourcing you
know are we going to have to actually
[SPEAKER_03]: identify where where the products coming
from because currently their suggestions
[SPEAKER_03]: are not to include a country of origin.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is the CBD actually derived from hemp
because there are people considering you
[SPEAKER_03]: know deriving CBD from from yeast and
doing it in a GMO fashion.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these these things are like front and
center considerations not only for the
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp industry but for ag in general and
for the canvas industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you know it's right there it's kind of
big industry versus regenerative and
[SPEAKER_03]: smaller scale practice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the biggest thing is education.
[SPEAKER_00]: People need to be educated that they can
farm in a different practice and they can
[SPEAKER_00]: make the right decision based upon you
know how they want the world to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think California could be in one of
the forefronts of that just because
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody here is very organically minded
and you know closed-loop farming and such.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think education is the best place to
start and I know with this hemp CBD versus
[SPEAKER_00]: the versus the cannabis CBD that's one of
the big education points right now because
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't understand what the
differences are because it's all kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: been oh it's CBD is CBD and now there's a
lot of companies going out there and going
[SPEAKER_00]: out making the differences of no there's
hemp CBD there's cannabis CBD these are
[SPEAKER_00]: the benefits this is what they can bring
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think education would be pretty much
for anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah and education you know again from the
media standpoint and I can see even from a
[SPEAKER_02]: few years ago just that you know people
are very slowly it's two steps forward one
[SPEAKER_02]: step back but you know they're coming
around to being more approachable I guess
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say with you know with being open
to even receiving education to you know
[SPEAKER_02]: into you know non-cannabis companies you
know advertising on cannabis platforms
[SPEAKER_02]: saying you know that you're not gonna get
like blackwalled for this or something
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I mean and also the the converse is
true I can't even believe my eyes still
[SPEAKER_04]: when I see some of these medmen billboards
all over town I'm like oh my gosh there's
[SPEAKER_04]: a giant billboard in the sky and it says
cannabis am I in some kind of like
[SPEAKER_04]: alternative reality here because this is
not what I thought the world would be like
[SPEAKER_04]: when I was you know 15 years old and I was
paranoid all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's that and then there's the idea
that the hemp consumer and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer is the cannabis consumers coming
out of the closet and hemp consumer is
[SPEAKER_04]: discovering that they are that they that
they actually that there's a there are
[SPEAKER_04]: products out there that are more effective
and better and better for the planet in
[SPEAKER_04]: line with their values and so just today I
was at my shop in the morning and these
[SPEAKER_04]: two older women came by and walking their
dogs and they're like oh look we can get
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD here I was like wow this is just you
know like one step away from my mom
[SPEAKER_04]: wanting to take CBD which I'm still
working on her but she loves the hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: clothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that that's it's education it's
hemp education and it's also just the
[SPEAKER_04]: mainstreaming of what was once a vital
crop for this country so it's kind of a
[SPEAKER_04]: rediscovering of our own history it's it's
reclaiming our plant inheritance you know
[SPEAKER_04]: it's so weird that that a plant was
basically a plant that was grown in every
[SPEAKER_04]: state and and all over the world was sort
of erased and you know banned and
[SPEAKER_04]: demonized and taken away from it's from
the ecosystems it's terrible but now it's
[SPEAKER_04]: back and coming back stronger and
stronger.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'd love to add one more thing just on the
topic of education you know it can be
[SPEAKER_05]: sometimes confusing to look at industries
within their silos but you know taking a
[SPEAKER_05]: more macro look at the whole world in the
global economy some of the macro shifts
[SPEAKER_05]: that are happening and that need to happen
are shifting towards what we would call
[SPEAKER_05]: circular economy versus a linear economy
which is take make dispose which is how
[SPEAKER_05]: we've been operating for you know pretty
much for all the industrial era and modern
[SPEAKER_05]: era and you know really I think a lot of
what the hemp industry is perfectly suited
[SPEAKER_05]: for is is furthering our path towards the
circular economy where we're designing
[SPEAKER_05]: things for recovery whether it's clothing
whether it's packaging whether it's the
[SPEAKER_05]: products we put in our body it's doing
things regeneratively and and I would
[SPEAKER_05]: encourage you all to look up the Ellen
MacArthur Foundation and just find out
[SPEAKER_05]: more about what a circular economy means
and then I think it will make it easier to
[SPEAKER_05]: understand how hemp and other things that
are happening globally right now fit into
[SPEAKER_05]: that larger story and that larger change
that needs to be happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I think I think we're all right there
with you James and it's kind of an ironic
[SPEAKER_03]: and circular movement itself that you know
this plant that has a 10 to 12 thousand
[SPEAKER_03]: year history with humans some some people
theorize that we actually have a
[SPEAKER_03]: co-evolutionary process with cannabis like
Michael Pollan and now it's coming back
[SPEAKER_03]: into the mainstream it's pulling all of
these resources it's giving us resources
[SPEAKER_03]: to to heal the planet and change our ways
and alternatives to fossil fuels and
[SPEAKER_03]: things that we've been just doing kind of
blindly and unconsciously so it's an
[SPEAKER_03]: element of like how do we bring the
educational aspect into our branding how
[SPEAKER_03]: do we how do we focus products to a
marketplace that is about you know
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerative practices natural products
and really like responsible consumerism so
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe talk to like some of your favorite
products on the market or how you do it
[SPEAKER_03]: within your brand to like represent those
sort of business ethics too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just kind of as part of that segue too I'd
like to say I think that probably the one
[SPEAKER_02]: of the one of the best things that we can
do as people in the industry is to be
[SPEAKER_02]: authentic about who you are what you do
because I it was a real eye-opener I
[SPEAKER_02]: started going to some very professional
networking groups a couple years ago and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was just it was so funny because you
know people you know tell them what you do
[SPEAKER_02]: and about half the people were like oh
cool the other half were like you know but
[SPEAKER_02]: I swear of that other of that other 50%
probably 90% of them would come back
[SPEAKER_02]: around and go well actually you know so
it's just when we when we give ourselves
[SPEAKER_02]: permission to be authentic it it's it has
an exponential effect it gives other
[SPEAKER_02]: people permission to be authentic you know
and that's how change happens so that's my
[SPEAKER_02]: take on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the way that I in the vital hemp
gets the word out and sort of markets the
[SPEAKER_04]: the vitality of this crop is by connecting
it to everyday activities so last year I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't know at a party I must have said
something which is like everything's
[SPEAKER_04]: better in hemp and and then I was like
better in hemp that's the slogan and so I
[SPEAKER_04]: came up with a whole marketing kind of
campaign where it was like pictures with
[SPEAKER_04]: just better in it and it's like you know
yoga is better in hemp you know men are
[SPEAKER_04]: better in hemp New York is better in hemp
meditation is better in hemp and so it's
[SPEAKER_04]: like a wide range of people in places and
things that are better in hemp and if you
[SPEAKER_04]: really think about it it's true so it's
kind of an unarguable thing and if you
[SPEAKER_04]: experience it so I think the it's so
interesting to me that 10 years ago or so
[SPEAKER_04]: there was maybe one company that I knew
knew of making hemp shampoo and now there
[SPEAKER_04]: must be 30 at least maybe more maybe 50.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I just read that Barneys is now going
to include CBD cosmetic products in their
[SPEAKER_03]: store.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah there you go yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're opening up a whole little CBD
store in the with one brand that I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: remember the name of the brand now which
is terrible but Bebo there we go they're
[SPEAKER_00]: opening that up in the Beverly Hills
Barneys which is just incredible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that just shows how far things have
come.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well hopefully it's not just like a fad
though.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not just a product like available for
elite consumers that right and it could be
[SPEAKER_03]: widespread because the efficacy is so good
for everyone in different walks of life.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I think that's what the studies are
showing just even anecdotal studies are
[SPEAKER_04]: showing that people who are using CBD are
leaving pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Talk about a cure for the oxycontin
crisis.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a good one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Educational marketing that's all I have to
say about how to go about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean there's so much education that you
have to do with your consumers anyways in
[SPEAKER_05]: the hemp industry that you should always
just be leading with education.
[SPEAKER_03]: Looking towards the future I mean the last
couple of years have been bright and I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't think they're you know even what we
had in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the future of cannabis and specifically
hemp and hemp in California and even
[SPEAKER_03]: yourselves and your own ventures if you
want to kind of spew off that and we can
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of close out with some thoughts
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really hope that we're able to continue
building the on the cannabis side and the
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp side the industries that you know are
the ones that we've been building towards.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope we're not too detract by you know
big cannabis and big hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously there's a place for that but I
just you know looking towards the future.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hope the infrastructure comes but with
the infrastructure I hope we're able to
[SPEAKER_05]: hold on to the integrity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just feel with it being such an amazing
plant that we just need to stay true to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant and basically give to it what it
has given to us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say what one of my biggest focuses
with moving ahead is to include I hate to
[SPEAKER_02]: use the word minority but to include
populations that have been kind of left
[SPEAKER_02]: out and have been marginalized including
obviously Native Americans and you know
[SPEAKER_02]: because they actually can't federally grow
well marijuana that side of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: But of course we're focused on hemp here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well they can but they have to give up
their sovereignty.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with hemp it's another story thankfully
and I just want to give a shout out to Evo
[SPEAKER_02]: Hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are working with Alex White Plume
from the Pine Ridge Reservation and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're in 3,000 locations now and they
expect 25% of their revenue to come from
[SPEAKER_02]: the hemp from Alex White Plume and from
White Plume hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again I got the chance to visit that
reservation several years ago and 90% of
[SPEAKER_02]: that reservation lives beneath the poverty
line and there's literally the middle of
[SPEAKER_02]: nowhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: People aren't not working because they
don't want to.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're working because there's no place
to work.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually the poorest county in the
United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes and you know let's do what we can to
get behind the rights of these people who
[SPEAKER_02]: were placed where they are and let's give
them a sustainable industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well I think that the future of hemp kind
of relates to some things that were talked
[SPEAKER_04]: about on the last panel where I heard some
guys saying you know these investors they
[SPEAKER_04]: come in and they're so excited about this
new industry and he says dude I've been
[SPEAKER_04]: growing for 20 years or this is not a new
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know in the same way hemp is there
have been people in this industry a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: longer than me and I've been doing it 16
years and there are a lot of and I say a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of the people who've been doing it
when it wasn't necessarily the newest
[SPEAKER_04]: hottest thing that's going to be in every
you know supermarket those people were in
[SPEAKER_04]: it because of you know a kind of a love
and a respect for the plant and what it
[SPEAKER_04]: could do for life on earth in addition to
wanting to make a living and seeing a
[SPEAKER_04]: future that we you know we wanted to to
manifest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the the challenge is that some of these
people who've been in it the longest with
[SPEAKER_04]: the best practices and the best values are
getting marginalized both in cannabis and
[SPEAKER_04]: in hemp and it's not some malicious thing
necessarily it's just giant market forces
[SPEAKER_04]: moving in because they see opportunity
they've managed the legislative landscape
[SPEAKER_04]: to favor them and they're going to
capitalize on it and so then the question
[SPEAKER_04]: becomes are who who's again how do we
somehow effectively educate the consumer
[SPEAKER_04]: not just to love hemp but to love certain
that hemp that has a certain kind of a
[SPEAKER_04]: supply chain in the same way that's that
consumers now want organic produce right
[SPEAKER_04]: even at their Walmart they want organic
produce and so you know if we can can
[SPEAKER_04]: create that kind of an ethic for our
industry both from the consumer to the
[SPEAKER_04]: highest you know to the biggest producer
which I don't think is going to happen
[SPEAKER_04]: easily the only the big boys only come
along when they realize the little guys
[SPEAKER_04]: are taking away their market share right
because they're so that's what that's what
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we need to do is stand by our our
best values continue to educate the
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer with that there are differences
even within our industry in terms of
[SPEAKER_04]: what's produced and and and thereby
hopefully you know get to a better place
[SPEAKER_03]: with all of this yeah yeah those lines
just to kind of close it out I mean
[SPEAKER_03]: there's there's been people in California
doing good work for decades so that the
[SPEAKER_03]: market could develop and we could get here
I mean Jack Herrera Emperor wears no
[SPEAKER_03]: clothes Richard Davis and the World
Cannabis Foundation and and John Trudell
[SPEAKER_03]: with Hempstead Project Heart who the
nemonomy tribes actually taken over that
[SPEAKER_03]: operation so there's a lot of nonprofits
and groups along with the future cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: project that are helping us to get the
word out as an industry so appreciate all
[SPEAKER_03]: that so I think we can shift into Q&A now
I'm tethered here with my microphone but
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to join me up front so my
question is do you think it would be
[SPEAKER_01]: prudent to have a moratorium on hemp
production in areas that are already well
[SPEAKER_01]: known for their cannabis cultivation
outdoors can't or can they coexist
[SPEAKER_00]: question I believe that they can coexist
but it needs to be very well planned out
[SPEAKER_00]: on how they coexist as long as the hemp
farmer is staying with feminized seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: the distance is you know five miles away
from the most of all the cannabis like
[SPEAKER_00]: where I'm at in Santa Barbara County all
the cannabis is grown in greenhouses so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not open fields so it the seeds are
feminized and the distance is set I think
[SPEAKER_00]: the county would be able to regulate that
and everybody could be happy yeah that's
[SPEAKER_03]: something at the CDFA level that's like
like really a topic that that comes down
[SPEAKER_03]: even to the local level too so it is the
the county ag commissioners the county
[SPEAKER_03]: boards of supervisors that are addressing
that we have the opportunity in California
[SPEAKER_03]: that we actually have 58 counties where is
the county ag commissioner that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: sets the rules so there are already
counties that have at least temporary
[SPEAKER_03]: moratoriums on on hemp pollen or hemp
production Riverside County Tony what else
[SPEAKER_03]: Santa Barbara County San Bernardino San
Bernardino County so first and foremost if
[SPEAKER_03]: you do want to cultivate him San Joaquin
see there's they're popping up every day
[SPEAKER_03]: check with your check with your county
commissioner all right that's a wrap
[SPEAKER_03]: thanks everybody thank you
