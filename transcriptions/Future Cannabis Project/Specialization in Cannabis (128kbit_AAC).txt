[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think I know the whole
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a master of distillate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not where I spent my time.
[SPEAKER_02]: When distillate all first came out,
we started seeing extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember the first cats were blowing out
of PVC tubes, cooking it on the oven.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this would have been 2001.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is when people started first
squirting.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I hit up my mom and say, hey,
mom, from a scientific point of view,
[SPEAKER_02]: what does this look like in the modern
world?
[SPEAKER_02]: So she sends me all the modern extraction
pictures of today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lie, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to do five.
[SPEAKER_02]: I might even do greater, but I'm going to
have to take the deal, or I'm going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at 20.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not the joint time that kills me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the time that kills me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can handle joint time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't handle the years of not being
present in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got kids, and I got life.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I said, I'm cool with the
distillate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I mess around with people that are
competent, and I go to labs all the time,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I hang out, and I got partners that do
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when I look at pen cottages,
I go neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: They ask me, we need varieties to feed
into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can go my direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I don't want to be brilliant in every
goddamn room, because you're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: You end up diffusing your overall
knowledge base.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I try to stay within cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to stay within propagation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to stay with organic cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I understand how to run biologically
driven systems outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I work on market, because all those
things were prior what I've done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just an expansion of what I'm
doing now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not trying to be a distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to be one.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a distribution company tied to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: The turp stripping, I don't want to be the
turp stripper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have companies coming in utilizing my
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: The manufacturing and processing,
we own the properties and the facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it lets us utilize our resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not going to be the ones that
come in and do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be able to have partners come in and
do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this way, it lets me and my guys stay
where we belong, and just stay on point,
[SPEAKER_02]: and keep chasing what we're chasing,
which is just nasty varietals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff that's nasty, and stuff that's nasty
that works for the cultivator,
[SPEAKER_02]: and stuff that the market, I call it
market velocity.
[SPEAKER_02]: But things that leave and then money comes
back, leave, money comes back,
[SPEAKER_02]: leave, money comes back.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you create a real loop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not something that's going to pop
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use purple punch as an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this shit looks incredible in a bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke this shit twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I challenge you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Smoke it twice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because really, it's horrible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I see some people bring me bags of
this stuff at the shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it is some of the most picturesque
cannabis ever flowered.
[SPEAKER_02]: You couldn't get a better shine off that
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just like whoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is stellar.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as soon as you smoke it, you go,
where's all the terpenes?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's all the punch?
[SPEAKER_02]: And where's all the punch?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's an OG to a perp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the potential's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the quality wasn't selected.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was selected off Instagram ability.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though Instagram drives so much
of what you're doing, it's not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: drive a lot of your new users,
because that's not where they're going to
[SPEAKER_02]: shop for their weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't buy steak from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not buying my soda from Instagram.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't drink soda.
[SPEAKER_02]: But using that as an example, I'm not
buying it off of IG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't buy it off of Facebook either.
[SPEAKER_02]: I buy it off of either marketing that's
been locally done or marketing that's in
[SPEAKER_02]: conventional methodologies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's trying to figure out how do
you create that and how do you create
[SPEAKER_02]: systems that are accurate so that there's
a bunch of us that work with these systems
[SPEAKER_02]: so we don't have redundancy, so you and I
aren't competing on the same genomic
[SPEAKER_02]: level.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have your product diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have my product diversity.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both fit the gradient.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're both scientifically accurate.
[SPEAKER_02]: They both work for us as cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: It allows us to work in true capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once I started researching a champagne
model in France, I saw it because
[SPEAKER_02]: champagne model is defined by the house.
[SPEAKER_02]: So champagne model is four specific
grapes, one production methodology.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to be part of the champagne
gang, you're getting certified on one
[SPEAKER_02]: production methodology.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four grapes.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that does is that creates a
standardized product that the house can
[SPEAKER_02]: mine from.
[SPEAKER_02]: So most houses aren't even running their
own fields.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't need to.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can buy from every little farmer,
gather the grape, and then it's how they
[SPEAKER_02]: process the grape.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how they go through the carbonation
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's how they go through all the holding
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what defines champagne.
[SPEAKER_02]: What everybody in cannabis thinks is going
to be the burgundy model, where it's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be Appalachians, where it's my little
piece of property is so unique that it
[SPEAKER_02]: imparts such a quality of experience to
the flower that it will define me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the problem is a lot of that
methodology and models work because France
[SPEAKER_02]: was able to do this in 1860s.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one had any idea the potential of value
at the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You think they're going to give little
people that much money power?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we want to work on is regional
power.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to work on being able to have the
regions in California that have outdoor
[SPEAKER_02]: situations, because outdoor and indoor are
different models, different markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the outdoor models will be able to
have regions specific, cultivar specific.
[SPEAKER_02]: So say you have that Clementine Oskush,
and you take that and you go into it
[SPEAKER_02]: genomically because it's yours.
[SPEAKER_02]: You chase it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You find the variety that goes into
outdoor production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And pretty soon you're able to license it
in the farms in specific geographical
[SPEAKER_02]: regions that are suitable to produce it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You make money on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The market gets it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The market should get it at a better price
point in terms of the outdoor production,
[SPEAKER_02]: because cost of production is lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're going to have less consistency,
more variability, because climate will
[SPEAKER_02]: affect it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But ultimately you'll be able to get
products out that work off of these
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the product?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the OZK lemon citrine turf extract
from that.
That
[SPEAKER_02]: is kind of neat.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got the two phenols.
[SPEAKER_02]: The one that took the more after the Oz,
and then the one that took more after the
[SPEAKER_02]: orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: One more after the fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fuel version has absolutely no
fungal propensity whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this was the one that we want to run
outdoor, because when you put them both
[SPEAKER_02]: together, the first variant, which was,
to me, I like it a little more in
[SPEAKER_02]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it going a little bit more in the
orange tone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the second one has more of the gas
with the orange flow through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of them stellar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Both of them award winners.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just what you like as preference.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the Oz won.
[SPEAKER_02]: More fungally prone.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in a buffered space indoor,
not an issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that shit outside, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a trick.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the second one that we did a year
later, radically different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Full rainstorm on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: No botrytis.
[SPEAKER_02]: No PM issues.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you want a copy of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can throw you one of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the same thing, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in probably three people's hands
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's gassy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can smell the mandarin in it,
though, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real nice blend.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you smoke it, you get that sweet,
skittlesy, mandarin orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you're getting that gassy poke
from the OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, because with Skittle by itself,
I think Skittle by itself makes some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the best ice hash I've ever smoked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when Brandon started washing that stuff
initially and we started smoking that
[SPEAKER_02]: really high level Skittle ice hash,
he was competing in concentrate cups with
[SPEAKER_02]: that ice hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And doing well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The quality was superior.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was like, wow, that's where it
shines.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't have a long holdability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you smoke it, you kind of come
down off it quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when the Oskush got into it,
that's when it was cherry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We found a really nice gem of a male.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had a great structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We crossed it with aloe bar.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, favorite genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a great strawberry strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it is so strawberry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen any strawberry strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that strawberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a nice strawberry banana that when
you make it into a rosin, same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's full strawberry in the mouth with
that heavy osmium banana that just flows.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's brownie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's brownie.
[SPEAKER_02]: I noticed that, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a little brownie.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the sandy resin, you guys get this
gritty, the resin off the plant's gritty.
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost looks oversized like sugar
chunks.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Salt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that was dramatic as a haze.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Skittles, Skittles is the weakest
plant I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: You said you revamped it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we got it in culture.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we plugged it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no matter what it does, it'll always
be a fragile frame, more prone to a
[SPEAKER_02]: pathogen issue plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because that's just what it is
genetically.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's just who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never herms.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but stable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the sherb version of it that that's
the parent of.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which was ironic because a buddy of mine
goes to Sherbinski, gets a cut from him.
[SPEAKER_02]: He brings it back and says, here,
this was the sherb that we're grabbing for
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so another buddy of mine gets the
sherb cut from Jigga.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the dark sherb.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have one that's just pale green.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when Jigga come up and said,
bro, you got this one, he goes,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's what's directly connected to the
Skittle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I already mapped it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we thought that the sherb was the
parent of the Skittle, that the Skittle
[SPEAKER_02]: was an S1.
[SPEAKER_02]: In my mind, the Skittle was an S1 of the
sherbet, where someone got a sherbet cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they selfed it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And out came the intensified
orange-flavored, runty, genetic plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And lo and behold, when we DNA mapped it,
Nishan, the head scientist from Philos,
[SPEAKER_02]: he can look at the plants and figure out
where the transference was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what he says is, the Skittle is the
parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the parents.
[SPEAKER_02]: He doesn't know male or female.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't tell.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is the parent of that sherbet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you smoke that sherbet,
it has that orangey flavor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you get that cut off of me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you turn it into a concentrate,
it's very Skittle-like, because the
[SPEAKER_02]: Skittle is the parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's got sherbet potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: Killer, killer, killer grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what our ODK looks like the day
before you harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're taking it down like 53 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not a long cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the others were around 60.
