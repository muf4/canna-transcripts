[SPEAKER_01]: My task is to bring you to the world of
medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to start off with an email I
received not long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one of the emails I receive
basically daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to read it for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So dear Dr. Piumelli, it says,
I have read about your work on marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the father of a three-year-old girl
diagnosed with autism.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would walk through fire to get her a
cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can marijuana help my girl?
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got to say I've read this to people
so many times.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every time I read it, it curdles my blood.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a father, as a scientist, I've got to
ask myself, what is this man asking from
[SPEAKER_01]: me, from me as a scientist?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I do to answer this question and
the question that so many other people are
[SPEAKER_01]: asking?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can cannabis help?
[SPEAKER_01]: In what can it help?
[SPEAKER_01]: As a scientist, I have to put these
questions in a different way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to ask, what medical conditions,
if any, can really benefit from cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the risks associated with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there is no such a thing as a
benefit without a risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what can cannabis teach us that may
lead, in general, to better therapies?
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we approach these questions,
I'd like to make very, very clear that
[SPEAKER_01]: emotions are wonderful, but we need
evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need evidence-based answers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opinions are great for debates,
but when it comes to decisions,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they have to be tempered by facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to share with you some facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being a professor, I brought my
slides, and I'll walk you through them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I promise there will be many chemical
structures.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does cannabis work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you know this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just remind you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It contains chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them is quite famous.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's called THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one is called CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the structure of one of these
compounds is shown.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of them is shown here, THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does it work?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when people use the compound,
use the drug, it enters their brains,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it encounters in their brains a
protein that sits on the cell,
[SPEAKER_01]: on the surface of the brain cells.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are called neurons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these particular proteins that
recognize THC in cannabis, just like a key
[SPEAKER_01]: is recognized by a lock, these proteins
are called the cannabinoid receptors.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a ton of cannabinoid receptors
in the brain, and they are spread
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are present in specific regions of
the brain, but also they are very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very abundant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what do they do when they are
activated by THC?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what they do is something similar to
what they do when they are activated,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're our own compounds,
what I call the brain's own cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our brain makes chemicals that have
chemical structures different from those
[SPEAKER_01]: of THC, but similar enough that they will
recognize the cannabinoid receptor,
[SPEAKER_01]: just like THC does.
[SPEAKER_01]: These compounds are endogenous
cannabinoids, so we call them
[SPEAKER_01]: endocannabinoids, just to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't sound smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do they do?
[SPEAKER_01]: They do a lot of different things,
and they're really important things.
[SPEAKER_01]: They control feeding, they control
emotion, they control pain, memory,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as pleasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the functions of a molecule our
body makes, and we experience it every day
[SPEAKER_01]: as we live our lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: These molecules are regulating these
different functions of our body.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should be aware of that, because it's
very important to understand what then
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis does to these endogenous system.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does it do?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, by activating the cannabinoid
receptors in the brain, THC will produce
[SPEAKER_01]: the effects that I'm sure you're quite
familiar with, because your friends told
[SPEAKER_01]: me about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It stimulates appetite, it relieves
anxiety, it alleviates pain, it impairs
[SPEAKER_01]: short-term memory, and also it can be
addictive.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are the effects of THC that
pharmacologists like me, that's my job,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a pharmacologist, pharmacologists like
me have over the last 30 years
[SPEAKER_01]: characterized.
[SPEAKER_01]: But how can we use these effects from a
therapeutic perspective?
[SPEAKER_01]: Which ones of these effects, which we have
studied in the mouse, in the rat,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the monkey, and also in people?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can actually turn into a real therapy,
and this is what I'm gonna try to briefly
[SPEAKER_01]: go over with you in the next couple of
minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first one, the one I wanna really
stress, and I wish this is, if you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: only take one thing out of my boring
lecture tonight, is this, chronic pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: One in 10 Americans experiences at least
once in their life excruciating pain that
[SPEAKER_01]: comes from damaged nerve or from
inflammation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chronic pain is profoundly, highly
regulated by the endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Endocannabinoid system is actually one of
the main regulators of pain, along with
[SPEAKER_01]: the other system.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have heard before, Congressman
Orenbacher mentioned the opiate system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The two systems go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have, I'm gonna show you some data.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have data showing very, very clearly
that comparing a placebo to a cannabis the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis will perform better than the
placebo in alleviating pain intensity in
[SPEAKER_01]: humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the Academy of Science,
the National Academy of Science,
[SPEAKER_01]: in a panel I was honored to be a member of
last January concluded, as you can see
[SPEAKER_01]: written here in the slide, that there is
conclusive and substantial evidence that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is effective as a treatment of
chronic pain in humans.
[SPEAKER_01]: In adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a statement that comes straight
out of the conclusion of a study that
[SPEAKER_01]: involved nine months of work looking at
24,000 papers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me tell you, being a member of
that committee, it was not exactly a walk
[SPEAKER_01]: in the woods.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chronic pain, another one, very,
very important, chemotherapy induced
[SPEAKER_01]: nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of us tonight have family or
themselves who have gone through the
[SPEAKER_01]: ordeal of having chemotherapy or
experiencing one of their family with
[SPEAKER_01]: chemotherapy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, THC in cannabis, but also CBD,
the other component of cannabis,
[SPEAKER_01]: they act in regions of the brain that
stimulate appetite and reduce nausea.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is an effect I like to stress that
is opposite to what the opiates do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the opiates cause nausea.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabinoids decrease it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, the National Academy of Science
has concluded that cannabis is useful as a
[SPEAKER_01]: treatment for, it's not potentially
useful, it's useful as a treatment for
[SPEAKER_01]: chemotherapy induced nausea and vomiting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Finally, the third indication in which
National Academy was extremely clear is
[SPEAKER_01]: spasticity in multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiple sclerosis is accompanied,
as you well know, by this muscle spasms
[SPEAKER_01]: that are extremely, extremely painful.
[SPEAKER_01]: And THC acts to alleviate those spasms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, this is the third and actually
last indication that the National Academy
[SPEAKER_01]: has recognized as being definitive and
having substantial support from evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the National Academy also studied
other indications.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are indications that are often
allowed by states in which medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is legal as indications in which
cannabis can be prescribed.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the data do not support
necessarily that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not support that and don't
necessarily support the opposite.
[SPEAKER_01]: The data are not there yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, Parkinson's disease,
Alzheimer's disease, cancer, autism,
[SPEAKER_01]: post-traumatic stress disorder.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are all diseases in which there is a
lot of anecdotal evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anecdotes do not, no matter how
exciting they get, they can be,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not amount to proof to evidence
that we can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we need, what do we need?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we need a lot of work to establish
efficacies in these other indications.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to establish, basing ourselves on
the anecdotes we have now, ask the
[SPEAKER_01]: question, are these anecdotes valid for
you, you, you, you, or are just valid for
[SPEAKER_01]: the one person that has told us about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an important point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's look at the other side of the
coin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's look at the risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first risk I wanna put out there for
all of you, and please do bring that home
[SPEAKER_01]: and please do talk to your families about
it, is using, expecting, and nursing
[SPEAKER_01]: mothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I strongly recommend being very,
very careful if you're expecting,
[SPEAKER_01]: you think you're expecting, or if you're
nursing, to use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reason for that is that THC
crosses the barrier that defends the fetus
[SPEAKER_01]: from the blood, crosses it, and it
accumulates in the fetus.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so does in the milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the infant will be exposed to THC,
to CBD, and we do not know what that could
[SPEAKER_01]: bring about as consequences, which is
simply don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: While we don't know, I say better safe
than sorry, just don't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly, teenagers, the brain of a
teenager is extremely changing every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't we all know that, who are parents?
[SPEAKER_01]: And obviously we want to be sure that this
growth is not interfered with by anything,
[SPEAKER_01]: not alcohol, not tobacco, not marijuana
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially the frequent use of
marijuana, we have to be careful about.
[SPEAKER_01]: For a reason I would love to be able to
entertain you with a very boring two hour
[SPEAKER_01]: long lecture, but I won't.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a couple of other things that
one needs to be careful about.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who suffer from schizophrenia,
people who have heart conditions should be
[SPEAKER_01]: careful with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is why this is medical cannabis,
because it has to be handled by
[SPEAKER_01]: professionals, by medical professionals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And additional work is needed to
understand and fully assess those risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm gonna conclude by saying a couple
of things that I think we can get done in
[SPEAKER_01]: the next five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not in the next 50 years, but really in
the next five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would love to be able to be part of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we say that we can say the last
word on cannabis effectiveness in a series
[SPEAKER_01]: of clinical indications for which we still
have no evidence of efficacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, Parkinson or anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can assess the risk associated with
medicinal cannabis use, which are probably
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be different from those associated
with recreational cannabis use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we need to leverage,
we need to use our new knowledge to create
[SPEAKER_01]: better cannabinoid based medicines,
to go beyond even cannabis and help the
[SPEAKER_01]: patients in many other ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in conclusion, I wanna go back to the
email I received from this anonymous
[SPEAKER_01]: person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we help his girl?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, I think we can, not right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to be able to answer that question
appropriately, we need a societal
[SPEAKER_01]: commitment to reduce regulatory hurdles
and to support research.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in particular, I wanna say to
reschedule cannabis from schedule one to a
[SPEAKER_01]: lower schedule to make possible the
research that we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Piemeli, you read an email that pretty
much took the air out of the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody just gasped.
[SPEAKER_00]: At getting such an email.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know in your position, you don't
wanna give advice, but let's say one of us
[SPEAKER_00]: received that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perhaps we have a relative that is dying
of cancer or is going through chemotherapy
[SPEAKER_00]: and they ask us, what do you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Should I try cannabis or should I try some
more conventional medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: What would your advice be?
[SPEAKER_01]: I say, go to your doctor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speak to her or him and explain to your
doctor that you believe that this could be
[SPEAKER_01]: useful for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I try to do when people ask me that
question, I also try to share with them
[SPEAKER_01]: some data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, if it's a cancer patient
suffering from great pain, then I send
[SPEAKER_01]: these folks scientific papers,
scientific papers through the email and I
[SPEAKER_01]: said, bring this with you when you see
your physician.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the Journal of the American
Medical Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not the Journal of Psychedelic
Studies.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's something very, very serious and you
have to take it seriously.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I can do as a basic scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: In your slide show, you mentioned under
risk factor, addiction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of talk that I'm seeing,
this kind of nascent movement plant over
[SPEAKER_00]: pills and we probably have a number of
people here that have read about cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: or thinking maybe I might try some.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you expand on addiction and cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me first start off by stating what is
addiction in the medical dictionary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a behavior that we pursue despite our
knowledge that is hurting us, that's an
[SPEAKER_01]: addictive behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: So addiction is not dependence.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can become dependent on a number of
different things and as you became
[SPEAKER_01]: dependent, you can also regain full
control in a process that is complex but
[SPEAKER_01]: it can be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Addiction is different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Addiction is also a disease of the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a problem of will.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a chronic disease of the brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, does cannabis cause addiction?
[SPEAKER_01]: When we think addiction, addiction in the
terms I just shared with you, we always
[SPEAKER_01]: think the first thing we think about is
opiates, crack cocaine, alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are things that are devastating
forms of addiction that we are familiar
[SPEAKER_01]: even from a filmic standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: We remember the movies and how people in
the movies with addiction behave and we
[SPEAKER_01]: think, well, cannabis doesn't do that and
it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis does not do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The type of addiction that cannabis causes
and now I think all specialists agree,
[SPEAKER_01]: we really know acts to grind that cannabis
does cause addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: The type of addiction that cannabis causes
is of a different type.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's milder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harder to get but it's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's say 8% of the people who use it
can become eventually addicted.
[SPEAKER_01]: 8% doesn't seem a big number if you
compare it to the 45% you have with
[SPEAKER_01]: nicotine or the 35, 40% you have with
cocaine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like a small number but if a lot
of people use it, that the small number is
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna translate into a lot of people,
that small percentage into a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we need to be cognizant of this
and as Carol says always when we talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about medical, cannabis, because that's my
main concern, what are we comparing
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis to?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I spoke about chronic pain and there is
a reason for that because it's the one
[SPEAKER_01]: condition that I believe offers the
greatest promise for cannabis and of
[SPEAKER_01]: course the big comparator there is what?
[SPEAKER_01]: The opioids and I don't think it needs any
introduction to anybody that the opioids,
[SPEAKER_01]: although very, very effective,
are extremely addictive drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very, very addictive and there is
no question that if we compare cannabis to
[SPEAKER_01]: the opioids, the addictive properties of
cannabis are much milder than those of the
[SPEAKER_01]: opioids.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know these are facts but then there are
a lot of questions and I think we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: answer some of those questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me point to one in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we combine cannabis and opioids,
what happens?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something we need to ask because
our youth are gonna do that and also our
[SPEAKER_01]: patients are gonna do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really know what happens in the
long term.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what happens in the short term.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the short term if you combine a small
dose of an opiate and a small dose of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, you got a lot of pain killing
effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's called a synergism with
potentiation in case you care.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the problem is in the long run,
are we enhancing the possibility of
[SPEAKER_01]: getting an addiction to either drug or are
we decreasing it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That again goes to my last slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need research on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name's John Stashenko and I have a
question for Dr. Pameli and Dr. Reynard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was wondering if in your research,
if either one of you have found or know
[SPEAKER_00]: where we could find a list of
contraindications for cannabis medicines?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're asking about contraindications to
cannabis medicines.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tried to cover some of the potential
risks in my presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly I think it's important to avoid
usage in during pregnancy and during
[SPEAKER_01]: nursing as well as in adolescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: At this point I think it is critical that
we, before we make any proposal about use
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis products in adolescent or
younger kids, we assess in that condition,
[SPEAKER_01]: in those conditions, what the safety of
the product is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that is something we really owe to
the public.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as other specific
contraindications,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually medical use is likely to be
different from recreational use.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we have learned from recreational use
might turn out to be outdated.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one reason why I pointed out that
one thing that we do need in the future is
[SPEAKER_01]: to really specifically ask the question,
medical use say in the elderly,
[SPEAKER_01]: is it going to be causing specific effects
that we do not expect?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me just elaborate on this a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you consider, for example, the use of
cannabis in young people, one thing that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis does do, it makes you,
shortens your memory.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something that happens all the
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: That happens in young people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does it happen in older people,
in elderly people?
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really know because the system,
the famous endocannabinoid system I bored
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody with is really changing changes
during life to the point that in late
[SPEAKER_01]: adulthood and in old age, it might
actually have opposite effects that those
[SPEAKER_01]: it has during adolescence.
[SPEAKER_01]: If this is the case, then really all the
bets are off and we don't really know what
[SPEAKER_01]: side effects could happen in a medical say
50 or 60 or 70 year old subject.
[SPEAKER_01]: You see what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of research is still needed.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
