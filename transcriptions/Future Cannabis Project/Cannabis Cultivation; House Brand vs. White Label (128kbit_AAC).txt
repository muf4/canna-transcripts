[SPEAKER_00]: You have enough to put out there on the
market, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're out there shopping these guys,
getting them to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how much do you do as original brand to
your own versus a white label for a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: a better term?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a moving target as well,
because just coming into the compliance
[SPEAKER_01]: legal market and forming a distribution,
we're still kind of getting our feet wet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as we're opening new accounts,
it's still a small business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cash flow is king.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm out for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm outsourcing and just bulking out and
white label and selling to manufacturers
[SPEAKER_01]: as much as I can right now to keep cash
flow going and to still open doors on
[SPEAKER_01]: stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd say we probably have a pretty
extensive menu compared to other brands on
[SPEAKER_01]: the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have over 60 SKUs, COAs,
shelf ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's still probably, again,
probably about 25% of my production.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully that'll change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we get more market share,
I will provide less material or specialize
[SPEAKER_01]: on material, because it's great to have
good relationships.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's great to thrive with a thriving
brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm happy to work with people like
Papa and Barclays and be one of their
[SPEAKER_01]: tried and true farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that helps build my brand as well,
because they have good brand equity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we help build each other up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there will always be a balance
where I won't always just be like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, I'm going to build my brand and find a
new supplier.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always want to keep those relationships
and have a good place in the brand for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd also like to look at limited
release.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, this is a seasonal product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not necessarily trying to be something
that's on the shelf with the same exact
[SPEAKER_01]: product year round.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, get it while it's hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a formula there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you make a drop, people know it's
coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're like, oh, it's not going to be
around next month, so I better get it
[SPEAKER_01]: while I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing that in other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny you point that out,
because the clothing industry has moved
[SPEAKER_00]: towards that, like this limited,
no matter if it's kicks, sneakers,
[SPEAKER_00]: or if it's clothing lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting you point that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even craft beer, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, craft beer is the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm my self-proclaimed can of sewer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time a season ends, I actually
pull out last year's crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: From Hidden Prairie Farm, I just took out
some of her blue skittles, which is a bit
[SPEAKER_00]: trendy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is something about her blue
skittles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just like, I busted that out this
season and was able to obviously preserve
[SPEAKER_00]: it thanks to the Seal on Mason jars and
our product that we put out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are enough can of sewers,
to your point.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, that is coveted.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the strain that worked for me,
that worked for my endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know about how it reacted to
yours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could see people are like, this is a
limited edition.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got to pick it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm all about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I love supporting the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I'll pay 20%, 30%, 40% more over
what a typical eighth goes for,
[SPEAKER_00]: or a typical ounce goes for, if it means
getting quality fire or loudest kicks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know you won't be able to get it
in the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a one-time thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like that bottle of wine from 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's another part of my strategy,
is trying to get ahead on the strain
[SPEAKER_01]: releases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully, we'll have a hot new strain
in that season before everybody has it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then get that out and be like,
oh, that was that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on to the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got to get it while it's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully, it'll all work out in that
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be creative.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
And I'll see you in the next one.
