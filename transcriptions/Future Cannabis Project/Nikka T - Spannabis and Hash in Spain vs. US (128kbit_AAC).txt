[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks Lambert coming here from Barcelona
Spain for spandibus 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on the final day here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a special guest next to me Nick
Tannum He is a true master of rosin and
[SPEAKER_00]: was a recent judge of the Masters of Rosin
Which we sponsored that just went down
[SPEAKER_00]: last night, but it's been kind of a
week-long thing dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome Yeah, yeah, yeah give thanks for
having me man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just blessed to be out here in Spain For
real the Masters of Rosin has kept me high
[SPEAKER_01]: for a week Seriously, the amount of
entries the amount of quality entries that
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to go back and retry has been
insane You know a lot of quality increase
[SPEAKER_01]: since last year the year before just
dramatic quality increases out here in
[SPEAKER_00]: Spain well now and man it's funny because
Although you look like a younger guy to
[SPEAKER_00]: the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been doing it for a minute We were
talking we're talking a few decades and
[SPEAKER_00]: being a Cali guy too, which obviously
you're close to The source of some quality
[SPEAKER_00]: in itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you know, I've been doing this more
than half my life This is my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm super blessed to have parents and
family that supported everything that I've
[SPEAKER_01]: done all the moves that I've made I
started operating in Colorado back in 2009
[SPEAKER_01]: and started the first Tax-paying hash
company in the US essential extracts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just blessed to still be here
Definitely man, and I recognize that name
[SPEAKER_00]: once I had to kind of put it all together
We're talking about similar ties for our
[SPEAKER_00]: California Colorado back to California For
both of us and in knowing that we
[SPEAKER_00]: recognize the differences in the market
over there How do they compare though to
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're seeing here and you talked
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are getting better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But how does it compare to back home?
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you say for ash?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the increase in quality this year
is insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Creating a competing market to the US
really and we're seeing it, you know Like
[SPEAKER_01]: not to put anybody on blast, but we see a
lot of US companies bringing product out
[SPEAKER_01]: here to Spain and last year I think a lot
of the California flowers here in Spain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're selling really really well this year
I'm looking for the local flowers because
[SPEAKER_01]: the local growers are stepping up game
seriously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah I'm saying the same thing man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's one thing I was just talking to
a friend over loud seeds and he was kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of talking about the whole convert Yeah,
yeah, you know James and talking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole fact that you know, you've got these
Genetics guys that are coming down from
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Netherlands these guys are coming
out from the West Coast and just just
[SPEAKER_00]: collabing not competing but collabing
right and is that something that's
[SPEAKER_00]: carrying into obviously into your craft as
well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely definitely, you know people out
here are really really hunting phenos It's
[SPEAKER_01]: something that I've noticed that the
European market really does is they're
[SPEAKER_01]: popping a lot more seeds than we're
popping in the US Especially in places
[SPEAKER_01]: like Morocco and places where they have a
large agricultural area that can do such
[SPEAKER_01]: things We're seeing amazing pheno hunts
and with that comes phenos that are
[SPEAKER_01]: yielding way better in hash So I mean,
you know big up my friends at La Colada,
[SPEAKER_01]: big up Grateful Seeds, big up La Sagrada
Fam, a lot of these cats are really really
[SPEAKER_01]: pushing the boundaries of what they can do
out here and they're finding amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: phenos that are really really proper for
solving this hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's excellent to hear and for some
of you to do a bit of homework Geno is one
[SPEAKER_00]: factor the whole genotype of the phenotype
is next level and exactly the next point
[SPEAKER_00]: it just brings so much more craft to the
culture just brings so much more flavor to
[SPEAKER_00]: the experience because it's not about the
race to the top in THD It's a furthest
[SPEAKER_00]: that a lot of us that really respect this
plant want it to be about so tell me again
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean you're a master in your own right
What are some of the other hash makers or
[SPEAKER_00]: who I should say even more?
[SPEAKER_00]: So are some of the other hash makers you
almost kind of look up to or maybe mentor
[SPEAKER_00]: it a little bit from out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know out here actually in Europe one
of my mentors and one of the women that
[SPEAKER_01]: taught me so much about making hash is
Mila Jansen They call her the hash queen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So big up Mila each and every time you
know, I've learned so much from so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different generations back in the day full
melt bubble mark aka bubble man's website
[SPEAKER_01]: was a huge learning source more recently
about 10 12 years ago we created a website
[SPEAKER_01]: and forum called extract artists which
I've been teaching in but I've also been
[SPEAKER_01]: learning in you know there's a lot of
different avenues I think that we've we've
[SPEAKER_01]: all been learning via a lot of oral
tradition you know originally when I first
[SPEAKER_01]: went out to Amsterdam to study under Mila
in the early 2000s there wasn't anything
[SPEAKER_01]: written about this I had to go bug Mila in
her shop in her production facility and be
[SPEAKER_01]: like hey you know how do I get to this
color how do I get to this consistency is
[SPEAKER_01]: this rinsing thing that I'm doing good you
know and and nowadays we tour all
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the world me Mila and I
teaching each other and teaching people as
[SPEAKER_01]: well you know Mila gives me credit for
bringing fresh frozen and the idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: running fresh frozen material to Europe
and I really give her a lot more credit
[SPEAKER_01]: than that a lot of the credit came from
Mila for the whole rinsing thing that I
[SPEAKER_01]: just briefly mentioned but the technology
of rinsing your hash after you've
[SPEAKER_01]: collected your hash back in the day when I
learned that has really really upped my
[SPEAKER_01]: game you get rid of a lot of the
impurities by rinsing out those trichomes
[SPEAKER_01]: after you've collected them and that's one
of the texts that I learned from Mila
[SPEAKER_00]: that's cool man and you mentioned fresh
frozen which is something that it's almost
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of taken back home not not too big on
Cali but I see it becoming more popular
[SPEAKER_00]: seems to be it guys it's a little bit
easier to turn the crops if they're able
[SPEAKER_00]: to just set some of now there's a whole
refrigerator I mean it's a whole other
[SPEAKER_00]: category right as far as being able to
have a place to refrigerate but your point
[SPEAKER_00]: like fresh frozen we're seeing more of
that I mean I talked to one of our friends
[SPEAKER_00]: as gross 25% of his crop went straight to
the chillers so that's something you're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing more of too in your space yeah
there's a number of reasons we're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: more of it number one we're able to take a
cultivation and go in there and help
[SPEAKER_01]: consult and get rid of an entire room
where they're trimming and drying material
[SPEAKER_01]: right all of these employees that don't
actually work for them but are coming in
[SPEAKER_01]: on a hired basis to trim the material that
you know creates a lot more issues with
[SPEAKER_01]: theft and quality control and things like
that you get rid of all of them we can
[SPEAKER_01]: turn that room into another flowering room
or a mom stable to keep all your genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: right you're not having to pay all those
trimmers and we're bucking the material
[SPEAKER_01]: straight from the fucking field right into
a freezer so it saves a lot of time and a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of money for the grower that's one of
the big things that we're promoting and
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it's crazy to talk about fresh
frozen because I think it really started
[SPEAKER_01]: in Colorado with that legal market and the
regulated system out there kind of pushed
[SPEAKER_01]: towards fresh frozen and then the live
raws our live resin guys grabbed it right
[SPEAKER_01]: after we started promoting it and saying
hey we're running live fresh material
[SPEAKER_01]: they're like oh shit maybe we could run
that in our closed loops and now we're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing the live resin the live rosin and
it's really cool to see those are some of
[SPEAKER_01]: my friends on the live resin side that
kind of coined the term live resin and I
[SPEAKER_01]: got nothing but love for them it's just
creating higher quality for the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: industry so big up for fresh frozen each
and every time for real you're retaining a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more terpenes when you're using fresh
frozen especially when you have a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: of these air volatile terpenes the gassy
terpenes the chems the diesels those are
[SPEAKER_01]: escaping immediately if you fresh freeze
that material we're able to lock those in
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot easier and I've noticed her that's
exact I've got fresh exactly got the rosin
[SPEAKER_00]: in my pocket it's all about the fresh
frozen your point because it's just a
[SPEAKER_00]: totally different from a terpy standpoint
for someone who appreciates really I know
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a played out term but the full
spectrum not just again all about the you
[SPEAKER_00]: know loudness of the cannabinoids it
really does preserve that you don't lose
[SPEAKER_00]: it through the rest of the process like
you said so that's awesome to hear so what
[SPEAKER_00]: are talked about some of the different
styles who's mentored you what's your
[SPEAKER_00]: style like what what is it you mentioned
rinsing but I'm sure there's a few other
[SPEAKER_00]: jump to share all the secret sauce but but
what have you found to really make your
[SPEAKER_00]: own to make you so unique and as popular
as you've done and become really you know
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of it is my openness yeah my
my community education skills is I think a
[SPEAKER_01]: big part of it you know because I think
there's a lot of amazing hash makers out
[SPEAKER_01]: there but I don't know if all of them have
really utilized their skill and promoted
[SPEAKER_01]: what they're doing and really taught you
know the industry and that's really what I
[SPEAKER_01]: pride myself on is creating a higher
echelon for the industry and not just
[SPEAKER_01]: teaching the people that want to learn but
I mean I'm teaching what people are
[SPEAKER_01]: calling competitive companies and they're
not competitive to me the more education
[SPEAKER_01]: that's out there the more that those
competitive companies are also teaching
[SPEAKER_01]: solvent less methodology the more my
product sells so I think one of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that's really you know made me stand apart
is my willingness to teach and learn same
[SPEAKER_01]: way you know I'm not ever gonna stop
learning myself so that's where I'm at man
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just I'm just blessed to be here hey
yeah and again stoked that we're able to
[SPEAKER_00]: connect and catch up me this I'm Nick
literally we're on the last day final
[SPEAKER_00]: hours for you to be able to come by and
get some time in man I know you had a
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy my team I said we spoke at a
sponsored last night it's my whole team
[SPEAKER_00]: was there and I don't even think they got
out bed till 11 o'clock so definitely a
[SPEAKER_01]: blog I don't think I went to sleep until
seven or eight I got home from to the
[SPEAKER_01]: Airbnb like six seven in the morning so
yeah sounds about right but it's something
[SPEAKER_00]: we look forward to man I mean that's
something in in HQ obviously supports it
[SPEAKER_00]: being back in it and the whole week just
building it up building it up building it
[SPEAKER_00]: up and this something again I love that it
gets the attention it does you know yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: man it's been a great vibe a great year
spanimus 2019 heard it from Nick all
[SPEAKER_00]: righty guys thanks again for future
cannabis project this Lansley ever you you
[SPEAKER_01]: you you you you you you you you
