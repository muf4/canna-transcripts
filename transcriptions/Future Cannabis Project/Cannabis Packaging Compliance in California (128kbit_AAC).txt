[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to dig into our panel now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you ready for this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to go ahead and introduce our
panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have James Eichner here from SANA
Packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to talk about hemp-based
solutions for packaging, which is quite
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have our star, Christina Dempsey,
of the Manufacturing Cannabis Safety
[SPEAKER_01]: Branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the regulatory body from the
Department of Health here in California
[SPEAKER_01]: that regulates packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Andrew Hopkins.
[SPEAKER_01]: of the workshop, and Julie Crockett of
MMLG Consultancy here in Santa Monica.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start with you, James.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk to us a little bit about
hemp-based plastic and why it's a great
[SPEAKER_01]: alternative, or could be, for
petroleum-based plastics?
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm with SANA Packaging, and we design and
develop hemp plastic packaging solutions
[SPEAKER_04]: for the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Simply put, you can make plastic out of a
variety of biobased materials.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp being one of them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most bioplastic in the United States is
made out of corn, and when we first
[SPEAKER_04]: started working on this, we were basically
frustrated consumers looking at the amount
[SPEAKER_04]: of petroleum plastic packaging waste that
we were creating.
[SPEAKER_04]: As we started to look into sustainable
alternatives, corn plastic was the first
[SPEAKER_04]: thing we looked at, but seeing the
evolution of the hemp industry that's been
[SPEAKER_04]: happening in tandem with that of the
cannabis industry, we thought it would be
[SPEAKER_04]: a good idea to look into hemp-based
plastics, and that's how we stumbled upon
[SPEAKER_04]: it a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically, the plastic that we use to make
our packaging, which is right here,
[SPEAKER_04]: is a fiber-reinforced biocomposite.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're using a corn plastic resin,
which is a PLA, as our base material,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then we're infusing that with a
microtized hemp herd, which is the innards
[SPEAKER_04]: of the stalk, which is currently a very
underutilized part of the plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's 100% plant-based and
chemical-free.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I hope some of what we'll get
into this evening is talking a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: about waste recovery, which is a large
challenge for all packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, I believe that only 40% of
packaging is actually recovered,
[SPEAKER_04]: whereas 60% is landfilled.
[SPEAKER_04]: Recovery is a challenge for all packaging
materials, but it's additionally
[SPEAKER_04]: complicated in the cannabis industry due
to a number of factors, the largest of
[SPEAKER_04]: which is, it'll be interesting to see how
it plays out in California, but for
[SPEAKER_04]: instance, in Colorado, even if the plastic
that your cannabis packaging is made out
[SPEAKER_04]: of is recyclable, recycling facilities
there do not accept cannabis packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: So either a change needs to happen where
facilities can accept it, or there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: missing piece of the puzzle, which would
be a company that sterilizes or cleans the
[SPEAKER_04]: packaging before it goes to the facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: So waste recovery is a big challenge,
and regardless of how cool the materials
[SPEAKER_04]: are that we continue to develop,
that's something that needs to be
[SPEAKER_04]: addressed before we can really solve the
problem of waste within cannabis packaging
[SPEAKER_04]: and within sustainable packaging in
general.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you speak to us about poison
prevention and what the testing is that's
[SPEAKER_01]: required to be considered child-resistant
packaging?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because my understanding is it does
require quite a bit of testing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and from my research, I believe,
that you can do your own testing if you
[SPEAKER_01]: like, but it's a difficult endeavor,
and there are entities or agencies that
[SPEAKER_01]: will do that for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to know a little bit more about
that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So ASTM is the organization that monitors
all of this.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, the testing can be done by a
number of third-party testers.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Poison Prevention Act, I believe,
was in 1970.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forget exactly what spawned it,
but basically, child-resistant packaging
[SPEAKER_04]: was developed at that point and to stop
children under a certain age from being
[SPEAKER_04]: able to access certain substances.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was pioneered in the pharmaceutical
industry, and now it affects cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rather, it's kind of exactly what you
would imagine.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you do the physical testing,
whereas you actually get a room full of
[SPEAKER_04]: 200 kids under, I believe, it's 48 months
or something, and the way the testing
[SPEAKER_04]: actually goes is they're given the
packaging samples.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're given five minutes to try and open
it, and then after those five minutes,
[SPEAKER_04]: they are explained how to open it,
and then they have five additional
[SPEAKER_04]: minutes, and you're supposed to hit a
threshold I believe of over 80%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if more than 20% of the samples are
open, then you fail the testing,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's kind of as simply as I can put
it, but it is kind of funny being there
[SPEAKER_04]: and watching all these kids try and open
packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are allowances for elderly packaging
in other industries, and unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's not something that's been made
available to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially, you can talk to us about why
that is, that the elderly allowance was
[SPEAKER_01]: not part of our regulatory basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure, so again, my name's Christine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the outreach manager for the
California Department of Public Health's
[SPEAKER_02]: manufactured cannabis safety branch,
which is a whole lot of words.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before I answer your question,
I'll just tell you my area of specialty is
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis manufacturing and manufactured
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if there's a question that is asked in
the audience or by Courtney that falls
[SPEAKER_02]: under another state office, I'll tell you
which state office it is, but I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: answer those questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll try to be as clear as I can for
answers that fall under our office,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'll tell you where they fall if they
don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to answer your question about the
elderly packaging allowances, is the
[SPEAKER_02]: Medicinal and Adult Use Cannabis
Regulation and Safety Act, or MALCURSA,
[SPEAKER_02]: which created the whole cannabis
regulatory structure for both adult use
[SPEAKER_02]: and medicinal cannabis, specifically
states child-resistant packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't refer to the Poison Prevention
Packaging Act.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what our office did in talking
about what would qualify as
[SPEAKER_02]: child-resistant packaging, but because the
act itself refers to all cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: and cannabis products being in
child-resistant packaging, we didn't have
[SPEAKER_02]: any regulatory authority to allow for
something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's worth noting that with the elderly
allowance, you would be able to say on the
[SPEAKER_01]: package, this is for households with no
children, in which instance, you would not
[SPEAKER_01]: need the child-resistant packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be pretty nice for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would also reduce the amount of
plastic, because in many of the solutions,
[SPEAKER_01]: some of the solutions I passed around here
today, you'll see that plastic is
[SPEAKER_01]: providing a solution with the
child-resistant packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a child-resistant cap, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So potentially, we can get around that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another issue that I see is that with
pharmaceutical industry, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can do shipments of bulk products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the pharmacy isn't getting tiny bottles
of child-resistant packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're getting a bulk shipment,
and then they are packaging at the retail
[SPEAKER_01]: level.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our industry, unfortunately,
we're not packaging at the retail level,
[SPEAKER_01]: and there's no bulk packaging available to
us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something that we can also ask you
about, Christina, about what maybe the
[SPEAKER_01]: reasoning was for that, or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we're gonna talk to the Bureau
later.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's turn to you guys,
Andrew and Julie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that you have different
specialties, but can we ask you about some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the issues you've seen with your
clients that we can talk about,
[SPEAKER_01]: and potentially individuals in our
audience have had similar issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Julie Crockett.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the Director of Compliance for MMLG.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was recruited to help launch a brand
called WVAPES, a vaporizer brand,
[SPEAKER_03]: in 2015.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had no experience in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: My previous job, I was a marketing
director for an adult toy company,
[SPEAKER_03]: so that was my background, was dealing in
fringe industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a civilian in Los Angeles, I thought,
and knowing nothing about cannabis law,
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, there's dispensaries
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been illegal for years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's no big deal, and then I realized,
I walked into an empty warehouse,
[SPEAKER_03]: an empty office building, and an
extraction laboratory, and was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: what's up, guys?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: And realized that I was put in charge of
an unlicensed business in Los Angeles,
[SPEAKER_03]: and very quickly made myself their Chief
Compliance Officer, and helped guide that
[SPEAKER_03]: company towards compliance, and did that
for three years, and then ended up doing a
[SPEAKER_03]: flip where I went to work with our
compliance attorney at MMLG, and now my
[SPEAKER_03]: old job became my client, and now I get to
help a bunch more people go through this
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a person, what I do with MMLG is I do
ongoing compliance with all kinds of
[SPEAKER_03]: different operators.
[SPEAKER_03]: I work with cultivators, and
manufacturers, and retailers, pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: every licensed type, and go in and help
them to figure out how to navigate and
[SPEAKER_03]: meet the requirements of these
regulations, which is brutal.
[SPEAKER_03]: The experience, the real world experience
of operators trying to adjust their
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses and continually pivot to the
demands of these regulations is
[SPEAKER_03]: heartbreaking and crucifying to watch.
[SPEAKER_03]: The costs of compliance, the costs of
lawyers and consultants and redesigning
[SPEAKER_03]: your packaging, and the impossibility of
competing with an illicit market at this
[SPEAKER_03]: moment is crushing.
[SPEAKER_03]: The most compliant companies that I work
with are doing the worst, are suffering,
[SPEAKER_03]: are losing money, their sales are down 60
to 90%, they cannot sustain and compete in
[SPEAKER_03]: this environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: That said, you know, I help them try to
find a way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So some of it is understanding like that
this, you know, this is an evolving
[SPEAKER_03]: system.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing that gives me hope as we go
through this process is one, cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: folks are wily and creative, and they will
find a way, so that's a good part,
[SPEAKER_03]: and two, that this is a living,
evolving process that is still happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: The political activation that has happened
for me as an individual by going through
[SPEAKER_03]: this process, by working at the state
level with organizations like CCIA and the
[SPEAKER_03]: trade organizations with local
organizations like Glocka, like seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: human beings inform policy and watch laws
change.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw a law change sitting in a meeting
with the Department of Public Health
[SPEAKER_03]: because what was written is not what they
meant, and when somebody from the industry
[SPEAKER_03]: explained to them, do you realize what the
impact of this law is gonna do to
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses, they went, oh no, that's not
what we meant, let's change that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're actually in this incredible
moment in time where the agencies,
[SPEAKER_03]: the state agencies know that they don't
know everything, and are listening and
[SPEAKER_03]: willing to receive input, and they have to
hear a voice that's loud enough and clear
[SPEAKER_03]: enough and can tell a concise enough
story, because attention spans and time is
[SPEAKER_03]: short, to communicate the real needs of
this industry, because it's a very short
[SPEAKER_03]: window that we have right now,
really short window, and when this period
[SPEAKER_03]: comes up of the full regulatory language
being introduced, and operators have 45
[SPEAKER_03]: days to make a comment on it, which the
agencies have to respond to every single
[SPEAKER_03]: comment that is submitted during that
time, there has never been a better time
[SPEAKER_03]: to tell your story and state your
experience, and talk about what needs to
[SPEAKER_03]: be done and what's not working,
and not receive this as something that's
[SPEAKER_03]: just happening to you, but that's
something that's actually being
[SPEAKER_03]: participated in, because for years I've
been saying, in these next few months,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're either going to see the cannabis
industry wake up, come together,
[SPEAKER_03]: and become one of the biggest political
forces the world has ever seen,
[SPEAKER_03]: to defend what has been built,
or see it get ripped out of our hands,
[SPEAKER_03]: and become an industry like every other
industry, and Amazon will be delivering
[SPEAKER_03]: vapes, it'll suck, so basically that's
what I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to add to that, I worked with a
global cannabis manufacturer, and I worked
[SPEAKER_01]: so hard through the winter holidays to
bring medicine to patients, and then in
[SPEAKER_01]: January discovered that there was a $800
fee per unit for the testing, so when
[SPEAKER_01]: we're larger companies, and we're going to
market, and we're bringing large volumes
[SPEAKER_01]: of product, it can make sense,
you kind of work it out in terms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: volume, but if you have smaller volumes of
product, and you didn't know, it's a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: expense, especially if you have multiple
SKUs, because the testing is per SKU,
[SPEAKER_01]: that means you have a different size
product, it's each size, so that's
[SPEAKER_01]: something worth noting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well first of all, tough act to follow.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Andrew Hopkins, I work for the
workshop, we are a laboratory pioneering
[SPEAKER_08]: some terpene development and flavors,
in addition we do compliance consulting up
[SPEAKER_08]: and down the entire cannabis supply chain.
[SPEAKER_08]: Myself personally I work a lot with the
manufacturing side of things, so to answer
[SPEAKER_08]: the original question, what are some of
the challenges the workshop has observed
[SPEAKER_08]: with brands, and specific to packaging,
the biggest challenge we're facing right
[SPEAKER_08]: now is with the idea of pre-printing
potency.
[SPEAKER_08]: As Courtney mentioned before, the only
requirements to list on your label are THC
[SPEAKER_08]: and CBD, that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You have a plus or minus 10% variance on
those listed cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now there's two caveats I want to mention
to this, as Courtney mentioned,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you start to list other cannabinoids,
THC, CBD, any of the others, the same
[SPEAKER_08]: rules apply, 10% plus or minus,
and generally speaking, those cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_08]: are found at much lower levels in your
packaging, the same would apply to CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: Traditional vape cartridge, let's just
assume it's 700 milligrams, that gives you
[SPEAKER_08]: basically 70 milligrams plus or minus of
your variance on your testing,
[SPEAKER_08]: so you have some wiggle room based on the
BCC regulations.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, CBD, if you only have one
milligram in your product, you have 10%,
[SPEAKER_08]: that gives you almost no wiggle room in
the BCC state testing laboratory
[SPEAKER_08]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we recommend, and although brands
generally do not like it, we recommend do
[SPEAKER_08]: not print your potency on your permanent
packaging, apply some sort of sticker that
[SPEAKER_08]: you do at the time of production,
because that way you do your final potency
[SPEAKER_08]: testing and you'll know that, hey,
it's gonna be within that 10% threshold.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, if you go off and do a
5,000 print run and pre-print your
[SPEAKER_08]: potency, due to manufacturing
complications, we know that that potency
[SPEAKER_08]: can change, and now you're in a position
where you're stuck with packaging you
[SPEAKER_08]: can't use, or you're gonna have to either
label over it or sticker over it in some
[SPEAKER_08]: way, shape, or form to make it compliant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, although it's not aesthetically
pleasing, keep this in mind as you go to
[SPEAKER_08]: your manufacturers, that if you wanna
pre-print your potency, you better be darn
[SPEAKER_08]: sure you can lock down that number,
because if you can't, your boxes are gonna
[SPEAKER_08]: look even worse with markers all over it
and stickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Henry's package that I passed around
has what is called the variable data
[SPEAKER_01]: label, and you'll see on there that that's
a solution for this problem, that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: printing a variable label instead of
printing the boxes themselves so that you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have issues when you're trying to
meet this variance of five milligrams,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is quite difficult when you work out
the ratio and the numbers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, can we talk to you, Christina,
about some of the issues facing the
[SPEAKER_01]: Department of Public Health?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I wanna just piggyback on Julie's
statement that the regulatory bodies do
[SPEAKER_01]: care about what we have to say as an
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's another reason we're here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why she's here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I was getting to that, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are very responsive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We reached out to them and said,
would you please send a member of your
[SPEAKER_01]: organization, and she really rallied for
us to make sure that she could be here,
[SPEAKER_01]: so thank you for that again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe you can talk to us about what are
the issues for public health that are at
[SPEAKER_01]: the top of your list that we need to
discuss?
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that brass knuckles, for example,
not to call them out, but we're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: start to see some more litigation
pertaining to pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pesticides are a dire issue for our
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're much more prevalent now than they
were 20 years ago, and if you are an
[SPEAKER_01]: organic cultivator, for example,
I'm using organic in the sense that you
[SPEAKER_01]: are cultivating without pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are cultivating organically,
you can be subject to what we call
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide drift.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, other farms are using pesticides,
and now it compromises your cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's something that's pretty serious,
and we wanna keep an eye on that,
[SPEAKER_01]: because it affects our children.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're finding that there are residues of
pesticides in the umbilical cord.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's causing brain damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a real issue, and it's here today.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, just for example, I'll let you take it
from here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, that was a lot of different things,
but I'll give you some public health
[SPEAKER_02]: issues that we're looking at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because testing happens in the final stage
right before product goes to retail,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is different from some of the other
states, I think a lot of the contaminated
[SPEAKER_02]: product issues that other states have seen
will not happen in the same volume in
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, as many headaches as the testing
system does create, I think there's some
[SPEAKER_02]: public health benefit to the way that it's
set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we've been looking
at is how manufacturing facilities are set
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we have quite a number of extractors
among our manufacturer population.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that our inspectors are
looking at is, do you know how to operate
[SPEAKER_02]: the equipment that you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which shouldn't be a tough question,
but it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: With people coming into this market,
we've seen people who order equipment,
[SPEAKER_02]: and they read the instructions,
and they think, oh, I know how to operate
[SPEAKER_02]: this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reality is extraction is a
chemical process in a lot of instances,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you have to understand chemistry,
or at least basic science.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, one of the things our inspectors have
been asking when they go into facilities
[SPEAKER_02]: is, tell me how this equipment works.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you disassemble it to clean it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Some basic questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: About it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, we've been looking at, is it being
operated safely?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it set up safely?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any risks to the workforce and
the surrounding communities?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, that's products.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other public health issues that are on
your mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it might do some justice to share
the fact that much of the regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: outline is based on historical context.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, for example, I don't know if you all
remember the Tylenol murders of 1982,
[SPEAKER_01]: but this is where this tamper evident
packaging stems from.
[SPEAKER_01]: Individuals went to the store,
they purchased Tylenol, they took it for a
[SPEAKER_01]: headache, and then, unfortunately,
that was their demise because it was
[SPEAKER_01]: poisoned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that day, I think, as a populace,
we were much more trusting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, there wasn't a concern about whether
or not someone had tampered with your
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, now, I think we've come to a
point where maybe it's a little excessive.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: We spoke about whether or not you can use
a paper strip around your package to
[SPEAKER_01]: indicate whether it's been tampered with,
and the answer was yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, if you would like to go another step
further, you can put your logo and print
[SPEAKER_01]: that on the packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's not just an Avery label that
anybody can pick up and put on top of a
[SPEAKER_01]: package.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit more unique and
descriptive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's another branding component,
so that's something that you can leverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also put on your packaging a
little note to indicate that, hey,
[SPEAKER_01]: by the way, there was a tamper evident
strip here.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not here now, then you should be
cautious in taking this product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I'll add one thing to the public
health side because I like that you
[SPEAKER_02]: brought up packaging and labeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our labeling requirements are fairly
extensive, and there's a reason for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really want consumers to be informed
about the product that they're consuming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, it comes from a real place.
[SPEAKER_02]: The tamper evident, that's part of
malcursa, but I think there's real value
[SPEAKER_02]: to knowing when these products have been
opened before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, the child-resistant piece comes
from malcursa because malcursa says that
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the cornerstones of all of our
regulations that we develop, but the law
[SPEAKER_02]: in general, is protection of public health
and youth in particular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the child-resistant packaging
requirements, while they can feel like a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot to grapple with as a business,
the legislature was really keeping the
[SPEAKER_02]: residents of the state of California in
mind for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I visited Oregon a few years ago,
and I took the opportunity to go to a
[SPEAKER_01]: retail out at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I went in, they had a exit
package.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, when you go there, you can purchase an
exit packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't say if that's the case now,
but at the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you go in, you can purchase an exit
package that's child-resistant,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it creates a solution for all of your
packaging needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we don't have an instance where we're
trying to package a pre-roll, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: to be child-resistant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sana, James brought a very nice example of
a solution here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's similar to a Tylenol bottle where you
turn the cap, and you align the notch,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then you can open it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we're creating these solutions to meet
the demands, but there are solutions that
[SPEAKER_01]: other markets have presented, Oregon being
one.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't purchase this exit package
that's child-resistant, you can bring your
[SPEAKER_01]: own.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, similar to what we have here in
California, the 10-cent bag requirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you bring your own package,
we're reducing waste, we're reusing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's something that we could be
doing here in California as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could be a model for the entire nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, Oregon's already done it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, here's a question.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I may, is it possible for you to
elaborate on potentially why we didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: choose that as a solution for California?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the way that Maura Curso was worded,
and I don't know if it was intentional.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the way Maura Curso is worded is that
that child-resistant packaging piece must
[SPEAKER_02]: be done before retail sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, our interpretation or the Bureau's
interpretation is that that means before
[SPEAKER_02]: the time of sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you're talking about on the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite a few other states have used exit
packaging that is child-resistant to do
[SPEAKER_02]: that same function to protect consumers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's a possibility here,
but our position is that it would require
[SPEAKER_02]: a legislative change to be able to allow
us to change that in regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, please, Dean.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to add to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the issues with the exit
bag conundrum is that it causes redundant
[SPEAKER_04]: packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you have a legislative environment
where you're trying to have everyone
[SPEAKER_04]: comply to certain regulations,
to have the wiggle room of being able to
[SPEAKER_04]: use an exit bag just causes people to not
necessarily meet the regulations because
[SPEAKER_04]: they can fall back on a retail outlet
having to use an exit bag, and that costs
[SPEAKER_04]: a retail outlet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also, these exit bags are typically
made out of mylar, which are very terrible
[SPEAKER_04]: for the environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, even if you do have someone,
for instance, in Oregon, it's about 50-50
[SPEAKER_04]: there, whether the actual package that the
product in is child-resistant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And even if it is child-resistant,
the dispensaries there are just trying to
[SPEAKER_04]: cover their asses, so they'll still throw
it in a mylar exit bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so then, you have a child-resistant
package within a child-resistant package,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I just think it opens kind of a
Pandora's box for inefficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which leads me to mylar packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, in case you all are not aware,
mylar is a metallicized plastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are only three recycling
facilities in the entire country.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also one of the most prevalent used
packaging for cannabis that we see.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, be aware that those facilities are
here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potentially, we should be leveraging them,
but if I may, I would ask you to consider
[SPEAKER_01]: glass or some other renewable resource in
your solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spoke to James, and I said, hey,
are you guys gonna do a hemp based
[SPEAKER_01]: solution for a CRP cap, similar to what we
talked about earlier?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said it's on their agenda.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've done a great service in trying to
bring these products to market,
[SPEAKER_01]: and these solutions, given that there is
this excessive testing that has to happen,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, there's a cost associated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to maybe, can we talk a
little bit more about the hemp solution,
[SPEAKER_01]: and how it affects the landfills,
in terms of the way that methane gas is
[SPEAKER_01]: released, et cetera?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hemp plastic, similar to corn plastic,
is biodegradable.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, that is not to be confused with
compostable.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, biodegradable just means that
something will break down in a reasonable
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of time, and it's literally defined
as a reasonable amount of time,
[SPEAKER_04]: so that's up for debate what reasonable
is.
[SPEAKER_04]: With exposure to light water and oxygen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Similarly, compostable products are
defined that way, but the reasonable
[SPEAKER_04]: amount of time is 180 days, within certain
conditions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, where am I going with this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Methane gas, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, one of the benefits of hemp plastic is
if your product does end up in a landfill,
[SPEAKER_04]: the hemp will act as a carbon trap,
and it'll trap that carbon, so it won't
[SPEAKER_04]: release gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, if it does go to an appropriate
composting facility, it can also be
[SPEAKER_04]: appropriately composted.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it kind of offers a dual solution,
and in the short term, we're gonna be
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at most hemp plastic going to
landfills, simply because waste recovery
[SPEAKER_04]: is a huge issue, and it's not just with
hemp plastic, even with your to go
[SPEAKER_04]: Starbucks cups that are made out of corn
plastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: About 5% of composting facilities
nationwide even accept that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, greenwashing is the wrong term for it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's more just an issue of consumer
education and consumer engagement,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it goes back to the point I was saying
earlier about how we can keep innovating
[SPEAKER_04]: materials and make materials more and more
sustainable, but we're really not going to
[SPEAKER_04]: solve this circular puzzle until we really
address that recovery part.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, what I think makes hemp
interesting is that in the short term,
[SPEAKER_04]: while products go to the landfill,
it'll act as a carbon trap, and then once
[SPEAKER_04]: we do have the infrastructure required for
all sustainable packaging, not just hemp,
[SPEAKER_04]: it can then go to a composting facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to just point out that part of the
reason we're here today is to identify
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, we're not just talking about it,
we're not complaining, we're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at how we can create solutions and
address some of these issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Starbucks, I want to point out,
their lids are of a specific type of
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic that actually can be toxic,
it's not recyclable, and they've created a
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're offering $10 million for companies
to come together and make suggestions for
[SPEAKER_01]: alternatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, that's something to be aware of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also, I know that Julie is part of the
CCIA Legislative Committee, and
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially you can also speak,
Andrew, to how we can work to change
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, how we can move through the
legislature, and what those steps are,
[SPEAKER_01]: what can we do?
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to ask Christina a question.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is so much regulation and concern
for public safety for licensed operators
[SPEAKER_03]: and licensed manufacturers who need to
include all of the safety information,
[SPEAKER_03]: have a child-resistant package,
and all of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, I'm wondering, from the agency's
perspective, from the Department of Public
[SPEAKER_03]: Health, what are the plans, if any,
that the Department of Public Health has
[SPEAKER_03]: for public education about why somebody
shouldn't buy that $10 gram, and what's
[SPEAKER_03]: wrong with it, and why consumers right
now, where they're just coming to licensed
[SPEAKER_03]: operators and going, why is this so
expensive, and why do you use so much
[SPEAKER_03]: packaging, and you're ruining the earth,
and what's wrong with you?
[SPEAKER_03]: How the departments and agencies can help
the licensed operators with the education
[SPEAKER_03]: of the public of why they should care that
they're using really expensive but
[SPEAKER_03]: laboratory-tested and well-packaged
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the fact that licensed products
are laboratory-tested has to be a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: selling point for people, so I do think
it's an area where there needs to be more
[SPEAKER_02]: education.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three state offices for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're one of them, and then the Bureau of
Cannabis Control, which most people are
[SPEAKER_02]: familiar with, is the lead agency for
cannabis, so the Bureau put in their
[SPEAKER_02]: budget request for this year money for a
public education campaign on that very
[SPEAKER_02]: issue, so both consumer education and for
educating people about how to come into
[SPEAKER_02]: the licensed market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still all, so this is part of the
state process, we're still all going
[SPEAKER_02]: through our budgeting processes,
but I think something like that would go a
[SPEAKER_02]: long way towards helping people understand
how these products that come from licensed
[SPEAKER_02]: companies are different, not only for the
product itself, but because you know that
[SPEAKER_02]: that manufacturer located down the street
from this place that you go to all the
[SPEAKER_02]: time is not a safety risk for your
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think even things like that are
important for people to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, more on the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we make these changes?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can we do as individuals to make
those changes?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a Los Angeles City Council meeting
tomorrow morning at 830 a.m.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everybody gonna be there?
[SPEAKER_03]: All of you, I'll be looking for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's the thing, those things
actually work.
[SPEAKER_03]: The people who show up, who make the
public comments, some of the things being
[SPEAKER_03]: discussed tomorrow, the state has
introduced the S-type license for shared
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities, which is huge for small
businesses and smaller operators.
[SPEAKER_03]: Los Angeles needs to introduce this
license type as a local option,
[SPEAKER_03]: because we don't have that license type.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's many, many facilities ready to go
that could do it if they could get a
[SPEAKER_03]: shared license authorization there at the
local level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Los Angeles, I'm just speaking
specifically to Los Angeles, Los Angeles
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't have any testing labs.
[SPEAKER_03]: We gotta test July 1st, everything's gotta
be tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a single lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Los Angeles, it's gonna be a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's like 18, 13, how many
labs?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's like 20 or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're up to 20 or so, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Biggest market in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 labs, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Every product has to be tested.
[SPEAKER_03]: Los Angeles is looking to mainline an
emergency licensing process for testing
[SPEAKER_03]: laboratories in Los Angeles, because we
need them.
[SPEAKER_03]: There were 55.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're down to 37 bills currently
going through at the state level that have
[SPEAKER_03]: to do with cannabis issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of these would impact operators like
you couldn't believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like there's a bill right now that's
trying to define a mature plant as
[SPEAKER_03]: anything that's 18 inches.
[SPEAKER_03]: That doesn't work for a lot of people,
it's arguable.
[SPEAKER_03]: So knowing that those things are happening
at the local level, at the state level,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to show up, you have to say your
opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to not be crazy when you show up
and say your opinion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just gonna say that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't go up at the city council meeting
and be like, we want an unregulated
[SPEAKER_03]: market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ship is sailed.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want a regulated market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got a kid.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want good schools.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want roads.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want this money to be distributed well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want an equity program.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want social justice.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why I voted for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, many people are having voter's
remorse about Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't know exactly how it was gonna
shake down, but it was time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the main thing is that it is a moving
evolutionary process that is not over.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even when the full language comes out,
it's not over.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do like bills.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do like politics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything we saw in Schoolhouse Rock is
real.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can make a petition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the world is crazy and anything's
possible at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the main thing is being engaged.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the one thing that I will say again,
my feeling is the big thing right now is
[SPEAKER_03]: pathways to compliance.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we get more people participating in
this industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody genuinely who wants to participate
in the cannabis industry is your enemy.
[SPEAKER_03]: The days of small groups battling with
other small groups is over.
[SPEAKER_03]: The giants at the gate are just hovering.
[SPEAKER_03]: You look at what I now call the Canadian
menace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most major companies in Canada,
trace it back, who owns them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Alcohol companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: This industry is changing in front of our
eyes.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's huge multinational corporations
itching to come buy your company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of that's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe that's what you wanna do.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you want to preserve the dream of
the industry that has kind of existed,
[SPEAKER_03]: the time for action is now.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is gonna be over soon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as I've always said, the main
beautiful potential of this industry is
[SPEAKER_03]: that the world has always been filled with
healers and shamans and cool people,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they've never been sitting on top of a
multi-billion dollar industry that they
[SPEAKER_03]: need to own and get politically active and
donate to politicians.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wanna change some stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: Donate to some politicians.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will listen to you.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the one thing I've learned at the
state level.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pay to play.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like the sunset strip out there,
man.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when you have the seat at the table,
have a good story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't be crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I just wanna tell you all,
before the panel, Julie told me that she
[SPEAKER_02]: has to be out of here at eight o'clock
because she's going to theater and I feel
[SPEAKER_02]: like she's a show woman.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanna piggyback off of that a little bit
because I think, especially because this
[SPEAKER_02]: is sort of co-marketed or whatever the
relationship is, with CCMA, it's important
[SPEAKER_02]: to talk about industry associations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So CCMA, CCIA, there's a number of local
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any sort of outlet like that where you
come together and you make your voice a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit louder is really valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think for us as regulators, sometimes we
look to industry groups and we say,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, what are all of your memberships
saying about this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are all of your membership confused about
this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there some issue that this collective
group that you represent is having trouble
[SPEAKER_02]: with?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really helps us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to piggyback on Courtney's question
on how to influence legislation and
[SPEAKER_08]: regulation change.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think, first of all, you're doing it
right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're here, you're attending,
you're learning.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the first step.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's really the first step.
[SPEAKER_08]: In addition, I know Julie spoke to this
earlier, but regulations changed again a
[SPEAKER_08]: few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: And by law, not just with cannabis,
other regulations as well, there's a
[SPEAKER_08]: public comment period.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not very long, especially this last one,
but that's your time.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's your time to talk and that's your
time to get your answers out there,
[SPEAKER_08]: your questions and your feedback.
[SPEAKER_08]: And by law, the state has to listen.
[SPEAKER_08]: Doesn't mean they have to act,
but they have to listen.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's the first thing you can do and
that's the public forum.
[SPEAKER_08]: The next suggestion I would have for every
single one of you out there is,
[SPEAKER_08]: based on my experience so far in the last
few months, all three government agencies
[SPEAKER_08]: regulating cannabis want people to be and
companies to be in the system.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's gonna cost money.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a burden to entry, but all that being
said, they want us to get out of the gray
[SPEAKER_08]: market and the black market.
[SPEAKER_08]: They want us to be legit.
[SPEAKER_08]: They want us to be legal.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all that being said, submit your
questions online.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go to the BCC, go to the CDPH,
go to CDFA.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's a website that just says,
email for questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: They will answer.
[SPEAKER_08]: You do not even have to be some huge,
huge corporation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ask a question as an individual.
[SPEAKER_08]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_08]: What's the worst they can do?
[SPEAKER_08]: Not answer.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, from my experience so far,
answers have been excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been timely.
[SPEAKER_08]: They've been promptly.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's effectively, again, everyone
wants this to happen in the right way.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you ask the right questions in the
right way, based on my experience so far,
[SPEAKER_08]: the government agencies are gonna respond
in the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked Christina if it's possible for
individuals or companies to send their
[SPEAKER_01]: actual packaging and ask for input.
[SPEAKER_01]: And unfortunately, I think that time has
passed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I personally did send several emails
asking for guidance, and I did receive
[SPEAKER_01]: prompt responses that were quite helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's one more thing I wanna talk about,
and then I think we should probably open
[SPEAKER_01]: up to questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: So start thinking about what you wanna ask
while you still listen to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for lab testing, it's pass or fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you said, you were talking about
your child, and it just reminded me that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis is medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis is medicine for adults and
for children.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we have a pass or a fail,
if we have some of this critical illness,
[SPEAKER_01]: there is a concern that those trace
amounts of pesticides can be harmful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not all of us have healthy immune
systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some of us are looking at what that can do
to compromise our health.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's something worth noting.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd just like to turn to all of you and
ask if you've had any instances where this
[SPEAKER_01]: is something that's come to your
forefront, or perhaps maybe there's other
[SPEAKER_01]: ways that we should be approaching lab
testing besides a pass or fail?
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyone?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, just to be honest, the latest
regulations that pass by the BCC change
[SPEAKER_08]: some of the tolerance levels for some of
the testing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_08]: It is.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a capital expense to buy that kind of
machinery to perform these tests.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't really have a good answer,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, again, as the law is the
law, and these are the these are the path
[SPEAKER_08]: that's been been directed.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, you can either try to
influence legislation and hope it goes
[SPEAKER_08]: back, or I hate to say it, grin and bear
it, because it's probably going to be a
[SPEAKER_08]: reality.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I think that almost everything
that gets passed that has to do with
[SPEAKER_08]: safety generally doesn't get taken back.
[SPEAKER_08]: So when we talk about these pesticides,
solvents, and these test the side levels
[SPEAKER_08]: being, you know, very, very stringent,
I just hate to admit it, guys,
[SPEAKER_08]: start finding clean material.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how to put it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to piggyback on that a little bit
and say that one of the most effective
[SPEAKER_04]: things you can do is vote with your
dollar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And something you can do while you're
shopping is look for certain
[SPEAKER_04]: certifications.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure you're all aware of the fact
that, you know, not being a federally
[SPEAKER_04]: regulated substance, cannabis is not
subject to USDA certifications.
[SPEAKER_04]: So kind of in the absence of those,
a number of third party certifications
[SPEAKER_04]: have arose and something I always do when
I'm shopping for cannabis products is look
[SPEAKER_04]: for either clean green certified or
certified kind or DM pure, which is a
[SPEAKER_04]: really cool one because it's for
regenerative cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's, I think, a great way of kind
of, you know, weeding out a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: shit that you'll otherwise get.
[SPEAKER_01]: Demeter is a 40 year organization,
biodynamic cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bit esoteric, but in the very
basic, it's a more stringent requirement
[SPEAKER_01]: than the FDA would require for organic
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's another avenue that you can
pursue.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that, let's open up our panel to
questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: How are we doing on time, Julie?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, we have like 10 minutes,
guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jodi, Christina, is there any kind of
certification that you foresee coming down
[SPEAKER_01]: to give us more information about the
micro microbes or other issues pertaining
[SPEAKER_01]: to tests, pesticides?
[SPEAKER_02]: So her question is really about labeling
and, you know, a past lab requirements
[SPEAKER_02]: kind of label.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see that coming because the truth
is if it doesn't pass lab testing,
[SPEAKER_02]: it will not be able to be sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is some allowance for certain
products.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they do not pass lab testing,
they can be remediated, which you
[SPEAKER_02]: mentioned that word.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I wanted to talk about it a little bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if a product fails lab testing for any
issue other than labeling THC
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it passes because there are pesticides
in it, or there's some mold in flowers,
[SPEAKER_02]: a common one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then it can be remediated if a plan is
sent to the Department of Public Health
[SPEAKER_02]: and approved, it'll go back to a
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_02]: The manufacturer, usually it's like an
extraction process that they put it
[SPEAKER_02]: through to try and clear out whatever
contaminant is in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It still has to go back through lab
testing to confirm that it worked.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the end of the day, the products
that you have on the shelf are still
[SPEAKER_02]: products that have passed lab testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked Christina what happens if the
packaging is not compliant and it's passed
[SPEAKER_01]: the July 1st deadline.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she notified me that that's a question
for the PCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I want you all to be aware of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think at this point the PCC is intending
to provide education and guidance as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to just laying down a hammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can be a little flexible,
but we should all really strive for this
[SPEAKER_01]: deadline of July 1st.
[SPEAKER_02]: Questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: On that really quickly, I will say the
Bureau has a transition period,
[SPEAKER_02]: like a July 1st fact sheet up on their
website that talks a little bit about,
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think they're going to just look
the other way for packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, this is a question to ask them
about how exactly they're gonna approach
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I can tell you that I've seen is that
we've had six months of a transition
[SPEAKER_02]: period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a relatively short time for a
business to get up to date on regulations
[SPEAKER_02]: to order new packaging to, in many ways,
raise the bar for compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my team reviews every email that comes
into our office.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got almost no questions about packaging
and labeling, maybe like a handful over
[SPEAKER_02]: the first five months of the transition
period.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the past two or three weeks,
we have been inundated with questions
[SPEAKER_02]: about packaging and labeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you review my label?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we cannot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: What about this requirement?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that says to me is that as far as
packaging and labeling goes, I think it
[SPEAKER_02]: was one of the last things on people's
minds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in some ways, I'm not sure if it's sort
of this six month of a transition period
[SPEAKER_02]: that opportunity was squandered a little
bit, or it was an overwhelming everything
[SPEAKER_02]: else was on the mind first.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at some point, we have to have an end
to the transition period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the date is July 1st.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what we announced in November.
[SPEAKER_02]: So again, I would talk to the Bureau about
how they're gonna enforce this at a retail
[SPEAKER_02]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at some point, it has to change over
to compliant packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can start saying that message about
the products on the shelf here are
[SPEAKER_02]: different from the products on that
unlicensed shelf there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think many of us know that retailers
have already stopped accepting packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gentleman in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we still use stickers to adjust the
packaging?
[SPEAKER_02]: This has been an interesting question
because in our transition period language,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the CDPH emergency regulations we talk
about, you can use a sticker to satisfy
[SPEAKER_02]: labeling requirements during the
transition period.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people read that as you can only
use a sticker during the transition
[SPEAKER_02]: period.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use a sticker at any time as long
as it's actually adhered to your package
[SPEAKER_02]: and not one of those peel away stickers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue hat backwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, they rip open.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's your tamper evidence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the mylar packaging when it's heat
sealed, is that considered tamper
[SPEAKER_01]: evidence?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good indication that someone has
been in your bud.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the only products that have to be an
opaque packaging are edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Flour does not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Non-edible manufactured products do not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get that question a lot too.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about a Ziploc?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's Ziploc, it would have to be child
resistant reusable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it says that you can't use
an exit package.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the product packaging itself is what
has to be child resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have distinguished, we use the term
secondary package because you could use a
[SPEAKER_02]: bag like that to meet the child resistant
packaging requirements as long as it has
[SPEAKER_02]: all of your labeling requirements on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your package is already packaged into
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exit packaging is what a retailer puts
your whole purchase in before you walk out
[SPEAKER_02]: the door.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's different from secondary.
[SPEAKER_02]: Packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're looking at is, is your
product, each individual product,
[SPEAKER_02]: sold in some sort of child resistant
packaging?
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be a bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: It could be something else.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for pre-rolls, for example,
let's say you have a pre-roll package.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's not child resistant, that solution
to bring it to market by July 1st can be a
[SPEAKER_01]: child resistant package.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be an additional expense,
but it will bring you compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something worth noting.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I understand that there's a lot
surrounding alcoholic beverages and the
[SPEAKER_07]: infusion of THC and CBD, and THC will be
kept separate or not allowed.
[SPEAKER_07]: But are you working with the TTP at all on
packaging with alcoholic beverages that
[SPEAKER_07]: are including CBDs and non psychoactive
effects like turkey?
[SPEAKER_07]: Why are you guys going to do that
yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis, CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Will you repeat the question?
[SPEAKER_02]: So his question is about alcoholic
beverages being infused with THC and or
[SPEAKER_02]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: Either way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that would be a manufactured product if
you're talking about CBD from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we specifically prohibit alcoholic
beverages from being sold as cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't matter if it's THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's also CBD from industrial hemp,
which Mauer-Kursa specifically excludes
[SPEAKER_02]: from the definition of cannabis,
so it doesn't fall under our office.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from what I understand with the
offices that it does fall under,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's still prohibited.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good question because we are
seeing a number of beers that are
[SPEAKER_01]: including cannabis across the nation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The young lady here with the blonde hair,
please.
[SPEAKER_01]: A physician endorsed formula.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would we add it to the label and who
would we speak to?
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, I could be corrected here.
[SPEAKER_08]: But one of the requirements for all
manufactured labels is that the product,
[SPEAKER_08]: every claim must be truthful and factual
on the label.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you have a clinical study from a
physician that you could actually document
[SPEAKER_08]: and cite as backup if some regulatory
agency came knocking on your door,
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that you would be okay to include
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as already previously discussed,
there is no quote unquote label approval
[SPEAKER_08]: that has to go through the state with
California.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now that all being said, I strongly
discourage this practice because what
[SPEAKER_08]: you're doing is the moment we start
making, we as the industry, start making
[SPEAKER_08]: drug and health claims on our products,
you open the door for the FDA to come in
[SPEAKER_08]: and now look at you.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we are illegal within the state of
California and we follow the rules within
[SPEAKER_08]: the state of California, but you start
saying pain relief, cures cancer,
[SPEAKER_08]: all this kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: You better have some sort of documentation
behind it to back it or else you're just
[SPEAKER_08]: opening the door for legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can say things like there's a relaxing
physical effect, but you have to be pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: cautious.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry, go on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so there is a provision that talks
about health related statements.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're talking about one specific
physician said this one specific thing and
[SPEAKER_02]: again backed up by a study, maybe you
could get away with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to second him.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The provision about health related
statements, so you're talking about treats
[SPEAKER_02]: this disease, cures insomnia, something
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are only permitted if there is a
consensus of science, I can't remember the
[SPEAKER_02]: exact wording, but it is a significant
scientific agreement and peer reviewed
[SPEAKER_02]: study.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at this point, there is not that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is a provision that allows you to
include statements about what we call
[SPEAKER_02]: characteristic anticipated effects.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's like something that informs the
consumer about what they might feel if
[SPEAKER_02]: they take the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it might make you drowsy, might have a
relaxing effect, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, the second you start to get into
anything disease related, you are really
[SPEAKER_02]: inviting a level of scrutiny that I don't
think you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: This gentleman over here with the rosin
hat on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So his question is about characters,
cartoons.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's essentially there's a provision that
one of the labeling prohibitions is
[SPEAKER_02]: anything that is intended to be or is
attractive to children.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it lists a couple of examples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cartoons are one.
[SPEAKER_02]: The word candy or candies is one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've gotten a lot of questions about
this since the rules originally came out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was essentially the question that
we usually get is something like,
[SPEAKER_02]: can you tell me exactly what this means?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a really hard question for us
to answer because every time we've tried
[SPEAKER_02]: to put really concrete regulatory terms
around it, you either end up looping in
[SPEAKER_02]: things that are not attractive to children
or not including things that are that
[SPEAKER_02]: really are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the way it's worded is you cannot
include labeling or images that are
[SPEAKER_02]: attractive to children as determined by
the department on a case by case basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a question about something on
your label like that, you can send it to
[SPEAKER_02]: us and we'll look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really challenging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll tell you what we sort of look for
in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thing that I usually say is we look at
the totality of the package just because
[SPEAKER_02]: you include a graphic on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it is an adult themed package and it
just happens to have a drawing on it,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's not necessarily attractive to
children.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are some things that we look at in
the market that are so attractive to
[SPEAKER_02]: children and there's no question about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there's some things that are
clearly marketed to adults.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the gray area that's a little bit
harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want me to look at it,
you can bring it up afterwards or you can
[SPEAKER_02]: email us.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very kind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have cards here if anyone wants them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think with that we need to conclude our
evening.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I hear a cue here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to ask you all to visit future
cannabis project and if you'd like to know
[SPEAKER_01]: more about these types of events,
you can visit whitebuffalocannabis.com
[SPEAKER_01]: forward slash events and I hope to see you
all very soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you again to our panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks Julie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Please stick around and enjoy some drinks
and some food from Solidarity.
