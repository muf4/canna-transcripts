[SPEAKER_01]: If you analyze everything you do from the
first sprouts to the end product,
[SPEAKER_01]: and you do the soil and the plant,
you know what the plant is taking from the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like all this data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a lot of data right
there, because there's so many variables
[SPEAKER_00]: within that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the soil is one aspect of what is
going to be produced from the trichrome,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also is the humidity and the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but it's like it's a wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to prove that what you do is
special, you need this data not only to
[SPEAKER_01]: guide you to greatness, but to prove
something you'd like to prove a terroir,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's what you need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need six science done by the French
government for a place like Bordeaux to be
[SPEAKER_01]: given that ultimate award.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not like some geographical part of
the territory, it goes deep, really deep.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, that depth makes you
go so much deeper into to see what your
[SPEAKER_01]: plant is taking from your soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's good for you because you need it
since you need to replenish that soil at
[SPEAKER_01]: the end of the season anyway, you need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then it's less guessing what's the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then per genetic, you can see that
some are going to take more of some type
[SPEAKER_01]: of mineral while others, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that, it's data that can make you
fine tune your ability to create really
[SPEAKER_01]: the ultimate quality because you don't
guess your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really know them or know what the
other generation took from your place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you give it on the next year and
you see the results and so on until you
[SPEAKER_01]: get to perfection.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, wow, science, to have this lab,
it just costs too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you give them the ability to have
scientific paper written about shit like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, that it can come for free because
that science we need, bad.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think there's going to be the
market for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will the cannabis market appreciate those
levels at a certain point?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're making a hash that's
relatively consistent every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: But me, I need the farmer that give me
that consistency.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm just a beggar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And does it have to be a year later?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's an agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like if the rain come early,
like there is a lot of stuff that come
[SPEAKER_01]: into play.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fire, a lot of more CO2 in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they will be greater year than other.
[SPEAKER_01]: But outside that, that would be more
reflected in overall characteristic of the
result.
[SPEAKER_01]: The quality per se, it comes every year
and is defined by when you harvest the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a fruit on a tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like if you harvest early,
it's not going to be a great fruit.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you harvest it when it should be,
the stuff is going to blow your mouth
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I need from the farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I need a super close collab with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to protect them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need them to make a good living that
they can dedicate their life to quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, they're not going to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they cannot survive in a big market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now, Bordeaux was recognized as a
terroir because the wine coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: Bordeaux were recognized worldwide as
being quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that before the knowledge of
the terroir, there is a knowledge of the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of the produce that come from that
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when it's something that you have in
Spain, in California, that you don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: to prove your terroir, your reputation
worldwide is a stamp of proof that you
[SPEAKER_01]: have the terroir.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in six months, you start to be known
for the mediocre quality that there is on
[SPEAKER_01]: the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like quality and a good rap is really
hard to build at any level.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's super easy to lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's happening in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mediocrity is promoted because there is
too little farmer, too much demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so instead of taking care of the
demand by bringing more farmer,
[SPEAKER_01]: now you want the little one to produce
more than to take every shortcut that
[SPEAKER_01]: there is possibly, maybe you can possibly
make to put something not even decent on
[SPEAKER_01]: the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like seriously?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's a lot of economics at play
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no economics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about economics.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like if you're not the center of
quality in the mind of the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: who are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a producing place?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of producing place on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is nowhere like California in the
genetic and the quality you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I've been there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like you lose beyond money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lose the legacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You lose the ability to be the only
country in the world that can produce
[SPEAKER_01]: quality than there is everybody else that
has been producing only quantity.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how much of an edge it is on the
world market?
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't take me about losing money.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think small, doing that way they
are, who's going to buy their swag when
[SPEAKER_01]: the window open?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you have a world trade, you see
they're going to compete with Mexico.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to compete with Jamaica.
[SPEAKER_01]: With Colombia, with South Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like go to Morocco, go to Lebanon
when there is a third of the country that
[SPEAKER_01]: has been growing cannabis since down of
time for thousands and thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to compete quantity wise with
shitty genetics not adapted against those
[SPEAKER_01]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy the show.
[SPEAKER_01]: Enjoy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really want to be relevant in the
market of the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: Become what the French is to the wine
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Create quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Embrace quality and nurture it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then you can make a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: People will keep looking at you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will be relevant in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise it's like producing swag is not
difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the price is going down and down and
down and down and down and down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And quality is going to stand even more
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more mediocrity and the people who
really stick to quality, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: stand out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to keep the principle in the
middle of all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really don't care to put something that
I wouldn't smoke and enjoy myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: No fucking way.
[SPEAKER_01]: With my name or white label or anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like when I can do quality,
there is no way I'm not going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a choice to do quality or quantity
and I can make the same money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on one side I'm going to be the king
of the jungle and on the other side I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be with the big shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: To all his choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I really know where I stand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's no denying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For you it's the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a bunch of pockets in the whole
California where you have heirloom
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have stuff that is nowhere else on the
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is one thing about that though.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole terroir in California effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had the genetics and the basically
cultural to supply the soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we do have that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have hundreds of microclimate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the microclimate that allows for us
to produce the best quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the middle of the mountain,
the salmon going up this river since the
[SPEAKER_01]: creation of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the glaciers that melted from Canada
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: All that cost is rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the biggest tree in the world
growing only on the water in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's amazingly rich.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this gives you a way to stone in the
cannabis industry worldwide like the
[SPEAKER_01]: French are in the wine industry because
you have everything that the French used
[SPEAKER_01]: to create what they did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still feel like there is a difference
though with the terroir effect in also
[SPEAKER_00]: applying that to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we could talk about the weather,
the climate and the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a different plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a perennial plant and an annual
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have a plant that can adapt
better than any other plant on the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have much more ability to maximize
the terroir than with any other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you can maximize it quicker and
you can keep it more consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But part of the effect of a terroir is
down in that soil that the grape goes is
[SPEAKER_00]: some iron molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the lawn and it's the microbial.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is two sciences for the lawn.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is the science of how the soil is
formed like the constituent and the
[SPEAKER_01]: science of the life inside that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all about that life.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plant when it grows, full grown in the
soil, it calls all these microbes to it to
[SPEAKER_01]: break down the nutrient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like in the air, all the terpenes,
it's to make mobile living organisms do
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: So depending on your insect life,
your terpenes profile is going to change
[SPEAKER_01]: certain aspects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if you're going to retain the main
characteristic terpenes profile of GDP,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you grow it in such an environment
and there is such a life outside in the
[SPEAKER_01]: soil and everything, that plant is going
to become more that specific place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can become that much faster than
any plant to the point that there is long
[SPEAKER_01]: race and there is ruderalis, indica and
sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought it was species and they're not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it goes to some level of adaptation
that is beyond anything, any other veggie,
[SPEAKER_01]: rice, tea.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can adapt a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: They transform, they're different.
[SPEAKER_01]: The rice from Japan is totally different
from India.
[SPEAKER_01]: The grain and everything, but it's the
same plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know it's the same family.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are different species.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes so fast into becoming something
else adapting incredibly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we can harness the power of terroir
with the cannabis much stronger and
[SPEAKER_01]: deeper, with more potentialities than any
other plant or very few would give you
[SPEAKER_01]: that ability.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an interesting perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tomato is a pretty good example of a
competitive vegetable that can adapt to
[SPEAKER_01]: anything and still be great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is a little bit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I take a tomato that is an heirloom
from Russia and I grow it in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's still that Russian girl, but she's
totally performing in a new territory and
[SPEAKER_01]: while she's showing those main
characteristics of the tomato I was buying
[SPEAKER_01]: and I wanted, it's going to be some
modifications that are born from the place
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you do it, you let the seeds and
you let it become an heirloom,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to slowly, slowly, slowly
transform.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a lot of plants that do that and
cannabis does it like none other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so important that we don't lose the
respect for the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine, the business is fine,
but the power comes from the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the less you understand that,
the less performance you're going to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: your business in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it all starts there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the gap there is between the farmer
and the patient, the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter how many times I tell
everybody it's not me, it's the lawn,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the climate, it's my farmer and my
genetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still all about me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would be nothing without them.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the wine bottle, you don't see the name
of the winemaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't play that game.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't want to play that game.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their game is to make wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: To be recognized in your industry as a
master of what you do, fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't need to give your identity
for the perception of goodness people
[SPEAKER_01]: experience when they drink your wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your name doesn't mean nothing in the
experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about the grapes that were grown
in such a place, the dedication of the guy
[SPEAKER_01]: in this field, and the power of
transformation of that guy who can play
[SPEAKER_01]: that finite little magic and give his
touch to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a touch.
[SPEAKER_01]: If he doesn't have that quality,
it's like a three-star Michelin.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you make him buy at Safeway,
he's not going to put the same stuff on
[SPEAKER_01]: the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then when he goes and he takes only the
vegetable seasonal, he goes to the farm
[SPEAKER_01]: every day, he harvests with his farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That type of vegetable, there is a whole
life and love and dedication and goodness
[SPEAKER_01]: in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not only growing in good condition.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's that whole osmosis of the life of the
plant, the climate, the farmer,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the plant, or the animal, or anything
you raise.
[SPEAKER_01]: When this is to the top, then you have the
greatest quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many times I had great produce from
great growers, and then they had a bad
[SPEAKER_01]: year, some stress family or girlfriend or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, on that year, there isn't such.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there was no love in the field.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not only a little hippie story.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's real.
[SPEAKER_01]: A plant is a living organism that is
aware, and you feed it good vibes,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's going to give you good medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very simple, but that's why it's like
if we lose this, we lose the biggest part
[SPEAKER_01]: of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even if I don't do medicine, I just do
psychoactive, still, the goodness,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm giving, it's because I have all that
that come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comes into it throughout the whole
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just me.
[SPEAKER_00]: The love starts in the beginning,
all the way to where it comes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always the way it's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
