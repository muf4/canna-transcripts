[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I will say, because of my
experience in the CCA, that the one thing
[SPEAKER_00]: where labs and manufacturers come together
on is where testing happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a lot of industries, especially
pharma, you don't test the product in its
[SPEAKER_00]: final package.
[SPEAKER_00]: You test the product in its final form,
but you can be delivered that final form
[SPEAKER_00]: in bulk to test.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quarantined until they get the COA
and then everybody is hunky dory and you
[SPEAKER_00]: release it and they can package it and go.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our industry, we have to receive it in
its final package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Child proof packaging, blister packaging,
oh and great, babe cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dude, it takes to get enough sample and
we're only talking like two and a half or
[SPEAKER_00]: three grams total.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to go through, especially if
it's half gram cartridges, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can only get two-tenths of a gram,
maybe three-tenths of a gram out of a half
[SPEAKER_00]: gram cartridge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I'm trying to get three grams,
I'm looking at 10 to 15 cartridges that
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be opened.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's about 30 minutes of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I charge my customers labor for
that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, I don't make back my margin on
my tests and it's not fair to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not fair to us, but it's the way the
regulations are written and it's just one
[SPEAKER_00]: of those things where manufacturers are
pushing for testing at final formulation
[SPEAKER_00]: or final product, but not final package.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lab has been screaming about this for
two freaking years, dude, because before
[SPEAKER_00]: they went into, the real regs went into
effect this past year or the year before
[SPEAKER_00]: under the temporary practice regs was
still in cartridges and we were still
[SPEAKER_00]: complaining back then two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
