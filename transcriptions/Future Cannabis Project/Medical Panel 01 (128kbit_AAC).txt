[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Wade Lafter and I am among
other things an advocate for medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and it's my pleasure to serve as
the person who's going to moderate a
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion between Forrest Hurd and Dr.
Stephen Bannister and I personally am very
[SPEAKER_00]: thrilled to be doing this because these
are two of my favorite people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dr. Bannister has been in medical practice
in our community for 42 years I think you
[SPEAKER_00]: said and 20 some years of that,
22 years more or less, he has risked his
[SPEAKER_00]: medical license because the California
Medical Board gets nervous about doctors
[SPEAKER_00]: who actually practice with cannabis,
advise people to use cannabis and Dr.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bannister has for the last 22 years at
Highland Springs been helping patients
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how to use cannabis in treating
the conditions that they are subject to
[SPEAKER_00]: and that has been a scary thing at times I
would guess as he says that the medical
[SPEAKER_00]: board can get nervous or jumpy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meantime Forrest Hurd, I don't even know
where to start, this gentleman is he comes
[SPEAKER_00]: to medical cannabis out of direct personal
needs in his own family and his son is
[SPEAKER_00]: subject to most of the types of seizures
that have been identified in the time that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known Forrest it's coming on four
years now there have been months at a time
[SPEAKER_00]: when Silas was free of seizures thanks to
certain cannabis medications that we had
[SPEAKER_00]: access to and on the other hand especially
in the last few months it's been a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: relentless nightmare of ongoing seizures
and in the midst of all of that in his own
[SPEAKER_00]: life he has made time and space and put
effort into creating an entity called the
[SPEAKER_00]: Caladrius Network which has been providing
cannabis preparations to families at no
[SPEAKER_00]: cost to those families and many of those
preparations are custom formulated for the
[SPEAKER_00]: needs of those children and in order to
qualify for Caladrius the child has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: in a situation of what's known as
catastrophically ill which means Western
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine does not have an answer for this
condition and it is typically fatal and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's who Forrest is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So today what I'd like to do is hear from
these two people about the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: medical cannabis in California today and
some of the exciting possibilities that
[SPEAKER_00]: are out there in therapeutic possibilities
and some of the dilemmas that are going on
[SPEAKER_00]: and so with that who what do you think
guys who wants to start I'm gonna shut up
[SPEAKER_00]: for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you Wade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks everyone for coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a big topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure where to start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we'll just give a summary of my
experience and then we'll talk about the
[SPEAKER_02]: same and we'll see where we get from
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as Wade mentioned I started researching
medical cannabis very seriously about
[SPEAKER_02]: seven years ago when my son was diagnosed
with a condition called Lennox-Gastaut
[SPEAKER_02]: syndrome which is a considered a rare
catastrophic form of epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Considered an intractable type of epilepsy
meaning it doesn't respond to medications.
[SPEAKER_02]: Children have multiple seizure types.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've documented 10 different types of
seizures and many of them don't even
[SPEAKER_02]: really have a name.
[SPEAKER_02]: With him he went from a healthy boy to he
had his first seizure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a matter of weeks not months when
he had his second seizure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a matter of months not years when
he was having seizures every day and
[SPEAKER_02]: within a year, year and a half he was
having hundreds of seizures a month and by
[SPEAKER_02]: the time he was five he was having around
2,500 seizures a month.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we just watched this rapid decline and
I had worked in pediatric mental health
[SPEAKER_02]: for 15 years with kids with different
mental health conditions, environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: and genetic causes of different mental
health conditions and you know when my son
[SPEAKER_02]: became ill it took those years of
experience to start really researching
[SPEAKER_02]: where the science was with cannabidiol
because at that point they didn't think he
[SPEAKER_02]: was going to live very long at all and
they told us he would never live to see
[SPEAKER_02]: the age of 10.
[SPEAKER_02]: Happy to say he's 12 now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's how I came into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I studied it a lot more feverishly than
maybe most people because I felt like we
[SPEAKER_02]: were going against the clock and out of
that experience we started working with
[SPEAKER_02]: local politics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that got the type of attention that
attracted other families with similar
[SPEAKER_02]: types of kids wondering if they could get
help because we weren't able to get
[SPEAKER_02]: psilocyst seizures after a lot of work,
a lot of different cultivation of specific
[SPEAKER_02]: strains of plants to stop.
[SPEAKER_02]: At one point they stopped for six,
seven months and even with the seizures
[SPEAKER_02]: he's having now compared to 2,500 months,
we still have on average about a 90%
[SPEAKER_02]: seizure reduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now 10% of 2,500 is still a lot of
seizures, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know if we're talking about
statistically as far as other anti-seizure
[SPEAKER_02]: drugs and success rates it blows every
other anti-seizure drug out of the water
[SPEAKER_02]: considering that they had zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: That 90% is pretty incredible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the coagulants that worked with us
formed as a collective like a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: medical patient collectives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what a lot of people don't realize is
when we passed Proposition 64 we sunset
[SPEAKER_02]: the clock, there was a clock from SB 420
that was sunset to expire on January 9th
[SPEAKER_02]: of 2018.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Calabrius Network, well the BCC was
supposed to write laws for non-profits.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said they were too busy and didn't
have time to get it finished.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Governor Brown allowed them to push
that date back to January 19th of 2019.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he didn't push back the sunset of the
collective model.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were on the same date.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's happened is the Calabrius
Network was forced to shut down on January
[SPEAKER_02]: of this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the time that we were working,
what we were doing was working with you
[SPEAKER_02]: know, terminally and catastrophically ill
children.
[SPEAKER_02]: So intractable epilepsy, cancer,
and I've worked really hard with a skin,
[SPEAKER_02]: a horrible skin condition called
epidermolysis filosa which is probably the
[SPEAKER_02]: worst thing I've ever seen in my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you look it up, fair warning,
you don't want to see it what these kids
[SPEAKER_02]: are going through.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were working with horrible diseases
where kids typically don't work,
[SPEAKER_02]: live out of their teens in all these
conditions with the exception of some of
[SPEAKER_02]: the cancers because we've made a lot of
progress in cancer and treatment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were able to collect from the
farmers here in Nevada County.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were able to collect donations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ran programs, like two-for-tots
programs where we'd get farmers to put out
[SPEAKER_02]: two plants and we'd collect them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were able to take those in,
do the extractions ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had a lab in Sacramento that was
volunteering to test them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were able to get all the safety testing
done.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we, I would make the preparations
based on the lab results in our kitchen
[SPEAKER_02]: for these kids individually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially with rare epilepsies,
we found they really needed a specific
[SPEAKER_02]: formulation for that specific brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't get into that quite as later.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm proud to say that in the,
we worked publicly for two years,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we ran as kind of just families and
parents for longer than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when we got shut down, we finally took
a breath and went back and looked.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were able to donate $1.2 million worth
of medicine to over 100, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: to over 700 families,
[SPEAKER_02]: 150 of those families were ones who worked
on ongoing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the question was, and I'm getting to
the point, I promise, what's the current
[SPEAKER_02]: state of medical cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that backstory is important to
understand actually how the statement I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: about to say is true because it's not one
that you can hear very often.
[SPEAKER_02]: From my perspective, medical cannabis is a
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for a lot of patients with conditions
that are treated with simple or easy
[SPEAKER_02]: treatments like flour, smoking flour,
medical cannabis is really good because we
[SPEAKER_02]: have a lot more access and legality than
we had before.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we get into catastrophic illness,
the illnesses that I'm used to working
[SPEAKER_02]: with that my son has, it is worse now than
it was in the mid-90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's harder now, it's more dangerous now,
as far as legal ramifications,
[SPEAKER_02]: than it was since before Prop 215 was
passed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think I'll let that hang there for a
while and talk about why that is as we
[SPEAKER_02]: move on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as of today, there's no legal way at
all for myself to get the medicine that
[SPEAKER_02]: silo suits, let alone the individual
medicine all these other children use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I think I'm gonna let that hang
there and we'll talk about why that's what
[SPEAKER_02]: it's all about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, as it was both in how Prop 214 was
implemented in the later.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to be sure that we really understand
what he just said, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulatory framework called
legalization in California, this is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the unintended side effects or
consequences of what legalization has
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the compassion programs of any sort
in California are facing the same
[SPEAKER_00]: predicament that Collabious Network is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really tragic about it is the
need for these preparations has not
[SPEAKER_00]: stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the opportunity to do so has become,
again, perilous in the legalization
[SPEAKER_00]: framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna stop and I would invite Dr.
Bannister now to share with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drug policy alliance is one of the
several nationwide advocacy groups.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's several of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like most of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marijuana policy project and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, I just got this from the drug
policy alliance in the mail and it says
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana is not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've seen gains, however, marijuana
arrests for possession increased to
[SPEAKER_01]: 600,000 in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one arrest every 53 seconds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 247 million people still live in states
where marijuana is not legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as Forrest was saying, access to this
is hugely difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: People have moved to Colorado from
Tennessee and all over the country so that
[SPEAKER_01]: their kids could get some CBD,
which is the predominant.
[SPEAKER_01]: One that has helped seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: One predominant one that's helped these
difficult seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we've gotten part of the way but
we're still in a huge mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, yeah, it's not good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what audience I was gonna
get to talk to today so maybe I'll find
[SPEAKER_01]: out as we go along.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's small but mighty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things I wanted to put out
is that I think cannabis is the future of
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine and I think there's ways to get
there and the ways are very important as
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing the ways that we're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not always working right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's working against Forrest and these
kids.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that wasn't the intention was to make
this more difficult but that's what it's
[SPEAKER_01]: doing in this situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: The way it becomes the future of medicine
is that cannabis is so extremely useful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been a doc for 46 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been every kind of doc, a ER doc and
a family practice doc and whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've treated most everything and I've
treated things with regular prescriptions
[SPEAKER_01]: and herbs and acupuncture and every damn
thing I could think of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found cannabis to be the most useful and
safe medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've ever used.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
