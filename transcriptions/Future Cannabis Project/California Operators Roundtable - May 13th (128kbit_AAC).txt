[SPEAKER_04]: I'd love to just start by going down the
line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, you guys change order in my
view.
[SPEAKER_04]: But starting with Chia, who in your mind
is your target demographic?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's the main product you sell to
them?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are the trends you're seeing in
terms of growth, decline, and whatnot?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I am a cannabis farmer up here in
Northern California, Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_05]: And primarily, my farm just produces
top-shelf flour for my own brand and for
[SPEAKER_05]: other brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so that's my priority.
[SPEAKER_05]: So flour consumers would be my number one
target audience at this moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, I do sell my biomass and my
shake to companies, manufacturers who turn
[SPEAKER_05]: that into various things.
[SPEAKER_05]: But my primary concern is having my flour
sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: What percentage of your harvest goes to or
I guess you said your shake.
[SPEAKER_04]: So all the flour you keep for your own
brand sales.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then how much shake is going out for
white label?
[SPEAKER_05]: I just did a calculation for last year's
harvest.
[SPEAKER_05]: We had about 30% of our income was from
shake from last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's a significant portion.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of interesting to see in the end
of 2019 and so far in 2020, the shake
[SPEAKER_05]: buyers have gone way down.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not getting thousands of inquiries
every day from shake buyers like I was in
[SPEAKER_05]: 2018-20.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beginning of 2019, I basically paid my
bills by selling shake.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really, I could have just turned my flour
into shake and sold it faster than I could
[SPEAKER_05]: have sold flour back then.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the times have turned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now I'm getting calls, multiple voicemails
every day from some random guy who works
[SPEAKER_05]: from some random company looking for
flour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Looking for flour to white label or flour
with Menda or Arcana Flour's brand on it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, so just to be clear, I operate
Mendocino Generations, which is a group of
[SPEAKER_05]: 50 farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of those farms have their own
brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of those farms sell their flour to
other brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: And me personally, I sell my flour,
probably 75% of my flour goes to other
[SPEAKER_05]: companies who put it in their own
branding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the other portion of my flour
goes into my brand, which is called Arcana
[SPEAKER_05]: Flour's.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, they're putting it into probably
some portion of pre-rolls, top shelf
[SPEAKER_05]: pre-rolls that are made, you know,
exclusively from flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: As well as putting it in their branded
jars and such.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chelsea, who's your target audience?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's your archetype?
[SPEAKER_06]: My demographic is definitely boomers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's interesting because it kind of
derived naturally out of how kind of my
[SPEAKER_06]: whole company brand started.
[SPEAKER_06]: My first product was just something I made
for my grandma.
[SPEAKER_06]: It kind of got this award and all of a
sudden the public knew about it and I had
[SPEAKER_06]: to create the business at that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like I was saying, the first product
being specifically designed for my
[SPEAKER_06]: grandma, who is a Jehovah's Witness,
very not cannabis friendly, especially
[SPEAKER_06]: just given her age or background.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that naturally derived kind of who
my target audience would be.
[SPEAKER_06]: And like right after we won our first
Emerald Cup, I remember the Sacramento Bee
[SPEAKER_06]: did a write up about us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, like it was in the print
version, buried in the pages, tiny little
[SPEAKER_06]: font.
[SPEAKER_06]: And yet, you know, 200 boomers,
probably busted out a magnifying glass to
[SPEAKER_06]: read my email address and just blew me up.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's kind of how we got started.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just serving our local Sacramento
community and taking it from there.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the way it links up to what we're
doing now with the delivery service is
[SPEAKER_06]: those 200 original customers, which,
you know, we're all older people,
[SPEAKER_06]: all people with pain.
[SPEAKER_06]: All people who were in the process of
getting kicked off their opiate regimens.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're kind of the customer base that I
still have a deep loyalty to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when COVID happened and it became
really unclear if people would be able to
[SPEAKER_06]: still have access, especially being an
older generation, more vulnerable,
[SPEAKER_06]: like maybe even going out to do curbside
isn't an option.
[SPEAKER_06]: I knew that I had to like quickly get a
delivery on board and to start making sure
[SPEAKER_06]: that they could get safe deliveries at
their homes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the delivery service I partnered with
offers contactless delivery.
[SPEAKER_06]: They got it approved through the BCC,
you know, emergency regulation style.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're able to, they're able to go
to my website that they're familiar with
[SPEAKER_06]: by my products and another other selected
products curated and get that delivered to
[SPEAKER_06]: their home with no contact with the
driver.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's, that's how we're working it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, Chelsea, we were talking yesterday
about compassion programs as well in
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that a part of what you, are you able
to utilize that and save some tax money
[SPEAKER_00]: and that type of stuff?
[SPEAKER_06]: So what I do is if I have or have any
inventory that's getting, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: within four months or so, of its COAs
expiration date, I just shift all of that
[SPEAKER_06]: inventory over to compassion programs.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we're in the process of doing that
right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're going to probably be putting out
about like 300 units of the deep skin into
[SPEAKER_06]: various compassion programs around the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing that there's a need?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just going to say, can you,
can you elaborate on the mechanics of,
[SPEAKER_04]: because compassion is recently back.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So can you explain like, when you say
we're going to give it like, who,
[SPEAKER_04]: who, who are you giving it to?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it an official nonprofit or?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no, just, just normal retailers.
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as they are prepared to deal with,
you know, the meticuli of properly
[SPEAKER_06]: documenting these transactions,
they can do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they don't have to pay taxes and you
don't have to pay taxes and the patient
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't have to pay taxes or what's the?
[SPEAKER_06]: Taxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I don't, I'm not an expert.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have someone who figures that part out
for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just trying to get people taken care
of.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like giving away products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Julie, I'm pretty sure that that was
recently amended, correct?
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to pay taxes on compassion
products.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can speak to that a little bit if you
want to.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we had some product that had expired.
[SPEAKER_05]: The testing, you know, the test expired
in, in last July and we were not sure what
[SPEAKER_05]: to do with this stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that time I was in contact with,
with a, a man who's called sweet leaf Joe
[SPEAKER_05]: and right.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he's been calling everybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, so I had, like started down this
pathway of trying to figure out how to,
[SPEAKER_05]: it was about six pounds of, of flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the tax rate is was at that point,
$148 per pound, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So in order for me to donate that six
pounds, I have to pay over $800 something
[SPEAKER_05]: in order to donate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It cannot be donated unless I pay that
tax.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've already lost six times,
whatever the pound price could have been
[SPEAKER_05]: plus trimming it, packaging it,
labeling it, testing it, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now I'm out somewhere around eight
grand just to try to donate some flour.
[SPEAKER_05]: And personally, as a farm, like I can't
really do it and I don't know what to do
[SPEAKER_05]: with it, but either way I have to pay for
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have to pay for it to get destroyed or I
have to pay for it to get donated.
[SPEAKER_05]: Kind of a tough one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you tried making any donations
recently?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So this is still in the process.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not totally sure what's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_05]: I, we're still kind of all figuring it
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause that's what I was under the
impression at the beginning that it was
[SPEAKER_05]: like, Oh, we're going to donate this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, we get to write it off.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, not really.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think over the next like month or so,
I shouldn't have an answer about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike, do you want to talk about your,
your target demographic with your
[SPEAKER_04]: solventless hash?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely Peter.
[SPEAKER_01]: More than, more than happy to.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both of our brands are, are targeting
the market at large.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to, you know, pigeonhole
ourselves at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We definitely are interested in the,
the over 65, the boomers.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really keen on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love what you were saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chelsea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love your brand, where you're going.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was so awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The passion is obviously there and your
trajectory is noble.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, those things are hard to
come by now in marijuana business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's awesome to hear and see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cali hash is definitely a, it's a,
it's a solventless hash brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's geared for the market at large.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're definitely keen on, you know,
the older people, the younger people,
[SPEAKER_01]: all the people more importantly,
our new brand, the hash, the hash lab line
[SPEAKER_01]: of products is going to be all solventless
based, therapeutic, holistic, non
[SPEAKER_01]: combustible products.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas tinctures mostly, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tinctures, sublinguals, topicals,
all of those things, but nothing
[SPEAKER_01]: combustible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nothing you're going to be smoking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really gearing towards the medicinal
side of the, of the industry and really
[SPEAKER_01]: making a stark contrast between a
lifestyle brand and a medicinal brand and
[SPEAKER_01]: what those two things are and why they're
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're very different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, as we evolve as a,
as an industry, the medicinal side is only
[SPEAKER_01]: going to grow in importance and volume and
all of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tamar, I wanted to ask you a quick
question now that I have you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love your company, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very expensive, but very amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, you work, you mentioned that the,
the volume is growing in, in some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller purchasing products.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, I didn't phrase that person.
[SPEAKER_01]: The lower price point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lower price point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that the race to the bottom of the weed
competition that's currently happening or?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look in the street,
there's a real feeling that there's a real
[SPEAKER_01]: race to the bottom when it comes to the
flower brands, just heading it out head to
[SPEAKER_01]: head.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all about who's got the most money to
withstand the most time and, and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really, it sucks.
Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to get your take on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so it's funny, it's funny that you say
that because actually I do agree that
[SPEAKER_03]: right now, one of the biggest indicators
of success at, is less on the demand side
[SPEAKER_03]: and more on the supply side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like who can just get product to
dispensary shelves better than anyone
[SPEAKER_03]: else.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the lower, you're definitely seeing
within the flower category.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I was pointing out in the slides
was specifically around the surge days,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: The, the days where people were stocking
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's when you saw a surge, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Along with those surge days in the lower
price point products, the under $20
[SPEAKER_03]: products, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which indicates that people were,
were stocking up right on, they wanted,
[SPEAKER_03]: they wanted more to stock up on,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They wanted more, more in their back
pocket at home, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: In case, you know, they ran out,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Also anticipating for potentially larger
or, you know, more consumption,
[SPEAKER_03]: which as I mentioned earlier, was
definitely the case with me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Overall, not within those specific surge
days, but overall, we're definitely seeing
[SPEAKER_03]: more of a race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I wouldn't quite yet call it a race to
the bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not Oregon, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or where Colorado is at either.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I think California on the flower
side still has the second highest price
[SPEAKER_03]: point out of all adult use markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nevada being higher, but, but you're
definitely seeing more value brands coming
[SPEAKER_03]: to market, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, Candessa and just launched bakers
and you know, we've seen an old pal,
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously taking a lot of share within the
manufactured goods.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think that you're seeing,
you're not seeing such a race to the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're not quite there yet,
but what is interesting within cannabis is
[SPEAKER_03]: right now, a lot of the pricing isn't so
much consumer driven.
[SPEAKER_03]: In fact, a lot of what's happening at
retail isn't really consumer driven.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we're not really at a point yet
where consumers are walking in a
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary saying, I want Cuba
blueberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the dispensary says, I don't have
Cuba blueberries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the consumer turns on and walks out,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, a lot of what's moving at
retail is primarily driven by the supply
[SPEAKER_03]: side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what you said, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like so much of what's moving is
just dependent on who's got the money to
[SPEAKER_03]: put it onto shelves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, not, not that consumers don't
really have an influence right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do, but we're not, not fully there
yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we still have a lot of brand
development to do as an industry in terms
[SPEAKER_03]: of, you know, not just brand awareness,
but also obviously brand loyalty.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, a lot of what moves at retail
is very much driven by a manufacturer's
[SPEAKER_03]: ability.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure all of you sitting on this
panel can fully relate to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Manufacturers ability to scale and get
products onto dispensary shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, as a manufacturer with my biggest
challenge to date is distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure you know about the distribution
industry in our, in our sector here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's, it's a shit show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard a thing or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I don't see it ever coming to
a stability.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably the last sector of our
industry that's going to stabilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, for the 15, 20% of growth,
you know, it's just not enough for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, it's, it's, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So until we get people that are managing
accounts properly, and right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: as a manufacturer, I have to go in and
manage the accounts myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is infuriating, you know,
because it's the last thing I want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be making products.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to ensure my prep brands, you know,
relevance and prevalence in the market,
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to go do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it is, it's frustrating.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wanted to ask you one quick question,
Tamar.
[SPEAKER_01]: In your opinion, how do we negate in the
flower side of things, what's happened in
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's happened in Oregon?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does California not go down that
route?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the elephant in the room of your
graph was all of the other states were
[SPEAKER_01]: trending downwards, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I sit, you're absolutely correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: California wasn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were absolutely the only one trending
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we maintain that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we not become Oregon or Washington?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'm going to turn off my video so we
don't get cut off again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we didn't, I didn't, I don't think I
showed a state by state view of price
[SPEAKER_03]: points.
[SPEAKER_03]: I may have.
[SPEAKER_01]: The graph I saw was just the three states
year by year trending up or down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Oregon, Washington, and I can't
remember, Colorado, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had the, well, anyway, I had a consumer
increase, but on the price point side
[SPEAKER_03]: though, you know, obviously a lot of that
has to do with supply and regulations,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So with Oregon specifically, you know,
it was a bit of a free for all market,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where, you know, and actually I'd be
interested to hear Chelsea and Chia speak
[SPEAKER_03]: to this, but specifically Chia.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we had, you know, in Oregon,
they were handing out cultivation
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses, like there was no tomorrow,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just ended up in a situation where
the market was flooded with supply and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, you know, it's also a good,
you know, great growing region,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: As is California, but, but, you know,
that, so, so the light licensing is a huge
[SPEAKER_03]: part and on the cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we throw taxes into the mix?
[SPEAKER_00]: What role they play?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then of course taxes, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So California has some of the highest
taxation out of all states, which in
[SPEAKER_03]: general is going to continue to impact
consumer purchasing, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, we saw with the launch
of adult use sales, flower, the flower
[SPEAKER_03]: category took the biggest hit,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's because with the launch of
adult use sales, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: In January of 2018 in California,
a lot of consumers, you know, the prop two
[SPEAKER_03]: 15, like long-time consumers, they were
like, you know, for a part, I'm not going
[SPEAKER_03]: to, you know, part of my French,
but like F this, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: $600 ounces.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and so, no, you know, this is
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know exactly where to find cannabis and
have never had a hard time finding it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so before a number that was really
interesting to me, you mentioned that
[SPEAKER_01]: California still has the highest price for
a program of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that, is that, is that a fact?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how are we in relevance to Washington
or Oregon say?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not the highest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, you know, I, I, I should have
actually included a slide for this and
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't, but, and I could look while we're
on the call.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll take me a second, but if I,
the information from BDS is amazing by the
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you're welcome also to hit me up
afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think if I remember correctly,
California's second and flower price to
[SPEAKER_03]: Nevada.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so, so, um, and I, and I believe
that's, I'm not sure if it's with or
[SPEAKER_03]: without tax, you know, I'm, I'm,
I'm tempted to say it's without tax,
[SPEAKER_03]: but I know Nevada has some of the highest
prices, um, by far.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, I think the, this is driven by
the tourist market of Vegas or tourism
[SPEAKER_03]: Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, uh, you know, I mean, in general,
highly tax market, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, uh, California because of,
I mean, I don't, we can get into why
[SPEAKER_03]: California is so highly taxed,
but I don't know that that's the purpose
[SPEAKER_03]: of this call.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm sure that you guys have heard it
eight ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you've heard it, you know,
you're, we've all exhausted that subject,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, um, and also you could probably touch
on it a lot better than I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, especially none of us make any money.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
Done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is it like?
[SPEAKER_03]: How much percent of your revenue?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a marginless business right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can, I can probably speak for everybody
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, as a craft producer,
a craft manufacturer, it's not a,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not a, it's not a profitable
enterprise.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just out there trying to maintain
your brand, keep relevant, keep in the
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're doing that, you're doing
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that's my opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all we're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: City of California is your most expensive
employee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just quickly, uh, Chia, you,
you had mentioned kind of, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: you as a supplier to other people,
uh, in terms of your trim and,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, even some of the flower, uh,
Mike, you, you're sourcing from farms,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, to make solventless extraction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Chelsea is Newell's based on solventless.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, I've actually had really good
relationships with suppliers and,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, and go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, I've actually had really good
relationships with suppliers and,
[SPEAKER_06]: uh, and, uh, luck with my suppliers.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I first started manufacturing in the
legal market, we were sourcing,
[SPEAKER_06]: um, ethanol extracted crude, cause we
mainly work in THCA and CBDA.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so we were sourcing ethanol extracted
crude that was made at the facility where
[SPEAKER_06]: we did our manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and they were getting their material
pretty much exclusively from like Southern
[SPEAKER_06]: Humboldt and Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so, you know, it was pretty decent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm a little bit jealous of you
Chelsea, because it sounds like you have
[SPEAKER_01]: an easier time than me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry to hear that, man.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the, what's funny is I've never used
the same source twice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause I'm always just shopping around.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, um, so yeah, so we had the,
we had the, we had the crude that they
[SPEAKER_06]: were making.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then, um, they, something about a fire
hazard, they wouldn't approve their
[SPEAKER_06]: extraction any longer because of something
about the way the building was put up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and so, so I had to go get it from
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_06]: I ended up getting from, uh, blessed
extracts the next time through.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, and then the most recent batch of
products I made, uh, blessed had run out
[SPEAKER_06]: of what I needed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I actually called up Shannon
Hatton.
[SPEAKER_06]: She took her flower over to a processor,
had it turned into crude and it was in my
[SPEAKER_06]: hands a week later.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could say all that beautiful
things like you just said, Chelsea,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have just horror stories.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been terrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's a little bit more challenging
as a solventless producer, because we
[SPEAKER_01]: really have to be so careful about where
we're sourcing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it is, you can't remediate.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no remediation.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't remediate rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't remediate.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't remediate any of this stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really, it's either clean 100% or
it ain't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we've had a rough time with
it, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're reduced to just finding it from
one specific lab downtown.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a 900 light facility that I know is
super clean and they are all the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: but up North, I've had a real hard time
with it because a lot of the ground is
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even a lot of these heritage farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I go back in the industry and I'm
like, I'm going back in the industry to
[SPEAKER_01]: the traditional side of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these three generation farms,
unfortunately, a lot of them are
[SPEAKER_01]: contaminated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've learned the hard way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've had to shut down 80% of my
Northern production because of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the biomass up there is much better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sungrown biomass makes much better
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Always.
[SPEAKER_01]: I abhor using lab grown biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hate it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you talking about chemicals or you're
talking about like heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_01]: more than anything, heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fucking heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lead.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your process?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your process when you go out North
for checking the cleanliness before you
[SPEAKER_00]: make a large sale?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: At first there was little process,
Tom, and I would just buy and then I would
[SPEAKER_01]: end up taking a loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have a really stringent process in
place.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't even trust COAs because a lot of
the times the biomass we're purchasing,
[SPEAKER_01]: the only COA I get, because the only
person by law that's required to do a COA
[SPEAKER_01]: on biomass is the last user of the
biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially I am getting COAs of the
flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times it can be indicative to
a point, but not truly indicative because
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm concentrating the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm not only concentrating the product,
but I'm concentrating the contaminants as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even if I didn't pass the threshold on
the flower or the biomass, there's a good
[SPEAKER_01]: chance I'll pass it once I concentrate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to be very careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the stuff I use now has to be
zero.
[SPEAKER_01]: And non-determined on everything,
on all 400 different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if there's even a little number there
on the COA list, I pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can you test in the field?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there things you can do to test?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a terrible process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even for the R&D side, for full panel,
I'm sure everybody here knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Down here in LA, it's 800 bucks.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know up there it's a bit cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: But down here, best case scenario,
600, 700, 800.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a week to wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a real pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a real pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm really limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish I could do what Chelsea does
more, because I do have a lot of contacts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And traditionally, that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would go where the best biomass was.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what led my process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's led by other factors,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the biggest one of them being is the
cleanliness.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say, unfortunately, on the other
side of it, now I recognize that we are
[SPEAKER_01]: consuming a lot of shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad that the other side of me is
thankful that I'm not smoking lead all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it matter to you if it's indoor,
a greenhouse outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: It does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I was saying before, when I say sun
grown, that's what I mean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the difference between anything that
was grown in a controlled environment
[SPEAKER_01]: using the sun, as opposed to using a
controlled environment as a lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now the lab stuff, and people are going to
disagree with me on this, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in my experience, what I'm looking for
in my concentrate is an incredible amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of incredibly oily, a long trichome,
a long cannabinoid molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you look under, if you take your
concentrates and you put them under a
[SPEAKER_01]: microscope, it's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll see exactly how all these
cannabinoids are connecting, and how their
[SPEAKER_01]: distillate looks different, and cold water
looks different, and CO2 extraction looks
[SPEAKER_01]: different, and butane looks different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all have their own little
differences.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whereas what I'm looking for is the
longest possible molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally speaking, when you're using
the sun, you're getting a much more
[SPEAKER_01]: developed trichome.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're using, doesn't matter what
system you're using indoors, it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: never going to be the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, you know, and we could argue
back and forth about this, but that's
[SPEAKER_01]: where I land on this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, and the market doesn't really
resemble that because the outdoor stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: even if it's very, very well maintained,
you know, these glass enclosed
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses, it's still cheaper than my
lab grown biomass down here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to pay upwards of $100 down here for
a unit, which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I mean, compared to what I used
to pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, a lot of challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer the sun grown.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish I could just go up north and shop
like I used to.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's a process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd love to talk to you, Chia,
about potentially getting some of your
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass though, now that I have you here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're making deals right on the webcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, if I could get, if I have
permission to contact you after this,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll reach out to Peter and we can maybe
link up and figure something out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm always looking for partners up north.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, we're expanding up north this
next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're very keen on solidifying some
supply lines up there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just quickly to take a little change of
pace, I want to bring Julie into the
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Julie, can you talk about what's top of
mind for you and your clients and what
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of fires you're putting out and
whether COVID-19 has created different
[SPEAKER_04]: fires or it's the same business as usual
fires.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the good doctor, Dr. Julie Crockett.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hi, good morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, my, I mean, it's interesting because
my target market is actual licensees and
[SPEAKER_07]: operators because I am a compliance
person.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so my whole reason for being is to
help people navigate through all of these
[SPEAKER_07]: systems and building their compliance
programs and dodging all the proverbial
[SPEAKER_07]: bullets of being a licensed operator in
this beautifully over-regulated system we
[SPEAKER_07]: have here in California.
[SPEAKER_07]: And yeah, the COVID was definitely,
I mean, I'm busier than usual now.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been a very interesting time for
operators, both with, I think,
[SPEAKER_07]: any time that you have to shift your
operations and take on new processes,
[SPEAKER_07]: especially during a crisis, kind of as
Chelsea was saying about like the delivery
[SPEAKER_07]: that she got paired up with is there's so
many people who just jumped to making
[SPEAKER_07]: curbside or jump deliveries or jump to
doing contact free delivery because it
[SPEAKER_07]: seemed logical that you would do that to
protect people without necessarily taking
[SPEAKER_07]: the steps of getting the right
authorizations to do it or documenting
[SPEAKER_07]: those processes or changing their SOPs or
training their staff on new protocols.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's kind of always the after the fact
stuff.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like I find that generally, except for
incredibly forward thinking operators who
[SPEAKER_07]: are really committed to compliance and the
gate, which isn't a lot necessarily
[SPEAKER_07]: because obviously you guys have different
concerns and you're just trying to survive
[SPEAKER_07]: and you're just trying to get on shelves
and you're trying to run your business.
[SPEAKER_07]: Usually compliance doesn't truly come into
it with any sense of earnestness until
[SPEAKER_07]: one, something goes wrong and then they're
like, oh my God, we have to make sure that
[SPEAKER_07]: we can dig ourselves out of this or you
get that notice to comply or you have to
[SPEAKER_07]: deal with a crisis.
[SPEAKER_07]: So a lot of times I'm brought into it
either in the midst of a crisis to try to
[SPEAKER_07]: unravel it and get folks out of it or in
the better case scenarios where it's kind
[SPEAKER_07]: of slow and steady from the gate and we
get to really lay the foundation.
[SPEAKER_07]: But kind of like anybody navigating their
business, I think one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_07]: challenges with compliance is kind of like
it's failure from the gate.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's so many things to comply with.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's gonna be shortcomings somewhere.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it does become a lot of prioritization
of what are the most important things that
[SPEAKER_07]: we're gonna or what's the most evident
thing that you're gonna possibly have
[SPEAKER_07]: enforcement upon or issues with so during
this time it's been a lot of even
[SPEAKER_07]: extending it out to safety protocols and
that employee training and SOPs and
[SPEAKER_07]: protecting people and even bringing in
aspects of HR and labor relations because
[SPEAKER_07]: there's a lot of businesses that have been
trying to navigate what are the impacts of
[SPEAKER_07]: the federal payroll protection on my
business if you have over a certain amount
[SPEAKER_07]: of employees or whatever your local
ordinances are and what is required of you
[SPEAKER_07]: in certain deadlines and the cannabis
industry is always under intense scrutiny
[SPEAKER_07]: period.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then now with the addition of being
deemed an essential business, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: amplified that scrutiny because it's a
really privileged position that also we
[SPEAKER_07]: don't wanna lose for the industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we start having a rash of people who
are getting sick or businesses that aren't
[SPEAKER_07]: being responsible, it's kind of that
aspect of we all need to do our part to
[SPEAKER_07]: support the industry to make sure that we
all get to maintain this with great power
[SPEAKER_07]: comes great responsibility and that part
of being an essential business at this
[SPEAKER_07]: time.
[SPEAKER_07]: But a lot of the main things that I focus
a lot of the shortcomings that I see with
[SPEAKER_07]: folks happens in primarily in areas of
documentation because when you're in the
[SPEAKER_07]: middle of a crisis, notifying the agencies
or documenting your processes or keeping
[SPEAKER_07]: your training logs up to date aren't
necessarily top of mind and that there are
[SPEAKER_07]: so many timelines and requirements built
into the regulations of if this happens,
[SPEAKER_07]: you're supposed to tell these people
within this amount of time and I think
[SPEAKER_07]: like I was saying, day-to-day that stuff
isn't really a big deal and you're not
[SPEAKER_07]: seeing a lot of enforcement on it but the
issues typically are when one thing goes
[SPEAKER_07]: wrong and then you get kind of that
magnifying glass put on your business that
[SPEAKER_07]: then the agency start discovering more and
more and more issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's that kind of where the Pandora's
box gets open once they kind of start
[SPEAKER_07]: digging in there and I definitely think
that operators should be preparing for the
[SPEAKER_07]: fact like we've been going through a lot
of these tumultuous times where there's a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of demands on the agencies themselves
where we're getting people temporary
[SPEAKER_07]: licenses, we're getting people provisional
licenses, we're trying to onboard these
[SPEAKER_07]: businesses and my scenario is always the
board on a Tuesday a couple years from now
[SPEAKER_07]: where the agencies aren't bringing in tons
of tax revenue or licensing fees and they
[SPEAKER_07]: really start to lean on levying penalties
and fines as a way to generate that state
[SPEAKER_07]: income and they have a huge amount of
breadth in terms of where they can choose
[SPEAKER_07]: to do that and how long they could do it
for.
[SPEAKER_07]: They have up to five years to turn around
and levy a penalty or fine so all of these
[SPEAKER_07]: friendly visits they've been having where
they come in and people are like it went
[SPEAKER_07]: great they were nice they didn't say
anything.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've started to see people start to get
notices to comply four to six months after
[SPEAKER_07]: that visit so they come and everything's
great and you think it went great and four
[SPEAKER_07]: months later they're like oh by the way
when we were there in January we noticed
[SPEAKER_07]: XYZ and you have 30 days to correct this
or you're gonna lose your license.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my you know we're all in this together
but I like to remind people like as
[SPEAKER_07]: friendly as they may seem these people are
not your friends and that you really have
[SPEAKER_07]: to be you know CYA is the word of the day
in terms of making sure and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_07]: way that we do that and we do cover your
assets is through documentation through
[SPEAKER_07]: training logs and through meetings you
know at least the basics of the regs.
[SPEAKER_04]: To get to I'd love to take these kind of
general ideas and get down to some
[SPEAKER_04]: concrete examples so does anyone CYA Mike
or Chelsea do any of you want to lie down
[SPEAKER_04]: on the doctor's couch and unburden your
souls about a compliance issue you're
[SPEAKER_04]: currently dealing with or even a question
you have?
[SPEAKER_05]: Not particularly myself no.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe we can throw the M word into the
discussion the dreaded metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah and is that another like auditing of
the you know is that another big shoe
[SPEAKER_00]: that's gonna drop on operators?
[SPEAKER_07]: For sure I mean I think we're definitely
starting to see the tightening of the
[SPEAKER_07]: metric screws as everyone knows you know
in May they shut down the ability to add a
[SPEAKER_07]: source with package so this seemingly
infinite grace period we had of that 30
[SPEAKER_07]: days to onboard your existing inventory
came to an abrupt end on May 1st where now
[SPEAKER_07]: every package has to have a source so the
state has decreed that anything that
[SPEAKER_07]: exists at this point is in the system and
if it's not then you're gonna have a much
[SPEAKER_07]: harder time putting it in the system at
this point you know obviously that came
[SPEAKER_07]: out with new guidance on the day of that
change in terms of how to do seeds and
[SPEAKER_07]: clones and tissue cultures and they got
the addition of a new little button and
[SPEAKER_07]: not the tremendously ridiculous workaround
that was previously there that you like
[SPEAKER_07]: called your cuttings trash and turn them
into packages so we did see you know that
[SPEAKER_07]: shift the next shift that's coming they
just released the notice for June that now
[SPEAKER_07]: all the testing results are going to be in
metric and products won't be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: proceed through the system if they don't
have in metric testing results attached to
[SPEAKER_07]: them so again that impacts some people's
old inventory and I think like I was
[SPEAKER_07]: saying there's all of these regulatory
notifications that are required where
[SPEAKER_07]: right now you haven't seen a lot of
enforcement about it you haven't seen a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of enforcement about you know report
not reporting if you have more than a 3%
[SPEAKER_07]: discrepancy in a 30-day period for example
or a 5% discrepancy if you're a
[SPEAKER_07]: manufacturer but we have to know that
metric is a gigantic data collection
[SPEAKER_07]: system that's being reported directly to
the state so as their analysts have more
[SPEAKER_07]: time to be able to look at that system you
will see people start getting close and
[SPEAKER_07]: people this is started already of seeing
something anomalous in your metric data
[SPEAKER_07]: but you will see people start to the
agencies paying more attention to what
[SPEAKER_07]: those discrepancies are in a system and
following up on that like I know operators
[SPEAKER_07]: in Oregon for example that if you do
something in your metric that's fishy
[SPEAKER_07]: you'll get a call in 24 hours from the
state saying hey we're looking at your
[SPEAKER_07]: metric we see something's weird like you
need to explain this to us so I think
[SPEAKER_07]: those screws are starting to ratchet down
in that kind of you know educational
[SPEAKER_07]: period we've all been in where this has
been real forgiving and people are still
[SPEAKER_07]: figuring this out is kind of winding down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry I have one more question for you
we've been talking a lot about the
[SPEAKER_00]: compassion programs especially in
California and how people want to utilize
[SPEAKER_00]: them but I'm wondering people won't
utilize them if they're if they're
[SPEAKER_00]: confused about how to integrate it into
metric is it clear how to do that do you
[SPEAKER_00]: know like how to take advantage of those
programs and not get in trouble doing so?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah I think I mean my understanding is
that it's a pretty it's not it's not a
[SPEAKER_07]: real graceful process in terms of that
there's a lot of limitation to the way
[SPEAKER_07]: that the bill was written so especially
some of the confusion comes from when a
[SPEAKER_07]: product in its life cycle has to be
designated as compassion so my
[SPEAKER_07]: understanding and I could be wrong because
I haven't dug into this so deep at that
[SPEAKER_07]: level is that you you can't midstream
suddenly decide that your product is
[SPEAKER_07]: compassion that that a lot of that
designation I think in the intent of the
[SPEAKER_07]: bill was that you're supposed to know from
the gate that a cultivator is supposed to
[SPEAKER_07]: be like great okay I'm gonna allocate 10%
of everything I'm making is gonna go to
[SPEAKER_07]: compassion now obviously that's ridiculous
and an operator should be able to
[SPEAKER_07]: designate at any time that they want to
donate that product and I think right now
[SPEAKER_07]: some of that is happening in case-by-case
basis where you're able to work with the
[SPEAKER_07]: agencies to get that product the
designation changed but to truly reap the
[SPEAKER_07]: tax benefits of that I think you have to
know way earlier down the supply chain
[SPEAKER_07]: what the intent is of that product but and
it's kind of like the old days if we all
[SPEAKER_07]: remember when they were composing the regs
and they were gonna have separate medical
[SPEAKER_07]: and adult use trails and they wanted you
to know from the gate well this I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: growing for medical and this I'm growing
for adult use and because we've kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: obliterated those lines in in California
it it's nonsensical at this point to try
[SPEAKER_07]: to preserve those we ran into that issue
with COVID as well where certain
[SPEAKER_07]: localities were considering only keeping
medical cannabis retailers open which
[SPEAKER_07]: which was insane because we're like you
destroyed medical cannabis you you
[SPEAKER_07]: obliterated it in this unification and
that's still I mean from a tax ranting
[SPEAKER_07]: perspective that's still I think one of
the one of like the highway robbery
[SPEAKER_07]: aspects of the regulations is when they
combine the medical and the adult use the
[SPEAKER_07]: fact that a 15% adult use excise tax was
applied to medical products is such an
[SPEAKER_07]: egregious ridiculous sin in my mind that
kind of something that I still hold that
[SPEAKER_07]: hope someday gets unraveled because it was
never in our medical program it was never
[SPEAKER_07]: the intent and that was an adult use tax
that shouldn't be applied to medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis hey Julie two things first of all
I love that you're an activist first and
[SPEAKER_01]: foremost that's fucking awesome you rock
two questions firstly what point along the
[SPEAKER_01]: supply chain will a biomass need to be
coa'd in these new regulations that you
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned is it gonna be much earlier on
because currently my understanding of the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation is that it's just the end the
end producer the end manufacturer of the
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass needs to see away that biomass is
that gonna change now with what you
[SPEAKER_07]: mentioned yeah no it's still it's still
when testing is required for it to move to
[SPEAKER_07]: so you'll see in the metric update they
went out there's a whole little grid of
[SPEAKER_07]: you know kind of fun system it's like our
own time machine we get to experience like
[SPEAKER_07]: late 80s technology every day
[SPEAKER_07]: so there are obviously any point in the
supply chain where you weren't required to
[SPEAKER_07]: have testing at that point so for a
cultivator moving you know raw mass out to
[SPEAKER_07]: a manufacturer that doesn't have to have a
test it's only where you would have had to
[SPEAKER_07]: have a final compliance test to move
through the system okay that's so great
[SPEAKER_01]: thank you for answering that I was already
getting worried um second thing I wanted
[SPEAKER_01]: to mention was I did get a visit from the
BCC roughly three months ago and we had
[SPEAKER_01]: exactly the same thing you said it was a
great meeting maybe one or two issues on
[SPEAKER_01]: the on the packaging of the labeling but
stuff we were amending no problem um
[SPEAKER_01]: should I expect something negative to
happen in the next two months I mean one
[SPEAKER_07]: of the things I mean one of the things I
would recommend after those visits is if
[SPEAKER_07]: there are things that they pointed out to
make sure that internally you're creating
[SPEAKER_07]: a corrective action plan you're
documenting that and you have that
[SPEAKER_07]: documentation of what went wrong how you
fixed it when you fixed it what you did
[SPEAKER_07]: because when you do get a notice to comply
and a notice to comply it's a very scary
[SPEAKER_07]: looking document a lot of people to
respond to it seriously it can be
[SPEAKER_07]: expensive because you want to bring in
your legal team to draft a letter to make
[SPEAKER_07]: sure that you know not attesting something
you don't want to say to the agencies but
[SPEAKER_07]: it will make that response if you do get
one so much easier if you already have all
[SPEAKER_07]: that documentation of yeah we fixed it and
here's how we fixed it and everything's
[SPEAKER_07]: fine so so I think that's I mean that's a
muscle that everyone is developing at this
[SPEAKER_07]: point is to get really comfortable with
the exposure and with the interactions
[SPEAKER_07]: with the agency to be able to show like
here's my process here's how I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: documenting it my logs are on point you
know and and that once you have kind of
[SPEAKER_07]: that documentation it really gives you
that sense of security and in same thing
[SPEAKER_07]: with how we use metric like I always
encourage everybody to blow up that notes
[SPEAKER_07]: field in metric when you're making
adjustments when you're making changes
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever you're saying because the whole
question is if the agencies ask you about
[SPEAKER_07]: something four months from now do you have
enough documentation on hand that you're
[SPEAKER_07]: going to be able to go oh yes of course I
know exactly what happened I you know
[SPEAKER_07]: destroyed that we have here's the wait
ticket or you know whatever it is that
[SPEAKER_07]: it's easy for you to have that recall and
have that documentation of you know pretty
[SPEAKER_07]: much just proving that you follow the
correct protocol and it sounds like you're
[SPEAKER_07]: saying that the state never forgets I
don't think I don't think they do I mean
[SPEAKER_07]: it's as in as in everything it's one of
the like I compare it a lot to like buying
[SPEAKER_07]: insurance like you pay for your insurance
all the time and most of the time
[SPEAKER_07]: hopefully you don't need it yeah you don't
you don't use it you don't end up in the
[SPEAKER_07]: hospital but it's that that you know
because the agencies have so much
[SPEAKER_07]: discretion and because we don't have
enough clear data yet on their enforcement
[SPEAKER_07]: priorities or their enforcement practices
it really is kind of like a needle in the
[SPEAKER_07]: haystack thing of like well maybe they're
gonna show up and have a huge problem with
[SPEAKER_07]: this one maybe they're not and we don't
really know in the in I think for the you
[SPEAKER_07]: know to keep operators from having ulcers
and anxiety attacks in an already
[SPEAKER_07]: challenging environment that's one of the
ways in which compliance can be really
[SPEAKER_07]: comforting to be like I got I know where
my binder is I can supply those those
[SPEAKER_07]: records and in and also not being like a
gerbil in a wheel like having a really
[SPEAKER_07]: clear sense of here's what the regulations
require of me I can check all of these
[SPEAKER_07]: boxes I can I know I have this
documentation that they asked for um and
[SPEAKER_07]: same thing and then you don't also don't
have like software companies trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: sell you bajillion dollar software for a
bunch of stuff you don't need because
[SPEAKER_07]: you're like here's my category this is
what I need covered and then you know once
[SPEAKER_07]: you kind of have that sense of security
that that you know your baseline is pretty
[SPEAKER_07]: good then then you get the kind of like
like Michael was saying like then you get
[SPEAKER_07]: into what you really want to be doing
which is like creating new products and
[SPEAKER_07]: thinking about how you make stuff and
finessing your processes rather than
[SPEAKER_07]: spending so much time just on these like
basics of is track and trace working and
[SPEAKER_05]: am I gonna get in trouble today Julie can
I ask you a question have you heard of I
[SPEAKER_05]: heard a rumor that CDF ARBCC was gonna do
a virtual inspections during this covert
[SPEAKER_05]: 19 time have you heard of anybody getting
one of those the only I haven't heard of
[SPEAKER_07]: anybody getting one on like an enforcement
visit yet but I have heard that they may
[SPEAKER_07]: do some of those for things like I mean
this is what they're doing in Vegas for
[SPEAKER_07]: example for onboarding of licenses or if
you're adding a distribution vehicle and
[SPEAKER_07]: they want to inspect it I've heard about
them using it for those kind of aspects
[SPEAKER_07]: like if there's something in the license
of the renewal that requires a inspection
[SPEAKER_07]: to look forward but I haven't personally
though I wouldn't put it past them heard
[SPEAKER_07]: of somebody having like hey we need to
come look at your facility so put us on
[SPEAKER_05]: FaceTime and walk us through you know how
that would work out you know for for me on
[SPEAKER_05]: a farm that would be really interesting
and hard hard to do I think yeah and I
[SPEAKER_05]: agree with you like I would way rather be
out there in the garden I have my hands in
[SPEAKER_05]: the dirt than on the fucking computer
pardon my French doing metric entry all
[SPEAKER_05]: the time like that's ice I do all that for
our farm and it's endless and it's really
[SPEAKER_05]: ridiculous and you know and when you were
saying on this on May 1st when everybody
[SPEAKER_05]: had to enter all that data to like the the
original source thing I was actually
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to just make a transfer from a
distributor to come to my farm and the
[SPEAKER_05]: system was so locked up because it's so
archaic that I could not get a transfer
[SPEAKER_05]: manifest finished that day because of the
fact that everybody was in the system
[SPEAKER_05]: trying to finalize all this stuff so it
was making business really difficult just
[SPEAKER_05]: for regular transaction to happen when the
van is literally like on its way here and
[SPEAKER_05]: I couldn't not get the system to work so
hopefully we move past that I don't have
[SPEAKER_05]: any big surges in that system like that
again but yeah it was a really challenging
[SPEAKER_04]: day just quickly Chia as our resident
plant tagging expert can you give an
[SPEAKER_04]: update kind of a state of the union on the
sensibleness or nonsensibleness like tell
[SPEAKER_04]: us what you have to do in relation to
tagging plants from clones to juveniles to
[SPEAKER_04]: dying plants to whatever and where you see
it going like what what are the
[SPEAKER_04]: conversations between cultivators and CDFA
in terms of moving in a more sensible fair
[SPEAKER_05]: direction like other crops yeah I'd be
happy to you know I think just to touch on
[SPEAKER_05]: what Julie was saying a moment ago about
documentation the way that I create a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of documentation in the metric system is I
call them you know I will email them or
[SPEAKER_05]: call them about little tiny minute things
and then they have to send you an email
[SPEAKER_05]: back that says yada yada do this that and
the other thing so that's the
[SPEAKER_05]: documentation and then I also do put a lot
of notes in the notes field to protect
[SPEAKER_05]: myself because like you said with so I
have a nursery and a cultivation license
[SPEAKER_05]: so there's a lot of you know little
nuances within the nursery side of things
[SPEAKER_05]: that are really challenging where I if I
want to make clones right before I had to
[SPEAKER_05]: call them waste from a plant then I had to
go in and create an item then I had to go
[SPEAKER_05]: create clones from this nothingness
basically it was very weird like seven
[SPEAKER_05]: steps to get to creating clones and then
you know you can clone you can tag one
[SPEAKER_05]: tray of say up to a hundred clones well
the thing that's challenging in that is
[SPEAKER_05]: that there's a lot of stuff to pay
attention to you know you have damping off
[SPEAKER_05]: you have you know things die things don't
root whatever and that in that process but
[SPEAKER_05]: then moving them through the system gets
even more challenging because obviously
[SPEAKER_05]: you're not going to put a metric tag
around this tiny little stem and like clog
[SPEAKER_05]: up your tray with all this stuff you have
one tag on the tray well as soon as you
[SPEAKER_05]: move them into you can transplant them
into dirt then like you don't have to put
[SPEAKER_05]: a tag on it and I started doing that in
the beginning because why do extra work if
[SPEAKER_05]: you don't have to well the problem is as
you move those plants around and you put
[SPEAKER_05]: them somewhere in the greenhouse and then
you you know things get confusing they get
[SPEAKER_05]: lost really easily and like what is this
batch attached to that and you know
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a lot of tagging going on so I
spent a lot of time creating spreadsheets
[SPEAKER_05]: of tags of my own tagging system that
matches up to the metric tagging system so
[SPEAKER_05]: that I know that this thing is related to
that number and it's insane amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: waste waste of time basically and then on
another note so I have my cultivation and
[SPEAKER_05]: I have my nursery if I want to move plants
from my nursery which is literally one
[SPEAKER_05]: foot away from my cultivation on my own
farm I have to have a distributor on site
[SPEAKER_05]: come to my farm to move the plants which
they don't actually touch them they just
[SPEAKER_05]: have to be here to sign the paper that
says that that happened otherwise I have
[SPEAKER_05]: to have my own distribution license which
I don't I can't afford that I don't want
[SPEAKER_05]: that I don't want a vehicle I don't want
to have to pay extra taxes I don't want to
[SPEAKER_05]: deal with all that bullshit so I have to
find a distributor and and make that
[SPEAKER_05]: happen like within a you know convenient
time frame that like today for instance I
[SPEAKER_05]: have a distributor coming here right after
this call that is going to pick up the
[SPEAKER_05]: last of my cannabis from 2019 so I'm
thinking okay well how can I utilize the
[SPEAKER_05]: fact that that distributor is going to be
on site at this time well maybe I should
[SPEAKER_05]: figure out real fast which plants I need
to move from my nursery to my cultivation
[SPEAKER_05]: and make an extra transfer document and
have them do that on site so things like
[SPEAKER_04]: that are just completely waste of time
just for clarification Chia are the
[SPEAKER_04]: nursery and the cultivation the same
corporate entity are they two different so
[SPEAKER_07]: it's the same company yeah kind of like
she is saying I mean there's so many
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivators that ran into an issue too of
just that how those licenses interact
[SPEAKER_07]: where you know they may be they may have
gotten multiple you know small licenses
[SPEAKER_07]: thinking okay I can have a bigger
footprint if I get all of these different
[SPEAKER_07]: small licenses but they failed to get a
nursery license and a processing license
[SPEAKER_07]: so then you're in a horrible pickle where
you can't have the immature area from one
[SPEAKER_07]: license serving up another license without
that nursery license and you can't be
[SPEAKER_07]: processing all of that cannabis in the
same space if you don't have a processing
[SPEAKER_07]: license so you'd have you know people who
already went through the whole licensing
[SPEAKER_07]: process and then realize that it doesn't
it doesn't work you know in terms of how
[SPEAKER_07]: you're lining up that system and having to
go back and either you get those
[SPEAKER_07]: additional licenses which is its own you
know very difficult process or having to
[SPEAKER_07]: process individually each of you know
premises and feed them from their own
[SPEAKER_07]: immature plant area which is also a
ridiculous and terrible solution and not
[SPEAKER_05]: to mention you know like all the the
accounting and the you know the time and
[SPEAKER_05]: the hours that it takes to if you had all
those licenses one person is going to have
[SPEAKER_05]: to track all those transactions through
the whole system in your own system it
[SPEAKER_05]: takes so much time to to manage all that
you know my husband is the is the
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivator he does all the the farming
really i mean i make it look pretty and
[SPEAKER_05]: and do all the metric stuff out there but
you know like there is no way no way even
[SPEAKER_05]: a 2500 square foot that those cottage
cultivators can do this on their own back
[SPEAKER_05]: in the day was one farmer did his whole
thing he did it from start to finish on
[SPEAKER_05]: his own that was it right maybe he'd bring
in some people here and there to do the
[SPEAKER_05]: harvesting whatever these days you know i
have to be 100 i am the accountant i am
[SPEAKER_05]: the metric person i do all the sales i do
all the collections i do all the bank you
[SPEAKER_05]: know everything myself and i barely even
get out into the garden and when i do you
[SPEAKER_05]: know it's wonderful it feels good but you
know it's super frustrating and you know
[SPEAKER_05]: on the cultivation side like we have we've
been doing this uh this is our 22nd season
[SPEAKER_05]: of cultivating here on my farm or well 19
on this farm um and you know we've we've
[SPEAKER_05]: seen it all we went through like you know
growing up i went through the reagan era
[SPEAKER_05]: of like hiding under the trees of the
helicopters everywhere you know we've done
[SPEAKER_05]: all that cultivated literally in platforms
and trees and hid stuff in the bushes and
[SPEAKER_05]: on the side of the hill in order to have
this lifestyle and as soon as there was a
[SPEAKER_05]: pathway to move into legalization we took
it every single step of the way and i've
[SPEAKER_05]: seen it all we've done everything we've
complied with everything possible in order
[SPEAKER_05]: to you know live this culture and this is
our lifestyle cannabis is my life it's
[SPEAKER_05]: been that way forever i want to continue
doing this i want to pay taxes i want to
[SPEAKER_05]: be recognized i want to be in the legal
market but it's so difficult and it's so
[SPEAKER_05]: challenging and it's so stressful that
there are days me and my husband turned to
[SPEAKER_05]: each other and we were like can we move to
a freaking tropical island tomorrow like i
[SPEAKER_05]: don't want to do this anymore and it's
because of all these little things that
[SPEAKER_05]: we're talking about that are so ridiculous
and over you know just over regulated
[SPEAKER_05]: there's way too much stuff that needs to
happen and i understand like let's try to
[SPEAKER_05]: keep stuff out of the black market sure
like that's that's the point of the metric
[SPEAKER_05]: system right ultimately um you know
there's a lot of workarounds i see a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of people doing really weird stuff asking
strange questions on this you know like
[SPEAKER_05]: mendocana action peter you were asking
about that this is a forum that we have on
[SPEAKER_05]: facebook where a lot of people in
mendocino county and beyond go on to ask
[SPEAKER_05]: advice and share information and all that
and network and you know nobody really
[SPEAKER_05]: knows what to do and how to do it we're
all just trying to help each other through
[SPEAKER_05]: it and you could call a thousand times and
you'd get a different answer every time
[SPEAKER_05]: from somebody at metric or you know you
call bcc and nobody has an answer for you
[SPEAKER_05]: you call cdfa because like for instance i
got a letter saying from uh cdfa saying
[SPEAKER_05]: that metric um gosh i can't remember
exactly what it was at this moment but
[SPEAKER_05]: that that i needed to do something in the
in the metric system so i call metric to
[SPEAKER_05]: ask them how to do it they say we don't
even know what you're talking about who
[SPEAKER_05]: sent you that letter cdfa sent it to me so
call them okay so i call them they say we
[SPEAKER_05]: never sent that to you like what am i
supposed to do here you know i'm trying
[SPEAKER_05]: i'm just like backpedaling all the time to
try to keep up with what i'm supposed to
[SPEAKER_05]: be doing in the meantime i could be
spending that time money and effort like
[SPEAKER_05]: making my brand better getting more
contacts and dispensaries like you know
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a million other things i could do
with my time so long story i have a
[SPEAKER_00]: question how how do you manage this these
challenges and this pain across the 50
[SPEAKER_05]: farms under mendicine yeah so mendicino
generations is an alliance of about 50
[SPEAKER_05]: farms we we have fluctuated over the years
we started in 2015 out of basically
[SPEAKER_05]: desperation of like how are we as heritage
cultivators gonna survive this tsunami
[SPEAKER_05]: that's coming we know that's coming so we
align together to try to figure out ways
[SPEAKER_05]: to support each other like you know
everybody says we're all in this together
[SPEAKER_05]: so um i live in a back to the land um
hippie commune basically um and i have a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple neighbors who are also about the
same age as age group as me and my husband
[SPEAKER_05]: and and they wanted to kind of move
forward in legalization as well and they
[SPEAKER_05]: saw us sort of paving the way um locally
we had you know we got like the 12th
[SPEAKER_05]: permit in mendicino county we we always
kind of got right in the front of the line
[SPEAKER_05]: for things and so folks were like asking
my advice and trying to to get help moving
[SPEAKER_05]: down that road and and you know there's a
lot of um folks who were in that older age
[SPEAKER_05]: bracket in our group in the very beginning
that they were on the verge of retirement
[SPEAKER_05]: but they'd been cultivating for 40 45 50
years some of them um and they're teaching
[SPEAKER_05]: their children to do it and and so the
next generation is coming up but these
[SPEAKER_05]: this older generation sort of decided and
realized as things started moving forward
[SPEAKER_05]: that they couldn't do this and they did
not want to and they backed out so our
[SPEAKER_05]: group has sort of changed in numbers over
the years but um here we are with
[SPEAKER_05]: somewhere around 50 farms and and those
farms you know they're on their own
[SPEAKER_05]: they're they're individual we're not
necessarily always um pushing and
[SPEAKER_05]: promoting we've tried different things
like we tried putting different farms
[SPEAKER_05]: flower in one brand as the mendicino
generations brand that turned out to be
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of a nightmare on a lot of different
levels it's hard to keep track of those
[SPEAKER_05]: things um but really we ultimately are
pushing and helping um you know get the
[SPEAKER_05]: sales going for people helping them find
good contacts reliable manufacturers and
[SPEAKER_05]: distributors um all the time and promoting
that sun-grown sun-grown flower um so does
[SPEAKER_05]: that answer your question
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah it's it's been a challenge you know
people are trying to move forward and i
[SPEAKER_05]: think people really really want to do this
and they're standing in line down at
[SPEAKER_05]: planning and building and in mendicino
county trying to get you know their
[SPEAKER_05]: buildings permitted and their things in
line so they can actually get a license
[SPEAKER_05]: and get a permit and that's not happening
it's really not happening we had a surge
[SPEAKER_05]: in the beginning we have somewhere around
250 some odd lice or permits in mendicino
[SPEAKER_05]: county and that number has pretty much
just stayed you know for the last two
[SPEAKER_05]: years we haven't really seen new people
getting permitted um but yet they're
[SPEAKER_05]: getting that state license they're jumping
ahead and getting the state license
[SPEAKER_05]: because they've got like preliminary
approval from the county and the county is
[SPEAKER_05]: just so far behind they cannot possibly um
you know right now they're closed down i
[SPEAKER_05]: can't get an answer um and i have
deadlines that are coming up for myself
[SPEAKER_05]: for permits and licenses um on various
things so and you also mentioned earlier
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're seeing a rise in um in busts
in uh of cultivators um and julia and
[SPEAKER_00]: these are also these are people who are
trying to transition into the legal market
[SPEAKER_00]: but haven't been successful yet uh and i'm
wondering julia are you are you seeing any
[SPEAKER_00]: of that with people that are trying to
move in but the process has stalled or
[SPEAKER_00]: slowed down for them and then the hammer
comes down on them um well i mean i'm down
[SPEAKER_07]: here in la so the whole thing is a stalled
process down here of uh you know trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: get the next phase open um and you know
you certainly know i mean anecdotally i
[SPEAKER_07]: know people who have been waiting a very
very long time trying to come into the
[SPEAKER_07]: licensed market and you know expressing
frustration and and i mean and and the
[SPEAKER_07]: thing that's heartbreaking is like
especially down here is is a kind of ease
[SPEAKER_07]: of you know there is a there's a draw and
appeal to the illicit market because it's
[SPEAKER_07]: so much easier in so many ways you can't
wait for doing that especially with
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivation like yeah the people you know
the heartbreak and the promise of what
[SPEAKER_07]: prop 64 was supposed to be is supposed to
mean um both as that kind of legitimacy of
[SPEAKER_07]: decriminalization and as a social justice
bill like just the whole thing has been
[SPEAKER_07]: heartbreak after heartbreak of it not
really panning out that way um and even
[SPEAKER_07]: the protections of smaller farmers you
know all of it that we thought was you
[SPEAKER_07]: know what many people thought they were
going to get out of that bill and um and
[SPEAKER_07]: in some ways too like the i don't know
what the right word is impotent and
[SPEAKER_07]: misguided you know enforcement efforts in
some way or just on like the historical
[SPEAKER_07]: blindness that um prohibition has never
worked it's never worked it's never been a
[SPEAKER_07]: thing and i do hold out like a um a
childlike and naive perhaps uh feeling
[SPEAKER_07]: that i i believe that in you know maybe 10
years or something i do think eventually
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis will be no different than almonds
or lettuce or anything else like i think
[SPEAKER_07]: that i think that we'll get there and the
the reminder for the people who are going
[SPEAKER_07]: through that process right now and who are
doing the licensing is that you know we
[SPEAKER_07]: are on the front lines of combating so
much uh uh prejudice and stigma and
[SPEAKER_07]: prohibition and and fear in the minds of
regulators who you know these are the same
[SPEAKER_07]: people who who you know in their mind put
cannabis as a schedule one on par with all
[SPEAKER_07]: others who think like this is a huge
social ill and realizing like where the
[SPEAKER_07]: enforcers are coming from and the training
and indoctrination that they've received
[SPEAKER_07]: of you know thinking that we're going to
take any opportunity in the licensed
[SPEAKER_07]: industry to divert to the illicit market
where you know where those of us who are
[SPEAKER_07]: operating know like you're not you're not
going to divert out of metric like
[SPEAKER_07]: nobody's going to put anything in metric
that they're then going to try to divert
[SPEAKER_07]: that track like nobody nobody nobody would
even get a license who really has you know
[SPEAKER_07]: a heartfelt intent to function on the
illicit market um and in that like how
[SPEAKER_07]: hard it is to try to do it right at all um
and and how little help uh the industry is
[SPEAKER_07]: getting so far you know in terms of the
fact and especially even right now again
[SPEAKER_07]: back to covid it's a very difficult time
because because the um public narrative of
[SPEAKER_07]: this time since being deemed essential is
like well cannabis is booming and
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody's doing great it's been very
difficult to get any sense of uh of relief
[SPEAKER_07]: from the agencies during this time for you
know people you know here we are in our
[SPEAKER_07]: like um chia was saying where people have
license renewals and local offices are
[SPEAKER_07]: closed and it's difficult to move these
processes along and the state's
[SPEAKER_07]: perspective is like you're doing great so
yeah on track pay your licensing fee let's
[SPEAKER_07]: do it and there's no um grace period
there's no extension of deadlines there's
[SPEAKER_07]: no uh tax relief and then even from a
legislative perspective of all of these
[SPEAKER_07]: you know things that we were still trying
to push it push along because
[SPEAKER_07]: legislatively we know like last year
there's still no trade samples like our
[SPEAKER_07]: trade samples bill failed there's no tax
relief or reform and and there's not going
[SPEAKER_07]: to be because now every single bill at the
legislative level is put on hold unless it
[SPEAKER_07]: directly relates to covid but then it's
also restructuring that narrative because
[SPEAKER_07]: then like tomorrow you know you look at
the cannabis industry and here we are
[SPEAKER_07]: we're surviving we're creating jobs people
are still working maybe you should support
[SPEAKER_07]: us like maybe maybe maybe we're doing a
good thing for the state at this moment um
[SPEAKER_07]: so i mean it's it's just so that's revenue
yeah and then yeah like here we're still
[SPEAKER_07]: bringing in the taxes we're doing it oh
and it's just so heartbreaking because
[SPEAKER_07]: we're like we're like the um we're like
like the abused uh child that just can
[SPEAKER_07]: never like impress their parents and us
just like look at us we're trying and and
[SPEAKER_07]: we just keep uh showing up you know to to
try to um you know to try to help people
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's so it's so absurd and i and i
like to like jump forward and look back on
[SPEAKER_07]: it from like a future historical
perspective where it's like they will
[SPEAKER_04]: laugh about this yeah the shit show that
is uh california regulated california
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis so just quickly we're we're on
the uh we're on the home stretch and i
[SPEAKER_04]: want to give people an opportunity to draw
attention to something that they think the
[SPEAKER_04]: california cannabis community should pay
attention to so chia i want to start with
[SPEAKER_04]: you uh can you talk about some raids and
busts that have been going on recently in
[SPEAKER_05]: your neck of the woods okay so yeah so
meanwhile those departments are still
[SPEAKER_05]: active right those guys are still busting
people and some things are for good reason
[SPEAKER_05]: there's some interesting things going on
in up in our area in the colvillo area
[SPEAKER_05]: there was recently a very large bust that
they had been trying to bust for a while
[SPEAKER_05]: they didn't really quite have a reason to
um or you know just hadn't got it started
[SPEAKER_05]: and there was a missing persons report
turns out it's tied to this big bust that
[SPEAKER_05]: just happened there um and you know these
are illegal operators and you know they
[SPEAKER_05]: they even some of the colvillo residents
have remarked lately that that operation
[SPEAKER_05]: has cleaned up the neighborhood because
it's very tight and and nice looking it
[SPEAKER_05]: looks like a legal operation from the
outside um and you know then we have these
[SPEAKER_05]: other folks for instance in humboldt
recently where there has been some oh
[SPEAKER_05]: there you go yeah peter's got it up there
um so there's been some busts recently um
[SPEAKER_05]: in humboldt county and northern mendocino
county where some of these people have
[SPEAKER_05]: been trying to get licensed they have been
in line they put in an application they
[SPEAKER_05]: have like done the things that they need
to do and for some reason they can't move
[SPEAKER_05]: forward maybe it's they can't move past um
the department of fish and wildlife maybe
[SPEAKER_05]: they are not able to get that piece of the
puzzle finalized um i have a neighbor for
[SPEAKER_05]: instance who has been waiting for his
local permit for two years there is zero
[SPEAKER_05]: reason he should not be getting that um
it's just that they have over 2000
[SPEAKER_05]: applications sitting on their desk they've
approved 250 of them they've denied about
[SPEAKER_05]: the same amount what's going on with the
rest of that stack and in the meantime
[SPEAKER_05]: those people are obviously going to keep
cultivating because that's how they pay
[SPEAKER_05]: their bills that's how they live they're
not going to go get a job especially not
[SPEAKER_05]: right now and you know so then you have
the helicopters flying around they're
[SPEAKER_05]: still busting people they're still drawing
maps with circles on them saying you know
[SPEAKER_05]: these are the targets we're going to hit
this summer and those people are you know
[SPEAKER_05]: they're family folk they they've been
trying they've been doing this forever
[SPEAKER_05]: they would like to be in the system they
would like to pay taxes you know they want
[SPEAKER_05]: to do that but yet they cannot um and so
those bus have been happening and and
[SPEAKER_05]: that's pretty frustrating for somebody
like me who is regulated and and licensed
[SPEAKER_05]: to watch my friends and neighbors get in
trouble for something that i almost feel
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like you know when there was the
fires and your house survives and your and
[SPEAKER_05]: your neighbors burns down you have
survivor's guilt it's kind of the same
[SPEAKER_05]: thing i feel bad for those people they've
been trying they they want to do it so
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah so there's some of that going on
peter um i don't know too much detail and
[SPEAKER_05]: i don't know i haven't um had any personal
friends necessarily get busted in this
[SPEAKER_05]: year but um you know i'm sure that that's
going to happen unfortunately hopefully
[SPEAKER_05]: they'll leave the little guys alone and go
for these more large egregious things
[SPEAKER_05]: especially ones that are on you know
forest land and and public lands and
[SPEAKER_04]: things like that like they used to do mike
anything top of mind for you down here in
[SPEAKER_04]: the the la world well hold on wait let me
unmute you okay and mike and mike you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: you're someone who uh in in the midst of
all of this is actually launching a new
[SPEAKER_01]: product so talk about that so not only is
it a challenge to launch a new brand a new
[SPEAKER_01]: product line which we're doing but
expanding cali hash has been a challenge
[SPEAKER_01]: as well the only way we've been able to
expand traditionally is by getting out
[SPEAKER_01]: there to the dispensaries face you know
facetime and obviously that's been
[SPEAKER_01]: impossible um so it's really been a
challenge um so yeah launching the hash
[SPEAKER_01]: lab is we haven't launched the product yet
uh we're probably three weeks out and no
[SPEAKER_04]: and no trade samples either right no trade
samples yet and uh but the minute that uh
[SPEAKER_01]: that we are you know we're gonna it's
gonna be a a much less aggressive rollout
[SPEAKER_01]: you know whereas traditionally we would
have approached all 50 retailers that i
[SPEAKER_01]: currently have product in now i'm gonna
target 10 to 15 and and roll it out a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit uh more trunched a little bit
more at pace um but that's just you know
[SPEAKER_01]: just being cautious we're also moving
facilities so you know there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: internal reasons for that as well um but
for us we're such a small guy i mean we
[SPEAKER_01]: are like the definition of small in every
way i never took investment from anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: the way we got to where we are today is by
partnering with like-minded people from
[SPEAKER_01]: the traditional space you know i'm not
part of the new wave of marijuana thank
[SPEAKER_01]: god and um so and it's actually played to
our advantage right now not only did the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer recognize us as being heritage
authentic but now we're picking up the
[SPEAKER_01]: pieces from a lot of these uh these guys i
mean i'll give you the perfect example
[SPEAKER_01]: from my point of view a year ago i
couldn't find a lab space for less than 12
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars a square foot now i have over 250
000 square feet available downtown for
[SPEAKER_01]: roughly between two and three dollars i
mean so it's like it's a vastly different
[SPEAKER_01]: market than it was six months ago and i'm
sure even um everybody here in chia
[SPEAKER_01]: especially can appreciate that you know
you to survive in this in this industry
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to be so nimble so lean and
nimble is the phrase i like to use a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: and um and a lot of these big guys don't
have that ability i mean they're just
[SPEAKER_01]: hemorrhaging capital i mean med man you
know uh even candescent was mentioned
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier i mean if you look at their
balance that they're at their books you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's it's a murder scene you know i
mean i've never seen so much red in my
[SPEAKER_01]: life so you know in the end of the day you
know who's gonna be there in the long run
[SPEAKER_01]: i don't know if anybody's guess at this
point but what i do know is that when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're operating an entity with zero debt
and you have you know market share and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have customer loyalty you know i think
you're in a better position than maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: some of these bigger guys that might have
more market share but they have incredible
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of debt they're answering to
investors from wall street investors from
[SPEAKER_01]: god knows where else and the plug can be
pulled at any time and they're beholden to
[SPEAKER_01]: the capital markets which are all going to
dry up in the next year which already are
[SPEAKER_01]: drying up so you know i think all of us
are positioned much better than those guys
[SPEAKER_01]: right now so i think i want to leave it on
that note the little guy is king right now
[SPEAKER_04]: and you know and long live the little guy
and so if people are watching and are
[SPEAKER_04]: about to go into their dispensary should
they support the little guy please support
[SPEAKER_01]: the little guy we just launched our
prequel line and that's how we actually
[SPEAKER_01]: are expanding in this environment it's by
launching other product categories under
[SPEAKER_01]: our current brands launching a whole new
brand is going to be challenging i don't
[SPEAKER_01]: deny that but the way we're surviving
right now like for example we just
[SPEAKER_01]: expanded our product category to include
pre-rolls so we're now we have infused
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-rolls and i don't know tam are you
still around i can't see you on my videos
[SPEAKER_01]: but the bds analytics numbers that i just
that i use that i most frequently cite are
[SPEAKER_01]: two percent of the general market is cold
water extract 30 something percent of the
[SPEAKER_01]: general market is pre-rolls or whatever 10
percent was it in our last graph whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: it is but the point is it's a much bigger
portion of the market you know kelly hash
[SPEAKER_01]: was very specialized in the beginning so
we had a very very limited market and so
[SPEAKER_01]: the way we hope to grow hope to survive
hope to expand going forward is by using
[SPEAKER_01]: that loyalty to our advantage using our
customer base to our advantage and slowly
[SPEAKER_01]: developing new product lines and new
categories that that our people appreciate
[SPEAKER_01]: and again our our branding is all about
cleanliness all about solvent less um so
[SPEAKER_01]: we're hoping that resonates with the
consumers and our tincture of our new
[SPEAKER_01]: brand tastes amazing i know tam was
talking about taste earlier so i'm very
[SPEAKER_01]: excited to hear about that because all the
vast majority of tinctures out there taste
[SPEAKER_01]: a little funky so we're really happy it's
not flavored it tastes like it's all all
[SPEAKER_01]: that's in it ingredient wise is hash and
mct oil and you know and specific curing
[SPEAKER_01]: methods to get different formulas you know
there's some more nuance to it than just
[SPEAKER_01]: that but essentially that's it so you're
the flavor profile you're getting are very
[SPEAKER_01]: benign they're very soft creamy almost
you're getting a lot of the hashing the
[SPEAKER_01]: pepper you know those those terpenes
you're not getting any alcohol obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's only mct oil you're not
getting any uh any additive flavorings no
[SPEAKER_01]: weird fucking artificial you know
strawberry or whatever people are at so
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah so we're really happy you know pina
colada yeah you know and teach their own
[SPEAKER_01]: but uh you know we really i'm a big
believer in authenticity purist you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and really just not complicating things
you know minimal amount of ingredients
[SPEAKER_01]: simplicity keep it simple kiss and you
know hopefully that works chelsea how
[SPEAKER_04]: about you uh are you uh launching are you
guys do you have any new products in the
[SPEAKER_04]: in the works and uh can you talk about
your you guys are small do you have
[SPEAKER_06]: outside investors uh um i don't want to
talk too much about the funding thing um
[SPEAKER_06]: that's getting a little into the weeds uh
but um we just definitely are launching
[SPEAKER_06]: new products um i had done uh a one-off
test batch of a bath soak back in like
[SPEAKER_06]: november uh we entered that into the
emerald cup and it won in the cv category
[SPEAKER_06]: and we'd so we've just finally done like a
full-size production batch for the market
[SPEAKER_06]: of that um and that started going out to
stores like three-ish no about a month ago
[SPEAKER_06]: actually um and that was that's what it's
been complicated with covid that i think
[SPEAKER_06]: there are a whole six weeks or so where we
didn't sell anything um because our
[SPEAKER_06]: salespeople were all not able to do any
face-to-face time um there was a couple
[SPEAKER_06]: weeks where i called around to talk to uh
buyers and they were they were in
[SPEAKER_06]: quarantine i guess they thought that they
had had exposure um and so they were
[SPEAKER_06]: isolating for two weeks and not involved
in the operation and even stores that were
[SPEAKER_06]: doing a steady throughput just not being
able to have that in-store experience has
[SPEAKER_06]: really impacted sales but um just quickly
is that the bath bomb uh yeah so that was
[SPEAKER_06]: the original uh the first run packaging
it's a little bit different now but uh
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah that's the bath soak is it a ball
chelsea no no no it's a it's a salt so
[SPEAKER_06]: it's a epsom salt pink himalayan blend um
yeah i should probably put like that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: great product for now we have some
retailers down here and i'd be more than
[SPEAKER_01]: happy to uh put a word in for you chelsea
i've got some great relationships down
[SPEAKER_01]: here and i can get stuff on their shelves
just with a phone call so yeah that would
[SPEAKER_01]: be amazing after this and we'll we'll sort
it out for sure okay i really appreciate
[SPEAKER_01]: that yeah that'd be great i love your
products i love you you're awesome thanks
[SPEAKER_06]: um so we're also we're planning over the
next like six months to drop a a massage
[SPEAKER_06]: oil that is a variation on our original
formula but just instead of being designed
[SPEAKER_06]: to absorb super fast it's designed to do
the opposite to stay in place on the skin
[SPEAKER_06]: for a long duration so the actual massage
can occur um and then we're getting into
[SPEAKER_06]: so part of that fun thing thing it's taken
care of it comes with a partner partner
[SPEAKER_06]: has big machines like a gel encapsulation
machine so we're gonna actually fitting
[SPEAKER_06]: out a a line of mixed botanicals with
select uh cannabinoid profiles for you
[SPEAKER_06]: know addressing various specific issues uh
encapsulate like i was gonna say
[SPEAKER_04]: nutraceutical yeah so it's cool they have
toys you can play with and and and make
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting products out of that excite
you yes very much so and chia any any new
[SPEAKER_04]: uh are you guys uh all flower and
pre-rolls or are you uh yeah actually um i
[SPEAKER_05]: have a line of topicals that i've been
making for about 15 years that i'm hoping
[SPEAKER_05]: to um launch this year i we were trying to
do that in march but that didn't quite
[SPEAKER_05]: happen um so maybe we'll get that together
by this coming winter we had issues with
[SPEAKER_05]: manufacturing space as well um but yeah
just continuing flower i have a crop in
[SPEAKER_05]: the ground right now so light type will be
out in about six to eight weeks um we'll
[SPEAKER_05]: have some fresh goodness um so looking
forward to that and and are there any new
[SPEAKER_04]: genetics you're running this season or is
it all uh same as last year yeah we will
[SPEAKER_05]: have some new things we had a new strain
this last year called pineapple cheesecake
[SPEAKER_05]: and just i was really um happy to hear
about the taste and the flavor being like
[SPEAKER_05]: the number one thing and that we've got a
ton of great response on that people love
[SPEAKER_05]: the pineapple cheesecake um so excited
about that um we're also moving into
[SPEAKER_05]: working with a manufacturer that we're
going to be making some specific um some
[SPEAKER_05]: rso basically for for the market which is
something that you know are are they based
[SPEAKER_05]: in mendocino as well are they local um no
they're actually in san francisco um and
[SPEAKER_05]: they also they have a a delivery service
um as well so um it'll be a great way to
[SPEAKER_05]: just you know direct to consumer um they
have a great they already have a good
[SPEAKER_05]: consumer base for that product as well um
and so anyways i'm looking forward to that
[SPEAKER_05]: just providing some some real medicine you
know we're all about medicine people and
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know better living through
cannabis is our motto and whatever that
[SPEAKER_05]: takes um you know whatever people need
really um it's interesting to me that
[SPEAKER_04]: you've been making topicals for 15 years
and in the nightmare that is the regulated
[SPEAKER_04]: california market it is difficult for you
to onboard them into your business yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: the challenge is that it's you know i'm
maybe i'm a little witchy and i make every
[SPEAKER_05]: batch is slightly different and you know
like it's hard to have consistency and i
[SPEAKER_05]: also don't want to give my recipe away
honestly that's that's been my challenge
[SPEAKER_05]: is like okay if i if i work with somebody
then all of a sudden they have my recipe
[SPEAKER_05]: and and honestly i don't think it'll turn
out the same as how i when i make it um
[SPEAKER_05]: there's something about the love and the
magic that goes in right but but it but it
[SPEAKER_04]: but it but it but but pre-regulated market
you didn't have to work with some you
[SPEAKER_04]: could just do it yourself and sell it to
your or give it away or sell it to your
[SPEAKER_05]: friends or whatever yep and i you know we
used to do a lot of events these farmers
[SPEAKER_05]: market things and i sold tons of it at
those people love that stuff but now i
[SPEAKER_05]: just kind of been holding back on it it's
you know it's a challenge i one thing like
[SPEAKER_05]: michael was talking about is like the
contaminants right i know that my cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: is clean but what about the other herbs
that are going into there i haven't gone
[SPEAKER_05]: forward to test that in a concentrated
level and that makes me nervous honestly
[SPEAKER_05]: they're organic and so is the oils and all
the things that go into it but what
[SPEAKER_05]: thresholds are they using yeah and you
know what are they testing for where we're
[SPEAKER_05]: testing for so many other things in
cannabis that that we hadn't looked at
[SPEAKER_06]: before so my whole thing we've never
failed a test for any pesticide or heavy
[SPEAKER_06]: metal we infuse whole herbs that are
organically sourced from you know your
[SPEAKER_06]: usual suspects star botanicals and
frontier um and we've never had a problem
[SPEAKER_06]: uh so yes i feel good so far well what's
interesting is the trap don't fall into
[SPEAKER_06]: the beeswax trap that's the bad one
[SPEAKER_04]: just quickly uh last week or the week
before we had wendy from space gems on and
[SPEAKER_04]: she was talking about you know having to
find different sources for things given
[SPEAKER_04]: the lockdown coronavirus and then her big
fear was you know she'll get ding not for
[SPEAKER_04]: the the extracted cannabis oil but uh from
adding these new organic uh you know
[SPEAKER_04]: non-cannabis ingredients in her in her
edibles yeah that's a concern for sure
[SPEAKER_04]: anyway ever everyone so anyway uh if there
are no last words i think we can wrap on
[SPEAKER_05]: that uh anyone know i was just gonna say
support the small the small companies um i
[SPEAKER_05]: think everybody can agree on that when you
go into a dispensary go for the brands
[SPEAKER_05]: that come straight from the you know the
source and and don't get these large
[SPEAKER_05]: brands you know i mean they they deserve
the shelf space too of course and and
[SPEAKER_05]: competition is wicked out there but the
small farmers and this this is where all
[SPEAKER_05]: the product comes from for all these
products as you can tell from this
[SPEAKER_05]: conversation so supporting those the small
operators is is king thank you i also just
[SPEAKER_07]: wanted to say that um you know a lot of
times uh in the industry people are like
[SPEAKER_07]: well how come the tobacco industry can do
this or how come the alcohol industry can
[SPEAKER_07]: do this or the rights and the privileges
of other established industries and a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of those came from um having incredibly
strong well-developed trade unions and
[SPEAKER_07]: lobbying arms and as much as uh it is so
difficult to be a small operator it is
[SPEAKER_07]: critical that we all uh band together
through the trade organizations and
[SPEAKER_07]: through the political action to try to
carve a path for us to be able to survive
[SPEAKER_07]: because as we've seen there the agencies
and the governments are not going to do
[SPEAKER_07]: the industry any favors that they do not
fight tooth and nail for um so that's one
[SPEAKER_07]: of the reasons why i've been so involved
in the state trade organization trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: work with the local organizations um to
try to push that stuff through because we
[SPEAKER_07]: really have to get those those uh those
changes made to carve out a place for the
[SPEAKER_07]: smaller businesses as well because the it
can't just be the well-funded gigantic
[SPEAKER_07]: companies who are sending their lobbyists
in to fight for their needs um and there
[SPEAKER_07]: truly is power in numbers when the smaller
operators band together and and flex their
[SPEAKER_04]: political muscle so just quickly on that
can everyone give a shout out to one or
[SPEAKER_04]: two uh local or statewide uh trade groups
that they think are are doing a good job
[SPEAKER_05]: fighting on their behalf chia um well
locally we have the the mca which is the
[SPEAKER_05]: mendocino cannabis association um which is
you know had been three or four different
[SPEAKER_05]: organizations that have now combined
efforts seeing that everybody you know was
[SPEAKER_05]: fighting for the same cause ultimately um
that's you know might as well just combine
[SPEAKER_05]: efforts um make that things happen from
that level um so locally that that's been
[SPEAKER_05]: um one of the best advocates on on the
small farmer side i think in la it's uh
[SPEAKER_02]: it's all about the retailers oh uh mike
sorry go ahead mike oh sorry um so i think
[SPEAKER_02]: down here in la it's obviously
manufacturing is a big thing down here but
[SPEAKER_02]: it's really the retail sector so really
for us um it's god i'm forgetting their
[SPEAKER_04]: name now a a well there's ucba southern
california coalition uh julie any others
[SPEAKER_07]: that uh yeah yeah i think glauco was the
was the one but now they're part of that
[SPEAKER_07]: southern california coalition i believe
and ucba has been a really strong advocate
[SPEAKER_07]: for retailers um uh cca is that one ccia
like i sit on the board of ccia that's a
[SPEAKER_07]: state trade organization california
cannabis industry association i've been
[SPEAKER_07]: deeply involved with them and they've also
created a coalition of all of these groups
[SPEAKER_07]: and meet you know frequently because
obviously there's a lot of fantastic local
[SPEAKER_07]: um trade organizations consumer trade
organizations obviously americans for safe
[SPEAKER_07]: access and california normal have been
huge for for patient advocacy but the the
[SPEAKER_07]: big magic is how do we get all of these
groups working together and saying the
[SPEAKER_07]: same thing because that's where you get
that kind of um uh force on par with you
[SPEAKER_07]: know the work has been done for years for
labor unions and even starting to work
[SPEAKER_07]: more with those existing unions um uh in
terms of of labor in other other areas
[SPEAKER_07]: where it's like generally we're all kind
of wanting much of the same things at at
[SPEAKER_07]: core which is you know protections for
smaller operators protections for workers
[SPEAKER_07]: um protections for social equity and
keeping that a priority because that's a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of the reason this got pushed through
in prop 64 was this idea of um you know
[SPEAKER_07]: reinvestment in impacted communities and
and making a place both you know for the
[SPEAKER_07]: smaller operators but also for um you know
that social equity and and i will say too
[SPEAKER_07]: just that you know the operators that you
know the regulations were written by
[SPEAKER_07]: people who don't know didn't know anything
about cannabis and they're enforced by
[SPEAKER_07]: people who don't know anything about
cannabis really yeah it has always been
[SPEAKER_07]: the job of the industry itself to educate
both the legislators and the enforcement
[SPEAKER_07]: and the consumers and ourselves like it's
really our job to be the people who are is
[SPEAKER_02]: lori still the head of the bcc or is
someone it is yeah lori with her i mean
[SPEAKER_07]: i'm not we're not friends it's ironic i
actually live in the city where the bcc is
[SPEAKER_04]: headquartered and and i can't get a
meeting with her so so so chelsea give us
[SPEAKER_04]: a local organization that that you think
represents uh the local sacramento
[SPEAKER_06]: community well uh none okay can i go with
none i don't think we have fun i don't
[SPEAKER_06]: think we have i mean i could be completely
ignorant on this there was probably one of
[SPEAKER_06]: delivery services that that rings a bell
um there's probably one for distributors
[SPEAKER_06]: there's definitely not one for
manufacturers and kind of as a whole uh
[SPEAKER_06]: the group that touts itself as
representing the industry really only
[SPEAKER_06]: represents nine specific retailers and no
one else so we don't really have one what
[SPEAKER_06]: what um i really appreciate the work of
the ncia and the ccia though what what's
[SPEAKER_04]: the group that's out itself is
representing everyone uh sacramento
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis industry association it's from
the um i don't know we call them the sac
[SPEAKER_06]: nine but it's nine retailers all owned by
the same people family it's it's connected
[SPEAKER_06]: to that ukrainian guy who got like
arrested i don't know okay got it all
[SPEAKER_04]: right on that note we will we will call it
a day uh i appreciate it everyone and let
[SPEAKER_04]: me cut to this is what we have been tuned
into buzz on the street with a bunch of
[SPEAKER_04]: operators data analysts and compliance
experts so i appreciate it and with that
[SPEAKER_04]: we will kill the live stream thanks
everyone you you you you you you you you
you you
