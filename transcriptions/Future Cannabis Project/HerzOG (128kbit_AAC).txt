[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Herzog.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herzog from Germany, Berlin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And tell me, from Germany.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you have in mind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'm working together with Exotic
Seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We developed our new project, My Strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cross of Larry OG and Kosher Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: We named it after me.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of OGs out there,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ocean grown it is, actually,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And my name is spelled the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: H-E-R-Z-O-G.
[SPEAKER_00]: Herzog.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we split that up and it made a perfect
Herz OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, that's how we called The Strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cross of two of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is the characteristic of the OG?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a strong and happy high.
[SPEAKER_00]: The best you want, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can laugh your ass off and sweat like
a motherfucker because you think you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trippin'.
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you say that it's a little bit more
like higher or...
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hybrid, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, it hits your head and it hits your
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really get a full body stoned and
creative high, actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it tastes like a little bit woody,
a little bit earthy with notes of
[SPEAKER_00]: marshmallow and honey.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has this little gassy, earthy touch
with the sweetness at the ends.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really, really awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the whole years that you have been
in the cannabis world, in a way to say,
[SPEAKER_01]: have you noticed any big change or like in
the taste of the customer or the public?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there are lots of new seed banks out
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is growing and everybody is
developing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody is bringing out new strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really progressive business,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants to push the frontier.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want the worldwide legalisation so
we can traffic cannabis globally.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually right now working in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell kilos of CBD, you know,
throughout Europe because it got this
[SPEAKER_00]: medical aspect, which is really important
to me also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's also important to bring up the
structures for the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: When THC is legal, we have already set up
all the structures, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we started with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are freaking grossing that it's
something that happened fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, everything that wants to turn out
fine and good has to take its time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you got to be patient,
you got to be confident and you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: visualise the future and the upcoming
events, which may be mostly positive and
[SPEAKER_00]: in a good way for the legalisation,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I ask you now, what is the thing,
what's the small thing that makes the
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between your seed and... We put
much more love in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put our guts in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put our balls in it and we put our
brain in it, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live for the plant, we die for the
plant and we're pushing fronches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we push that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have to check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you have to, of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was Herzog here with... Jan Carla.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a pleasure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye.
Bye.
Thank you.
