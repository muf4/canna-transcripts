[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go ahead and go to the CHP and then
we'll open it up for questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Morning, thank you Mr. Chair, Madam Chair
and Mr. Chair and members.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Rich Desmond, I'm the legislative
director for the California Highway Patrol
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm appearing today on behalf of
Commissioner Joe Farrow who wanted me to
[SPEAKER_04]: send his regrets.
[SPEAKER_04]: He really wanted to be here to be a part
of this important discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is obviously an issue that has a
large impact on law enforcement in the
[SPEAKER_04]: state of California with the anticipated
increased use of marijuana and increased
[SPEAKER_04]: incidences of impaired driving.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the state of California, a lot of the
law enforcement impact will affect locals
[SPEAKER_04]: in their local communities and certainly
I'll be deferring to them to express their
[SPEAKER_04]: concerns.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on a statewide level from the
California Highway Patrol's perspective,
[SPEAKER_04]: an agency that makes 2 million enforcement
contacts a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will have some real big challenges for
us in the areas of transportation of
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana, marijuana products and
certainly in the area of impaired driving
[SPEAKER_04]: that Mr. Sumner touched on briefly and
I'll certainly go into a little more
[SPEAKER_04]: detail about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: With respect to the transportation issues,
our experience with the transportation of
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal marijuana has revealed that
there's a lot of confusion in the law
[SPEAKER_04]: enforcement area about who can lawfully
transport it, how much can lawfully be
[SPEAKER_04]: transported.
[SPEAKER_04]: You combine this with, as Mr. Chair,
you reference a patchwork of local
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations and it certainly makes it
confusing for the officer on the side of
[SPEAKER_04]: the road to make the determination when
and where that transportation is being
[SPEAKER_04]: conducted lawfully.
[SPEAKER_04]: The good news is that we have a very
productive relationship with the
[SPEAKER_04]: Department of Consumer Affairs,
the Department of Technology and all the
[SPEAKER_04]: other licensing authorities identified
both in the medicinal marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: legislation and Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've been involved meeting with them
and helping ensure that a regulatory
[SPEAKER_04]: framework that is put in place has clear
guidance for law enforcement agencies on
[SPEAKER_04]: the front lines.
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, one of the areas where we've
been talking to them is in the development
[SPEAKER_04]: of a track and trace system.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can imagine the benefits of a system
for law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_04]: If I pull someone over or perhaps
encounter somebody at a collision scene
[SPEAKER_04]: who is transporting marijuana,
the officer, I need to be able to verify
[SPEAKER_04]: that that marijuana is coming from a
licensed facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to a licensed facility,
wherever it is in the distribution chain,
[SPEAKER_04]: a cultivator, a distributor, a processor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also to make sure the amount being
processed or being transported is within
[SPEAKER_04]: the licensing restrictions.
[SPEAKER_04]: As part of these discussions about a track
and trace system, we've been having
[SPEAKER_04]: regular conversations about what law
enforcement would need to see on,
[SPEAKER_04]: say, a manifest, whether that's a paper
manifest or an electronic manifest as part
[SPEAKER_04]: of a database we were tracking to.
[SPEAKER_04]: How it would need to be packaged and
appropriately labeled for law enforcement
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to read and be able to
decipher.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are some issues that are going
to be crucial for us as we move forward
[SPEAKER_04]: and see more marijuana out on the roadways
that we patrol.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other really large issue that
obviously we anticipate with the CHP is
[SPEAKER_04]: the increase in impaired driving.
[SPEAKER_04]: I believe the Department of Public Health
is going to address some of the science
[SPEAKER_04]: behind marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: But from our perspective, it's a very
difficult landscape because marijuana is
[SPEAKER_04]: infinitely more complex than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: People want to make the easy comparison
with alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey, we do it this way for alcohol with
law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why can't we do it similarly for
marijuana?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, marijuana, it's very difficult to
correlate levels with impairment.
[SPEAKER_04]: As you know, it's very difficult to
measure for an officer on the side of the
[SPEAKER_04]: road.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are some of the inherent challenges
that we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you combine some of these challenges
with now diverse products we're seeing out
[SPEAKER_04]: there on the roadways of all shapes and
sizes, of all levels of potency that we're
[SPEAKER_04]: experiencing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can imagine some of our challenges
with detecting, apprehending, and of
[SPEAKER_04]: course, prosecuting marijuana impaired
drivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now Proposition 64 does have some
specifics relating to the CHP,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's good news.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it provides $3 million a year for
five years for the Highway Patrol to
[SPEAKER_04]: oversee research.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're hoping to do is piggyback on
some of the research that's already being
[SPEAKER_04]: overseen by the Department of Consumer
Affairs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Following some of the medicinal,
recently medicinal marijuana legislation
[SPEAKER_04]: to help develop better field sobriety
tests for law enforcement officers to use
[SPEAKER_04]: to detect marijuana impaired drivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope to be able to use some of this
research funds to help identify technology
[SPEAKER_04]: that will help officers on the side of the
road.
[SPEAKER_04]: Commissioner Farrow will actually be going
to University of California San Diego with
[SPEAKER_04]: their medical cannabis research center,
along with Ms. Ajax from the Bureau of
[SPEAKER_04]: Marijuana Control.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Chris Murphy from the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the Office of Traffic Safety to go
talk with those researchers about the
[SPEAKER_04]: research they're currently doing to
improve field sobriety testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what additional research they may be
able to accomplish as part of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Proposition 64 funding.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing that Prop 64 does
specifically with the Highway Patrol is it
[SPEAKER_04]: provides a portion of the tax revenue for
DUI related training for not only CHP
[SPEAKER_04]: officers, but also our allied agency
partners.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grants to local governments for
prevention, education, enforcement,
[SPEAKER_04]: and equipment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to just very briefly touch on a few
of the things that the California Highway
[SPEAKER_04]: Patrol is already doing in anticipation of
increased marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because we know there is some delay
with the funding from Proposition 64.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're restructuring things
administratively within our department to
[SPEAKER_04]: refocus, reprioritize on impaired driver
training and education.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are changing some of our internal data
collection methods for collision reporting
[SPEAKER_04]: and arrest reporting to more accurately
capture drug impaired driving information.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are the statewide drug recognition
expert coordinator in conjunction with the
[SPEAKER_04]: Office of Traffic Safety and NHTSA.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope to train 400 additional drug
recognition experts within this next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are actually training every one of our
officers and sergeants in advanced
[SPEAKER_04]: roadside impairment driver education.
[SPEAKER_04]: So our officers, line level officers,
will have a much better understanding of
[SPEAKER_04]: the impacts of drug use, specifically
marijuana use, and how it impacts driver
[SPEAKER_04]: impairment.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are also participating in a number of
different task forces with the Office of
[SPEAKER_04]: Traffic Safety, with Department of Motor
Vehicles, our allied agency partners,
[SPEAKER_04]: NHTSA, crime labs, prosecutors,
on identifying some best practices,
[SPEAKER_04]: best approaches to deal with this problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the law enforcement perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, that's the extent of my
prepared remarks.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm happy to answer any questions you may
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Mr. Desmond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know there's a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know I get questions back in the
district, especially relating to CHP.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've touched on some of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the AMU allows up to $3 million
to be spent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you were talking about some of the
field sprightly tests and whatnot and some
[SPEAKER_01]: of the research that DCA is doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been talking to a number of doctors
and different agencies about the research,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it seems to be not well coordinated,
I guess, is a good way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you shed some light on just,
from CHP's perspective, do you see this as
[SPEAKER_01]: like a breathalyzer like we do for DUI,
or what type of tests are we just still at
[SPEAKER_01]: the beginning phases and don't know what
that looks like yet, or do we have kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: some sense?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's more of the former.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot of new technology
out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't necessarily know what this
new technology is capable of and how
[SPEAKER_04]: feasible or logistical it is to use on the
side of the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've had multiple conversations with
Commissioner Farrow and the administration
[SPEAKER_04]: about using some of this research money to
have an independent body vet some of these
[SPEAKER_04]: devices and actually give law enforcement
in California information about if you're
[SPEAKER_04]: going to use this device, this is what
it's going to test.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what it's going to collect.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can have faith and confidence in that
when we deploy it out in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what we're hoping to get out of
some of the research that we will be
[SPEAKER_04]: overseeing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So given that marijuana use has probably
been occurring for some time now,
[SPEAKER_01]: what are some of the methods that CHP
officers are going through now,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether somebody was using it for medical
or something before the AUMA was passed?
[SPEAKER_04]: So right now, all of our officers are
trained at the academy, obviously,
[SPEAKER_04]: in alcohol and drug impairment detection.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're trained in field sobriety testing,
specifically standardized field sobriety
[SPEAKER_04]: tests.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens today is if I pull someone
over, I was just a regular roadside
[SPEAKER_04]: officer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did not have any extensive training in
drug impairment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would pull someone over if they exhibit
signs maybe in their driving and maybe
[SPEAKER_04]: with their eyes and their speech that
indicates some kind of impairment,
[SPEAKER_04]: then I would administer field sobriety
testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Field sobriety tests to that driver.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the driver, again, indicated that
there's some kind of impairment,
[SPEAKER_04]: maybe they can't follow instructions or
they can't touch their finger to their
[SPEAKER_04]: nose appropriately, right, that the test
that you've all seen before.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would call out a drug recognition expert
or I would arrest that driver if I had
[SPEAKER_04]: probable cause to make the address and I
would transport them to the office for a
[SPEAKER_04]: further evaluation by a drug recognition
expert.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is if I don't think they're under the
influence of strictly alcohol.
[SPEAKER_04]: A drug recognition expert officer receives
two weeks of specialized training and an
[SPEAKER_04]: additional one week of certifications out
in the field.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our prosecutions, and I don't want to
speak for prosecutors, but from what I've
[SPEAKER_04]: heard and what I've experienced is that
prosecutions are successful if a drug
[SPEAKER_04]: recognition expert actually can evaluate
the person.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can come up with some certainty that
the person is either under the influence
[SPEAKER_04]: of marijuana or some kind of opioid,
some kind of narcotic or amphetamine,
[SPEAKER_04]: and prosecutions are successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: The problem is with those methods in the
past, they're expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's difficult to train officers to become
drug recognition experts, very time
[SPEAKER_04]: consuming to do so.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so with increased marijuana use,
what we know we need is we need to have
[SPEAKER_04]: better tools for the officer on the side
of the road.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we will not always have a DRE
available.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where the research really comes
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now what's going on in UC San Diego
is research to correlate the standardized
[SPEAKER_04]: field sobriety tests that were validated.
[SPEAKER_04]: To detect alcohol, to correlate their use
directly with marijuana impairment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we think that's a step in the right
direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: We hope additional research along those
lines, as well as research into some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the technology, whether it's breath
testing in the field or fluid testing in
[SPEAKER_04]: the field will be effective for officers,
front line level officers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, obviously we want to keep all
Californians safe, especially when they're
[SPEAKER_01]: using our roadways.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's probably the question I get the
most back home is how are we going to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure people are safe?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you talk to them about the bunny
set aside to help with the research in
[SPEAKER_01]: this department.
[SPEAKER_01]: But is there any, just from your past
dealings, any loopholes or something that
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be clarified in regulation that
we can do meanwhile while this research is
[SPEAKER_01]: being done just to help improve the safety
in our roadways?
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had a lot of discussions with the
administration and other licensing
[SPEAKER_04]: authorities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to continue those
discussions, sir, and certainly get back
[SPEAKER_04]: to you and any other members who are
interested in this topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm sure we will, as we go further
down the line, we will identify areas that
[SPEAKER_04]: may require some legislative tweaks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you for asking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we started with CHP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously we have questions for the
Department of Justice also, but I believe
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Daly had a question for CHP.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to follow up on Chairman's
question on the timing of when you think
[SPEAKER_02]: there'll be more technology out to predict
what the level is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for our business, I'm going to talk
about the business side of it,
[SPEAKER_02]: not so much the recreational side of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us, we have a trucking company.
[SPEAKER_02]: My wife and I own a trucking company.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the employees that drive trucks,
you can't have a recreational habit or use
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana, it's banned, so we have to make
sure that they're not a cannabis user.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other employees that I have that
aren't driving a truck and aren't in a
[SPEAKER_02]: drug program and aren't required to be in
one, so let me give you an example.
[SPEAKER_02]: They drive a company vehicle to the farm
on the way out to the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: They get in an accident and they had used
recreational marijuana on the weekend,
[SPEAKER_02]: but weren't impaired at the time,
but it's still in their system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And somebody gets injured, it's my
vehicle, now I'm on the hook for,
[SPEAKER_02]: so there's a big gray area here for
businesses in California that,
[SPEAKER_02]: first of all, may not know that their
employees are using a recreational drug,
[SPEAKER_02]: or then who's liable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us, we just want to abide by the
laws and we want to reduce our risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we don't have a tool to measure the
amount or when, and that's a real problem
[SPEAKER_02]: for businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is in California.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, yes, that's an inherent problem,
obviously, for us as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think, once again, people look for a
correlation with alcohol where we have
[SPEAKER_04]: that specific 08 standard.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where we have, through scientific
research, through studies, we can say with
[SPEAKER_04]: some level of certainty that if you're an
08, you're impaired, regardless of whether
[SPEAKER_04]: you use alcohol all the time or you use it
occasionally.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the challenge really is twofold,
is how do we develop?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or correlate impairment with marijuana
use, which is so much different,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then how do we measure it to give you
an industry or law enforcement level of
[SPEAKER_04]: certainty.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can tell you that there are devices out
there for oral fluid testing that have
[SPEAKER_04]: been the subject of a lot of study by the
National Highway Traffic Safety
[SPEAKER_04]: Administration.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've had discussions with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, they don't provide a level,
and so that's an inherent drawback.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do provide information about the
presence of marijuana, amphetamine,
[SPEAKER_04]: heroin, other illegal drugs, so there is
some value.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's some other devices that,
from what we have read, are still,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think, in their infancy, but have a
great deal of promise where they would
[SPEAKER_04]: measure a level in your breath.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think for us, what we really want to
see is see this technology developed to
[SPEAKER_04]: the point where we have a much higher
level of confidence in using them from the
[SPEAKER_04]: law enforcement perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully, that would have a side
benefit to industry as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hope that's- Just a quick follow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are the other states that have
legalized it, are they, I'm sure that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're in the same boat we are,
at least their businesses and their law
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we could work together with those
other states to put some more resources in
[SPEAKER_02]: there to get some sort of a tool that we
can allow the measurement of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: because that would really help in all the
processing of who's doing what and when.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, yes, yes, and we are doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, sir.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Mr. Chair.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess, just kind of a follow up again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So obviously, the drug recognition experts
are very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that certainly in some of my
counties, getting convictions for driving
[SPEAKER_00]: under the influence of cannabis has been
very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: And probably because of the lack of
resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to the $3 million that's
going into research, are you seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: additional resources for making sure that
there are drug recognition experts?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to still potentially need that
anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regardless of what technology we use to
detect impairment, there's multiple kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of impairment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you seeking, are you expecting
additional resources to help with that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, so Prop 64 is part of its funding
scheme, is that a certain percentage of
[SPEAKER_04]: the tax dollars will go to the highway
patrol.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, it doesn't say exactly how much,
but it does set a floor of $50 million per
[SPEAKER_04]: year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could potentially be more.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's been projections that are all over
the map, so we don't know exactly how much
[SPEAKER_04]: it will be.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that money we will be able to use to
administer grants to local agencies to
[SPEAKER_04]: train more personnel for DRE and better
impairment detection to help them get
[SPEAKER_04]: better technology, to put more officers
out on the street for DUI prevention,
[SPEAKER_04]: detection and prevention.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the DRE program, as it exists today,
is funded by grants from the National
[SPEAKER_04]: Highway Traffic Safety Administration,
and OTS administers those grants for the
[SPEAKER_04]: state of California.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that money obviously keeps coming in
from the federal government as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we continue to get a funding stream
today, and we anticipate getting a much
[SPEAKER_04]: larger funding stream to improve law
enforcement's ability to apprehend
[SPEAKER_04]: impaired drivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't know how much that's going to
be, because obviously the funding's not
[SPEAKER_04]: going to come until the 18-19 fiscal year
to this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: CHP, we're in the process right now,
I referenced us restructuring things
[SPEAKER_04]: administratively.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll be in a position to administer
these grant fundings.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're not going to do it in a vacuum,
I want to assure you of that as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because we plan to convene groups,
and we're already part of stakeholder
[SPEAKER_04]: groups composed of crime labs,
prosecutors, our local agencies to make
[SPEAKER_04]: sure when we administer the grant funding,
it's going out to the right places to get
[SPEAKER_04]: the biggest bang for our buck,
of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Assemblymember Lackey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, let me begin by apologizing for my
voice.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's impaired.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a joint hearing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nicely done.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what's really missing in this
discussion is the real important
[SPEAKER_03]: difficulty in identifying a pyramid in
marijuana versus usage nationwide.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of focus on establishing per
se limits, when in fact marijuana has a
[SPEAKER_03]: very unique distinction to it in the fact
that its impairing levels are not for a
[SPEAKER_03]: sustained period of time, usually only a
couple hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now, the science is able to
detect metabolized THC, when in fact
[SPEAKER_03]: that's not a strong indicator of
impairment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the tools that we're trying to bring
forward, and I think that your department
[SPEAKER_03]: is trying to bring notoriety and trust and
value in, is also being looked at by UC
[SPEAKER_03]: San Diego in the study that was the result
of AB 266.
[SPEAKER_03]: And specifically, the field sobriety tests
are being developed to address specific
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana levels of impairment.
[SPEAKER_03]: The impairment levels are different,
and the impairment in itself is different
[SPEAKER_03]: than alcohol.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's what makes it very,
very difficult for the roadside officer to
[SPEAKER_03]: be able to identify true impairment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we need is, and I'm trying to
address that through my own process,
[SPEAKER_03]: to bring policy that will allow your
agency to lead the country and be able to
[SPEAKER_03]: identify impairment before we start
talking about per se limits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that we're getting the cart
before the horse when we're trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: establish per se limits when clearly we
don't have really strong verifiable
[SPEAKER_03]: pathways for the regular roadside officer
to determine just impairment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I look forward to your agency's
leadership and to be able to help make
[SPEAKER_03]: that distinction between impairment and
usage.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because unfortunately, there are probably
some people who have been punished for
[SPEAKER_03]: just usage when in fact impairment was in
question, and that's what we do not want.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I just want everybody to be clear that
the California Highway Patrol understands
[SPEAKER_03]: that distinction and is working very,
very diligently to be able to build the
[SPEAKER_03]: confidence and to remove truly impaired
people because they are the threat.
Thank you.
