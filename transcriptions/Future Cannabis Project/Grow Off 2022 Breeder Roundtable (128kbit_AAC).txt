[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm Sam from the grow off.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run a science based competition where,
you know, we're reliant on excellence in
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding because everyone starts with
identical genetics and then they're judged
[SPEAKER_00]: by lab results for total care.
[SPEAKER_00]: There it stopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, I reached out to Peter
because it's our biggest year ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to eight states.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, this podcast is actually representing
every single time zone in the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need quality breers state by state
to get out these cuts to our growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, we put them through the ringer,
you know, they have to meet certain
[SPEAKER_00]: metrics, pass certain tests, pests,
inspections, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's an awesome group of guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get them all together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I had to wear my bioweed women's
shirt because I'm looking for female like
[SPEAKER_00]: ladies that do some breeding and genetics
for next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So hit us up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, let's, I guess go through
introductions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, that makes sense, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this weekend we just handed out clones
in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, Michigan and Oklahoma and let's meet
them first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, Michigan's on the East coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So technically we're first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll introduce Ross from fresh seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if we can hear, if we can get
questions from people tuning in,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would be cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they can ask anything they want,
except what the mystery strain is flower
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we can't talk about what they got,
but we can get to know these breeders and
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics partners.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, Ross, fresh coast seeds are
Michigan partner.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Ross, what do you want to tell it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can you tell us about yourself,
your process, what you love about
[SPEAKER_00]: Michigan?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, those are pretty broad, but,
um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, so I'm born and raised in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, 39 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, I guess, uh, just how I got it even
into, into cannabis, I was younger,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and like in high school hustling
bricks of weed and, you know, doing the
[SPEAKER_03]: thing, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I always had a passion for it,
but then throughout life I did other
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, I had a major back injury in
the Bering sea.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I came home and, uh, just kind of had
to rework my whole life.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, um, I got into like third coast garden
and I worked with him for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, uh, I started doing my own
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, I really never had any intention
of necessarily a breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I was like, you know, up at four
in the morning, buying thousands of
[SPEAKER_03]: dollars worth of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, uh, and one thing led to another.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it took me about six years to lock
down like nine females.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I don't know, I'm pretty picky
when it comes to plant selection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but I, I came up with these females.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then, um, like I was telling you,
I had an experience just, uh, having a
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation with the universe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and I just got, I was really sick of
doing production stuff and, and she gave
[SPEAKER_03]: me the idea of, of fresh coast seed
company and starting a seed company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So within 24 hours, I had, um,
fresh coast seed company LLC, and,
[SPEAKER_03]: uh, I moved out of the Lake houses and we
went and bought, uh, 20 acres in Bel Air
[SPEAKER_03]: and, um, we started breeding immediately
and I had the right females to do it with,
[SPEAKER_03]: um, and, uh, everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was, uh, seven years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: So here we are now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, the brand has actually gotten way
bigger than what I can handle.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm, I'm working on that part right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but yeah, so that's just kind of a
little rundown of how I got to where I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh, this is a cool layout.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's bring up Robbie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Robbie from nerds genetics, our Oklahoma
genetic partner.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, kind of find an angle that gets me in
the camp.
[SPEAKER_09]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey, welcome everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, yeah, so, um, this year I did the,
uh, the Oklahoma drop.
[SPEAKER_09]: We did the Colorado drop last year,
um, for the, the clone selection.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, this year we, we had a
little bit of experience with the,
[SPEAKER_09]: the contest.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so we, we had a little bit of,
I would say different parameters,
[SPEAKER_09]: um, when we were selecting for the contest
in Oklahoma and knowing a lot more about
[SPEAKER_09]: how the contest works.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, and, uh, a lot of the things
that we could potentially see in the
[SPEAKER_09]: contest.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, cause yeah, when we did our,
our Colorado one, we, we broke a couple of
[SPEAKER_09]: records, you know, both good and bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: We broke records.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, am I not talking Sam?
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you hear me?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, we can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's just other people in the
background that I'm saying to mute
[SPEAKER_05]: yourself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause we hear everything going on back
there, but you're fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, I just got confused.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, anyway, so yeah, we broke a couple of
records in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_09]: Uh, one bad one for most Hermes and one
good one for highest terms.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, that's, that's just how it
works sometimes.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, but, uh, when we, uh, went and had
seen how the, uh, the contest works and
[SPEAKER_09]: knew a lot more, uh, about it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, you know, it changed the way we
selected for it.
[SPEAKER_09]: When I selected in Colorado, I was really
trying to select for something that had
[SPEAKER_09]: the potential to break some records.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, and when we did it in Oklahoma,
um, we were really looking for something
[SPEAKER_09]: that was going to be, uh, you know,
something that could be a staple strain
[SPEAKER_09]: out here or something that was really
different from anything that, um,
[SPEAKER_09]: is being seen on any of the shelves out
here or, uh, you know, any of the things
[SPEAKER_09]: that, uh, um, are, are sort of what is
hitting the norm, you know, like Oklahoma
[SPEAKER_09]: is a new market.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're seeing a lot of the same 10
strains that get recycled out here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Um, so we, we tried to bring something
that was going to be a totally different
[SPEAKER_09]: flavor profile, something that was going
to be a totally different, uh,
[SPEAKER_09]: high than anything that is, is really
being brought to the table right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's what we brought for the
Oklahoma Oklahoma show.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, Sam, you're muted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a good point, Robbie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you that like I mentioned,
we have certain metrics that we ask all of
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys to hit when we look at strains
and you know, who is that crunching?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when one of those is, it can't be me,
is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it me?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in one of those metrics is like that we
are looking for something that's not
[SPEAKER_00]: widely on the market because we take these
six months of the competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, hyping up all these growers,
this mystery strain, everyone that's in a
[SPEAKER_00]: competition is going to bother every
single one of you and say, what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me, tell me.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be making their guesses and you
guys have to keep your mouth shut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's part of the fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and we want to make sure it's
something cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when it hits the market at the end of
the year, it flies off shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Hey Dave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, so yeah, it's, that's one of the
metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other is, you know, we, we do pest and
pathogen testing to make sure these are
[SPEAKER_00]: very, very clean cuts as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, uh, people watching don't know what
hops late and viroid is, I encourage you
[SPEAKER_00]: to Google it, reach out to any of us here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure we can talk to you through all
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to recap, uh, Michigan,
Oklahoma dropped on Sunday, but you can
[SPEAKER_00]: still pick up clones there this week only.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can just DM us or sign up at the grow
off.com and let's move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our next clone drop will be in Colorado,
our home state with, uh, dark horse
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to introduce Caesar now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's doing that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can hear you, but your wifi is a little
choppy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: If anything, we, you have the genetics
ready.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got them in the corner a few days ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm looking at them behind me,
just looking for them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got way more than I needed, but I'd
rather have more than I need and less than
[SPEAKER_05]: any of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So actually Caesar, I needed to ask you,
cause we're getting close to the number
[SPEAKER_00]: that you told me we had to cut it off at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have more entries available or we
got to cut it at a hundred?
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's 206 in the corner right now,
assuming everyone roots, uh, should have
[SPEAKER_05]: more than I need.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if anything, once I get a little
closer to the data, I can possibly feel
[SPEAKER_05]: more comfortable opening it up to a little
bit more people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll keep you all posted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have like maybe 10 spots left
if we're keeping it at a hundred,
[SPEAKER_00]: but actually this is a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only do they have to get us cuts
for the, you know, all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: participants, but you have to grow more
than you need so that we have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, an even, uh, crop for,
so that everyone's getting the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of challenges we throw at you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you so much for doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, the one after Colorado is going to
be California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's the biggest friggin
state, uh, we have to do three clone
[SPEAKER_00]: drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are going to be in humble Oakland
and San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will introduce Daniel and Dave from
Hendricks farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, how much of us are in the frame?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we both in the frame?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Dave.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Daniel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, we're with Hendricks nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're stoked to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is our fourth year doing the grow
off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, it's kind of our, our favorite and
like most unique challenge is get
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody perfect, unique clones on a date
and keep a mystery strain, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: that you guys haven't seen before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we did a really good job this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love working with, uh, Sam and it's
really fun to be here on this call.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get to see all the other breeders.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I wish I, I was a fan of the
grow off before we ever were asked to be
[SPEAKER_02]: the nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just seemed like the coolest thing to
compete in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, uh, we wish we could grow all your
guys, genetics, all the other breeders out
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, it'd be really fun to go from state
to state strain swap.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can we make that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's take this to WhatsApp.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Daniel, you've been reaching out
to previous years, uh, genetic partners
[SPEAKER_00]: and linking up with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was so cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like the one person who was not able
to be here, I was bummed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, uh, like an SOP officer now,
um, Wendy Kornberg from Sonibus wrote up
[SPEAKER_00]: some SOPs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're all kind of on the same page.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's state to state is getting,
you know, similar clones or just quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and she could not be here today,
but, and I totally lost my train of
[SPEAKER_00]: thought where we were headed, but,
uh, she's, oh, she's trying to grab one of
[SPEAKER_00]: each of them because she's doing those
pest inspections.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's sending folks to do those for her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so she's going to try to grow every
single one of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but if you all want to try to connect,
I think that would be very fun too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe do some crosses for future grow off
projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be very fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my favorite part about this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's cool to get the contestants too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just interlinking with everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a good way to find genetics is just
working with the people that are growing
[SPEAKER_02]: the stuff too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as well as the people on this call,
but you know, contestants as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I will help facilitate that if I
can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next on the calendar, I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Virginia, we're still looking for a
venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I'm going to bring you up next
actually, Mario.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so this is an interesting story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, and if anyone watching has a friendly
venue for us to do a clone drop,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm looking for something near the DC
area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please DM us, email me Sam at the grow off
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but this is an interesting story.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we met Mario because he won our like
beauty pageant bud battle challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was with something really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously everyone liked the photo and
they knew what the strain was.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we advertise that as part of the
battles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, Hey, we're interested in doing
a Virginia grow off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you want to release La Jefa as the
mystery strain?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the first time we've ever told anyone
what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, the first ever like purposeful
release of the mystery strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so Mario from eating stars on Mars.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_12]: Hey, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you today?
[SPEAKER_12]: Good.
[SPEAKER_12]: All right.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, yeah, I mean, it's been pretty
interesting with this whole thing that
[SPEAKER_12]: went down.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, you know, I didn't expect to win,
but that was going against somebody that
[SPEAKER_12]: had like, I guess they had like 30,000,
some followers, you know, I'm here just
[SPEAKER_12]: starting up my IG, like a couple of years
ago and just having fun with it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, I've been growing for, for a minute.
[SPEAKER_12]: I know in Virginia we're going on a year
soon.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, when it comes to home grow,
but I've been growing a little bit longer
[SPEAKER_12]: than that.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's not a VA.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's, I don't want to say like,
I've been doing some hot shit,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know what I'm saying or something,
but, um, yeah, I've been, I've been doing
[SPEAKER_12]: a lot of here and there throughout the DMV
area.
[SPEAKER_12]: If that's what you want to call it pretty
much.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause it's, you know, like a Maryland,
DC, Virginia thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, we're all connected.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's a lot of good growers out here.
[SPEAKER_12]: Um, a lot of good genetics as well.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, it's exciting to just be a part of
this little family right here and,
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, see how things go.
[SPEAKER_12]: So, um, especially with LaFa she's,
I've been growing her for four years now.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I've, I've got her really dialed in.
[SPEAKER_12]: Uh, so that picture was, uh, like right at
its peak where she's been amazing,
[SPEAKER_12]: you know, to be just, uh, getting a lot of
clones off her, trying to like branch her
[SPEAKER_12]: out a lot.
[SPEAKER_12]: But, um, yeah, it's just been amazing,
man.
[SPEAKER_12]: This whole thing is, uh, I'm excited for
it, especially for Virginia.
[SPEAKER_12]: Cause I know here it's, it's a lot of low
key folks out here, but they've been
[SPEAKER_12]: growing for a minute.
[SPEAKER_12]: But for me, I think it's time for them to
just come out and have some fun,
[SPEAKER_12]: uh, with this competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes, uh, we think we have a venue,
but if any, again, if anyone's watching
[SPEAKER_00]: knows some Virginia folks, let us know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next on the calendar is Maine,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wait, hold up one second.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was muted.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trying to get your attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: So hit up Lou because he has, he has a
venue in Virginia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lou and I are chatting the venue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to Lou.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping to collab on a gene traders,
uh, at the Virginia clone drop for the
[SPEAKER_00]: grow off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that would be extra special.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would just require a little bit more
space and 420 friendly venue where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: just need to hand out clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, thank you, Ross.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, and if any, and I'm assuming we have a
lot of growers watching, if you don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: what a gene traders event is, they're
awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pop-up seed and clone event where
you can just get the latest and greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: in genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, they're all over the country and
they're awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next on our calendar is May or sorry,
June 25th, we will be in Maine with
[SPEAKER_00]: Bangladesh farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, uh, Peter, hopefully you can put
John and Jason on the screen at the same
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's possible
[SPEAKER_00]: while they work on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got John on the screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Jason and Jason, you're muted by
the way.
[SPEAKER_14]: Got you.
[SPEAKER_14]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, a little background on us,
I guess I've been playing with this plant
[SPEAKER_14]: for about 25 years.
[SPEAKER_14]: Pretty seriously.
[SPEAKER_14]: Did a couple breeds for some outdoor folks
here in Maine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Since we have such short seasons and wet
finishes, uh, they really have to be some
[SPEAKER_14]: early finishers and, um, very hardy
plants.
[SPEAKER_14]: So that was kind of like my first edition
on my, what I was trying to breed for this
[SPEAKER_14]: area.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, then kind of threw together some,
uh, really deep OG lines with the FOTIA
[SPEAKER_14]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, came to this farm, kind of started a
new awakening and passion for this plan
[SPEAKER_14]: after taking about a good year off from
before we got the 7,200 square foot spot,
[SPEAKER_14]: um, up and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_14]: So now we're excited because we just
popped about 700 plus seeds and just
[SPEAKER_14]: lost the mix of, Oh, I must've lost it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_15]: We lost you at the seven, 700 seeds.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: So now, uh, with this 700 seed project,
hopefully this will give everybody a good
[SPEAKER_14]: view into what we're working with moving
forward.
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, so the selection that we'll be using
will be from that 700 plus seed hunt.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're really excited to see what this,
uh, results should be.
[SPEAKER_14]: Cause, uh, we're, we're really fresh and
working with it now as it is.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, we'll be, you know, pushing these
strains moving forward.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I'm, I think it'll be fun to see the
test results and see how people do with
[SPEAKER_14]: them.
[SPEAKER_14]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, John, you got anything to add?
[SPEAKER_15]: No, I mean, for me, it's kind of like,
obviously I started smoking really young,
[SPEAKER_15]: started slinging, um, originally from
Boston, started slinging packs in college.
[SPEAKER_15]: So kind of giving the kids in the area,
something good, um, used to go up to Maine
[SPEAKER_15]: to grab the stuff.
[SPEAKER_15]: I ended up moving up there kind of,
um, passionate about the plant.
[SPEAKER_15]: So ended up hooking up with Jason and we
just, you know, this is our passion
[SPEAKER_15]: project and we've taken our time for the
last two years building the place out,
[SPEAKER_15]: making sure everything was done right.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, you know, making the decision to pop
the seeds was the best thing we ever did
[SPEAKER_15]: because we didn't have to worry about
anything going around.
[SPEAKER_15]: Um, and we don't have to worry about
taking anyone's cuts into to get going and
[SPEAKER_15]: then end up with a virus or bugs or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_15]: So it was a good decision.
[SPEAKER_15]: We're just excited to kind of be part of
this thing, right.
[SPEAKER_15]: And, um, you know, June 25th at urban
garden centers in Maine, we're going to
[SPEAKER_15]: have an awesome drop.
[SPEAKER_15]: So we're looking forward to it,
seeing what everyone grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm right after Maine,
I'm scooting right down to Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, but I will say our Maine signups,
I know there are like thousands of growers
[SPEAKER_00]: in Maine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I don't know where they're at yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to hustle some, some Mainers out
to pick these cuts up.
[SPEAKER_14]: So yeah, maybe some more post and
marketing on our end and we can get them
[SPEAKER_14]: things kicked up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_14]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maine's been bugging us to come there for
years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this should be a good turnout once
they, uh, get signed up and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So after Maine, I'm scooting right down to
Worcester mass, uh, where our breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, fat cat select seeds is providing the
cut this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome Travis.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think you're muted.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're muted, Travis.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_13]: That better.
[SPEAKER_13]: So like Adam said, I'm Travis from fat cat
select seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, my brother Ian and I, uh, do all the
breeding, the whole, everything right from
[SPEAKER_13]: start to finish.
[SPEAKER_13]: We, um, we called it select seeds because
we actually, um, individually look at
[SPEAKER_13]: every single seed before we sell and
package them.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so they've been all hand selected
every single one.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so to get to a brief history,
um, we grew up on Martha's vineyard,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, which is an island off the coast of
Maine.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, we've been isolated for years and
years and years away from the rest of the
[SPEAKER_13]: world, really for genetics.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and we still are, uh, really out here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, people really don't know what's going
on with the new strains, um, anything
[SPEAKER_13]: that's happening out there with the
popularity.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, things have kind of evolved a
little differently out here.
[SPEAKER_13]: I can say from the beginning of breeding,
it's been growing up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Wasn't me who started, it was the previous
generation.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, who showed me how to, um, make seeds
at our young age, how to, um, select the
[SPEAKER_13]: better plants, how to, um, you know,
pick the best ones and go forward with
[SPEAKER_13]: them.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, so, uh, we've always been interested
in, uh, breeding genetics, uh,
[SPEAKER_13]: right from the beginning, not only in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, I've done breeding in other fruits,
vegetables, and things like that.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so cannabis has always been very fun
though, and sometimes something that out
[SPEAKER_13]: here, um, genetics were very hard to come
by.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, so you collected them as best you
could.
[SPEAKER_13]: You, uh, when you found something,
you saved it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, you tried to keep your clones,
you tried to keep your seeds as,
[SPEAKER_13]: as best you can because you do not want to
lose them because sometimes they're almost
[SPEAKER_13]: impossible to replace.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, now that, you know, things have
changed a little bit, we can, uh,
[SPEAKER_13]: access strains and clones through these
places all over the world.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, it's a lot easier with legalization
and, um, with the way things are going.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, so, you know, right from the beginning
of legalization, we were interested in
[SPEAKER_13]: having our strains tested.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the first thing we did.
[SPEAKER_13]: We wanted to know what we were growing.
[SPEAKER_13]: We wanted to know what our THC percentages
were, what our terpenes were.
[SPEAKER_13]: We wanted to know what plants we liked,
uh, what we didn't, why we liked them.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, there were some plants, you know,
you just don't know what terpenes are in
[SPEAKER_13]: them until you have them tested.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when you do, uh, then you know.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, which is why, uh, you know,
the grow off is really, really a great
[SPEAKER_13]: competition.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's really in, in, in reality,
the greatest phenotype hunt of all,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, considering that the phenotype is just
the, um, environmental expressions of the
[SPEAKER_13]: plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: So each individual clone would be the
genotype, but the phenotype is up to each
[SPEAKER_13]: individual grower to create on their own
through their fertilizer and their grow
[SPEAKER_13]: rooms.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, so it's the ultimate contest really.
[SPEAKER_13]: The, the top that you could do to be a
grower.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, people say phenotype hunt,
but, uh, phenotype hunt is really,
[SPEAKER_13]: um, the same clone grown differently.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, when you're searching through seeds,
it's really a genotype hunt, but,
[SPEAKER_13]: um, it's really just a common word that's
kind of misconception.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, um, you know, creating genotypes is,
uh, what we do, what we look for.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, we tick, uh, basically look to create,
uh, what we call apex strains.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, an apex strain, I would consider a
strain that, uh, best represents the
[SPEAKER_13]: characteristics of, uh, whatever you're
looking to do.
[SPEAKER_13]: Say it's a blueberry or bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, you're looking to make the best,
best tasting, best characteristics of
[SPEAKER_13]: blueberry that you can find.
[SPEAKER_13]: And it may not be everybody's favorite.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, that's where the breeder comes in.
[SPEAKER_13]: Uh, the breeder picks his favorite.
[SPEAKER_13]: And, uh, when a breeder gets a reputation
locally or wherever, people trust in your
[SPEAKER_13]: nose, your, what you pick, what you like
for your plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you get a following and, um,
that's really how it started with,
[SPEAKER_13]: uh, fat cat and breeding was, um,
a following of people and wanting to make
[SPEAKER_13]: better strains.
[SPEAKER_13]: Um, and ones that were true to how you
wanted them to taste.
[SPEAKER_13]: If I bought blueberry seeds, I want them
to taste like blueberry and good
[SPEAKER_13]: blueberry.
[SPEAKER_13]: And if I buy bubblegum, it should taste
like bubblegum.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, uh, I really liked the classic
strains, creating them, recreating them,
[SPEAKER_13]: and, uh, trying to make them, um,
as best as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Sam, I love that because, um,
blueberry, I started in the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: co-founding a seed company and we create,
or we reproduced, uh, DJ short's blueberry
[SPEAKER_00]: is one of our first packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was, that's a killer strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you, Travis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, I'm sorry, I think we got,
um, mixed up adding questions from the
[SPEAKER_00]: chat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll, uh, start doing a round table,
but we have one more breeder to introduce,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, last and certainly not least.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so excited for this one because at the
end of the season, we're all going to need
[SPEAKER_00]: a vacation and, uh, we're going to come
visit Jason on Oahu for our very first
[SPEAKER_00]: Hawaii grow off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So welcome Jason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Aloha.
[SPEAKER_11]: Aloha everybody.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I'm honored to be here.
[SPEAKER_11]: Humble, great people are around us.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're just seeing this over and over
again in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_11]: this really cool connection, whether it's
Instagram or whatever, it's all coming
[SPEAKER_11]: together.
[SPEAKER_11]: That used to be old smugglers,
old growers, old breeders, um,
[SPEAKER_11]: all that good stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's super fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, it's just such a euphoric life
nowadays.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're kind of stuck in time a little bit,
but we're getting there.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're still at a stacking license kind of
formula.
[SPEAKER_11]: So you can grow 10 plants per person and
there's no limit to where you can,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, how many plants, how many cards you
can have at a site.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, they've tried to control that and try
to regulate it and try to enforce it,
[SPEAKER_11]: but it's never worked.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've officially become the largest
patient based farm in Hawaii with over
[SPEAKER_11]: 2000 patients on our farm.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, it's happening because we have
dispensers that are open that aren't
[SPEAKER_11]: providing, um, affordable medicine,
good medicine, and access to medicine for
[SPEAKER_11]: medical patients.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, uh, that's where we came along.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, you know, started rolling with the
affordable ounce.
[SPEAKER_11]: We call it the $150 onion.
[SPEAKER_11]: So kind of exciting.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and then we bring, you know,
blueberry back into the picture and man,
[SPEAKER_11]: a good blueberry is hard to beat,
man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I remember I was in Vancouver about 10
years ago and Mark Emory was kind of doing
[SPEAKER_11]: his thing and there was a lot of short
blueberry around, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: And when you hit that thing, man,
you better hold on, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think it would just kind of get you all
like, Whoa, reset.
[SPEAKER_11]: So very excited.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, we reached out to Sam to grow off
because we're just trying to get people.
[SPEAKER_11]: Connected here, empowered, working with
policy makers, getting the growers out of
[SPEAKER_11]: the closet to recognize that, Hey,
if we don't do something here,
[SPEAKER_11]: we're going to run into a lot of problems.
[SPEAKER_11]: Other States are having where their big
business is going to take over and control
[SPEAKER_11]: our growth sites and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're moving pretty fast here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we're doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're, we're lobbying, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're trying to open up thousands of
local based cooperatives, rosin makers,
[SPEAKER_11]: everything around here.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're, we're just following Maine.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what we're trying to do right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm trying to throw Maine on them as
hard as we can.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a medical program here.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's pretty much a failure.
[SPEAKER_11]: It was established in the year 2000.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know if you guys do, but Hawaii
was the first place to pass medical
[SPEAKER_11]: cannabis and the last place to get
dispensary 16 years later.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's always been a conundrum.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, but yeah, so we met Sam and we just,
I said, Hey, well let's just try and get a
[SPEAKER_11]: little grow off going here and see what we
can do in Oahu.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, I'm not a breeder.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have bred many times before,
but I would definitely not call myself a
[SPEAKER_11]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm definitely a grower.
[SPEAKER_11]: We have about a 20,000 square foot site
here without, like I said, 2000 patients.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, my grow off kind of plant and what
we're going with was a humbling experience
[SPEAKER_11]: by meeting, um, King Lancelot the eighth,
which was a, uh, in the eighth generation
[SPEAKER_11]: of King Kamehameha that was still alive.
[SPEAKER_11]: And he passed away a couple of years ago
from cancer and handed me some seeds.
[SPEAKER_11]: I can't tell you what they were because
then I'll give it away.
[SPEAKER_11]: But, uh, um, there was some special stuff
in it.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we ran about a hundred seeds and we
found some really cool old school stuff in
[SPEAKER_11]: it, some blueberry and some cheesy stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so that's kind of what we're going
with right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're going to try and run, um,
those clones and then kind of like any
[SPEAKER_11]: memory of King Lancelot.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of how we're rolling with
it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, we're really excited.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's definitely an old mercy and pining
old school strain for sure.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, there's something going on with it
and, uh, I haven't smelled that smell in a
[SPEAKER_11]: long time.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that's kind of what we're up to and
what we're excited about, um, in a,
[SPEAKER_11]: in a short story.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's I'm so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason's like so good at just driving
community around just what he's doing and
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing growers in and where you're
throwing a party during our clone drop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that'll be fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, we do.
[SPEAKER_11]: We try to run a couple, uh, patient
awareness days or patient appreciation
[SPEAKER_11]: days.
[SPEAKER_11]: Cause the patients are what makes our
site.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just been insane.
[SPEAKER_11]: You guys seeing people come through the
gate and just saying, Hey, we don't have
[SPEAKER_11]: access to medicine.
[SPEAKER_11]: And we're like, here you go.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now we've got a lot of great things on
our side.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, we don't see crazy narcotics
compliance check.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's all gone now.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we've really found the right people,
the right lawyers, the right lobbyists to
[SPEAKER_11]: really take control of this and start
driving in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_11]: So people are not suffering.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: There's there's so, you know, I'm sure a
lot of you guys started like I did just
[SPEAKER_11]: growing wheat for our friends and having
fun and really not understanding maybe in
[SPEAKER_11]: my opinion, the whole medicinal effect of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: And now that you start seeing people
coming through the gate, they can't sleep
[SPEAKER_11]: at night and doing this and doing that and
trying to find a remedy for them.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's totally transformed me as a person.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, it's, it's, it's bad ass.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, it's just exciting.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, um, and it gives you a lot of
leverage to kind of go back to the people,
[SPEAKER_11]: the lobbyists in our state or the
politicians in our state that are still
[SPEAKER_11]: stuck in the reefer madness world and just
going, Hey, you're looking at it all the
[SPEAKER_11]: wrong way.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got people suffering out here and you
need to move quickly.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and so, yeah, we do not on a
tangent, but we do.
[SPEAKER_11]: We did our first medical, uh, patient day,
uh, about a month ago, had about 400
[SPEAKER_11]: people and had some live, uh, local reggae
stars and legal Jordy, some fun stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: And it went, I, it was, you know how it
is, you guys, when you get these things
[SPEAKER_11]: together and they're safe and sound and
people walking around with joints in their
[SPEAKER_11]: mouth and don't fear, uh, persecution,
it's just, it's just iry.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just so empowering.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're hoping to have this next one on
another party.
[SPEAKER_11]: July 9th.
[SPEAKER_11]: Um, and, uh, hand out some clones and see
what we can go on on here.
[SPEAKER_11]: We got a shitload of growers in Hawaii,
tons of them.
[SPEAKER_11]: They're all hiding out and starting to
make their way forward.
[SPEAKER_11]: And, uh, we're actually even starting to
kind of who we have to kind of gang up
[SPEAKER_11]: with them to get their flower to our farm,
to kind of showcase them and start
[SPEAKER_11]: branding them for the future.
[SPEAKER_11]: So when things kind of opened up,
they already have a great name and
[SPEAKER_11]: they're, they're well known and,
and they can make their living off this
[SPEAKER_11]: one.
[SPEAKER_11]: Wonderful plant and still help people.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, since, uh, you're the last clone
drop of the season, I would, I'll invite
[SPEAKER_00]: like everyone on the call.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're participating in the grow off,
like let's go to this party together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll hand out some clones and you've all
earned it after all the hard work that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're putting into doing this for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, please let's go.
[SPEAKER_11]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you guys, you guys can pitch a tent.
[SPEAKER_11]: Don't even get a hotel room.
[SPEAKER_11]: Just come up and stay on the farm and kick
it and have fun.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you guys are all welcome, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's really, you know, I'm very familiar
with a lot of the breeders on this,
[SPEAKER_11]: uh, podcast right now and a lot of new
ones and you guys see what's happening.
[SPEAKER_11]: You got to have breeders.
[SPEAKER_11]: You can trust that you can get clones and
seeds from, uh, the seed industry is just
[SPEAKER_11]: out of control.
[SPEAKER_11]: So it's nice that we're all starting to
wrap up and kind of gain energy together.
[SPEAKER_11]: So we get legitimacy and saying,
Hey, you know, this is the real deal.
[SPEAKER_11]: We, I got it right here.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, it just like, whether it's a cut
from Mendo or, you know, you're,
[SPEAKER_11]: it's really exciting.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: So we're, we're excited and we love
bringing genetics in and there's
[SPEAKER_11]: definitely a lot of Hawaii genetics,
but as you guys know, cannabis didn't show
[SPEAKER_11]: up to Hawaii till like the late fifties,
early sixties surfers, Vietnam vets.
[SPEAKER_11]: So, you know, all the strains are from
outside of Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_11]: Uh, although they've been here for a
little while.
[SPEAKER_11]: So there's still some hidden stuff around,
you know, and, um, and a lot of it lost as
[SPEAKER_11]: well.
[SPEAKER_11]: And you'll hear every story from someone
here who had grew as a kid.
[SPEAKER_11]: I mean, this place is just a cannabis
kingdom.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's amazing to see like talk to people
who are my age or older that were growing
[SPEAKER_11]: Durbin hash plant and sugar cane fields in
the sixties or seventies.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and you're like, what was that
all about?
[SPEAKER_11]: You know, and those seeds aren't around
anymore, but you kind of kind of know
[SPEAKER_11]: probably what they were fooling with,
with some of the old legends in place and
[SPEAKER_11]: the creators of Durbin poison and some of
the Gannies that were being smuggled over
[SPEAKER_11]: here and closed from back in the day from
some of the legends.
[SPEAKER_11]: So yeah, it's really, it's really
exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hopefully some of you guys can come
out and join us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if not, we're actually doing for the
first time ever, all of the awards are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be in Vegas on November 15th.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like the first night of the big
convention that we don't have to tag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, so yeah, November 15th, we'll be
announcing winners from all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: States, uh, at a private party in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're participating in the grow off,
you have free entry.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these guys will hopefully be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll also be live streaming and
Peter, maybe we'll do it on here so that
[SPEAKER_00]: folks can watch and see who won from all
these awesome States and someone at the
end of the year.
So I'm excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to start with a question that
I got asked who can enter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I made a point in the last two
years to make sure we could open this up
[SPEAKER_00]: to home, grow caregivers, not just
commercial farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We originally started, it was just
commercial and then realized that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the home, grow caregiver market
is huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them want employment in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so by going through a grow off and
some of them don't, which is totally fine,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they also grow higher weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we figured, um, if we can get the
home, grow market participating,
[SPEAKER_00]: they have a resume item if they win and
then, uh, they can kind of move themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: up in the industry if they choose to,
but they are also, their test scores are
[SPEAKER_00]: off the charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, in, I think every single one of
these States home, grow caregivers open,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, depending on metric transfer stuff,
a commercial might not be available in
[SPEAKER_00]: your state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so yeah, Val, you should definitely
enter because, uh, home grow is available
[SPEAKER_00]: in all of the States that we're in this
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what should we chat about boys?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, what questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a question about how many males you
go through before you choose one to breed
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone want to chime in?
[SPEAKER_13]: You go through until you find what you're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_09]: How many do you have?
[SPEAKER_14]: You got the space and the time.
[SPEAKER_14]: You'll see it when you know, like that
structure that stem rub, um, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: they'll just the way the leaf complexion
of the leaf, the waxiness of the plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: You can see like how like the plant health
overall, based on how you're feeding or
[SPEAKER_14]: really kind of dictate what sort of
expressions you might be able to pull out
[SPEAKER_14]: of it too.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, and always like, I always just try
and make sure that people finish those
[SPEAKER_14]: males.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like don't just wait until they dry.
[SPEAKER_14]: Drop, but see what they do when they're
done, you know?
[SPEAKER_14]: Um, but you don't have the space for it
and can't get it, you know, can't get it
[SPEAKER_14]: segregated from any place.
[SPEAKER_14]: It shouldn't have seeds in it.
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously that's a little tough,
but.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think if you have the opportunity
being able to see the male plant flower
[SPEAKER_09]: out to completion before you, uh,
ever hit it to another girl really is a,
[SPEAKER_09]: a really beneficial thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a lot of things that you see
during that process that you don't see
[SPEAKER_09]: otherwise.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't see how the plant expresses or
you don't see how the plant like really,
[SPEAKER_09]: uh, continues to stack flowers unless you
really run that male completion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm, I'm also a big firm believer of
putting them on revenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let them finish and reimagine them and
you know, you'll find out a lot about them
[SPEAKER_03]: too and bring things.
[SPEAKER_14]: And a lot of it comes down to looking at
the progeny and like what came out of
[SPEAKER_14]: that, you know, is like with the magnum
opus breed.
[SPEAKER_14]: So one of the magnum really pulled through
every one of the crosses.
[SPEAKER_14]: There wasn't one real dominant female out
of that group until I selected further for
[SPEAKER_14]: a male that would actually pass those
traits.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, um, that really kind of, you know,
time effort and your dedication to what
[SPEAKER_14]: you're really looking for, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: None of us can read the future.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so like if you don't watch the progeny
and you don't see which traits are
[SPEAKER_09]: dominant, then you have no idea like what
we're moving with in the first place.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a mystery pond that, you know,
it's like, there's so many different areas
[SPEAKER_14]: you could go, especially with the Polly's
and the hybrids out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: Just there's so much variation and
recessive dominance, especially once you
[SPEAKER_14]: start talking about the filial generations
and moving further into the line.
[SPEAKER_05]: I would definitely a stress test as well
with certain strands.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the smallest amount of stress will
cause it to harm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you pretty much promote that into
the progeny, into the next generation.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something I want to promote into
the next generation seeds of definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: stress testing for as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: So like treat them like shit, absolute
garbage.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, to me that is testing, you know,
testing is treating them like shit and
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing what they can do with, because at
the end of the day, you know, like you can
[SPEAKER_09]: be the best girl in the world and get my
seeds or you can be the worst girl in the
[SPEAKER_09]: world and get my seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not going to know what you are.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just going to sell you the pack of
seeds.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we're going to find out
afterwards when you do your stress test.
[SPEAKER_14]: And not every time I've been styled in
either, you know, you got to kind of play
[SPEAKER_14]: to the environment and actually like,
you know, look a little bit deeper than
[SPEAKER_14]: just how the plant reacted.
[SPEAKER_14]: And maybe take a look at what you did to
that plant through that situation.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like I'm not always look, I feel like a
lot of times people come up with excuses
[SPEAKER_14]: for the plant or why it didn't work for
them, where they might be needing to look
[SPEAKER_14]: at why you didn't work for the point.
[SPEAKER_02]: And don't be afraid to throw stuff away
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't hang on to everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of it, you know, it isn't special.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they all are special, you hang on to
them, but don't get attached to them,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, if they're not.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it's not no game changing, like terpene
profile or like yield or anything else
[SPEAKER_05]: like that, then it's probably not worth
keeping around.
[SPEAKER_05]: You only want the stuff that's mind
blowing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got to do all the things.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got a veg well, it's got a clone
well, it's got a flower well, it's got to
[SPEAKER_09]: give badass bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got to smell good.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got to get you higher than shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's got to do it all.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sometimes you're always at and that
doesn't mean that it's always going to win
[SPEAKER_05]: trains.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like it'll take three weeks, almost a
month.
[SPEAKER_05]: They grow like absolute dog shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's hard to grow that the terpene
profile is what makes it stick around.
[SPEAKER_05]: No other train has won more awards than
the Seagulls did in one year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just based off of the terpene profile,
it's a smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's pretty much like very hard to grow,
but now everything should be a
[SPEAKER_05]: commercially viable strain for it to stick
around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cause it's a lot, a lot of them aren't
commercially viable unless they're higher.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got to earn those terps.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hey guys, back to males and females.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm right at the beginning to know what
you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you don't know what you want,
what you want to create, what you're
[SPEAKER_13]: looking for, you're just looking to choose
the one that maybe impresses you the best
[SPEAKER_13]: one of the bunch.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you know what you're looking for,
then you know what to pick.
[SPEAKER_13]: We use a method where we grade every
single plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: We give it a one to 10 score.
[SPEAKER_13]: We do it sometimes every two days.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll give a score on its stock smell,
on its leaf smell, its resin production,
[SPEAKER_13]: its node spacing, vigor and size,
its resin smell, its flower size,
[SPEAKER_13]: compactness, all of the different
characteristics of the plant throughout
[SPEAKER_13]: its flower.
[SPEAKER_13]: Every two days, we'll give it a grade.
[SPEAKER_13]: By the end of the flower, you've got an
average of 15 different gradings for each
[SPEAKER_13]: plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: You average out all those grades and it's
a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_13]: The top one sticks out guaranteed every
single time because you rated it maybe a
[SPEAKER_13]: couple of times and it gets a nine or 10
every time for smell.
[SPEAKER_13]: It gets a seven or eight for resin,
whatever you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd like to add to that too, to be careful
if you're a grower and want to become a
[SPEAKER_11]: breeder.
[SPEAKER_11]: Here's your people right here giving you a
warning, man.
[SPEAKER_11]: Breeding is no joke.
[SPEAKER_11]: You want to reach out to the breeder.
[SPEAKER_11]: If you're a grower, you want to get your
stuff from the breeder.
[SPEAKER_11]: You don't want to be a breeder grower.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm reaching out to the breeders.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what they specialize in.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's what they're taking all the
meticulous notes and trying to find all
[SPEAKER_11]: the great crosses.
[SPEAKER_11]: You will save yourself a lot of time and
frustration by just reaching out to your
[SPEAKER_11]: badass breeder.
[SPEAKER_14]: Once you breed it, you're still looking at
a good six months of a year before you
[SPEAKER_14]: even really get a good look at it.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's time and dedication right there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a long process and a lot of
heartache.
[SPEAKER_10]: Throwing a lot of the crazy shit away.
[SPEAKER_03]: If people knew what we got rid of,
they'd probably peel over in the chair.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've just got done doing this 700 seed
hunt and I'm still having trouble trying
[SPEAKER_14]: to find which ones I need to trash.
[SPEAKER_14]: We built the Ferrari, so now it's time to
drive this thing and start making the hard
[SPEAKER_14]: choices.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you hunt for that, you can pretty
much almost guarantee that whatever you
[SPEAKER_05]: select is going to defy almost any change.
[SPEAKER_05]: When people are doing pheno hunts that
large, I tell them, keep the number on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Australia's GG for Wi-Fi 53.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just like Bruce Banner 3, the number
definitely does help.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you see Magnum Opus number 456,
they're going to be like, well,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's the best cone out of any one that
anybody could possibly find because they
[SPEAKER_05]: went through that many seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: The process of running back said once that
you want to keep.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another year running back two or
three times to know what you're really
[SPEAKER_03]: working with.
[SPEAKER_14]: Here's a question that I've always had and
wanted to ask other readers.
[SPEAKER_14]: Do you guys find your better expressions
or truer expressions to your seeds or it's
[SPEAKER_14]: from your clone testing?
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like seed runs are always the best
run, but I feel like you get the honest
[SPEAKER_03]: expression when you're on your second,
third run.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's where I've been at.
[SPEAKER_14]: I've been trying to stay away from my
actual seed hunts and actually do my first
[SPEAKER_14]: clone hunts as well.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's what you're going to get in a
commercial garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're never going to run that seed run
again.
[SPEAKER_09]: You only get one shot at it.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you don't have something that does good
in the clone generation, then you're
[SPEAKER_09]: screwed afterwards.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've actually been taking clones off of
said seed plant and running that first.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what I've been finding that's
worked really well for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he was just saying I'm holding all
those clones back as the process goes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now in this day and age, we've got our
tissue culture lab set up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just tissue culture everything and
it takes up zero floor space for me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can just eliminate them out of the
refrigerator as we go.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a little bit of a
micro-propagation.
[SPEAKER_05]: This much space is like 700 for you.
[SPEAKER_11]: I just kind of fucking say I love you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: If we sell 10 seeds in a pack,
that's all I ever do a hunt with.
[SPEAKER_13]: For the throw-off, 10 seed packs,
sprout 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: You've got to trust in the genetics.
[SPEAKER_13]: A lot of people come and they think
they're impressive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five thousand.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes you should got to trust if
you're selling someone a six pack of
[SPEAKER_13]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five thousand.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes you've got to trust if you're
selling someone a six pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: A hundred percent trust in the genetics.
[SPEAKER_13]: With a six pack of seeds, they're going to
come up with something that's top,
[SPEAKER_13]: top quality.
[SPEAKER_14]: Hands down.
[SPEAKER_14]: When we bought 700 seeds, that was 50
different strains.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: You have one strain.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, 10 seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: If it's a quality cross and quality
genetics, you really shouldn't have to go
[SPEAKER_13]: through that many to get a really,
really top, top notch.
[SPEAKER_14]: I say that, but I do like three,
four, five packs of some people's gear
[SPEAKER_14]: just to find that one.
[SPEAKER_14]: They do exist.
[SPEAKER_14]: You're going to find out of every pack,
you're going to find a good expression out
[SPEAKER_14]: of 50, 50 parents, maybe some of the
mother dominance, or maybe some of the
[SPEAKER_14]: male's dominance.
[SPEAKER_14]: We can sit here and say that you can find
fire in a pack, but to find one that's
[SPEAKER_14]: going to hit all expression, whether it's
nose, look, bag appeal, smell,
[SPEAKER_14]: taste, growth rates, veg.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's going to take a little bit more
digging than just one pack.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't care whose pack of seeds I'm going
through.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes it takes a while.
[SPEAKER_13]: When they go through a thousand,
700 seeds, you guarantee you found a good
[SPEAKER_13]: one.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, when I had a thousand seed plant,
in the past, I found like 10 expressions
[SPEAKER_09]: of 10 things.
[SPEAKER_09]: There would be one phenome, phenotype,
or one expression that I would see 20
[SPEAKER_09]: times, a hundred times, 50 times,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it would be like six or seven
different things that I would see across
[SPEAKER_09]: the whole thousand.
[SPEAKER_09]: Then it was really just about picking out
of those six and seven things,
[SPEAKER_09]: which is the winner of the six and seven.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think the point is that you're going to
find bomb seeds from a great breeder.
[SPEAKER_11]: We can go back as early as Reserva
Provoda, and Taiwako Jeans and stuff.
[SPEAKER_11]: Can you get a 10 pack of that,
man?
[SPEAKER_11]: It's just like, oh shit, this is crazy.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: Just game changers.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those Reserva packs, those Reserva packs,
you had six seeds and every one of them
[SPEAKER_14]: was the same.
[SPEAKER_14]: There was some homoidea in those packs,
like the Beverly stuff.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't want to say nothing, but it ain't
what you say.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bob, let me just talk real quick.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's messed up is that back in the day,
people used to actually really breed
[SPEAKER_05]: specific strains, go into the work,
go to like F4, BX5, whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now it just seems because the end user's
demand is changing so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it doesn't load on Instagram,
if it doesn't load on Instagram,
[SPEAKER_05]: then they don't want it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's like, most people, there's almost
no end of it that takes so long to like
[SPEAKER_05]: BX5 or something like that because
people's demand keeps changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Instagram keeps making everybody's demand
change so fast by the time you work with a
[SPEAKER_05]: specific strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not even public anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's hard to get three different strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Short term thinking though.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's short term thinking, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Instagram is only the visual component of
ganja and you can smell it and you can
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke it and it changes you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Breeders just have to be partly crazy
because you have to know that you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: on this 10 year journey to be an old ass
man by the time you get to whatever you're
[SPEAKER_02]: creating.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all depends on what your trying to
create because then it tells you if you
[SPEAKER_02]: need a million males or a hundred females
or you're doing acres or whatever you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking for because sometimes you're
looking for that really rare thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes you're trying to prove your
consistency.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like the 10 pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty fair way to look at it
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't see how rare, I don't see how many
great tips we're going to find to keep
[SPEAKER_05]: across Gelato back to Gelato without.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know if we're going to go nowhere.
[SPEAKER_14]: But the breeder shortcuts, you know,
cookies and Gelato.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, that's the thing though.
[SPEAKER_09]: As Cesar pointed out, the Instagram thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we look at what the consumer is
trying to really get these days,
[SPEAKER_09]: they want that Gelato times Gelato times
Gelato times Gelato times cookies.
[SPEAKER_09]: For whatever reason, that's what they
want.
[SPEAKER_09]: But at the end of the day, the people that
are on this call are generally not
[SPEAKER_09]: interested in Gelato times Gelato.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't forget about 50% THC too.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, when it's 40% Terps and 50% THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: It does happen to me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that's what's really cool about
Breeder 2 is when you get that pack and
[SPEAKER_11]: there is a homodony, then you know it's
been done right.
[SPEAKER_11]: You just know, hey man, if I'm going to
ban or pack them, I'm getting this.
[SPEAKER_11]: I know I'm going to get something right in
this joint.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what people are watching this.
[SPEAKER_11]: Be careful who you're working with and how
you're selecting seeds because the
[SPEAKER_11]: market's wide open right now.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think this is the most important
part of bringing the Breeders together to
[SPEAKER_11]: go, hey, who's doing what and who's
putting the time in so they get paid
[SPEAKER_11]: properly and announced properly.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: That's really important.
[SPEAKER_13]: To get purple to breed in and the reds,
we just came out with a brand new red
[SPEAKER_13]: flower.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a lot of time and a lot of hard work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we are all crazy.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we're also holders and protectors of
the seeds, so we all have to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this was a feat to bring you all
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you for doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter, I don't know if we're already
cutting this at four.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep going.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually got to bounce my AC guys
there to put in some new ACs.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I got to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I appreciate this.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm excited to see what goes on in every
state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we should definitely all think about
what we can do together to swap or make
[SPEAKER_03]: some shit for next year's Girl Offs and
then next year's Girl Offs after that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that would be really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so much more organic and so much
better than high times or any of that
[SPEAKER_03]: shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't wait to see where this actually
goes in the next five, 10 years,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And to be clear, I want to work with all
of you guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if the possibility is there,
hit me up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want to do this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's have some good community members.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see what we can do.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I can say we're better together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Teamwork makes the dream work,
baby.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that being said, our entry fee this
year is 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be hundreds of dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just said, let's get as many hours
as we possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bye, Ross.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Appreciate it all, y'all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all I've got in touch.
[SPEAKER_14]: You got it, man.
[SPEAKER_14]: Have a great day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, we need to hop up too.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_17]: I just want to let everyone watch.
[SPEAKER_17]: We gotta go.
Bye.
[SPEAKER_17]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter, join me for the end of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's space on the call now,
Peter.
[SPEAKER_09]: We get to see your smiling face.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's up, Peter?
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was just trying to say,
like you said, we don't have any female
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic partners on the call.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see more women wearing our
wrestling belts for your championship.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a social equity grant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're looking for more BIPOC
women-owned veteran.
[SPEAKER_00]: Previous incarceration entries get 50%
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: A $50 entry fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want as many people doing this as
possible because you can see just from the
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic side of things, this is a
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do is get growers together
within their own communities and then
[SPEAKER_00]: connect state to state until it's
federally legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we can do one all together with
the conglomerate that you guys all make
[SPEAKER_00]: together from all the different strains.
[SPEAKER_13]: Everybody knows seeds are federally legal,
right?
[SPEAKER_13]: So we can now send them to the mail.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can send them to the U.S.
[SPEAKER_13]: Postal Service.
[SPEAKER_13]: You can bring them on planes and on boats.
[SPEAKER_09]: I definitely never did that before.
[SPEAKER_11]: Let's remember all of our badass growers
are incarcerated right now, too.
[SPEAKER_11]: So let's get them out of there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Peter, do we have any other questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, let me just mute.
[SPEAKER_16]: I'm going to mute everyone for a second.
[SPEAKER_16]: And then, all right, so evidently the
audio is a little better.
[SPEAKER_16]: And as I was joking, the people on YouTube
probably didn't appreciate it,
[SPEAKER_16]: but I was like, it sounds great in the
stream yard.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yeah, I think, well, from me, I mean,
the first two people kind of talked about
[SPEAKER_16]: like themselves, like they're kind of
intent as breeders and kind of if we could
[SPEAKER_16]: just quickly go around everyone else.
[SPEAKER_16]: And, you know, I breed for medical.
[SPEAKER_16]: I breed for, you know, I play with land
race.
[SPEAKER_16]: I breed for the hype market.
[SPEAKER_16]: I, you know, like specific terpene
profiles and I breed for kind of what I
[SPEAKER_16]: like.
[SPEAKER_16]: And this is what I personally like.
[SPEAKER_16]: You guys can just kind of go around the
horn or Jason, since you don't breed,
[SPEAKER_16]: what do you like to smoke?
[SPEAKER_11]: Personally, you know, you guys are going
to laugh.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm like an old hippie green crack guy,
man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know, but I'm just a goofy.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like that goofy high, you know,
I mean, I can, I can throw them down,
[SPEAKER_11]: but I'm more of a green crack kind of
goofy guy.
[SPEAKER_11]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: A lot of stuff strong, a little strong for
me.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm, you know, I'm not quite the smoke dog
I used to be, but yeah, I would say the
[SPEAKER_11]: skunks man.
[SPEAKER_11]: I love the skunks and some, some of the
skunks in the little show a little more
[SPEAKER_11]: sativa and I'm, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_11]: And yeah, anybody got any of that green
crack?
[SPEAKER_11]: I'd love to see that again.
[SPEAKER_11]: So the original.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're up.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, our project has always been
to breed for hash.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we, we breed mostly for terpenes and
secondary cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_09]: The like, and then how that presents into
extracts is, is really what, what our
[SPEAKER_09]: interest level has been for, for the last
many years.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so, you know, a lot of our,
a lot of our stuff has lots of CBD and CBG
[SPEAKER_09]: and THCVA and things like that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, and as a minor cannabinoids,
and then there there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_09]: interesting turpoids or terpenes and
flavonoids that come in our stuff too,
[SPEAKER_09]: so that we can make better tasting hash.
[SPEAKER_16]: And when you do smoke hash, what kind of
flavor profiles do you personally like in
[SPEAKER_09]: hash?
[SPEAKER_09]: I like fruit and weed, I like gas.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know, it kind of depends on what
I'm going for, but you know, as,
[SPEAKER_09]: especially rosins and things, lemons and
berries are where it's at for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's my turn.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are my favorite turps?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the question?
[SPEAKER_16]: No, just kind of what, I mean,
that's part of it, but kind of what,
[SPEAKER_16]: what do you breed for?
[SPEAKER_16]: Like, what do you like to explore and
focus on in your projects?
[SPEAKER_16]: And then personally, what do you like
smoking?
[SPEAKER_05]: So currently right now I have a spritzer.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the 2020 grow off strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is a strain that I'm in the process
of making a feminized seeds from.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I reverse the spritzer and I'm going to
make a bunch of new crosses.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I had in mind for this was making
a hash line.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like spritzer is known to wash like around
six or 7% return with some crazy high
[SPEAKER_05]: return on the press.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I pretty much wanted to make a line
that's going to be pretty much hash
[SPEAKER_05]: washers, unique turf profiles,
breeding strain specifically for
[SPEAKER_05]: connoisseurs, the aficionados,
the cannabis cognacentis out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I kind of wanted to do some, a little bit
of both, like the cookies to cookies.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the cookies cross to non-cookie
stuff, like OGs and kems and sours and
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff like that and skittles.
[SPEAKER_05]: So try and get some different new turps in
the mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now, the most anticipated one that I
got right now at the top two is probably
[SPEAKER_05]: like the hazelnut cream to spritzer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then the African hazel leaven to
spritzer.
[SPEAKER_05]: That African hazel leaven, if you had
never tried that, that's from a Bronson
[SPEAKER_05]: farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was one of my favorite hazes period,
like an 11, 12 week haze.
[SPEAKER_05]: But this is like amazing flavor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like if you ever heard of PIF or had any
kind of PIF turps, definitely you'd like
[SPEAKER_05]: the African hazel leaven.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that cross to the spritzer should
definitely produce some new, unique turps
[SPEAKER_05]: into the market, which I'm definitely
looking forward to.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hope it wasn't too choppy.
[SPEAKER_13]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_13]: The reason why, what I breed for,
it started out as just, you know,
[SPEAKER_13]: personal satisfaction, the challenge of
making something that was just amazing or
[SPEAKER_13]: not just amazing, maybe even the best.
[SPEAKER_13]: Being from an island, we're very
localized.
[SPEAKER_13]: And when someone has the best,
it spreads really quickly through the
[SPEAKER_13]: whole island that they've got the best.
[SPEAKER_13]: So it's always been fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: And that challenge has always been fun.
[SPEAKER_13]: When people have told me of anything that
you can't grow that, that doesn't grow
[SPEAKER_13]: here.
[SPEAKER_13]: Oh, well, that sounds like a challenge to
me.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sounds like I'm going to grow it.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I grow mainly outdoor.
[SPEAKER_13]: So growing outdoor, I have to grow a huge
variety.
[SPEAKER_13]: The seasons are crazy out here on the
island.
[SPEAKER_13]: The humidity is out of control.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's probably one of the most inhospitable
growing environments in the whole country.
[SPEAKER_13]: So, you know, I have to have up to 18 plus
strains outdoors all times.
[SPEAKER_13]: And at sometimes you'll lose six strains
in full.
[SPEAKER_13]: So breeding has to do a lot with the
finding the strains that work,
[SPEAKER_13]: finding the right ones.
[SPEAKER_13]: And the challenge is always great.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, it's always fun to pick
something and say, I'm going to make this
[SPEAKER_13]: and then go make it.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't find the strands first.
[SPEAKER_13]: Sometimes I pick what I want to make.
[SPEAKER_13]: I want to make something that smells like
bananas.
[SPEAKER_13]: Then I have to go find so many strains to
find the male and the female that actually
[SPEAKER_13]: smell that way to put them together.
[SPEAKER_13]: So breeding, a lot of it is a challenge.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's a lot, the personal satisfaction and
it's the fun of it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Finding something new, something
spectacular when you give it to someone
[SPEAKER_13]: and they go, whoa, it blows their mind.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's why we do it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Well, for me, I'm not much of a breeder
like everybody here.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's a privilege to be even with you
guys.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm more of like your average consumer.
[SPEAKER_12]: You know, I have a few packs from a few of
you guys here.
[SPEAKER_12]: So for me, I just love to hunt.
[SPEAKER_12]: If I do like something that's going to
drive a drop, I'm going to get two packs
[SPEAKER_12]: of it, pop it, see if I can find something
out of two or three packs.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm just that type of consumer.
[SPEAKER_12]: So for me, I'm just having fun,
just looking for those phenos.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's my big thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: Just trying to have fun with it.
[SPEAKER_12]: Popping everybody's seeds.
[SPEAKER_12]: Whenever I get an opportunity to see
somebody's like work, I'll reach out to
[SPEAKER_12]: ask.
[SPEAKER_12]: For me, it doesn't hurt to ask.
[SPEAKER_12]: So whatever's out there, I'm going to ask.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I'm going to try and get it.
[SPEAKER_12]: I've even flown out to California a couple
of times for some clone drops.
[SPEAKER_12]: For me, it's just having fun, man,
and trying to bring that shit over here to
[SPEAKER_12]: like the East Coast side in the DMV area.
[SPEAKER_16]: And what do you personally like to smoke?
[SPEAKER_12]: Right now, I'm honestly stuck on a banana
cream cake crossed with jealousy from a
[SPEAKER_12]: sea junkie.
[SPEAKER_12]: That shit is, shit's fucking crazy.
[SPEAKER_12]: As flour or hash?
[SPEAKER_12]: It's flour, yeah.
[SPEAKER_12]: I went out there and grabbed a clone for
the drop.
[SPEAKER_12]: And yeah, it's probably one of the biggest
positives I've done since I've been
[SPEAKER_12]: growing.
[SPEAKER_12]: So that was a big thing.
[SPEAKER_12]: But yeah, it's really stuck in my library
right now.
[SPEAKER_12]: So it's rotation is heavy.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let me do.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right, so what's going on,
guys?
[SPEAKER_14]: You hear me?
[SPEAKER_14]: The main crew.
[SPEAKER_14]: What's going on, Peter?
[SPEAKER_14]: Can you guys hear me?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, we can hear you, bud.
[SPEAKER_14]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I'm primarily a gashead.
[SPEAKER_14]: I like those OGs, Kims, the sour,
that funk, you know.
[SPEAKER_14]: But lately, I've been really kind of
getting into the Skittle surfs.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's a few cookie runs, crosses that
we've been finding lately in the seed hunt
[SPEAKER_14]: that have really started to open my mind
to those candy turps.
[SPEAKER_14]: Once again, I remember trying that back in
2016 at the animal cup with the turp hogs,
[SPEAKER_14]: kind of threw that out there.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that was one of those turps that just
always stuck with me.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I love the candy turps.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm primarily a gashead.
[SPEAKER_14]: I breed for flavor, pretty much solely.
[SPEAKER_14]: Effect as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're looking for some things that can
help people medicinally.
[SPEAKER_14]: I did a couple CBD projects that really
helped a lot of Crohn's patients.
[SPEAKER_14]: And IBS patients.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we're trying to bring some of that back
as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: But primarily for turps and short
flowering times and hardy plants for this
[SPEAKER_14]: main weather.
[SPEAKER_15]: Yeah, I'm Jason's apprentice.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm kind of like shadowing him through
this whole process, which has been
[SPEAKER_15]: unbelievable to watch.
[SPEAKER_15]: But I'm a big citrus guy and we have some
serious citrus coming down.
[SPEAKER_15]: So I'm looking forward to that.
[SPEAKER_15]: And I've kind of fallen in love with the
kawaii candy from 808.
[SPEAKER_15]: That stuff's like gas candy all day long.
[SPEAKER_15]: So anything with gas or citrus is kind of
my game.
[SPEAKER_15]: And especially on the exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to throw on a hat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone in the comments was like,
I'm going on with no, without a hat on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you got a beard you can throw on too?
[SPEAKER_11]: Keeps the sun off us.
[SPEAKER_11]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll answer what I'm smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously I don't breed because who would
have the time after everything else we're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm preserving some of the hype train
from the last Colorado Cup with some
[SPEAKER_00]: Boveda packs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So smoking on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Jake's cousin is this awesome
grower down in Crested Butte.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've known what he brought us,
but it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he's unfortunately not allowed to
compete because we're a fair competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And family members are allowed to join the
grow off, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_14]: We can just do a friends and family one.
[SPEAKER_16]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_16]: So any other chat questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone asked about auto seeds I saw at
one point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've been asked to do competitions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wrapping my brain around that,
everyone gets a lottery ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they pop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do they not?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we do the clone thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I am curious if you all have opinions
on autos.
[SPEAKER_09]: I have opinions.
[SPEAKER_14]: Lots of opinions.
[SPEAKER_14]: They're fun.
[SPEAKER_14]: If I need a bumper crop in my veg or an
early like July crop, maybe.
[SPEAKER_14]: But dude, night owls always been kind of
some of my go to or Mephisto.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mephisto.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are the 10 guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: But Daz actually just moved up here to
Maine.
[SPEAKER_14]: So we've been kind of chatting back and
forth about a few things.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I trust his work a lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I feel like as far as the competition
style, it might be something where you
[SPEAKER_14]: might give somebody seeds to kind of maybe
maybe everybody gets to make their
[SPEAKER_14]: selection out of a 60 block.
[SPEAKER_14]: Rather than having to have one plant to
kind of move forward with, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_14]: But then how do you judge it?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because it can't be tested.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because one phenom is going to test higher
than another phenom.
[SPEAKER_09]: But you can't clone an autoflower.
[SPEAKER_09]: No.
[SPEAKER_13]: You damage the roots just once or twice.
[SPEAKER_14]: There's really no way to have a baseline
on that.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, autoflower.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they don't, in this quote,
have the they don't have what the regular.
[SPEAKER_14]: They don't really have those capabilities.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it would be tough.
[SPEAKER_14]: But you'd probably just have to do like
the best selection out of everybody's pack
[SPEAKER_14]: of seeds and kind of hope that you got a
good selection.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I mean, that is an analytical results.
[SPEAKER_14]: It would be kind of a toss up.
[SPEAKER_13]: Do you guys read much autoflower?
[SPEAKER_13]: I've done it several times.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I do regular autoflower.
[SPEAKER_13]: I do.
[SPEAKER_13]: I mean, I've done it a lot.
[SPEAKER_13]: And I have some really cool autoflowers.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys want to try them out?
[SPEAKER_13]: I have a rainbow mix, which is like I've
got purple, blacks, reds, blues in the
[SPEAKER_13]: mix.
[SPEAKER_13]: So you'll have a great, beautiful garden.
[SPEAKER_15]: Where are you on the island?
[SPEAKER_15]: Where are you on the vineyard?
[SPEAKER_15]: West Tisbury.
[SPEAKER_15]: It's like right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll come.
[SPEAKER_15]: I'll come check you out because I always
go over there.
[SPEAKER_15]: Oak Bluffs.
[SPEAKER_13]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm around.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm on island.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm here.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, we'll we'll tour around.
[SPEAKER_13]: We'll check out some cool stuff,
you know, and seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Peter.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is we just implemented pathogen
testing two years ago, and it caused just
[SPEAKER_00]: so many additional issues on top of
everything else because people weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: talking as much about hops latent as they
are now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I still don't think that a lot of
growers know what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are testing for it for the grow off
clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd love to hear everyone's thoughts on
the topic.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, I saw a hop late and viroid like
years ago on some gelato cuts that ended
[SPEAKER_14]: making their way up here before everybody
was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I was kind of noticing like a dudding,
the quote unquote, dudding disease.
[SPEAKER_14]: And it was very random on the plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: Like there could be one branch that was
looking funky, but the rest of the plant
[SPEAKER_14]: was fine.
[SPEAKER_14]: Kind of started noticing it moving to
other strains.
[SPEAKER_14]: So at that point, I had to just kind of
nix the garden to move on.
[SPEAKER_14]: And honestly, I haven't seen it since,
but it just seems to be, you know,
[SPEAKER_14]: when you're when you're purchasing clones
from trusted places, it's hard to know
[SPEAKER_14]: where everybody's getting and sourcing
their things.
[SPEAKER_14]: And, you know, unless there's like some
sort of, you know, breed or pedigree,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, documentation that comes with
it, there's really no way to know unless
[SPEAKER_14]: you test everything.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's only twenty five bucks per plant to
get it tested.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it's not a very expensive test.
[SPEAKER_14]: But, you know, when you're taking in new
things, you just have to take every
[SPEAKER_14]: precaution.
[SPEAKER_14]: And hop late and viral, it's going to be
one of those things until you do some seed
[SPEAKER_14]: pops.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there is some discussion that it can
transfer to seed into the progeny as well.
[SPEAKER_14]: So, you know, best thing that you can do
for yourself is to start from seed as much
[SPEAKER_14]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_13]: But I've heard a lot of people say that
they've they can get rid of it through
[SPEAKER_13]: tissue culture, also out and new colony,
new tips.
[SPEAKER_13]: You guys have anyone able to get rid of it
a lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: The problem is it's a virus.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it lives within the point.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'm like, OK.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I heard there's a company advertising
that will cleanse hop late and viral out
[SPEAKER_13]: of tissue culture plants.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's in California, actually.
[SPEAKER_13]: I don't remember what it was, but they
said you could send them your infected
[SPEAKER_13]: plants and they will cleanse them for you
and send you back the uninfected clones.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're going to keep that genetic,
though.
[SPEAKER_09]: The phylos.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm interested in the cleansing of the
genetics.
[SPEAKER_13]: They said they can do all types of
cleansing.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's possible for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, the plant is looking human.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you get a virus, you can cleanse that
virus from your system.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, if you're if you're strong
enough immune system to be able to fight
[SPEAKER_09]: off and you can fight it off and then not
necessarily transfer it into the next
[SPEAKER_09]: clone generation, because it doesn't
necessarily affect the whole plant at the
[SPEAKER_09]: same time.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, like some part of the plant can
be affected while other parts of the plant
[SPEAKER_09]: are not.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it doesn't necessarily mean that when
you transfer it forward, you're going to
[SPEAKER_09]: be transferring it forward with the virus.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's a really weird deal, honestly.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's it's really important.
[SPEAKER_09]: We talk more about it because so few
people know that it's even existing in
[SPEAKER_09]: their gardens.
[SPEAKER_09]: They have no idea why entire clones are
dying off or entire trays of plants are
[SPEAKER_09]: dying off all at once in the middle of
flower.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's just the weirdest shit.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I mean, I think that it's really
important to sort of try and understand
[SPEAKER_09]: this and then also not to necessarily be
afraid of it, because we can kill it.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can figure out ways to clean the plants
of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it doesn't mean that once you get it,
then your your genetic that you've loved
[SPEAKER_09]: for 20 years is necessarily gone.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_09]: It just means that you got some work to
do.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, there's products like we call them
that you can use to clean and sterilize
[SPEAKER_14]: your equipment to make sure that you're
not passing it on to other plants and
[SPEAKER_14]: making sure your SOPs are are good when
you're going from plant to plant based on
[SPEAKER_14]: using new scalpels or making sure that
you're cleaning your utensils as you go.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's a product that you can kind of find
at most Walmarts.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's in the pet section.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's a yellow tub, but it is a virus side
that works pretty well for cleaning and
[SPEAKER_14]: sterilizing equipment.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, another thing I think is interesting
about hoplite is that you tend to see it
[SPEAKER_09]: in environments where the plants aren't
necessarily as strong.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm not saying that this is 100
percent of the case, but the place where I
[SPEAKER_09]: see hoplite virus, the worst is in
complicated hydro systems.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you have like a super complicated
drip system or an aeroponic system or
[SPEAKER_09]: something like that, then hoplite virus
has a real chance of taking out your
[SPEAKER_09]: plants in a way that it doesn't
necessarily if you run maybe a more
[SPEAKER_09]: organic based system where the plants have
a stronger immune system.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if you run a system that is just where
the plants have a stronger immune system,
[SPEAKER_09]: even in hydro, you don't see it as much.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really where you're having problems
in the first place is where you tend to
[SPEAKER_09]: see a lot more hoplite virus.
[SPEAKER_13]: Anything that's susceptible to disease is
going to get it first, no matter what.
[SPEAKER_14]: Especially with older plants, like
specifically with like plant count laws,
[SPEAKER_14]: like some people are growing six plants
under six lights.
[SPEAKER_14]: So you get like a 10 or 12 week veg on a
plant.
[SPEAKER_14]: Whereas in our situation, we're running
three gallon pots that turn over every
[SPEAKER_14]: three weeks.
[SPEAKER_14]: So it doesn't have a chance to express
itself as long as it's in perfect plant
[SPEAKER_14]: health.
[SPEAKER_14]: Obviously, we don't have those issues here
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_14]: But so, you know, plant health above all.
[SPEAKER_14]: And if these if you keep them healthier
and you have plants that haven't been,
[SPEAKER_14]: you know, mothered out so much and or
growing in a small pot for so long.
[SPEAKER_13]: Replacing your mother plants really often
is key.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I replace them every three
weeks.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, I got to bug out guys.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's about how long they'll last.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thanks, John.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Got to replace them.
[SPEAKER_13]: And then go again.
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep them healthy.
[SPEAKER_13]: Keep them growing healthy.
[SPEAKER_13]: You know, when you're when you're going on
a small scale indoors, I don't do much
[SPEAKER_13]: indoor growing.
[SPEAKER_13]: But what I found is that once the roots
fill the pot size, you're 100 percent
[SPEAKER_13]: relying on your fertilizer regimen and
scale.
[SPEAKER_13]: But if you give that pot some space,
those roots a lot of space to grow that
[SPEAKER_13]: way, especially through flower.
[SPEAKER_13]: When I grow indoor, I have run into that
problem all the time.
[SPEAKER_13]: Vegging too long.
[SPEAKER_13]: So I only veg for 14 to 20 days.
[SPEAKER_13]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_13]: Hit them in 14 days, veg, bam,
flower so that the roots never actually
[SPEAKER_13]: fill the pot and they're healthy the whole
flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_13]: If you can get to the end of the flower
with healthy roots, the healthier the
[SPEAKER_13]: plant, the healthier and better the bud.
[SPEAKER_14]: Which in like, you know, larger rooms with
larger plant counts and smaller pots,
[SPEAKER_14]: you can achieve with more watering
intervals and watching your dry backs a
lot.
[SPEAKER_14]: And that's where, you know, the technical
aspect of growing really starts taking
[SPEAKER_14]: hold.
[SPEAKER_13]: Yeah, you can't just plug it into a
computer like most grow houses who run
[SPEAKER_13]: like a 70 day program for every single
strain.
[SPEAKER_13]: And they wonder why half of them are,
you know, two, three weeks too long,
[SPEAKER_13]: have somewhere too early.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's because you're just running by the
computer program.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're just doing the 70 day boom done on
the fertilizer program.
[SPEAKER_13]: And you're not you're not catering it to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're just catering the grow to the seed.
[SPEAKER_13]: You're just doing it to the system and it
does not work.
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, I always say that successful grow is
a culmination of the sacrifices you made
[SPEAKER_14]: for that fire.
[SPEAKER_14]: You know, you started a hundred.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's up to you to keep it like my old
history teacher used to say.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I also need the crews, but it was been
a pleasure talking with everybody.
[SPEAKER_14]: I love meeting all you guys.
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, should we should we wrap it on that?
[SPEAKER_09]: It seems like we're dwindling down past
the Brady Bunch.
[SPEAKER_16]: We went from Brady Bunch formation to the
Brady Bunch.
[SPEAKER_09]: You have a job now, Sam.
[SPEAKER_16]: And the big pharma question we can save
for the next conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_16]: We're going to prepare for big pharma
entering this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say our focus is on finding like
breeders doing interesting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We touched on this earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that are using stuff that's not
widely available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate all of you for what you
do, what you do for growers and for doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the hardest thing that I probably you can
ask to do is like create a hundred clones
[SPEAKER_00]: that look identical and make sure they're
clean and on time and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really, really appreciate all the
work you guys do.
[SPEAKER_09]: It is really, really hard, Sam.
[SPEAKER_09]: I want you to know that as somebody who's
done this a long time, that is a really
[SPEAKER_09]: hard challenge.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to meet the three that are
left that we haven't gotten out to see you
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our website has the schedule on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The grow off dot com entries, 50 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you apply for the social equity,
it's 25 bucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want to see all types of growers this
year.
[SPEAKER_09]: Can we thank a future cannabis project for
having us to you?
[SPEAKER_09]: Because you're always.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_13]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_16]: I appreciate you having us go eat my lunch
now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_09]: You've been holding off.
[SPEAKER_12]: Was that that noise?
[SPEAKER_12]: Was it like a sandwich wrapper?
[SPEAKER_07]: He was the crinkler.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, the crinkler is probably me.
[SPEAKER_09]: We're trying to deal with metric right now
and getting all of the seeds that I've
[SPEAKER_09]: made in a metric is one hell of a
challenge.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, no joke.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've got till the 27th and I'm through
like 130 seeds or strains so far and we're
[SPEAKER_09]: just on THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like there's there's a lot more to do.
