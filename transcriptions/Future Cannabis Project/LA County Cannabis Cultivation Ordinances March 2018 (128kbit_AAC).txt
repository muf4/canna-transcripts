[SPEAKER_01]: The current recommendation on cultivation
is to restrict it to artificial light
[SPEAKER_01]: growth only.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they are not allowing outdoor
cultivation, they are not allowing mixed
[SPEAKER_01]: use within greenhouses in any way shape or
form, and for whatever reason they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: allowing any type of licensed cannabis
activity on agricultural land.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything has to be indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little silly because within the
committee we had an operator come out,
[SPEAKER_01]: good operator, come out and kind of tell
us, you know, we got to see how they run
[SPEAKER_01]: their indoor operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the indoor operation, what we learned
are some facts on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The indoor operation was about an 11,000
square foot grow and we got some
[SPEAKER_01]: statistics and data behind where it was
for their power usage on that because we
[SPEAKER_01]: have concerns around is this going to be
an eco-friendly thing, so on, to say
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing about just taxing the grid in
general here.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they ended up sharing with us is that
they did the math behind it and said that
[SPEAKER_01]: for their 11,000 square foot grow,
if they were to transition to a solar
[SPEAKER_01]: panel setup, so they could be just off the
grid that way, it would take them the
[SPEAKER_01]: equivalent of five acres of solar panels
to power that on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that just makes absolutely no sense in
any way, shape or form because part of
[SPEAKER_01]: what the county is recommending is to use
renewable energy for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're going to have to do it in a
warehouse location, which is probably in
[SPEAKER_01]: some populated city area on that,
where are you possibly going to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: get that kind of square footage to say
nothing of the fact, what does it actually
[SPEAKER_01]: cost to set that up?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they want to force everything to
industrial areas and it's a little silly
[SPEAKER_01]: of a thought on that because they want to
see that as a way of controlling the
[SPEAKER_01]: market and yet historically the market
went into the industrial into the
[SPEAKER_01]: warehouse as a way of hiding from all this
stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we had the chief of the fire
department who said that from a safety
[SPEAKER_01]: point of view, he preferred that
cultivation actually be done outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we have all these other departments
are seeing the stuff in there and yet the
[SPEAKER_01]: directive has still remained to not allow
for any outdoor agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indoor, cap it at 10 and then do they have
a square footage cap like those 10 can in
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregate?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, it's just 10 licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a 10 license and it's ridiculous
all the way around.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say on that cap and that cap
would include whether they're licensed at
[SPEAKER_01]: a full acre.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's say it's indoor so you can
only do 22,000, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the max license that you can get on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that because of the state?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have that max.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a max of those or it could be
a max at only the 5,000 square foot level,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's all in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And furthermore, to go into this stuff,
there is intent and the county wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: form a 15 person panel for equity to
discuss equity here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their intent is not to, they want to set
aside a percentage of licenses that will
[SPEAKER_01]: go towards equity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you just quickly define equity for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, certainly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, equity means a variety of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: What has been historically so far in the
topic, let's say city of Los Angeles seems
[SPEAKER_01]: to define it as giving an opportunity for
ownership for a license to someone that
[SPEAKER_01]: has been previously affected by the war on
drugs, meaning they have a criminal record
[SPEAKER_01]: or anything on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So should someone have been affected by
having a cannabis conviction and could not
[SPEAKER_01]: have participated in the market until now,
they actually get a leg up to participate
[SPEAKER_01]: in the market by getting a license that
will be reserved for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the county, I'm happy to see the county
is looking at a little bit more where
[SPEAKER_01]: we're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: They want a wider lens on what equity
means.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't specifically only mean
ownership.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be health stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be other things going forward
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them we want to see the county do
is actually affect a policy that would say
[SPEAKER_01]: that any county employee could not get
fired if they tested positive for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of stuff that we want to
see a wider lens on equity for there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But within the specific model of,
you know, licenses that would be given
[SPEAKER_01]: towards an equity applicant on there,
they want to set aside a percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the percentage is, let's say,
20 percent, they're matching that with a
[SPEAKER_01]: panel they're putting together of 15
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this whole panel, they want to put
together 15 people to give, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 percent of 10 licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that doesn't seem to make any sense as
to the resource they would put behind
[SPEAKER_01]: something.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have such a low cap on there going
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems very disingenuous for what that
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the issue, again, on the capping on
there, it's just from the committee's
[SPEAKER_01]: point of view, we address that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the recommendations we made,
which the county has not seemed to have
[SPEAKER_01]: taken into consideration yet, is that we
said we wanted them to consider
[SPEAKER_01]: alternatives to a cap.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the alternatives that we recommended
is because the county has so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different communities, some that may not
want this at all and others may want it a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had recommended hosting a discretionary
hearing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way, if an operator comes into
place and they want to look at there,
[SPEAKER_01]: the community still has an opportunity to
come out and say whether they want them
[SPEAKER_01]: there or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, we thought, was a better way to
adjust what are the proper levels as
[SPEAKER_01]: opposed to putting an artificial cap,
which at this moment really is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's really no reason as to why they've
thrown out this 20 or 10 number on there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little silly on there,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the other recommendations we did,
which they kind of seem to implement but
[SPEAKER_01]: did not do it for the reasons we did it
for, we were concerned that there would
[SPEAKER_01]: not be enough testing licenses or test
laboratories in place to be able to get
[SPEAKER_01]: product healthy and enough in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we recommend that they have a
reasonable number of testing licenses
[SPEAKER_01]: versus the cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: As it remains right now, they have a
one-for-one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they have 10 cultivation and 10
laboratory licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, every cultivator would get
their own laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome to some degree,
but just ridiculous because you don't need
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what the intent was behind what
we did on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the things when they're
looking at these caps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems to be at this moment,
I would like to think that it's more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: test in the, putting your toe in the water
right now for them to see what is the
[SPEAKER_01]: right market, right size for the markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I understand they may not know
what is good for cultivators and this and
[SPEAKER_01]: that, but 10 makes absolutely no sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I assume it follows the same logic as
the retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are currently more than 10 warehouse
cultivators in the County of Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to the discussion of how
large a market is in addressing with the
[SPEAKER_01]: proper amount of licenses, we speak with
the supervisors in there and some of them,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say the majority of them are
surprised and happy to see that there
[SPEAKER_01]: seems to be some data to say how big the
market should be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Certainly easier on the retail side than
anything else, but at least they have
[SPEAKER_01]: something to point to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their intent is like one of the things
that they want to do differently than the
[SPEAKER_01]: City of Los Angeles did is City of Los
Angeles did a rollout based on license
[SPEAKER_01]: type.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they did retail first, but there was no
supply chain to support it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where are you going to get your
distribution?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you going to get your product?
[SPEAKER_01]: All that stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was nothing legally within,
let's say even the County of LA mostly to
[SPEAKER_01]: get that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: The County is intent on giving a full
supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll give you your retail,
your cultivation, all that stuff going in
[SPEAKER_01]: there, but it's so limited that it doesn't
make sense as well, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why I kind of going back on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like the County doesn't want to
repeat others mistakes, but they seem to
[SPEAKER_01]: be figuring out new ones for themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many people are on the board of
supervisor five, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Supervisors is just everyone dead set
against outdoor or greenhouse cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we've we've learned differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Initially, when we had the discussions
last year, the keeping in mind that the
[SPEAKER_01]: outdoor opportunities are primarily within
district five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Supervisor Barger, she has by far the
largest district in the county.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that did, you know, initially the
discussions coming from that office was
[SPEAKER_01]: that they were concerned for, you know,
things such as water or this, that and the
[SPEAKER_01]: other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've now learned from the state's EIR
report and otherwise that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly doesn't consume more water than
any other crop that is already in those
[SPEAKER_01]: markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that discussion has not changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had the recent discussions on that,
and it seems to be more aligned with it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a political decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: So within the county itself, you have 21
town councils and they don't really get
[SPEAKER_01]: much legal say over how things are run,
but they do have certain certain
[SPEAKER_01]: parameters they can run around and make
certain laws for their own town,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: These town councils have influence over
the supervisors, but the supervisors still
[SPEAKER_01]: get the last say on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what seems to have been happening so
far right now, is that these town councils
[SPEAKER_01]: have been saying they've been against
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the discussions in the county as they
go out to discuss with them, as we've gone
[SPEAKER_01]: out there to discuss with them,
what we've seemed to have all learned is
[SPEAKER_01]: that they are right to be against cannabis
operators as they know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What the issue seems to be is that they
are against an illicit unregulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where crazy things happen, where there
is no way for people to enforce properly,
[SPEAKER_01]: so on and so forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on that line, I think everyone sees on
the same page for that one, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like no one wants that unregulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we have the discussion about what a
regular market can do, how it can benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: from taxes to safety, to so on and so
forth, job opportunities, it seems to
[SPEAKER_01]: start opening up a discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the county has not been promoting
those other aspects on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have not been, or I shouldn't say
even promoting, because I know it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: their job necessary on that, but they have
not been educating on the totality of what
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis and regulations could be one way
or another for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But supervisors bargain, like I said,
when it comes to the cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now they're not against it because they're
getting prospectors, they're getting
[SPEAKER_01]: people saying, hey, this is a great area,
we want to be able to do our stuff here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, the laws don't support it just
yet, but they're hearing constantly from
[SPEAKER_01]: the community saying, you guys have the
resources for this, we want to do this
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the contrast is like they want to hear
more from these town councils themselves
[SPEAKER_01]: on what their thoughts are.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like that so long as the town councils
have an opportunity to be fully educated
[SPEAKER_01]: on what the impact is on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where we are now trying to
reach out to the town councils and see if
[SPEAKER_01]: we can have that discussion or reach out
to the residents of those town councils
[SPEAKER_01]: and see if they can start that discussion
themselves and see if they can start
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding a little bit better what the
benefits one or another could be for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just keeping on the same point of
outdoor cultivation, you're saying the
[SPEAKER_00]: board of supervisors, while initially
saying indoor, indoor, indoor,
[SPEAKER_00]: is open to the idea of greenhouse or
outdoor, but wants to hear from the town
[SPEAKER_00]: councils that they want it in their local
towns or agricultural areas?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, ultimately, these are our
elected officials, they should be doing
[SPEAKER_01]: what we are asking of them to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the town councils are telling them,
no, we don't want this, then they will
[SPEAKER_01]: likely listen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they're saying, hey, there's
something here, and we should be exploring
[SPEAKER_01]: this, that'll be a different story for
them to start seeing that the the initial
[SPEAKER_01]: thoughts, because there was, you know,
a year ago, when they first passed the
[SPEAKER_01]: motion to start looking to stuff,
the initial thought was like, let's just
[SPEAKER_01]: limit this, we won't have a very broad
discussion, let's just take some baby
[SPEAKER_01]: steps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the easiest baby step was to say,
let's take the agricultural land out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the equation, because that is just such a
massive part of what LA County has.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now, as we've learned, we've seen more
data and more people's opinions on the
[SPEAKER_01]: matter, the interest is seriously there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how do we bridge that gap?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we give ourselves the
opportunity?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how does a county also see revenues
coming from that that could easily go to
[SPEAKER_01]: other counties surrounding counties
instead?
[SPEAKER_01]: There makes no sense for that opportunity
to go elsewhere on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I did like that there was a
recommendation that one of the supervisors
[SPEAKER_01]: gave us, and we put it ultimately within
the committee is that we asked the the
[SPEAKER_01]: supervisors to do a study that would say
essentially, how much money are they going
[SPEAKER_01]: to spend on trying to enforce against all
the agricultural land, although the
[SPEAKER_01]: operators that are on there, versus how
much money could they bring in revenue if
[SPEAKER_01]: they actually regulated and allowed it to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm hopeful that that's a study that
they will do at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can really contrast those numbers
and see where more benefits can come from
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there towns that are starting to speak
up to say, hey, we do kind of want to
[SPEAKER_00]: explore outdoor cultivation in our town or
in the environs of our town?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we had we had a couple that come
to mind right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of them was we reached out to recently
to have the discussion with the town
[SPEAKER_01]: council.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were prepared to go in there with as
much facts that we would think support why
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be good to have a regulated
market versus not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was a town council for Little Rock
and Pear Blossom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're out in the Antelope Valley
area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And typically that area out there is very
conservative.
[SPEAKER_01]: We thought that they would not be very
receptive to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Turns out the entire council was very
receptive and they were concerned what the
[SPEAKER_01]: current caps were on there and how that
could affect their town.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were great to point out that the
areas of land had no infrastructure on
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they were a lot more knowledgeable than
we were even prepared to see in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The voting data seemed to support it on
that as well, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew that ahead of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they did vote about 54 percent in favor
of Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we knew we had that in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's District 5.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other communities such as out in the Santa
Monica, Malibu Mountains area out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have Topanga Canyon.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Topanga Canyon is an incorporated area
very well known.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think within the cannabis space itself
as well, too, everyone kind of hasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: understood that there are growers there.
[SPEAKER_01]: People grow for their own personal use or
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been historically done there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great location for all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's been surprising to us in a very
positive way is that that community,
[SPEAKER_01]: when you look at that voting data,
the community was actually at 76 percent
[SPEAKER_01]: in favor of Prop 64 passing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by far they were one of the highest
rated communities in favor of illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis there.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, the way the current zoning is set
up, their supervisor, who represents them,
[SPEAKER_01]: Supervisor Sheila Kuhl, who is very
favorable to Topanga.
[SPEAKER_01]: She has always been favorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: She wants to see a regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, she has not had a very loud voice
in this discussion because the zoning has
[SPEAKER_01]: made so that her district essentially
would only have the ability to have only
[SPEAKER_01]: one dispensary in the entire district for
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: And no cultivation and no cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It would be hard to find anything else on
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the entire Topanga Canyon area,
all that stuff in there, there is no
[SPEAKER_01]: zoning that is allowed for any commercial
cannabis use, indoor, outdoor,
[SPEAKER_01]: you name it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is an example where the town
council started getting in the ear of the
[SPEAKER_00]: county board of supervisors saying,
hey, we would like either indoor or
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor cultivation in the Topanga area
that maybe the board of supervisors would
[SPEAKER_00]: start to listen to them and change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like the current policy is all
cannabis cultivation in this little tiny
[SPEAKER_00]: needle pin sized area of the entire
county.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where it's all going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we need is people in different
areas saying, hey, we'd like it in our
[SPEAKER_00]: area too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, we also like to do
greenhouse or outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's really important because if
that town council could voice that opinion
[SPEAKER_01]: more strongly to Supervisor Kuhl,
she would be even more encouraged to
[SPEAKER_01]: support expanding and actually having a
viable cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think right now what they have proposed
is not a viable market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be a market where you'll have people
that will spend their money and pay their
[SPEAKER_01]: taxes and stuff in there, but they have to
be competing against the illicit operators
[SPEAKER_01]: and the illicit guys want to be
responsible.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be just possibly going to jail for
something that is innate.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's also the contrast to where you
have certain town councils that have
[SPEAKER_01]: people that sit on them that are
conservative have based their opinion and
[SPEAKER_01]: they voice that opinion, but it doesn't
reflect what the actual voting data is for
[SPEAKER_01]: the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Topanga Canyon's town council has
decided that they've had this discussion
[SPEAKER_01]: previously last year when we went out to
do an opportunity to speak with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They spoke about it for about an hour on
the thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since that time, they backed away and
said, great, there's not going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: anything happening here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see that that is reflecting the
will of what the residents are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the residents are the ones that need
to show them that this is something they
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need to go to their town council and
they need to talk to them and say,
[SPEAKER_01]: we voted for this thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we don't do this, there are parents
that can be separated from their children.
[SPEAKER_01]: There could be so many other consequences
and stuff if they are continuing to do
[SPEAKER_01]: their grows because the laws no longer
support them to do that.
Thank you.
