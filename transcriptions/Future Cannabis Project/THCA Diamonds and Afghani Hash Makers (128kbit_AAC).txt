[SPEAKER_00]: So if you went in to grab some different
extractions that are made in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and brought them back to that Afghani
farming community and hash-making
[SPEAKER_01]: community, would they at least have an
appreciation for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you gave somebody diamond, if you
mechanically separated diamonds with oil,
[SPEAKER_00]: they would look at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people I was staying in those
producing countries, they follow me on my
[SPEAKER_00]: IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: They all have an IG.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really care about extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they see is hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like that's their stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hash I produce here, it's like the
best of the best that they produce for
[SPEAKER_00]: their own stash in very small quantities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't put anything close to all my
temple balls and stuff, but if you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know those temple balls are big.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Often enough I have them on my hand or
something like that, but I never put on
[SPEAKER_00]: the scale like he does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people around, they see those big
balls that are at least 100 to 200 grams
[SPEAKER_00]: of using resin temple balls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're tripping on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not really tripping on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would be interested by rosin because
it's super simple enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They can connect with that, but everything
that is really like butane, propane,
[SPEAKER_00]: CO2, ethanol extraction, it's too far away
from the plant for them to be connected
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically they'll ask, how do I smoke
this?
