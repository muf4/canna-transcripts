[SPEAKER_05]: Hey Peter, so we're in my kitchen and
we've got the the guys from grow magazine
[SPEAKER_05]: it's bear and pk nice to meet you guys and
then eric uh eric snug shots and candid
[SPEAKER_05]: kush chris from candid kush how's it going
what's up chris and then yours truly and
[SPEAKER_05]: jordan is coming on in and jordan's
daughter is here hailey and her daughter
[SPEAKER_05]: who is a very adorable one-year-old named
aurora and my wife and my daughter and
[SPEAKER_08]: it's it's sunday morning family time yeah
i love it say hi hi how are you i used to
[SPEAKER_05]: take baths like that we just canned like
amber my wife just canned like 20 lugs of
[SPEAKER_05]: peaches or something like that oh wow so
we made peaches and and we're we're also
[SPEAKER_05]: um going through all these different
phenotypes of freak show super freak and
[SPEAKER_05]: there's jordan who you spoke with there he
is what's up man i'm in my garage right
[SPEAKER_08]: now with like horses flies flying around
me and it's like a hundred and something
[SPEAKER_01]: degrees we're skating the heat somehow up
here it's kind of perfect right now yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a little bit of uh wildfire going
on so oh wow uh there's a little bit of
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke smoky haze in the air around us we
have a half a half canned jar of peach jam
[SPEAKER_08]: on the table and i love it you got you got
yeah you're uh this is all from the garden
[SPEAKER_08]: you got some some flowers some peaches
you're making some jam does everybody get
[SPEAKER_08]: to go home with jam at the end of the day
that was my plan i still have to talk to
[SPEAKER_08]: my wife about it though so you grew out uh
a bunch of different uh freak show plants
[SPEAKER_08]: and now so so you've harvested so does
that imply you did a light dep uh so these
[SPEAKER_05]: um these different freak show phenotypes
this is an f7 and um they're are these are
[SPEAKER_05]: are obviously seem very fresh and nice so
this was this like light now i just got
[SPEAKER_00]: done and they're just barely feeling right
now oh they're beautiful some of them
[SPEAKER_01]: dropped a minute i was able to get it into
a paper yeah so i'm gonna cure out so
[SPEAKER_05]: these are these beautiful uh freak show
seeds and they as as the plant is they are
[SPEAKER_05]: uh very unique and they often they remind
me a lot of of corian um which i don't
[SPEAKER_05]: know if folks know but if you've ever
grown cilantro and and had it uh go to
[SPEAKER_05]: flower that yeah hold on i actually give
me one second because i got my uh you've
[SPEAKER_05]: got some coriander there so here here are
freak show seeds and we can compare so
[SPEAKER_05]: that people can see the the likeness of
the freak show and the coriander seed
[SPEAKER_05]: because jordan tell me if you agree but i
also feel that they that these freak show
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds are more rounded than cannabis seeds
you know and people always say to us
[SPEAKER_05]: they're immature and they kind of get
upset sometimes when they first get their
[SPEAKER_05]: freak show seed pack and and we've tried a
number of times to explain in fact jordan
[SPEAKER_05]: even made a video that kind of shows that
yeah there's a but but they're always like
[SPEAKER_05]: this no matter how long we let them mature
on the vine there is no way that you can
[SPEAKER_05]: get them to be uh darker or yeah
differently
[SPEAKER_01]: you're throwing white seeds everywhere so
just hold on one second okay so what is
[SPEAKER_05]: that so these ones still have the the very
skin shroud it's sort of a it's a paper
[SPEAKER_05]: thin uh coating that that cannabis seeds
have that are you know it's it's where the
[SPEAKER_05]: tiger stripes often are found on cannabis
seeds and and about freak show seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: that's different is that that that coating
that gives them their unique look uh
[SPEAKER_05]: different tiger stripe patterns the model
looks of all different types of cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds the thing about freak show is that
that that shroud is actually thinner and
[SPEAKER_05]: detached so it it is more readily brushed
off by the seed sorting process and and it
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't uh weaken the seed or damage the
actual viability of the seed at all but it
[SPEAKER_05]: does certainly make it look different and
i would say more like coriander right say
[SPEAKER_05]: hi sure we've got a few different guests
here today with us it just happened uh a
[SPEAKER_08]: special the nat pennington show was
special guest all right who who's up first
[SPEAKER_08]: that's this is eric i'm eric what's up
how's it going good and you live do you
[SPEAKER_08]: live in the bay area or are you up in
oregon don i'm up in bend oregon okay got
[SPEAKER_08]: it yeah yeah so so so you guys are doing a
a photo shoot for uh what was it grow
[SPEAKER_06]: magazine well if you were it might grow
magazine but we're uh ideally yeah we were
[SPEAKER_06]: doing but i was doing some uh raspberry
parfait yeah there's the last one i did
[SPEAKER_06]: for girl magazine got it hey there we go
we're doing a a stack spin of some
[SPEAKER_06]: raspberry parfait seeds down inside like
actually still in the plant so um should
[SPEAKER_06]: be super cool i haven't processed it down
yet but it was like shooting started at
[SPEAKER_06]: like nine or ten o'clock at night it was
shooting till uh about five in the morning
[SPEAKER_08]: so it was an all-night shoot and what was
the reason why you did it that night uh
[SPEAKER_06]: well so it we did it at night so it was uh
not super hot um and uh it had to go all
[SPEAKER_06]: night because it's basically it's i don't
know the total of pictures i can crunch
[SPEAKER_06]: the numbers but it was probably like 8 000
pictures um because we're doing it's a 360
[SPEAKER_06]: so the camera will move 0.5 degrees
between each shot and then uh at each
[SPEAKER_06]: stage it's basically taking uh 55
different pictures for this one um so i
[SPEAKER_06]: can stack it together and get more depth
out of uh out of the picture and what are
[SPEAKER_08]: you shooting on are you shooting on like
uh like a canon with a hundred millimeter
[SPEAKER_06]: lens or what what's the rig uh yeah this
one is uh it's a canon 5psr so 50
[SPEAKER_06]: megapixels uh shooting with the the canon
mpe 65 millimeter uh dedicated map 1x to
[SPEAKER_06]: 5x um and that one last night it was a
about two and a half x were you taking the
[SPEAKER_08]: pictures out in the field or or just
inside with like a perfect uh setup like a
[SPEAKER_06]: controlled environment or yeah controlled
environment yeah we uh we took over the uh
[SPEAKER_06]: the document storage closet uh here on the
farm and uh and set up the rig in there um
[SPEAKER_06]: so we can control the uh the wind any
airflow ideally any vibration um and uh
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah so we take take the stock out of the
garden put it in there as we control the
[SPEAKER_06]: environment the lighting um and control
yeah try to control everything so much
[SPEAKER_08]: control it tickled mama so and you did i
mean that that's the the cover of of grow
[SPEAKER_08]: magazine with freak show on it so talk
about um like it's obviously unique and
[SPEAKER_08]: interesting plant like talk about freak
show but also just talk about some other
[SPEAKER_08]: you know interesting plants you've come
across in your journeys of macro
[SPEAKER_08]: photography or photography in general
because some of this stuff's not macro but
[SPEAKER_06]: yeah well i mean just i mean interesting
plants you've met freak shows the craziest
[SPEAKER_06]: looking as far as leaf morphology goes but
when you get up close on freak show it's
[SPEAKER_06]: still just you know trichomes everywhere
yeah but it's you know it's just a
[SPEAKER_06]: standard cannabis plant when you get up
close on it it's just a different shape um
[SPEAKER_06]: which is super fascinating to me um and
then as far as like weird weird unique
[SPEAKER_06]: interesting plants um a lot of the purple
stuff i've been shooting lately with the
[SPEAKER_06]: the pinks inside the trichome heads super
fascinating by that um it's kind of a rare
[SPEAKER_06]: trait that doesn't really pop up too often
but uh that was on the uh the star pupil i
[SPEAKER_06]: was shooting that and uh yeah just
anything super unique i'm like drawn
[SPEAKER_06]: towards so i want to want to shoot some
more of the freak show you know the super
[SPEAKER_06]: tasty ones that we've been trying over the
weekend here when you've done close-ups of
[SPEAKER_08]: the trichomes is it different or is it
just kind of similar to other like at that
[SPEAKER_06]: close-up level we have i've been hearing
some stories of some crazy trichome stuff
[SPEAKER_06]: that's going on on the freak shows uh at
shapeshifters farm but uh i haven't shot
[SPEAKER_06]: them yet so that's that's going to happen
this later this year but uh as far as the
[SPEAKER_06]: macros of the freak show i've done so far
the trichomes look the same they're pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: much standard um just normal normal
looking triches which is pretty much
[SPEAKER_06]: standard across all cannabis it's just
some have like longer stocks or thicker
[SPEAKER_06]: stocks or smaller heads bigger heads
different colors going on what about you
[SPEAKER_07]: chris yeah i mean yeah you got i did
recently photograph um a mac one uh strain
[SPEAKER_07]: and um i found on this one particular cut
a it's almost like a snailed eye trichome
[SPEAKER_07]: i have no idea if this will come through
if you can see it in the middle or not
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah yeah so you see that one right in the
middle yeah it's like a snake tongue yeah
[SPEAKER_07]: and then on the same exact plant i found
this other section this is gonna be a
[SPEAKER_07]: little harder to see because it's a little
darker yeah um but there's just like this
[SPEAKER_07]: wild looking trichome formation and
actually when you start looking around
[SPEAKER_07]: more and more into this frame there's like
you know double headed ones next to triple
[SPEAKER_07]: headed ones next to real fat stocks next
to this other weird looking droopy one
[SPEAKER_07]: down in the corner and this is like very
recent work um not even published i just
[SPEAKER_07]: captured it just a couple weeks ago
actually um so i have that cut drying and
[SPEAKER_07]: then i'll revisit it um as it's finished
and see like what those trichomes look
[SPEAKER_07]: like there that's probably the weirdest
thing i've seen yeah that's definitely
[SPEAKER_06]: i've never seen anything like that like
i've seen double headed trichomes and
[SPEAKER_06]: double stocked trichomes but that thing is
that is a straight mutation and like the
[SPEAKER_07]: the cola of the flower also didn't look
like normal i don't know really how to
[SPEAKER_07]: describe do i show you pictures i don't
have any pictures of it with me but it
[SPEAKER_07]: didn't have like the traditional type of
like uh christmas tree cone top it was
[SPEAKER_07]: more like weird sugary kind of swirly
formations and stuff on there so we're
[SPEAKER_08]: pretty interested in stuff when you talk i
mean because i know like you know half
[SPEAKER_08]: hashmakers look for certain things in the
trichomes so what like when you when you
[SPEAKER_08]: do a macro of kind of a hashy plant that's
desirable to hash makers kind of what what
[SPEAKER_08]: are you noticing that's different than
something that maybe would be the opposite
[SPEAKER_08]: where they're like that's not really what
i'm looking for i mean so i i don't know i
[SPEAKER_06]: i'm not a hash maker i i have a
rudimentary understanding i mean i i don't
[SPEAKER_06]: know i haven't noticed a ton of
differences like if you shoot a
[SPEAKER_06]: classically hash strain versus a non-hash
strain as far as like what the trichomes
[SPEAKER_06]: look like um classic hash strains usually
have like a lot more trichomes on them um
[SPEAKER_06]: and another thing a lot of people that
i've heard search for is short stocks um
[SPEAKER_06]: but as far as like just if you took a two
macros and one of the hash strain and
[SPEAKER_06]: one's not a hash strain i don't think
you'd be able to tell the difference by
[SPEAKER_06]: looking at the actual heads themselves but
i don't know that's an interesting one i i
[SPEAKER_05]: think something that uh probably it is
hard to sort of like quantify about hash
[SPEAKER_05]: making is how easily the the stalks will
break off and allow the the bulbous
[SPEAKER_05]: trichome head to sort of detach because a
lot of you know what you see and think of
[SPEAKER_05]: like the full melt hash and the really
light colored hash that's you know off uh
[SPEAKER_05]: you know um live live bubble hash
basically or fresh frozen bubble hash um
[SPEAKER_05]: though those those are really not a lot of
stalk material it's really just the head
[SPEAKER_05]: that you're capturing and so i i think
that's a factor of like what makes a good
[SPEAKER_05]: uh strain that sort of just dumps trichome
heads is makes a good hash strain there's
[SPEAKER_06]: another thing called the uh that started
started to pop up recently and another
[SPEAKER_06]: photographer shwale is the one that kind
of spotted it but uh and he calls it the
[SPEAKER_06]: week next trichome and if you try going
from the direct side you can kind of see
[SPEAKER_06]: the head is like up off of the stock a
little bit and you can see this like
[SPEAKER_06]: really it's like a one cell kind of
attachment point you can just clearly see
[SPEAKER_08]: it's just barely hanging on yeah it's
gonna snap off yeah with little effort
[SPEAKER_06]: ideally you want to snap it up but the to
be able to see a trichome from exactly
[SPEAKER_06]: that angle is really tough so if you shoot
a whole leaf and you've got hundreds of
[SPEAKER_06]: trichomes up in the frame you know maybe
10 or 15 will be at that exact side angle
[SPEAKER_07]: or maybe potentially a little bit more but
yeah and and then also um just like the
[SPEAKER_07]: thickness of the gland it's a little i
think challenging to see like through
[SPEAKER_07]: pictures but yeah you definitely notice
like when you break up different um folds
[SPEAKER_07]: of ours with if the weed feels like sticky
or greasy or like more powdery and sandy
[SPEAKER_07]: yeah and then that ideal for hash making
um if the head's more resilient it's gonna
[SPEAKER_07]: survive the process a lot but you don't
want to be too thick because then there'd
[SPEAKER_07]: be less total cannabinoids within the
gland like the thickness of that's like a
[SPEAKER_07]: conversation i've had with extractors i've
heard that conversation too but i don't
[SPEAKER_06]: know if it's like i literally heard it on
a podcast driving up here i don't know i
[SPEAKER_06]: didn't fully agree with it because it's
there's so much resin and it's just a
[SPEAKER_06]: small so tiny yeah it's gonna be super
thin i don't think it's taking away that
[SPEAKER_06]: much resin if the head's thicker but then
again i have no idea daniel son and mr
[SPEAKER_05]: miyagi debated the same so so peter i'm
really glad that you you know caught us
[SPEAKER_05]: here on this very laid-back casual uh
meeting of the minds up here at at our
[SPEAKER_05]: anchor farm in eastern humble um this is
where humbled seed company really you know
[SPEAKER_05]: got going and uh it's it's awesome to have
shape shifter who created the freak show
[SPEAKER_05]: strain here and these amazing
photographers and then we've got the guys
[SPEAKER_05]: from grow magazine who are you know this
is eric's photography right here on on the
[SPEAKER_05]: cover of the magazine and of course the
yeah the famous freak show strain here you
[SPEAKER_05]: can get the but but here are the guys just
to give you an idea of what we're up to
[SPEAKER_05]: we've been oh that's just gorgeous we've
been hard look at that look at that
[SPEAKER_01]: centerfold oh yeah we got a pretty cool
well it's it takes a village and and so
[SPEAKER_05]: guy here is is working on some freak show
right now actually and this is the
[SPEAKER_05]: mountain the mountain cabin that is a
humble seed company uh kind of
[SPEAKER_08]: headquarters whatever so so so is he
getting that ready to roll a bunch of
[SPEAKER_08]: joints that you guys are going to smoke or
what's he uh prepping it for we're also
[SPEAKER_05]: getting all of the seeds so here's pk and
it's basically it's a taste go ahead you
[SPEAKER_00]: tell them it's a taste test yeah um i got
all of them sitting here seated and i did
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of finos light seeded so we could
still taste it uh so it's a meal with the
[SPEAKER_00]: light seed to it and we have it um and
we're gonna i've narrowed this down to
[SPEAKER_00]: these five and there you go that's our job
today is you know i'm using these guys as
[SPEAKER_08]: gifts so talk about kind of the subtle
differences between the five uh you know
[SPEAKER_00]: the only major difference is the turbines
and just the flavor because i nailed down
[SPEAKER_00]: actually locked in a whole bunch of other
uh qualities for freak show um just
[SPEAKER_00]: nailing the leaf morphology right off the
get-go uh you know i didn't expect
[SPEAKER_00]: anything to be stable in other ways but
yeah i've gotten to the point in my
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding where i'll go ahead and try to
nail two three qualities just in one
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding but that's why i started out with
120 finos uh recently and then i depot out
[SPEAKER_00]: my choice of 30 and we've narrowed it down
to five here now so uh there you go that's
[SPEAKER_00]: our job now is to go outside and uh spark
it up so so nat nat can it can we can we
[SPEAKER_08]: uh can you lend your your uh palette can
you can you take a whiff of one of those
[SPEAKER_05]: and tell me uh absolutely describe it i've
been loving like the number 29 is one that
[SPEAKER_00]: i've been really digging uh i don't know
if you can see this but i've already kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of gave them a little preliminary
judgments you know when i was first
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing them in the bag and uh some of
them didn't make the cut i'm like well i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not interested in you and but yeah these
these last five are gonna get uh kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: go on the market maybe two right now yeah
well you know basically the i the criteria
[SPEAKER_05]: of course for uh freak show you know it's
most well known for its amazing and very
[SPEAKER_05]: unique leaf shape but what a lot of people
don't realize is that there are some
[SPEAKER_05]: incredibly unique uh and original right uh
terpens that that freaks the freak show
[SPEAKER_05]: strain actually produces very unique turps
and so now we kind of feel like our next
[SPEAKER_05]: job or you know is really getting what we
consider to be the most powerful turp in
[SPEAKER_08]: the most pleasant turpin was so so what
are some of the unique terpens because i
[SPEAKER_08]: know jordan when we spoke the other day i
mean not not in freak show but you were
[SPEAKER_08]: talking about something you smoked a long
time ago that i believe was tie that had
[SPEAKER_08]: like a distinct chocolate smell to it that
you know is just not something you can
[SPEAKER_08]: find now um so what what's kind of the
unique terpene profile i mean have you
[SPEAKER_08]: isolated what that terpene or those that
combination of terpenes are that give it
[SPEAKER_00]: its uniqueness yeah i was telling that a
while ago that um like this generation is
[SPEAKER_00]: where i'm kind of pulling together all of
the flavors i mean no one can really nail
[SPEAKER_00]: it down to one and we don't want to do
that anyway because everybody kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: likes a different goal of things and the
honest truth on this is i i probably have
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 different types of freak show right now
because that's how i am and that's how i
[SPEAKER_00]: do it and i don't want to limit myself or
bottleneck things and and just the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that freak show has such an unlimited like
ability to morph just so it's i mean i'm
[SPEAKER_00]: going in different directions on leaf
morphologies on what he's asking is the
[SPEAKER_00]: flavors okay the original which we also
have here the holy express which is one of
[SPEAKER_00]: the parent stock the other ones uh the
holy express was the original and i have
[SPEAKER_00]: that here and so this is like three
generations deep on a sesquiterpene line
[SPEAKER_00]: that i'm looking at the kind that hangs in
your sinuses as you're walking out the
[SPEAKER_00]: door and you get busy because it's sativa
and it got you out of your chair and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're jamming and you're like still
smelling in your head well to me that's
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the most rarest kind of genes
that's been getting knocked out in the
[SPEAKER_00]: last you know 20 years of time and you
know there's still really nice smelling
[SPEAKER_00]: weed out there there's all kinds of fairly
tasty weed but it all seems to be getting
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of homogenous well i'm going back to
those ones that remind me of the old days
[SPEAKER_00]: when an old dude says man that takes me
right back to 1968 or something you know
[SPEAKER_00]: what imported weed that have that really
weird smell up the house too it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: about the quote sativa the narrow leaf
drug tropical has always been my bag and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know everyone's like you know against
me like people almost like hate sativa for
[SPEAKER_00]: all these years it's really true but
[SPEAKER_00]: are you in a room full of haters right now
not at all no the times have changed and i
[SPEAKER_05]: don't hate indica anymore yeah we're you
know one thing peter that's been really
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting about having like the honor of
being the group that got to you know sort
[SPEAKER_05]: of mass produced and and come come forward
with shapeshifters wonderful creation has
[SPEAKER_05]: been getting to kind of see how many
interesting different reactions and one of
[SPEAKER_05]: the things that i i started noticing was
the people that reacted kind of negatively
[SPEAKER_05]: and were almost offended by you know this
totally different cannabis that is still
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis but it's it's a hundred percent
different uh a lot of people that were i
[SPEAKER_05]: think just new to cannabis in general or
at least new to trying to grow it um kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of thoughts themselves well you know these
guys are out there changing it before i
[SPEAKER_05]: even have a chance to and what they don't
realize is we're not changing anything
[SPEAKER_05]: we're just expanding on something and you
know making it more interesting and and
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of more unique so i think people that
it seemed to be consistent that like
[SPEAKER_05]: experienced growers loved it and wanted to
try it as soon as they could and then some
[SPEAKER_05]: of the people that were just maybe growing
their first plant were like why do you
[SPEAKER_05]: have to create something that looks so
different you know like we we just want it
[SPEAKER_05]: to look like a normal pot leaf you know
people were actually like offended by it
[SPEAKER_05]: and and we i had to remind them that a
this is not genetically modified ever
[SPEAKER_05]: never it is modified by me well but but
not the traditional sense of genetic
[SPEAKER_05]: modification where you're not splicing
genes you know so we're not we're not
[SPEAKER_05]: splicing genes from we're not gene editing
we're not uh splicing genes or you know
[SPEAKER_05]: we're not using crisper we're not using
any of that technology this is just simply
[SPEAKER_05]: a natural mutation that occurred and and
of course mutations are responsible for
[SPEAKER_05]: all evolution and so we wouldn't be the
human beings that we are today without
[SPEAKER_05]: many many millennia of of mutation you
know giving us an opposable thumb and
[SPEAKER_05]: giving us all these like advantages and
potentially disadvantages and then letting
[SPEAKER_05]: you know natural selection uh work that
out and and of course you know this new
[SPEAKER_05]: and amazing kind of cannabis is no threat
like people don't need to be threatened
[SPEAKER_05]: that all of a sudden all cannabis is going
to look really weird because hold on are
[SPEAKER_00]: they threatened by wedding cake i i i
would come at it from a totally different
[SPEAKER_08]: direction i think it it looks like a fern
which from a plant you know i'm not a an
[SPEAKER_08]: expert in plants but i know the fern was
kind of the link it's it was like the
[SPEAKER_08]: first plant correct uh and then all other
plants you know the fern's been around for
[SPEAKER_08]: uh what 400 million years um and and to me
that that this thing visually looks like a
[SPEAKER_08]: connection not to something weird and new
and different but literally to the past so
[SPEAKER_08]: that's why i'm saying i would look at it
inversely and say it's not this new
[SPEAKER_08]: bastardized thing it's something that
again and it's it's visual but it it's a
[SPEAKER_08]: reminder of where plants came from in my
mind right and that and that's cool i mean
[SPEAKER_05]: i think and and i'm sure maybe i could be
a little bit off on this but i think even
[SPEAKER_05]: humans and and plants we share like 75
percent of the same dna and that's how of
[SPEAKER_05]: course you know it's similar we we all are
so i'm sure that yes freak show was
[SPEAKER_05]: related to a fern or is in some cosmic way
but but the reality is just to answer some
[SPEAKER_05]: of the basic questions it it is a natural
occurrence the the freak show strain it's
[SPEAKER_05]: very different and it does have what i
would consider to be some really unique
[SPEAKER_05]: and unusual turpins would you guys agree
for sure yeah and you know these guys you
[SPEAKER_05]: know they have photographed thousands of
cannabis strains and uh you know so the
[SPEAKER_05]: turpins are really unique and i think that
there's a lot of really incredibly unique
[SPEAKER_05]: things and and what i really uh applaud
shapeshifter for hit the fact that he did
[SPEAKER_05]: not discard this unique plant the fact
that he was able to say you know the fact
[SPEAKER_05]: that he saw the potential of it as he was
developing it and i mean i know i've i've
[SPEAKER_05]: been a breeder here and in humbled for
well over 20 years and i've thrown away
[SPEAKER_05]: not things like this but i've thrown away
things that didn't fit the the normal
[SPEAKER_05]: criteria that i expect you know our
community to to want and and i in
[SPEAKER_05]: retrospect i you know probably threw away
some things that could have been amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: but historically those anomalies were
scary in some sense like i don't want to
[SPEAKER_05]: waste time or money on that right well
it's kind of a new uh you know with the
[SPEAKER_05]: stigmas around cannabis uh thankfully kind
of melting away a lot recently it there is
[SPEAKER_05]: more room for diversity and for more
experimentation and for more research and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know amazingly the way to get the
diversity back is going to be the line
[SPEAKER_00]: breed you know and all these separate
directions uh before it all gets so
[SPEAKER_00]: homogenized that it's going to be super
difficult to find something really
[SPEAKER_00]: different and that's that's a lot of how
freak show came about is i was actually
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to nail a turp you know like i said
the sesquiterpine uh the level that this
[SPEAKER_00]: one some of the parents dog had i was like
okay i really need to nail that and uh it
[SPEAKER_00]: turns out that right when i'm right when
i'm nailing what i was looking for in the
[SPEAKER_00]: way of turps i'm trying to fix this that's
for all and it's going to have diversity
[SPEAKER_00]: it's going to have five flavors that range
from fruity to gas to whatever uh but yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: it was at that point when i nailed it i'm
like okay i'm super interesting that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: i started seeing the anomalies in it like
the gator tooth leaf was kind of the first
[SPEAKER_00]: really that caught my eye like crazy
because i remember seeing that all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: back in the day when you would get one
seed out of the tie strip and it was the
[SPEAKER_00]: black seed crazy really dragon looking it
was like dragon gale we kind of i remember
[SPEAKER_00]: calling it back in the day real super
skinny leaves with these hooked uh
[SPEAKER_00]: serrations on and when i saw that i go
holy shit that's sweet tieweed in this we
[SPEAKER_00]: know there's tieweed in it probably from
the big sir always leave and i i
[SPEAKER_00]: researched it also a pineapple supposedly
has tie and uh so it turns out that the
[SPEAKER_00]: origins of freak show are all related
already and i think these things just
[SPEAKER_00]: happen because i've been choosing for
certain uh for what i'm looking for all
[SPEAKER_00]: this time and there was always a lot of
abnormalities in it i mean they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: there the whole time i don't know why it
crossed my mind like okay i'm just going
[SPEAKER_00]: to see where i can take this just dedicate
a little time to go on go for the really
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy looking weed so that it stands out
and the plant actually outdid me um i
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminated the regulatory genes completely
uh it's not just mutation it's a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: that can continue to mutate indefinitely
you know uh and that's the interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: part for me is now i can zero in on one
but like i said i have so many different
[SPEAKER_00]: lines of it i've got back crosses of it
one thing i haven't done i have outcrossed
[SPEAKER_00]: it um just found it check it out and test
out that and there's no freaks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: first step on outcross on anything you've
talked about then people are going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: posting that later going wow no no freaks
uh but i guess there are some people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are saying they're getting a certain
percentage of freaks out of that one out
[SPEAKER_00]: cross it with whatever but uh in general
what we want to see is for the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: entire world to have freak show where it's
mainstream and the people that are against
[SPEAKER_03]: something that cool it does look like
coriander well you know i think we're all
[SPEAKER_05]: i would certainly hope that we're all into
having you know cannabis become more and
[SPEAKER_05]: more accessible you know but and it's a
medicine and people should be able to you
[SPEAKER_05]: know enjoy it and have it however they
want to have it it's a gosh damn plant so
[SPEAKER_05]: what the hell i mean it's we're all here
for one reason or another and definitely
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis is here for i think a lot of good
reasons but um hey do you think that uh we
[SPEAKER_05]: should give it a try and and go on a
little uh field trip up up to the
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation area and and look at some at
some freak show and look at some different
[SPEAKER_08]: stuff let's do it and then just jordan
quickly because your roots were in the
[SPEAKER_08]: santa cruz area right and so you you had
mentioned holy express and i was like that
[SPEAKER_08]: must be some sort of big sir holy weed
kind of family tree so basically the
[SPEAKER_08]: lineage is is stuff that you grew up with
right i mean big sir holy weed uh and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you said pineapple express yeah there all
of it in there is all sativa or sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: dominant and we'll just say sativa quote
but yeah the uh i wasn't able to find out
[SPEAKER_00]: what uh holy baba what was it uh banana
kush i'm sorry the banana kush kind of had
[SPEAKER_00]: to get in after what it really was it was
uh so but that's the only kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: broadleaf afghanica vine that has it but
see now i've done i've done a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding where i'll bring in you know some
some afghanica but then i'll just choose
[SPEAKER_00]: back for the sativa phenotype so now you
end up with a 50-50 hybrid that no one can
[SPEAKER_00]: tell from a super solar haze it's just uh
it's just a matter of taking it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: direction you're trying to do and after
years and years and years of that i
[SPEAKER_00]: finally got to where it's not so much
guesswork anymore and the family of the
[SPEAKER_00]: seed bank i have i know real well like the
back of my hand i mean i can almost
[SPEAKER_00]: predict the outcome on it anything i do
but yeah i'm i'm a line breathing fool i
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to go into a big rant about it
but uh you know i it's just working the
[SPEAKER_00]: line breathing thing back crossing is good
but yeah i did take this one for a back
[SPEAKER_00]: cross ride um i wanted to take it more to
the pineapple express direction because
[SPEAKER_00]: that was the one that had so many
generations of what i was looking for i'm
[SPEAKER_08]: more incestuous nat did you grow up in
humboldt or where'd you grow up uh no i
[SPEAKER_05]: was born in new york and grew up um spent
time in philly but then moved to humble
[SPEAKER_05]: when i was 18 years old so i kind of high
tailed uh that was in 1995 and voted yes
[SPEAKER_05]: on prop 215 with our our our guy denis
prone um who became a friend later on that
[SPEAKER_05]: was my first vote was voting yes on prop
215 1996 and uh the rest is history i'd
[SPEAKER_05]: never really like left humble after that
aside from you know visiting family and uh
[SPEAKER_05]: taking a few vacations a few work trips
things like that well where where i was
[SPEAKER_08]: going with that was to ask if you had any
kind of historical historical experience
[SPEAKER_08]: with kind of big sir like the big stir
holy weeds back in the day um yeah we've
[SPEAKER_05]: grown big sir for a long time we've had
different cuts of it and scenes of it come
[SPEAKER_05]: up here and and big sir was uh on my way i
went and snuck into on my way to humble we
[SPEAKER_05]: we snuck into esalon and like smoked big
sir holy weeds uh in their hot tub late in
[SPEAKER_08]: the middle of the night when we were was
mojave was mojave in the hot tub i don't
[SPEAKER_05]: remember i you know i've since met but i i
don't remember if he was in the hot tub at
[SPEAKER_05]: that night it was a blur you know it was a
long time ago and lots of things happened
[SPEAKER_05]: in hot tubs back then you know so we've
now deseeded and twisted a bunch of these
[SPEAKER_00]: selections starting with this one here is
all i have to remember is that i got
[SPEAKER_00]: number 53 and i hope it wins and like i
said this is i said so you you have
[SPEAKER_05]: favorites already 53 is your favorite oh
no we're down to 67 we're starting we're
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna start the smoke analysis the uh and
we'll lab testing as well but but we're
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been here this has always been the
most reliable we're gonna test each other
[SPEAKER_03]: by joint by blunt by bong by pipe yeah i
like it and nat is is this your commercial
[SPEAKER_08]: way of uh of separating seeds the the you
get a team of free labor to hand pick them
[SPEAKER_05]: out no we when we do this like really
we're having a relaxed laid back weekend
[SPEAKER_05]: where we're working on the freak shows
train and trying to do some phenotypic uh
[SPEAKER_05]: you know narrowing it down a little bit so
that we have um a consistent turpent
[SPEAKER_05]: profile not that it's not all they're not
all great they're all great but um you
[SPEAKER_05]: know so part of that is uh you know the
organic way of selecting and working on
[SPEAKER_05]: phenotypes is smoking and checking out the
flowers and preserving any seeds that
[SPEAKER_05]: might be in it normally we have a seed
sorting machine that we run it through and
[SPEAKER_05]: we've got our seed distribution laboratory
out on the coast so you guys are kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: really seeing kind of the way that we've
always done it and they're a more rootsy
[SPEAKER_05]: way of of what we do here at humboldt seed
company and it's just so happened that
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a bunch of homies are in the house
so the special uh moment i would say so so
[SPEAKER_08]: just the last question before we uh cut it
off and regroup uh jordan when i talked to
[SPEAKER_08]: him the other day was talking about
breeding indoors will not produce as good
[SPEAKER_08]: seeds as outdoors so can i get your both
your perspectives on that about kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: well you know outdoors i think everybody
has their opinion and um i don't know if
[SPEAKER_08]: that uh you'd have to ask him so you well
then you guys have a different opinion
[SPEAKER_05]: right well i i just think that you know
you get what you put into it and i i'm
[SPEAKER_05]: sure that there are some amazing uh indoor
breeding facilities we have indoor
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding facilities and outdoor and you
know i i think that selection is the most
[SPEAKER_05]: important thing um and you know so i do
kind of feel like um if you're only
[SPEAKER_05]: selecting in one environment then that can
be a little bit flawed but um you know i
[SPEAKER_05]: tell him about the we breed in both
indoors and out and yeah that points up so
[SPEAKER_05]: much stuff right away oh well i think what
jordan's what he's referring to is just
[SPEAKER_05]: how different uh growing conditions
because if if anyone's familiar with the
[SPEAKER_05]: grow off competition everyone starts with
with one with a clone of the exact same
[SPEAKER_05]: plan it was they all end up with the same
but the last two years it was the last two
[SPEAKER_05]: years it was uh that's why we do that
cookies and then the next year they chose
[SPEAKER_05]: caramel cream from our strain or from one
of our strains and that's what both years
[SPEAKER_05]: the test results came back like and i'm
not trying to point anybody fingers or
[SPEAKER_05]: call anybody out but there was thc level
from the same exact cutting that went from
[SPEAKER_05]: 15 thc all the way to 30 percent and
turpin results that went from 0.7 percent
[SPEAKER_05]: all the way up to 5.4 which is just almost
a record uh for turpins and so it just
[SPEAKER_05]: goes to show how one single clone you know
one clone propagated strain can you know
[SPEAKER_05]: come out so differently in in different
locations and different growing yeah from
[SPEAKER_05]: it was it was all from the same exact mom
but anyway let's go out to the field and
[SPEAKER_05]: uh and see how things go all right we
might if we lose wi-fi it just means that
[SPEAKER_05]: we're gonna have to sign into the other
wi-fi that we have to maintain for um like
[SPEAKER_08]: metric purposes and things like that you
have a dead okay because it does that need
[SPEAKER_08]: to be up 100 percent or just when you're
uploading data just when we're uploading
[SPEAKER_05]: data okay so this is our uh kitchen garden
here some tomatoes coming in and yeah i'm
[SPEAKER_08]: looking at my tomatoes uh outside the
garage right now and this is our little
[SPEAKER_05]: trail you guys coming got some pretty
sunflowers so so is it is is everything on
[SPEAKER_05]: your home property yeah we have um we have
a dude like two different premise
[SPEAKER_05]: technically premises and this is the
residential premise over here and and
[SPEAKER_05]: there's no cannabis stuff over here but
then you go across this magic line oh that
[SPEAKER_05]: you even have a bridge a little foot
bridge so it's kind of a little cloudy day
[SPEAKER_08]: so so so so which number are you on what
are you smoking 167 and it's rolled with a
[SPEAKER_08]: fresh tobacco oh 67 very nice so do you
grow do you grow tobacco at home yes sir i
[SPEAKER_00]: do oh yeah there's almost nothing i don't
grow uh you know really grow it all matter
[SPEAKER_00]: of fact my air shows are a lot more
important to me than freak show to be
[SPEAKER_00]: honest i mean they're both super
interesting you have no idea what i've
[SPEAKER_00]: done with their little tomatoes yeah i'll
mess around with any genetics you know i
[SPEAKER_00]: used to do hybrid uh wolves for many years
and that was interesting too you know i
[SPEAKER_08]: had them up what wolves like yeah like the
in the canine family yeah yeah they were
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely pure ones they came from
minnesota and then i had one out of alaska
[SPEAKER_00]: and then it was hybridizing them uh with
german shepherd because you know you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to cross it with huskies the huskies
aren't really a real obedient dog at all
[SPEAKER_00]: so anyway i get them up to 96 wolf big
black beautiful wolves and listen to every
[SPEAKER_00]: word you say very trainable and all that
stuff but more like a wolf than a peer and
[SPEAKER_00]: uh they had killed my favorite dog uh one
night and uh that kind of ended the whole
[SPEAKER_05]: wolf breeding program let's go uh check
out the freak show chamber this is we're
[SPEAKER_08]: starting to get into sort of the zone so
so you're growing it on your property too
[SPEAKER_05]: correct yeah we've got um this is this is
our farm this is the humboldt seed company
[SPEAKER_05]: anchor farm and we've got 40 different
breeding chambers here that we each one
[SPEAKER_05]: inside each one we create each different
strain that we release and we've also got
[SPEAKER_05]: a permitted farm and nursery down in
nevada county as well so but this is our
[SPEAKER_05]: main anchor humble farm and then we have a
distribution for the seeds that we call
[SPEAKER_05]: the seed lab and that's out in eureka but
um we're so the idea here is is once you
[SPEAKER_08]: guys pick a winner of jordan's uh the
stuff that he brought over from his
[SPEAKER_08]: property you'd then pop those seeds and
basically create seeds out of that that
[SPEAKER_05]: would then go to market yeah that's how we
did the original um freak show seeds that
[SPEAKER_05]: are in market today so here jordan and i
are going to go with in uh inside one of
[SPEAKER_05]: these chambers here where we breed the
freak show and all right so they're a
[SPEAKER_05]: little there are little hoop houses got it
yeah and i mean you know we have our own
[SPEAKER_05]: special sort of tricks that we've
developed over the years for breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: different strains but i like the use of
bamboo yeah yeah i mean it's nature and
[SPEAKER_05]: here's some freak show buds i actually see
a seed i'm seeing the seeds forming right
[SPEAKER_05]: there and this is the feminized freak show
so the one of the interesting things about
[SPEAKER_05]: um the way freak show develops the anthers
particularly on this like a sex reverse
[SPEAKER_05]: one develop on the outside of the flower
but you know what people really want to
[SPEAKER_05]: see are these beautiful freak show buds
starting to form up isn't that just
[SPEAKER_08]: amazing yeah so so in this room it's all
females that have been pollinated with a
[SPEAKER_08]: male that you selected or or what kind of
the setup in the room so we've actually
[SPEAKER_05]: fully reversed um the sex of of this plant
or of freak show and that's how you make
[SPEAKER_05]: uh feminized seeds so it just so happens
that we're in a feminized breeding chamber
[SPEAKER_05]: right now but we all make regular freak
show seeds um but yeah here's this is
[SPEAKER_05]: right here the this bud is is absolutely
100 accepting pollen right now and the
[SPEAKER_05]: pollinators look like that yeah so you
know this you're getting kind of a really
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of a inside look at freak show we
don't always share exactly what this stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: looks like but you know breeding isn't
always as exactly as voted as growing
[SPEAKER_05]: flower for smoke because you know for one
thing for seeds to be mature you need to
[SPEAKER_05]: let the the flowers kind of sit and and
the seeds will ripen inside the flowers
[SPEAKER_05]: for another month at least beyond uh when
you would harvest it for for smoking right
[SPEAKER_00]: and yeah and how freak show seeds are
extremely hard to process because uh
[SPEAKER_00]: they're pale the way they're pale so it's
almost impossible to tell a hollow one
[SPEAKER_00]: from a you know a good one but it can be
done you just go through them one by one
[SPEAKER_08]: check them right it it looks like we're in
like a jurassic park scene right now yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: he's got a leaf here actually so that's
that's the uniqueness well not to mention
[SPEAKER_05]: that and the terpins are incredibly unique
yeah peter this is a lot like the uh the
[SPEAKER_00]: super freak and the fruity freak ones that
i'm i'm very looking out right now uh
[SPEAKER_00]: going for a much more kind of simpler
lacier matter of fact the ones at my ranch
[SPEAKER_00]: are quite a bit different than this
particular one but yeah sorry in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the leaf structure yeah exactly leaf
morphology has gone in a lot of kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: crazy directions and you know that's what
got me started finding freaks in the first
[SPEAKER_00]: place but you know i can't help myself now
i'm looking at the freaks of the freaks
[SPEAKER_00]: and where it's you know really taken off
and you know in another departure uh you
[SPEAKER_00]: know in the way of leaf uh shape and
that's there is actually correlations
[SPEAKER_00]: between certain things that you can look
at on any cannabis plant uh at any stage
[SPEAKER_00]: of the game aside from smelling them and
stuff uh you know i did it as guesswork
[SPEAKER_00]: you know we would find out later oh yeah
the one that you really love them skinny
[SPEAKER_00]: tie leaves uh that is the tasty one by god
you know so uh yeah come to notice things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that correlations between
morphologies and you know final outcome
[SPEAKER_05]: okay well it's really warm in here right
now and yeah um anyway there's some
[SPEAKER_05]: beautiful yeah we could go show them the
ones that are in the field and and so in
[SPEAKER_05]: that room how many plants are there i'd
have to look on metric there's quite a few
[SPEAKER_05]: so we do selection from quite a few plants
i would say my guess would be around 40 or
[SPEAKER_05]: so okay 50 so here's just one of our fino
hunt rose and uh these are non non-freak
[SPEAKER_05]: type cannabis these are just our our
normal cannabis and we we like to grow uh
[SPEAKER_05]: they're looking good we like to do auto
flowers kind of like out along the edges
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's sort of helps us build our
auto flower research so here's some nice
[SPEAKER_05]: little cute little autos that are just
popping out from behind these hedgerows of
[SPEAKER_05]: plants but anyway this is like a little
tour now you're starting to get some of
[SPEAKER_05]: our breeding chambers are up there one of
those bigger flat you know i'm a little
[SPEAKER_05]: hesitant to like i didn't really clean up
for this peter didn't even shave it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: nice auto flower they're doing their thing
right now so that's we like that it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: nice uh technique actually doing auto
flowers just right alongside and is that
[SPEAKER_08]: just so you can kind of just see how
they're express i mean it's just an
[SPEAKER_08]: opportunity to let it express itself and
get some feedback on it or is there
[SPEAKER_05]: another purpose uh we get feedback on it
we test some of the um and then you know
[SPEAKER_05]: it's also just like you know the more the
merrier as far as flower goes um and so
[SPEAKER_05]: but primarily the answer is it's for r&d
got it all right so i'm moving up now to
[SPEAKER_05]: where we have some freaks growing out in
veg and uh jordan's on his way as well let
[SPEAKER_05]: me just see this is um our blueberry
muffin breeding chamber here so these are
[SPEAKER_05]: pollinated here we go okay so this is the
blueberry muffin yeah this is our
[SPEAKER_05]: blueberry muffin breeding chamber so this
i don't know folks can see but that is
[SPEAKER_08]: full of of our femme blueberry muffin
seeds oh wow okay so so so the seat those
[SPEAKER_08]: seeds are already feminized or do you have
to treat them so the way that people a lot
[SPEAKER_05]: of people don't quite get it the way that
you make feminized seeds is by altering
[SPEAKER_05]: the pollen and the pollen comes from from
a plant that has two x chromosomes which
[SPEAKER_05]: is just a generally a female plant and so
because of that it uh creates all female
[SPEAKER_08]: seeds got it so so once you put the seeds
through the machine there and and pull
[SPEAKER_08]: them all there there's no more work to be
done in terms of the feminization process
[SPEAKER_05]: that's right yeah it it happens you treat
the um you treat the plant with the silver
[SPEAKER_05]: with the female plant with silver until it
releases um pollen which it normally would
[SPEAKER_05]: not release pollen so when it releases
pollen the pollen that it releases is is
[SPEAKER_01]: all female pollen and so these are just
going to be full term outdoor and they're
[SPEAKER_08]: just currently in veg right yeah these are
just in veg right now and and we're are
[SPEAKER_08]: these from feminized seeds or these just
regular seeds oh i think that some of them
[SPEAKER_05]: are um we we created both feminized and
regular freak show seeds last year and you
[SPEAKER_05]: know we keep track of of our rating always
at the base of the plants you can see this
[SPEAKER_05]: one was rated nine and uh that just has a
good turpin the gs stands for to be honest
[SPEAKER_05]: it's not that technical it stands for
great smell but you know hey we're keeping
[SPEAKER_05]: track and we breed with our highest rated
ones so these are all nines and tens and
[SPEAKER_05]: from individual populations and they were
selected out of many many um so you know
[SPEAKER_05]: many phenos or let's just say individuals
in a population phenotype is kind of a
[SPEAKER_05]: subjective word if you ask me you know one
person's definition of a different
[SPEAKER_05]: phenotype can be very different than
someone else's definition if you know what
[SPEAKER_05]: i mean well okay just for example someone
might call this freak show leaf shape a
[SPEAKER_05]: phenotype and just say that is uh an
interesting phenotype of cannabis but for
[SPEAKER_05]: jordan and i we we go through and look at
these different freaks and and we think of
[SPEAKER_05]: each one of these leaf shapes that's
different and so on and so forth we think
[SPEAKER_05]: of those as phenotypes as well so um i
that's why i just would say that the word
[SPEAKER_05]: phenotype is subjective that's okay it's
it's meant to be subjective they use
[SPEAKER_00]: overall phenotype for that you know
overall phenotype includes everything
[SPEAKER_00]: about the plants yeah and then we have
chemo type and then looking at the
[SPEAKER_00]: genotype and chirp type even you know
chirp profile is another yeah whole area
[SPEAKER_05]: of genes and i always tell people when you
combine all of it together and you find
[SPEAKER_05]: that plant that you really love that we we
call that one a dreamotype yeah right i
[SPEAKER_00]: got the problem of i kind of get into
where everything i got i love it all uh so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why i have so many lines of freak
show i could take it in any direction i

the view over the uh klamath base actually
[SPEAKER_05]: you have to excuse me i'm not always just
walking through our greeting facility but
[SPEAKER_05]: oh what the hell anyways so all right this
is uh the scenery here in northeast
[SPEAKER_05]: humboldt county kind of a an unusually um
cloudy day we were potentially going to
[SPEAKER_05]: have some thunderstorms today but they
seem to be holding off but normally it's
[SPEAKER_05]: uh just bright blue skies right now right
now that's that that's that looks like a
[SPEAKER_05]: happy uh happy spot it's a beautiful spot
we have a wonderful spot for breeding here
[SPEAKER_05]: we have uh 25 000 square feet and we breed
in all of it or breed or do really
[SPEAKER_05]: intensive you know hunting like you see
there and um you know we were honored to
[SPEAKER_05]: be able to do freak show here but we have
of course you know 50 different genetics
[SPEAKER_05]: that we maintain here um each one of them
has this individual pollination chamber
[SPEAKER_05]: and um it's a heck of a lot of work we
rarely take time out and just so happened
[SPEAKER_05]: that um our interview we kind of a meeting
a meeting of the minds are a lot of people
[SPEAKER_05]: come here to the farm today you know sort
of a special moment and uh inspiration
[SPEAKER_08]: very cool well let let's uh let's pick
this up i mean uh we should do stuff like
[SPEAKER_08]: you get great reception so i'd love to do
stuff from the farm and like like even
[SPEAKER_08]: like you know i'm just thinking like off
the top of my head like talk through your
[SPEAKER_08]: like your process of feminizing seeds and
like different breeding topics where you
[SPEAKER_05]: could teach people and um well we try to
we try to be really really like sharing
[SPEAKER_05]: and not you know have too many trade
secrets because we actually want people to
[SPEAKER_05]: try breeding themselves and we want people
to get into it and you know we feel like
[SPEAKER_05]: the more people understand about it the
more they'll understand how much like work
[SPEAKER_05]: and real effort so so is that corn in the
background yeah that's our little sweet
[SPEAKER_05]: corn patch that we do every year for you
know the the trim trim not the crew but
[SPEAKER_05]: the seed harvest team and guys talking
about the sweet cron which if anybody has
[SPEAKER_05]: ever gone through southern oregon you see
the big company that does sweet cron it's
[SPEAKER_05]: like they have corn and weed for sale
that's fine we all like to you know no one
[SPEAKER_05]: one wants to get fully sort of that in my
early days of breeding so right he's got
[SPEAKER_05]: quite a few years on me and right always
really you know we want to pay deference
[SPEAKER_05]: to that here at humboldt seed company
because there's so many that came before
[SPEAKER_05]: us and even though i've been here growing
and breeding in humboldt for five years
[SPEAKER_05]: almost or is that no more than that i
guess but anyway um i still feel like i'm
[SPEAKER_05]: you know a beginner in a lot of respects
compared to some of the folks whoa but
[SPEAKER_05]: anyway peter it's been amazing and uh i
guess i'll sign off now all right and i'll
[SPEAKER_08]: i'll check in soon what are we looking at
there to be honest this is uh this is
[SPEAKER_05]: forbidden fruit got it which um my
cultivation manager here at the farm uh
[SPEAKER_05]: just loves forbidden fruit and i like it
