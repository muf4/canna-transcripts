[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, my name is Danny Keith.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the CEO and founder of Cannabis Club
TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're an indispensable television network
with hundreds of hours of content and
[SPEAKER_02]: which one of them is the Boveda channel,
which is well received.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, which is dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for you guys to do that for us,
definitely appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do get the feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were talking about a little bit
earlier with a gentleman we ran into
[SPEAKER_00]: because he had asked us, you know,
who's your core audience?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talked about, you know,
very much the producers, the cultivators,
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Say it's lifestyle, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lifestyle thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Walked right into the show.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, so we were talking and it's
interesting because you're the first to
[SPEAKER_00]: pitch up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, yeah, you know, while a
better part of Boveda's customers,
[SPEAKER_00]: the producers, the grower, you're like,
those guys come into the store and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you have the distributors coming in this
store and you have the bud tenders in the
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think you made an excellent point of
although your system, your TVs are on the
[SPEAKER_00]: front line for like about a quarter of the
time, you're in the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: That doesn't mean only consumers are
seeing the message, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you know, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that we did,
you know, prior to really scaling was
[SPEAKER_02]: understand the atmosphere, maybe talk to
the dispensary owner, ask them what they
[SPEAKER_02]: have going on and just hang out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's surprising that, you know,
a lot of dispensaries are getting between
[SPEAKER_02]: three and five hundred people a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's customers, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I've I've hung out in dispensaries all day
doing installs and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's probably another 100 to 150
industry people coming through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just constantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't understand this revolving
door being a new industry where you have
[SPEAKER_00]: the vendors and the local reps and all
that just coming through and coming
[SPEAKER_00]: through and coming through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we talked a little bit,
too, like in this day and age,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially if you're not using video
driven content to tell your story,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're really losing out, even if it's
only living on your YouTube channel or,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, wherever it may be.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, the message is just
well consumed with video.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it didn't take a lot of us
in your arm to see for you guys to do a
[SPEAKER_02]: channel because I think you saw the
opportunity to to have another set of
[SPEAKER_02]: exposure that maybe you wouldn't get
otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a lot of people see the packs in the
in people's product and that's where it
[SPEAKER_02]: stops.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't really go any further.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if they are sitting there watching and
also they put two and two together,
[SPEAKER_02]: you start becoming a favorite of theirs
because now all of a sudden you're helping
[SPEAKER_02]: their products stay fresh longer and be
more enjoyable, if you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the thing, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear from consumers, which is
surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: We hear from consumers, which is
surprising.
We hear from consumers, which is
surprising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's why we do some shows
where it's B2B and B2C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of those consumers, they'll say,
yeah, I got this product when I bought Top
[SPEAKER_00]: Shelf from fill in the blank dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually took it out of that because I
went through the product, but the pack was
[SPEAKER_00]: still good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put it in my stash jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now I need to get more of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a great, great opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I knew you guys were winning in the
B2C field when I was nice enough to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: little care package from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I brought one home to my wife.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's like, oh, yeah, I already use
those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I peel them out of the stuff I get back
from the dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh, fair enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there is a little bit of that
self-induced education with your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that you guys are a critical
component in extending the lifespan of
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically flour, obviously,
before the consumer buys it, which is like
[SPEAKER_02]: an unwritten or unknown factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that because you're doing the
content, because of you guys doing
[SPEAKER_02]: podcasts like this, it helps the customer
understand where your role is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, again, I mean, I'm fluffing
you up right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what we want to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want to help.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our whole premise for our company is to
help educate the consumer, not just on
[SPEAKER_02]: flour, but on testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the guy we were talking to was a
lab.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's like, other brands go through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other brands are not happy with their
labs.
[SPEAKER_02]: They see your ad.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden they're like, oh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we try to offer a well-rounded,
not just the brand specific side,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we try to get in the B2B stuff as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you can share, I'm sure not all of
this is public information.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're under friendier.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we always have those kind of
conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smile.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us what you can share about some
of these new opportunities and new
[SPEAKER_00]: partnerships you have going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think what we're doing, right now,
is applicable to other verticals and other
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in addition to more and more people,
especially in the cannabis space,
[SPEAKER_02]: are producing content.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're a really attractive nuisance for
them to be able to get that automatic
[SPEAKER_02]: exposure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, just for the record on content
providers, they have an opportunity to
[SPEAKER_02]: monetize in line.
[SPEAKER_02]: So by the time we get the content from
them, they're already monetizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be able to guarantee them
those impressions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started expanding our categorical
search.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're a fringe one, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because not only you're a B2B,
but you're kind of more on the flower side
[SPEAKER_02]: of things, like cultivation side of
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's definite ends and
beginnings in the cannabis space on where
[SPEAKER_02]: the people are able to market.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there's the other area that they
don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where we saw the need in Hydro
to kind of have a space where we can help
[SPEAKER_02]: tell that story inside those stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a critical component of the
process of growing and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we launched Harvest TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did that in partnership with Green
Bros.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're building nice six foot tall
stainless encased stands.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the TV is right in your face.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Hydro stores move their stuff around
a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't necessarily have walls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a different breed than
dispensaries, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're on camera, buddy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in the field, people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are live in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not a stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our props.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are real dumb people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Harvest TV is an exciting thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We launched with Grogin first.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got there 19 stores across 14
states.
[SPEAKER_02]: Congrats on that, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're learning that space now,
a different set of clientele.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to be launching in the
early part of March HeadShop TV.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we also see a crossover, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it kind of just goes in line with
everything that we try to, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: when I look at the way I operate as a
businessman is I first identify a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I say, OK, well, can I manufacture a
solution?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then is there a monetizable component
to that solution?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then is it really provide a healthy
return for the people that get involved?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so on our site, we have a marketplace.
[SPEAKER_02]: We sell accessories like grinders and dab
rigs for companies that are advertising
[SPEAKER_02]: lists that can't do e-commerce.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're not really in cannabis stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've been asking us to go into
HeadShop so that they can have that
[SPEAKER_02]: immediate traction.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be fully in three different
categories by the first part of Q2.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, we got some exciting
things going on with Grasshopper kiosks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be putting the TVs on top
of the Grasshopper kiosks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're local guys, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They are from the Bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're in Hayward, I believe,
or Oakland.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're going to be the TVs on top of
those kiosks.
[SPEAKER_02]: No kidding.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little different model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, you know, we've got to be a little
bit more specific to the vending machine
[SPEAKER_02]: component.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's going to roll out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's already in market right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing a beta and it looks really
well received.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to be doing mobile
plays like mobile tours and buses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a deal brewing with the Uber
and Lyft television company that's going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be broadcasting content into Uber and
Lyft.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're taking the same thing that we did
in cannabis and we're just replicating it
[SPEAKER_02]: across other alternative markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've got a great library of content
and a really eager consumer of that
[SPEAKER_02]: content and a marketplace that needs a
brand to that consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, and I like the fact that you are kind
of looking at everything from channels,
[SPEAKER_00]: both literally and metaphorically
speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, who are these audiences?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a company that needs to advertise,
you know, we're proud to be the alpha.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're proud to be the leader.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just like Coca-Cola sponsoring FIFA,
no matter what position you're at,
[SPEAKER_00]: you always have to promote.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a lot of fake news out
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of times people are telling
things that aren't true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's true about your brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if you're the leader,
you've got to straighten that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's nice to hear that you're
targeting other audiences, though,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we are recognizing, to your point,
hydro.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, head shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: Head shops, smoke shops have had a
different angle since the whole cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: scene came on.
[SPEAKER_02]: I kind of thought, and I know you've been
in this space for a minute, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we all kind of thought that
dispensaries would just organically sell a
[SPEAKER_02]: ton of consumption devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the regulation has made it a
little bit interesting.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: State by state, like Washington,
you cannot.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only thing you can sell in your
dispensary are cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think also just the overwhelming
inventory levels that cannabis stores had
[SPEAKER_02]: to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that kind of left head shops off to the
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to see 2019 and 2020
be the year of the head shop.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still need to get the supplies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was just talking to a gentleman from
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what he said.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, you know, I go to my local
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the oil tanks and they have the
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, but they don't have grinders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to buy a grinder while I was here in
the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to buy papers while I was here in
the Bay Area.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's you would think you'd get
the tools to do the job.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been my advice.
[SPEAKER_02]: People that say they want to get into
cannabis lately on a retail level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just tell them, open a head shop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're like, why would I do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, well, there's no regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just need a business permit and a
landlord that'll let you do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's not the litany of other things
that has to take place.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't even do tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would just do and then just become the
premier place to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that, let me ask, both of us being
based out of California, which is in an
[SPEAKER_00]: interesting space right now, we'll just
say we knew 2018 was going to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: transitional year, but the permanent regs
didn't even come out until last month.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think for 2019 and 2020?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you think the market is going to
continue to mature, not just California,
[SPEAKER_00]: but domestically?
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, take that next step it needs
to for success?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, everything I do is based on numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: People can have a perception or try to
sell a perception.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I have discussions with people,
it's about what are the results?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the numbers?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've seen that the state's intent
to regulate has manufactured a bigger gray
[SPEAKER_02]: and black market now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's manufactured a bigger gray and black
market, which they have to basically dial
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: The state has to realize that they need to
do this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the regulations are going to be
modified.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any time you go in and regulate an
unregulated market that's been on its own
[SPEAKER_02]: for multiple decades, you're going to have
a snapback.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody's in this shock and awe that,
oh my gosh, we got this black market still
[SPEAKER_02]: in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's recreational.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's the first round of regulations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We already have a couple concepts.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, I think the state's got to level out
or calibrate their taxation and ease up a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit so that less people are enticed
to go black market.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Easier said than done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number two, the commodity component of
cannabis is up and down.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the stability of price which I
think is going to come from organizations
[SPEAKER_02]: working together.
[SPEAKER_02]: The stabilization of cannabis so that
there can be money made from good people
[SPEAKER_02]: would be helpful because sometimes people
really win and sometimes people really
[SPEAKER_02]: lose.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I think the final component is to
stop letting the consumer drive the
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary pricing and let the dispensary
and the brands determine the pricing that
[SPEAKER_02]: then the consumers will consume because
for everybody to think that they can get
[SPEAKER_02]: the top shelf cannabis for 45 bucks plus
tax, I'm a whiskey guy too, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I could get the top shelf for 45 bucks,
I'm in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got to do some price adjustments on the
market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nonetheless, it's an exciting time.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not for the faint at heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: It takes a lot of eating bowls of shit to
basically get here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think money is always the driving
agent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you have to look at what you're
processing and then you work on your
[SPEAKER_02]: variables within there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with a couple of brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: I work with Tommy's brand, Chong's Choice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even though he's an influencer,
it's not easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still have all the same market
pressures.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys do Willie's Reserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I talked to those guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just market pressures that are not
predictable, that don't exist in other
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the cube thing, the five times five
times five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my two cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that as far as industry trends
that you're noticing, you're obviously
[SPEAKER_00]: touching on brands and definitely good to
hear that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these brands seem to be maturing
and coming into fruition, but what is your
[SPEAKER_00]: take on trending as far as bigger brands,
smaller brands?
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to say I'm really excited about the
data that's coming out.
[SPEAKER_02]: People embracing data.
[SPEAKER_02]: People were afraid of that at first.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had BDS, you had headset.
[SPEAKER_02]: People are starting to pay attention to
the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all think what we know when we want to
sell to a consumer, but if you just listen
[SPEAKER_02]: to the consumer, you tend to do a little
better.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mean you put all your eggs in
one bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got BDSs and headsets, reports for
the last quarter coming into the first
[SPEAKER_02]: quarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sativa gummies are the top selling item.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think you're seeing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sativa gummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen, data is important, but also use a
little common sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look for the sleeper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't just jump on the hot one,
because the hot one's going to be passing.
[SPEAKER_02]: By the time you know it's hot,
it's already gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always pointed out, huge fan of
Sweetgrass Kitchen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shout out to Julie and Jesse out in
Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a little bit more of a boutique
compared to Wana brands or Sheba or Dixie,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they've been very even keel in their
growth, very successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came out with microdose.
[SPEAKER_00]: They came out with these little 2.5 to 3.5
milligram, that was like lossages,
[SPEAKER_00]: these little chews back in 2014,
2015.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before they were making you microdose?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, before they were making you
microdose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seriously, everyone was like, oh,
10 milligrams, that's it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we'll do as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was the thing that they were going
against.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's racing to the top, putting as
much in as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite contrary, we want to cater to the
mainstream that's coming on.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called the know your market routine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Know your niche and then just own that
niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly true.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the niche they came into.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even I had the epiphany growing up in the
Bay Area like you did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm out there in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, gosh, all the people that used
to consume and get it from black market
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to come over to legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, those people already had their plugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They already had their outlet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the mainstream guys and gals that
were coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't want this crazy race to the
top THC of 30, 35% Trinobles and amnesias.
[SPEAKER_00]: That scares them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does because they're thinking they can
consume what they consumed back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 60s, the 70s, you and I, the 80s or 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a fraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even just in the last seven years,
they're saying that the potency has gone
[SPEAKER_00]: up 4x.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, go back 20 years, 30 years,
what's been the multiplier.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the microdose, in your point,
those companies are not just industry
[SPEAKER_00]: trends, but figure out what the next thing
is.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, Sativa Gummies is hot,
but flour is always going to be at 25% to
[SPEAKER_02]: 35% of the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people have long since gone off of
THC value.
[SPEAKER_02]: Indica Sativa Hybrid.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all hybrids, just for the record.
[SPEAKER_02]: 80, 90% are hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple land racers out there,
but they're rare.
A few.
[SPEAKER_02]: Northern Lights, Nacapocos.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of your Durbans are still somewhat
pure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're seeing an evolution of the
plant too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was fortunate enough to speak with some
doctors at UCLA who are really not just
[SPEAKER_02]: synthesizing and bastardizing the plant,
but really taking it apart and
[SPEAKER_02]: understanding how many components are
within the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're going to learn a lot this
year about how terpenes influence us,
[SPEAKER_02]: the combination of THCV with terpenes and
a CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: What does that do for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: True entourage effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: To your point, what you're talking about,
and I talked to a doctor during my time at
[SPEAKER_00]: Weedmaps.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's she brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's like, we haven't divulged or put it
out there, but terpenes 100% enhance the
[SPEAKER_00]: high.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we were smoking weed before we knew
what we know now, and someone said,
[SPEAKER_02]: oh, this is the OG or this is the blue
dream, we would organically gravitate
[SPEAKER_02]: towards the ones that didn't make us feel
like we were a total ... I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoke sometimes and I'm like,
I started contemplating in my head too
[SPEAKER_02]: much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking, man, I'm a horrible person.
[SPEAKER_01]: The things I think if people knew.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you smoke some and you're like,
I want to clean the house right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like we organically gravitated
towards what we want.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think as we go forward now, I'm a big
fan of CBG and CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: CBG is the best sleeping agent you can
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with CBN.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we continue to learn, it's our job to
continue to educate the undereducated.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that there's X amount of people
that are coming on new as customers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why Sativa gummies are blowing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not blowing up on the weed head
guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The weed head guy's not going in and
buying Sativa gummies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of those things where I think
we've got a long ways to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be an exciting ride,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will allow new things to begin to
emerge.
[SPEAKER_02]: We started hearing about terpenes about a
year, a little over a year ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think people fully comprehend that
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the next winner's in flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say flowers are always going to
have a horse in the race, but you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to see, oh, vape's going off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God, now this is blowing off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, still, if you look at BDS or
headset, 50%, 51%, approximately half of
[SPEAKER_00]: all products sold in dispensaries that
they track.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cones, pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're projecting, as early as 2020,
maybe later on in 2022, that it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be 30%, 35%.
[SPEAKER_00]: A third of it's going to be flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: The statistics guy in my head says,
you're right, but then the cannabis guy
[SPEAKER_02]: that's been living in this space says,
I don't know if I can back that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been an advocate on the
medical side, but I'm a drier vape because
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's healthier and more reliable
than oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, unfortunately, the verdict's still
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the only oils I ever consume are
from companies, Temple or Native.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely know that they're components
and their contents are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're only reintroducing natural turps,
not food grade turps like PEG or PPG.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or fragrant oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you just don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think in the coming years,
we'll see that maybe oil isn't the most
[SPEAKER_00]: out of the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm hearing people are going to just smoke
turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what I'm hearing down the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know people that smoke turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you find a turp that really
activates for you, yes, we have a dozen or
[SPEAKER_02]: thousands of different beers, but they all
kind of have the same end result.
[SPEAKER_02]: Whereas the plant, we're just getting
started to understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's another show to talk about
hemp and that whole component.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's exciting times to see people out
of the closet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have meetings every week with people
that when I first came out of the closet,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're like, you're crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're never going to get another job.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just ruined your career.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're asking me for advice and
hitting me up on LinkedIn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just send them my Venmo account.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just say, send me $500 and we can
talk for an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've learned some crazy stuff,
dude, by hard knocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's very true.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I parted ways with the cannabis,
the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had friends, especially in digitalmedia
.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, well, at least you can
still say you worked for Digital First
[SPEAKER_00]: Media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can segue back into this and that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a feeling.
[SPEAKER_00]: And man, within the first 48 hours,
having folks like Weed Maps and High Times
[SPEAKER_00]: and Medicine Man reach out to me,
I'm like, obviously, this is my calling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the industry is telling me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, look, there's no shortage of
opportunities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a little bit of a shortage of
intelligence in some places.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think, listen, that's the reason why
we're pioneers, if you will.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're risk takers or entrepreneurs or
whatever you want to classify.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, we have a vision.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take the risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes it has a reward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most often than not, it has a reward.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we go into that knowing that there may
not be a reward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's just not for the most people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's true.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, when people ask me about getting
into cannabis, we had this talk,
[SPEAKER_02]: too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, well, what do you do already?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, and so I think you can probably
bring it to us that we need.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need doctors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need logistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need HR.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need real trade show people,
not just promo people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need real people that can make sales
that understand the sales process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need people that can slow it down
and do the right deals, not the deal right
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we need some cohesiveness among
certain players in the market,
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Long Beach, I'm going to give a shout out
to those guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have the LBCA.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a very organized group of people.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't let the brands push them
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't let the legal people push them
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've protected themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've done that through an
organization, sometimes frenetic,
[SPEAKER_02]: but agreed to process, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think we have to start to see
those things, too, to really continue to
[SPEAKER_02]: mature the place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's always going to be people
that try to do a speedy Gonzalez around
[SPEAKER_02]: the end and make a bunch of money real
quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those opportunities are going to start
to go away.
[SPEAKER_02]: And look, some people are going to make
it, and some people aren't.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some people are going to morph.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wish I could tell you what was going to
happen over the next year.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2018 felt like a five-year year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of the last five years for me,
it was definitely an interesting one,
[SPEAKER_00]: to say the least, domestic and abroad.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always good catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely good chatting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I love talking with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love having the ability to talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just keeps walking right through our
shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a celebrity.
Right through our shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't even know it right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I think just to end it for me,
I appreciate what you do and where you
[SPEAKER_02]: ended up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that no matter where you go,
that we'll have a friendship.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's really the networking
component of this space is really healthy.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely people I don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get along with and don't work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the people that I've invested time in
and that I have friendships with,
[SPEAKER_02]: they carry over into other areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's another thing that
might be impacting 2019 is as people
[SPEAKER_02]: change rosters, just like the NBA trade,
the teams come out different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you've brought a wealth of information
and opportunity to Boveda.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope they appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, man, I think they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get that vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wish you a catch-up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
