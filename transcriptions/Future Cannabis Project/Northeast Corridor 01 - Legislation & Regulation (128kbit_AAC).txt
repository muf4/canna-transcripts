[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say about six, seven years ago,
I started covering cannabis at the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: I used to work at the street.com with
Kramer and I started covering cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've really been covering it for quite
some time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I, you know,
we'll kick off right now is legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things I had heard from one of
my sources was that they thought that this
[SPEAKER_00]: administration was going to reschedule
cannabis to a level three.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had heard that was for a year's
quarter, but I think now with the
[SPEAKER_00]: government shutdown, that's off the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: But some of the people I talked to about
schedule three said that they really did
[SPEAKER_00]: not want that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to kind of put that to the
panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys heard that about Washington
bringing it down to a three?
[SPEAKER_00]: And if so, have you heard anything else?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what have you heard?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what is your thought on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I have heard that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would agree with the naysayers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do not think it's a good idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it will lead to a lot of
confusion.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I say that because if it goes to level
three, then presumably you would need a
[SPEAKER_03]: prescription at a pharmacy prescribed by a
physician to purchase marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's really unclear as to what it
would do for the recreational use market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to add to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody believes that there needs to be
cannabis reform federally.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of folks who get charged
with crimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are in prison for cannabis related
crimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that needs to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: But regardless of what the federal
government does, it puts you on a pathway
[SPEAKER_01]: to lose-lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because right now, the federal government
prohibition is the only thing keeping out
[SPEAKER_01]: the bigs.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you turn it over to schedule three,
you're then regulated medically by the
[SPEAKER_01]: FDA.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which means the cannabis industry is being
gift wrapped for big pharma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because every product that's developed is
going to have to go through clinical
[SPEAKER_01]: trials.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to have to go through FDA
approval to show that it's effective and
[SPEAKER_01]: safe for human use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Alternatively, the other option is to turn
it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's to de-schedule it completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it away from the FDA and say,
we're going to give this to ATF and
[SPEAKER_01]: regulate it like tobacco and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem there is you're opening it up
for all the big tobacco companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're opening it up for all the big
alcohol companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen that they're excited to do
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of them are making investments in
Canada right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And developing a cannabis related product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's tough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really tough situation to be in
right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the federal prohibition,
we have this really neat little industry
[SPEAKER_01]: where regular people are building up
businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regular folks are elevating their status
in life for their families and for the
[SPEAKER_01]: folks around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's all these new jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without the bigs coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't have the answer here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a policy decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: But any sort of change at the federal
level, whether it's putting it at schedule
[SPEAKER_01]: three, four, five, or de-scheduling it
completely and turning it over to the
[SPEAKER_01]: states, it's going to invite the big boys
in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to make it much harder for
the regular folks who are trying to run a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis business to continue what they
have going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that maybe is the issue is if
people that are within the industry can't
[SPEAKER_00]: agree on the correct solution,
it's kind of hard to expect our regulators
[SPEAKER_00]: and our politicians and legislators to
figure out what is the best solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at least for the industry itself,
it's going to provide the industry so much
[SPEAKER_01]: more flexibility and freedom if it's
de-scheduled completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because turning it over to schedule three
or any sort of schedule leaves it within
[SPEAKER_01]: the medical realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the cost of getting a product approved
by the FDA is going to be cost prohibitive
[SPEAKER_01]: for 99% of folks out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at least if it's de-scheduled,
you look at the alcohol industry as a
[SPEAKER_01]: model or something for comparison,
you do have small providers.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do have craft breweries and craft
producers who are doing things on the
[SPEAKER_01]: small level.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also will just invite Budweiser and the
big players to completely dominate the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry on a national level.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from my perspective, de-scheduling
seems to be the better solution for the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry rather than just moving it to
schedule three.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because then you're just pigeonholed into
that medical box and everything will have
[SPEAKER_01]: to go through FDA approval in order to be
on the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then Ed will have like nothing in his
database anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because he'll be like, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the first conferences we went to,
one of the keynoters said exactly what
[SPEAKER_02]: Aaron said, which was we benefit by having
the state regulatory framework for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's going to allow a lot of
companies to be innovative, to try things,
[SPEAKER_02]: and not be beholden to one regulator to
have so much power.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I would agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the amount of capital that has poured
into the industry, I mean, what happens to
[SPEAKER_03]: all these investors?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, all of a sudden, then you can't
sell what you've been selling.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it just doesn't make any sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't think it's going to happen
personally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's drill down then into our local
area, New York and New Jersey,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are both getting close to having
legislation on the books.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we know, Massachusetts just started
their adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had two dispensaries open on the
first day.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they up to now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Five?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they're up to about five.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they've had some.
[SPEAKER_02]: My Massachusetts researcher said they're
opening on the borders of the neighboring
[SPEAKER_02]: states.
[SPEAKER_02]: One's very close to New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: One's very close to Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think he said literally a stone's throw
into Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, I think that that's the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had spoken to a politician in New
Hampshire who had called me and asked me,
[SPEAKER_00]: just was doing some research and asked me
what I thought.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, here's the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you got guys decide to stick your head
in the sand and say no, all the states
[SPEAKER_00]: around you are going to give jobs to their
residents.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to have dispensaries in
their states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all the tax money is going to go to
all your neighbors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to be left empty handed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like that's almost like what
Cuomo realized was, holy crap,
[SPEAKER_00]: New Jersey and Massachusetts are going to
get all the jobs and all that tax money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be left empty handed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus, he finally had his group in Albany
that were clearly going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are we at with New Jersey?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know New Jersey's governor was
pushing for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then things seemed to really slow
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's obviously still on the table
in terms of when it's going to advance.
[SPEAKER_03]: My guess is this year and probably
sometime in this first quarter.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the other interesting thing about
New Jersey, too, and as Deborah's
[SPEAKER_02]: reported, we've seen a lot of the
multi-state operators come into that
[SPEAKER_02]: state, which changes the tenor of what
licensing is like when you only have a
[SPEAKER_02]: handful of licenses and it's competitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: And suddenly these people who have been
successful in running operations in other
[SPEAKER_02]: states come into your state.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to change the tenor because the
other data that you can research is who's
[SPEAKER_02]: paid the lobbyists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you often see that there is a
connection there.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it is going to have an impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll see how it plays out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know in New Jersey that that was a
big concern was people wanted to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that the small guy, the small player had a
chance to get into the New Jersey market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think we saw a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw some of the small players get these
licenses and then flip them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of don't blame them if you
spent like two million dollars or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, four million dollars trying to
get a license, which still is a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: money.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then somebody walks up to you and
says, hey, I'll give you 20 million for
[SPEAKER_00]: that license.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be like, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's kind of the problem is,
is now you like to Ed's point,
[SPEAKER_00]: you've now turned it over to, you know,
GTI or Cresco Labs or acreage.
[SPEAKER_01]: The big issue with New Jersey right now is
the taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the legislature, I think in their
latest proposal, they have a contemplated
[SPEAKER_01]: 12 percent tax rate and the governor wants
a 25 percent tax rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and before they're like even getting
down and dirty with like what the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulatory issues look like, they need to
figure out how much tax is going to be on
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think they have until about April to
figure out that issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but that's the problem we've had in
California is that there's there's too
[SPEAKER_01]: much tax in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state excise tax is 15 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: The state sales tax is seven and a half
percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the cities and counties get to
add tax on top of that in Los Angeles to
[SPEAKER_01]: buy adult use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a 33 percent tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with the tax that high, folks continue
to support the unlicensed market because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's that much cheaper.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, the folks in New Jersey,
the folks in New York, everyone like looks
[SPEAKER_01]: at this as a panacea for tax revenue that
this is going to solve all the state's
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's overtaxed that you need to bring it
down if you want like the overall system
[SPEAKER_01]: to succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: These these high taxes are completely
unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's going to be the key for
New York and New Jersey is to make sure
[SPEAKER_00]: that they don't make some of the mistakes
that California has made or even Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure a lot of people realize in
Oregon, the price of cannabis has fallen
[SPEAKER_00]: through the floor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that has ended up in the
black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, a lot of it is in New York.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all your black market dealers are all
selling you Oregon weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all ended up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But going back to going back to Deborah's
point about what's going to happen in New
[SPEAKER_02]: Jersey and New York, this whole notion of
first mover advantage.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I live in Connecticut and we saw
many years ago they glommed on to putting
[SPEAKER_02]: casinos in that weren't in New Jersey.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it brought in all sorts of people from
Rhode Island, from Massachusetts,
[SPEAKER_02]: New York.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then guess what happens?
[SPEAKER_02]: Other states are like, hey, us,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they'll go ahead and start doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the same thing with liquor taxes,
gasoline taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you see the people crossing state
lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think the same behavior is going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And because cannabis has played out so
much more publicly across the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States, I think it's a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people is that fear of missing
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in this case, it's fear of missing
out on tax dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think it's going to definitely move
more quickly than casinos, which took a
[SPEAKER_02]: long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and I feel like in New York,
the medical players are already setting
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves up to re-rec players because
you've got Medman's store on Fifth Avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got, I think it's Ianthus that is
going to have the Brooklyn store across
[SPEAKER_00]: from the Barclays Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so you can really feel like
these locations they picked, they picked
[SPEAKER_00]: for recreational in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess it's still too early on New
York to even know where we're going to go
[SPEAKER_00]: with the adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, well, that's interesting because in
New Jersey, they are giving in the
[SPEAKER_01]: proposal, they are giving priority to the
existing licensees.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's that's happened in almost every
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just from our experience, New York has
so few licensees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in Los Angeles, there's what,
like seven million people or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's there's about 200 licensed shops
just under and then another three to four
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred unlicensed shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like the folks who know that and
realize if we can keep New York to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 25 or under shops or 50 or under
shops, they're they're seeing like the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential cash bonanza there with a small
number of shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's it's really instrumental that
if, you know, regular folks are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to own these businesses that that
the state pursues policies for low barrier
[SPEAKER_01]: to entry, low capital cost to entry and
high number of participants, let let the
[SPEAKER_01]: market sort it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good operators are going to rise to
the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bad operators are going to go out of
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to artificially close a marketplace so
that you're handing lottery tickets to a
[SPEAKER_01]: few select businesses to make tens of
millions of dollars each year,
[SPEAKER_01]: it isn't it's unsustainable.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Toronto for Ontario, the province of
Ontario received twenty five hundred
[SPEAKER_01]: applications for their license lottery
with seventy dollars to enter twenty five
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred people applied for their chance to
get a retail license.
[SPEAKER_01]: New York would be making a tremendous
mistake if they kept it as limited as
[SPEAKER_01]: they've kept the medical program.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think they will, because in
New York, the winning argument has been
[SPEAKER_01]: social equity, the harm to the folks who
have been impacted by the war on drugs,
[SPEAKER_01]: the communities that have been impacted by
the war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It started during the the governor's race
and that was the issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: That Cynthia Nixon champion and Cuomo and
his proposal has has kept at least he's
[SPEAKER_01]: paid homage to it that we're looking to
help and find opportunities for those
[SPEAKER_01]: communities to get licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: His proposal is about 200 pages.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't read every detail in it yet,
so I can't like fact check it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at least the media talking points,
they are like talking about social equity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're not familiar with New York
right now, there's 10 license licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They started with five and then they
realized that was not enough and they
[SPEAKER_00]: bumped it up to 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: And within that 10, really, they're almost
all the MSOs, which is what we call them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The multistate operators are MSOs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd have to believe that the those
existing holders are going to have first
[SPEAKER_03]: dibs because they've been bleeding cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no revenue coming into New York
for the medical marijuana program.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's too restrictive.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's lack of doctor participation.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you go to Union Square, I think that's
the closest dispensary here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's probably nobody there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and you're right that one of the
first five licenses, I think, was
[SPEAKER_02]: Bloomfield sold to MedMen because they
were sustained the loss and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: enduring it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're well capitalized these companies,
but they're enduring the pain because they
[SPEAKER_03]: believe that they will be the first in
line for when it goes wreck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because MedMen's Fifth Avenue store,
I've heard, is not doing five,
[SPEAKER_00]: ten thousand dollars a month.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, but the thing is, in New York
City, the black market is so robust,
[SPEAKER_03]: the black market here that I could get
weed delivered quicker than a pizza.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's from Oregon and it's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the other thing, too, is like people
think, oh, yeah, I'm going to get a
[SPEAKER_03]: license.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a ticket for success and a
lottery ticket and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even the big players that are coming
in, the thing that's really the biggest
[SPEAKER_03]: risk factor I see is dilution,
because at any point in time, the state
[SPEAKER_03]: will then issue additional licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: The New York went from five to ten.
[SPEAKER_03]: Connecticut doubled their licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: New Jersey doubled their licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that valuation suddenly gets
diminished.
[SPEAKER_03]: But not Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_02]: They said, listen, we'll pay you five
million dollars, the three of us,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you won't add any more dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the state said, I'll take your money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And at some point when you think of these
stocks, these multistate operators,
[SPEAKER_03]: this should all have an impact on the
share price.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any of the moves that the states make
should impact this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but we're not really seeing that
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, I've got that kind of love
hate with the MSOs, because on the one
[SPEAKER_00]: hand, by having that much money and having
a really nice corporate organization,
[SPEAKER_00]: they are able to accomplish a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's all a bunch of middle aged white
men.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of bugs me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I look at their C-suite and I
see very few people of color or it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: token woman that's the head of HR.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a former NFL player who
they put on their board.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just really irritates me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're well funded.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very polished.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come in and, you know, you throw a
star, you know, politician on your board
[SPEAKER_00]: and there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they manage to open up a lot of doors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even in New York, I think attain is
one of the few female owned businesses
[SPEAKER_00]: here in New York.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: COO went to Hamilton College, so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the other thing I was going to say
about those management teams that Debra
[SPEAKER_02]: referenced is that I've seen a lot more of
them now being people with a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer packaged goods experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come out of Procter & Gamble.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come out of Molson.
[SPEAKER_02]: They come out of other Wrigley.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're starting to see, you know,
the management coming in from these other
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional big company industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really start to take some of the
senior roles in these big brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think the one that bugs me the
most is Green Growth Brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those guys were all like laid off
Victoria's Secret folks out of Columbus,
[SPEAKER_00]: Ohio.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you knew that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they come into the industry and they're
like, oh, man, all these cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries, they don't know how to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know retail because we sold bras.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to show them how to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they buy a dispensary in Las Vegas,
the source, which is already doing 17
[SPEAKER_00]: million dollars a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, apparently they know how to do it
because they're doing 17 million dollars a
[SPEAKER_00]: year, which is not too shabby.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, they're their claim to fame is
that they're all from Victoria's Secret,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, in my opinion, was a bunch of men
selling bras to women and over
[SPEAKER_00]: objectifying the women and hyper
sexualizing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they lost sight of the fact that there
was a whole hashtag me to and college
[SPEAKER_00]: rape.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were not paying attention to
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: To me, they were not really good
retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to come into the cannabis industry a
little late to the party and to say that
[SPEAKER_00]: they knew how to do it and no one else did
really bugged me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting is that they just
made a bid to buy another company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that kind of brings us to our next
topic, which is consolidation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing a lot of consolidation
happening in the market right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like every week I'm talking about
another acquisition that is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to talk a little bit more
about that.
