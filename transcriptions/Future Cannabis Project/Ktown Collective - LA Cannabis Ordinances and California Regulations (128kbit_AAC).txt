[SPEAKER_00]: City of Los Angeles can't even get their
original pre-ICO's license properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all struggling to meet a deadline in
August to have our annual licenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just waiting for the Department
of Cannabis Regulations in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it goes from Los Angeles,
kicks it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the state's a little bit more
ready to accept it, but because
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's based on a municipality and
where that's going, that's where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: just a big tangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there's been a lot of
investigations for politicians taking
[SPEAKER_00]: money under the table, trying to direct
licenses into different people's hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there's a lot of dirty money.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're seeing that all over the
country where politicians are not doing
[SPEAKER_00]: the right thing and everyone wanted to
say, oh, here's the social equity program
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone's got a chance and I'm so
sorry about your injustice that happened
[SPEAKER_00]: to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing happened to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was arrested in 2012.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I any different in the amount that
I went through and what I lost?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is my social injustice any different
than someone else's?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's not fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because I could go back and get more
licenses and I can put them under my name
[SPEAKER_00]: and I would be my social equity partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would love to be partners with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been partners with me in Cannabis for
over 12 years, so I'll make an excellent
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis partner.
[SPEAKER_01]: But OK, so specific.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're you're still operating with a
temporary license right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still operate with a temporary license.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually submitted to put in our annual
license with the DCR believe last April
[SPEAKER_00]: this past April a few weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still in a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't see them doing anything with
that application before July 1st,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said 60 days and then they wanted
another 30 days and then that license gets
[SPEAKER_00]: kicked up to the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our state license was extended out to
August right now, I believe.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as we get to that August deadline in
2019, the state will either have to issue
[SPEAKER_00]: another temp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or the city will actually do stuff and
will actually start to get go through the
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are all the pre ICO people in LA kind
of in the same boat as you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's in the same way.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no permanent license.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this should to anyone in the city of
Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when you all sit down and talk shop
on this topic, what's kind of the it's
[SPEAKER_00]: laughable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really laughable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's laughable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would think that with the amount of
knowledge that sits in a room,
[SPEAKER_00]: because Herb Westman's also president of
City Council Herb Westman's him,
[SPEAKER_00]: his office and his staff have been so with
the doors open for everyone and us to come
[SPEAKER_00]: in and talk about problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how the ordinance needs to be crafted
and changed and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: First open doors is that they've been like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do run and still to the council people
that put a roadblock up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of seeing where the positivity
and how things could grow and the tax
[SPEAKER_00]: revenues that everyone is so busy trying
to go after being able to collect those
[SPEAKER_00]: tax revenues for the benefit of the
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everyone's already trying to
reallocate where the tax revenues go that
[SPEAKER_00]: are that are derived from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Gavin Newsom was on the news last
week saying he'd like to take the legal
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis revenues and pay for diapers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, how many places do you
want to take?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, squeeze a turn up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't get only get so much blood out
of something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But specific to L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first of all, how many pre ICO shops
are there who are waiting to get everyone?
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's got a permanent.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe it's about no, it's a should be
a hundred and thirty five, I believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not a lot of licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a license process.
No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of the DMV and think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone said the reason that they
licensed the pre ICOs was because we had
[SPEAKER_00]: the experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the paperwork in order.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had everything together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those applications were probably the
easiest to source.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them may be missing certain
documents that you had to go back just
[SPEAKER_00]: because of an attrition over time or
moving or raids and everything that we
[SPEAKER_00]: were thrown at us for all these years.
[SPEAKER_00]: That documents got lost, but they've made
exceptions for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's holding up the Department of
Cannabis Regulations in Los Angeles?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really have no clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Though two times I've visited down there
to pick something up or or get a pass or
[SPEAKER_00]: submit some paperwork.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I literally sat in a lobby.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like an empty office.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's it's it's I guess sometimes you need
to get a business person in a room when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're trying to organize like an industry
because it is a business so that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of leadership direction on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not always just a policy driven
thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still got to have the nuts and bolts
in the engine to make the car drive.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's the worst case scenario that
they don't get their act together in time
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're in this limbo?
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst case scenario is if they don't
extend the temporary licensing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the city, the city and the state,
if they don't extend that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they can't process their paperwork on
time, they're going to have to make
[SPEAKER_00]: another bandaid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And California seems just like that's
their favorite thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's have another bandaid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's not work worry about traffic and
infrastructure and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just knock it out and take care of
18 months, three years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll figure it out in five years what we
messed up then.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's such a crazy way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, a businessman builds business from
the foundation and you have grassroots and
[SPEAKER_00]: you really build a foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of why the pre-ICO's have been
in the position they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had Koreatown Collective since 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't think I have a big foundation
and people really respect and come back to
[SPEAKER_00]: us because we explain the medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: We explain to them what's going to happen,
where we try to help them with their
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really question to ask what is it that
you're looking to treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone was talking about adult use and
recreational.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of those adult use recreational
patients really needed cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're really giving up some of their
other pharmaceutical drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole part of where we were supposed
to be going with Prop 64 was education and
[SPEAKER_00]: knowledge and empowering the people to be
able to make better decisions so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: would have easy exposure and easy access
to cannabis so that they're allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: improve their lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all they're doing is making it harder
and harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the taxes that are come on,
it's basically a sin tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: A person that needed cannabis to survive
every day so they weren't on painkillers
[SPEAKER_00]: or opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're taking other kinds of drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't afford their cannabis anymore
by the time you tax it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can go find a guy in the street and
go get it from their guy and not pay the
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't see the support from the
policymakers and the government to try to
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of that and to get rid of the
illegal shops and the illegal guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come to our store and they've got
tears in their eyes because we can't even
[SPEAKER_00]: give them free stuff anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't even pass along the samples.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm fortunate because some of the
companies I do will leave me samples
[SPEAKER_00]: behind in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do them at a discounted price,
whatever, and then we discount them to our
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether they come in and they get
something in a regular size, I can give
[SPEAKER_00]: them another size for a dollar.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried to come around those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: My partner and I, we kind of circumvented
the whole THC process, drew a line in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sand and opened a CBD store two doors down
called the Antidote.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because so many people that had a stigma
about THC or cannabis and didn't know what
[SPEAKER_00]: it was, they can come get some pain relief
and get different types of things and have
[SPEAKER_00]: no worries about having a psychoactive
effect of what's going on, but actually
[SPEAKER_00]: get that cannabinoid into their system to
help balance and regulate their system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like from a retail operational
standpoint, that CBD business is a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: more unencumbered to just be a retail
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBD store, it's like back to my hope
again, where I used to spend my time in
[SPEAKER_00]: K-Town.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were vertically integrated and we
literally took our clones, cut our clones,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we grew them all the way out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We grew them all the way out so that
whether you left with flour in a jar or
[SPEAKER_00]: you had an edible or you had a concentrate
and we were vertically integrated,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what I recreated going back into
CBD world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I know I got to move fast?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we created a skincare company.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no one else in the space like what
we have right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I know to run fast and go fast and get
it out there and market it and brand it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I think the regulations will be there
in three to five years?
[SPEAKER_00]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the good news is that I'm coming from
THC world, so I already know the rules and
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the testing and all those little
things that you're supposed to be doing
[SPEAKER_00]: along the way, we're already doing in CBD
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it more fun in CBD world?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can think.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not dealing with the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have three to five years to not deal
with the bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure the government wants to figure
out how to get their piece of that market
[SPEAKER_00]: as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how they're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure how they're going to track
and trace the THC because we've been in
[SPEAKER_00]: place to track and trace every single
thing and they still don't have their
[SPEAKER_00]: metric system ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to be their first guinea
pig.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's obviously a lot of talk about the
unlicensed retail shops.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you see?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really see them as much,
but I'm on my same path every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that the LAPD is hard at work and
kudos to them because they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the cannabis industry in Los
Angeles better than anyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've gone from our worst nightmare and
our enemies to our biggest supporters.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I can tell you the ones in my
district have been amazing and supportive
[SPEAKER_00]: of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that they have every right to go
in and shut them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they can work with the power company,
so they go in.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just cut the power first and then
they take everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the unlicensed shops are not your
personal biggest pain point as a business
[SPEAKER_01]: operator?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't feel the pain from those shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's unfair because they're not
paying the taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's very unfair.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much unfair in this world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tackle that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really LAPD and the city has to do
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to get anything
straightened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's this whole thing when everyone
wanted to just legalize cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't think about maybe we should
fix the system we had first so we'd have
[SPEAKER_00]: some infrastructure to build on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then go forward, but everyone was such
in a hurry and government wanted the tax
[SPEAKER_00]: revenues and they ended up shooting
themselves in the foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be doing delivery?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're setting it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're first launching our delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to partner with someone and
it'll be like top tier stuff so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: get larger amounts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we'll roll out right behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll roll out where you can get
deliveries from K-Town Direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where your brands, that's where
your loyalty, that's where all 12 years of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I've done in my community will
make me different than everyone else
[SPEAKER_00]: because people will trust what I put in a
bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also, on-site consumption when they
finally approve it?
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, we would go next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're next door to a hookah bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've already spoken to, you know,
it's like five places on one lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've already spoken and because I
ended up being the mayor of my community
[SPEAKER_00]: block, I just like said, you have this in
that, you know, they don't run the hookah
[SPEAKER_00]: lounge really in the daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, you got this part, I got my part
and shook hands and just wait for the
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses to come out for the City of Los
Angeles, which I don't think will be
[SPEAKER_00]: anytime soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2020?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know even if I'll have an annual
license by 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does that tell you something?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, but Los Angeles is your biggest
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the most people.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really embarrassing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we need to fix the things
we're doing before we start creating more
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you a member of one of the groups?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I'm on the board of Glocka and SCC,
the Southern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Adam Spiker's group.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's, I will tell you, and this is,
you can quote me on this if it's still
[SPEAKER_00]: running, Adam Spiker really has done more
to bring cannabis and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry, not just the dispensary owners,
which are still like there and that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on the board, but the manufacturers,
the cultivators and the politicians
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better than anyone else and I've been part
of Glocka since 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm on their board now and although we
were ordinance and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you always had so much internal fighting
within the industry and this industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to survive if it doesn't come
together and act as a community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's its own village and Los Angeles
really needs to get their act together
[SPEAKER_00]: because so much is being lost from
California, from Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the revenues.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how do you not have these
businesses up and running in downtown L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: already?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, all that income would be coming in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All those employees would be spending
money in those local stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would still be to the gas stations
there, to the little grocery stores,
[SPEAKER_00]: to all the food shops, to all the food
trucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will tell you that Ron Galpern,
who's the CitiCom trailer, he gets it and
[SPEAKER_00]: he's probably done more behind the scenes
to get the engine going than anyone else
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Herb Wesson's been there but he
has his own motives as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think pure motives, Ron Galpern is
like a great, he's been a great advocate
[SPEAKER_00]: for the cannabis movement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you talk a minute about Glocka?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you've been involved with them for
a long time, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been really interested for a long
time and so I've been writing about and
[SPEAKER_02]: covering the different groups since just
2015 but even since then a lot has
happened.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's keeping Glocka together and what is
it doing now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'll be honest, it's really a
framework.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people that the board members are the
ones really holding it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a division that happened and
when we finished, after they did Prop D
[SPEAKER_00]: and everyone had come together,
there were some compromises made that
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't have been made back in 2013,
I believe it was, was when we voted Prop
[SPEAKER_00]: D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there was a split and there were some
splits that were made and there was
[SPEAKER_00]: another group that's UCBA and they split
over here and then you had your old
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional Glocka members over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Glocka came about and started to embrace
more the industry in the village and
[SPEAKER_00]: taking a look at things item by item.
[SPEAKER_00]: You couldn't just throw everything into a
basket.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't just arbitrarily say no one else
can have a delivery license.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not the way we live in the United
States of America no matter what.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you still have certain principles that
you have to uphold.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the Glocka became more to try to
involve themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: We became part of the SCC, which was Adam
Spiker's group.
[SPEAKER_00]: UCBA still operates over here by
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have any issues, whatever,
because I always lived in my own hula
[SPEAKER_00]: hoop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can go to them and talk to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand what they're trying to do but
also a lot of them are micro licenses so
[SPEAKER_00]: they have their own brand that they're
trying to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're cutting their nose off to spite
their face because who's gonna take their
[SPEAKER_00]: brand outside their own little hula hoop?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's the purpose?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not gonna work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Adam has been like a real big spearhead
of trying to work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's so much backstabbing and
people don't realize that you catch a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more flies with honey than you do vinegar.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it's the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Glocka's like kind of holds on a lot of
us did go into the SCC so we're there and
[SPEAKER_00]: very supportive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came onto the board at SCC because I was
supposed to represent the dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: owners and try to get everyone to
understand like there's a reason why she's
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this and giving my time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kind of like fallen off some because
I just had some personal stuff going on in
[SPEAKER_00]: my own life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm like, no, Adam said so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can help him, I'm all in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
