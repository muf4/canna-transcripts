[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, as a hash maker, I wouldn't trade
this place for anywhere else in the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I would go back to India for a
spell, but... I would definitely go back
[SPEAKER_01]: to India.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in India, they view the plants as
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: In California, it's flour, because
everyone smokes flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go to producing countries,
they don't see the plants as hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone's talking about hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hash is in the culture.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have kids from the age of three or
four helping and rubbing and carrying
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, or at least going up to the
bugichos, to the oldest grandmother.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like they're all working and they
all know it's a really beautiful time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the harvest in the mountains of
the Himalayas is not quite the same than
[SPEAKER_00]: the stress of the harvest here in the
mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, it's like, fuck, it's so fucking
unhealthy that sometimes you don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be in the middle of your harvest
when it should be the most amazing time of
[SPEAKER_00]: the year.
[SPEAKER_00]: In producing countries, actually... Why is
it unhealthy here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because of the people coming to rip you
off, the police.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of stress and gun and
people like super on edge because you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to make it happen.
Yeah, you can feel the vibe change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then on top of it, if you have bad weather
and you don't want to be around,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like, it's stressful.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no joy into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not until the Emerald Cup that people
start to relax and it's like, OK,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it has to be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is so much handicap, let's say.
It's got the extra explosion.
