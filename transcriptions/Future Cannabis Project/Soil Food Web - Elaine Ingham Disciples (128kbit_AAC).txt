[SPEAKER_03]: I'm going to get a religious reference in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So talking about Elaine Ingham,
soil food web, there are a lot of Elaine
[SPEAKER_03]: disciples in this conversation today.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like, if I think of Christianity,
there are a lot of forks, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you had Catholicism and then you had
the Protestant Reformation where,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we agree with 99% of
Catholicism, but we disagree with this one
[SPEAKER_03]: thing and we're going to go down our own
path.
[SPEAKER_03]: So can you all talk from your own
perspectives kind of where you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: different philosophy, where your
philosophies are slightly or very
[SPEAKER_03]: different than Elaine's?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some of the differences between how
you see her approaching things and your
[SPEAKER_03]: personal approaches.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I guess to tie it into your
religious thing is within the agricultural
[SPEAKER_04]: sector, people are as devout as religious
people are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, each religion lives and
dies by their uniqueness and nonetheless.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're, I think we're personally in a
stage where we're kind of going from this,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, religious approach where it's us
against them.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's, you know, you're seeing this mineral
analysis against biological analysis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like Sarah went to the bio nutrient food
conference convention last year and met up
[SPEAKER_04]: with Todd Harrington, another big soil
food web guy from the East coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they went and talked to John Kemp and
introduced themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in that next segment, John Kemp is
talking about how you don't need to
[SPEAKER_04]: measure soil organism populations,
you know, and it's just, Elaine kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: does this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love and adore Elaine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would not be here without her,
but she responds in kind with all you need
[SPEAKER_04]: is biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think where we're unique is that we
incorporate everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I come from a very quality group of
hydroponic cultivators in Southern
[SPEAKER_04]: California.
[SPEAKER_04]: I absolutely take that into my living soil
strategies.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, and so you cannot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just quickly, what are some of the things
you've adopted from the hydro community?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the mentality.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, growing up in Southern
California, like, like you couldn't,
[SPEAKER_04]: you couldn't be fake about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you had to actually do it or you had
to completely be quiet.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so in the organic sector, it's much
more important to be the guru,
[SPEAKER_04]: know the guru or regurgitate the guru and
actually be good at growing pot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's the biggest disabled aspect of
the organic sector is it's much cooler to
[SPEAKER_04]: be like, you can cut down three quarters
of your garden each year and you still be
[SPEAKER_04]: a guru.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that's insane to me from my
hydroponic background.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you had to be good or nobody even
listened to a word you said.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I've taken that mentality and tried
to be as regenerative as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, you know, just take a
holistic approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sarah comes from medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: My family's in medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was raised in a hospital with my single
mom.
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent a lot of time sitting in a nurse
management office, listening to patient
[SPEAKER_04]: information prior to the HIPAA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nonetheless, but you know, we take a
holistic approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: We take a science based mathematical
approach so that I can approach it without
[SPEAKER_04]: emotions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I can make a quantified decision that
leads to a result that's either
[SPEAKER_04]: predictable or unexpected, but at least
measured so that we can come to a result
[SPEAKER_04]: that can be repeated.
[SPEAKER_04]: So Elaine is biology only.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mineral people are mineral only.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do as full effort on every aspect
as we can.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we foliar feed like we're doing
hydroponics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holistic biology.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, so what happens is as there's a
disruption in one component of the system,
[SPEAKER_04]: so like in organics or living soil,
the soil minerality moves at such a slow
[SPEAKER_04]: pace that if you're correcting a mineral
imbalance, you might take two or three
[SPEAKER_04]: harvests to get that under control.
[SPEAKER_04]: You need to balance that with your soil
feeds or your foliar feeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's why all these water only people
either don't do water only or they fail
[SPEAKER_04]: saying water only is because the soil
moves so slow.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to, you have to correct to the
context of the situation with soil feeds
[SPEAKER_04]: or foliar feeds while using the biological
population as an indicator.
[SPEAKER_04]: The main anchor of what we do is making
sure that nothing we do reduces biological
[SPEAKER_04]: populations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's what makes Sarah and I
actually unique is that lots of people say
[SPEAKER_04]: biology.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody says soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: They all hashtag it, but like by what
measure are you doing any of these things?
[SPEAKER_04]: And we govern all decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Based on what my wife measures through the
microscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: If something I come up with that I think
is a good idea wipes out populations,
[SPEAKER_04]: it obviously was not a good idea from a
biological standpoint because we harmed
[SPEAKER_04]: the most sensitive biological members in
the system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it might still lead to a yield,
but if you're compromising soil organisms,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're also compromising plant health
because it is also a biological system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say just to kind of touch on
your religious little opening there is
[SPEAKER_01]: that the first law of chaos is that the
truth is different for everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the beauty of science is that
science can unify us on what we can all
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve if we adhere to certain
principles, whether you're KNF,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether you're soil food web, whether
you're hydro anything, there's certain
[SPEAKER_01]: principles that underlie by a lot of
biological systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's all we're trying to say is
just quantify it, know what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: and integrate that into your IPM strategy
as your number one thing you do is get
[SPEAKER_01]: that system in place that you know what
you're doing nutritionally to support that
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's something that's been going
wrong, a messenger being sent to you via a
[SPEAKER_01]: bug or a disease, then you start looking,
okay, where is the crack in the system?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are, you know, is it nutritionally
based?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we pretty sound there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need to do more analytics there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we, do we look at like Lydia was
saying, do we need to, we're seeing a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain pathogen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we need to look at our water system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we cleaning that enough?
[SPEAKER_01]: Just those kinds of sound principles,
but just to wrap that all in anyway.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only real issue that, you know,
Elaine and I, because I respect the shit
[SPEAKER_00]: out of her.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think she's brilliant woman,
but, and she came to me to speak to me
[SPEAKER_00]: about, remember we had talked about
driving those viruses out of those plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she was fascinated because that's
anaerobically driven using lactic acid and
[SPEAKER_00]: sub-irrigation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we came to was that what's the
definition of aerobic?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because really it's a certain parts per
million of oxygen present.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in this gray area of
interpretation, there was which method is
[SPEAKER_00]: it considered an anaerobic delivery or
aerobic delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where like my mom was a
scientist and she's brilliant,
[SPEAKER_00]: but she always made sure I remembered that
you used to be burned alive because the
[SPEAKER_00]: sun rotated around the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you didn't say that they're
crucified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was pretty current science at the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so she always kind of let me
understand that we only see snapshots and
[SPEAKER_00]: we know as much as we can right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to work with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it doesn't mean that we don't know,
but it means that's our limit of
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when you get into this
religious dogma, what happens is you start
[SPEAKER_00]: to take away a reason and you just follow
blindly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you need to be able to do is take
the education from the individual and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand how to apply it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if other people are having success
with contrary methods, you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: investigate and try to find out what is
the common success of all methods because
[SPEAKER_00]: something is occurring that's succeeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think that with what we're all
trying to do is understand there's an art
[SPEAKER_00]: and a science we're trying to merge and we
only know so much about either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where Dr. Ingham gets
jammed is because I don't think she could
[SPEAKER_00]: be any smarter at what she is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you spend some time with them
and she's brilliant and she's got such a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice rhythm with it, that she lives that
shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what she knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you run something that you
don't have the same understanding,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's doing something, it can't be
wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really trying to bring
everyone into the same area to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: hey, look, with all our understandings,
we maybe can get our arms around part of
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: But none of us are so comprehensive that
we control the information on a thing
[SPEAKER_00]: because the thing is so complex.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's always evolving.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what she always says.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what Scott ended up doing and why I
kind of appreciate what he's done.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, there was a guy that was one
of the advisors, Elaine has these
[SPEAKER_05]: advisors, and these are the people that go
and do all her work all the way through.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for the street explanation of things
is what I'm giving right now, not the
[SPEAKER_05]: scientific like you guys.
[SPEAKER_05]: But basically within her group of
advisors, they all perform her work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like the disciples, so to speak,
and Scott and Sarah, those have gone
[SPEAKER_05]: through that process.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was somebody before them,
a homie of mine named Ian Davidson.
[SPEAKER_05]: He started a company called Biologic Crop
Solutions that a lot of people use,
[SPEAKER_05]: but he ended up moving to Hawaii and
getting into some other stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Scott and Sarah, when I met Scott,
he was basically jumping on as an advisor
[SPEAKER_05]: and learning and doing and saying the
stuff where Ian stopped his work and moved
[SPEAKER_05]: into something else.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the examples is going from
brewing compost teas to doing these
[SPEAKER_05]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what Scott did in Sarah is they took
her information and geeked out on it and
[SPEAKER_05]: went deep.
[SPEAKER_05]: And deep into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a lot of people kind of fucked
with Scott sometimes going, do you grow
[SPEAKER_05]: and stuff?
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I'm smoking some of his weed
right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But he's been on big facilities,
doing big work.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I've been to those.
[SPEAKER_05]: And even Kevin, you've recommended
something to a farm to have me go check
[SPEAKER_05]: out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after I do my work, I recommend
Scott.
[SPEAKER_05]: And next thing you know, the place is
blowing up.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so at the end of the day, what's
happened and what Scott decided to do was
[SPEAKER_05]: create those events.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we did them with Elaine because Elaine
was kind of like, you know, something that
[SPEAKER_05]: really drove a lot of people to get in
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Scott's data that had been collected
in cannabis was the real eye opener.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I remember the first one we did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Elaine was at the edge of her seat,
like, holy shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: By the third one, I don't know if she
could handle the spotlight that Scott was
[SPEAKER_05]: taking anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: She kind of started deteriorating those
events.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we had Kevin jump on with us.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we had some good ones after that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then eventually, I'm no longer with
the situation that we were doing to create
[SPEAKER_05]: those.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so subsequently, a lot of that has
stopped.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the information was insane.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was coming out of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what I clinged on to was Elaine
seated.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Scott and Sarah sprouted.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was much easier for me to
understand because I've read her papers or
[SPEAKER_05]: looked at some of her shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't even speak that language.
[SPEAKER_04]: Scott's ability.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's what you said.
[SPEAKER_04]: I called you on the phone back in 2013
trying to get some compost tea brewing
[SPEAKER_04]: products.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got you on the phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was asking really specific questions
about Dr. Elaine and regards to my
[SPEAKER_04]: family's farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, look, kid, if this is
important to you, you got to find this Dr.
[SPEAKER_04]: Elaine woman and figure out what she's
talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you must have had a bowl or two
because you're like, look, man,
[SPEAKER_04]: all these cannabis people, they keep
saying something about the soil food web.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I don't know anybody that's measuring
it like this woman is saying it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you like growing pot and you think
you can swing a microscope, get down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I took that really seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think the market at why really
understands the level of analysis that we
[SPEAKER_04]: can and have provide and aggregated and
distilled down into really functional
[SPEAKER_04]: advice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just I think it's a symptom of
the market's not quite ready yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Still, you know, we, well, we were trying
to take that to big ag too.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I had already spent a shitload of
time spraying walnuts with with compost
[SPEAKER_05]: tea when, oh, we needed to get it into the
irrigation system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Spraying it was barely doing shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when you called me, you were like,
yo, we're going to set up this thing and
[SPEAKER_05]: spray these fields or hay or whatever
fields.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was like, no, no, you got to drench
that shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what we did.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so basically it kind of evolved from,
you know, like a lot of ball from there.
[SPEAKER_05]: But, you know, again, it was, you know,
the comprehension of these things and the
[SPEAKER_05]: way that was laid out to us, everybody
that I knew.
[SPEAKER_05]: And at that time was we only sprayed
compost tea.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you maybe put a little into the
soil, but it was a big spray thing at the
[SPEAKER_05]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, but what we did was we we did the
data points.
[SPEAKER_04]: So both Sarah and I are capable of doing
the full microscope process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we showed up to a farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's exactly what we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And to my knowledge, we're the first
people to really provide that to the
[SPEAKER_04]: market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we went crazy because both Sarah comes
from medicine where lives are on the line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you don't document properly
baselines, then, you know, a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: problems come from that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I had a construction business that had
a lot of liability working in schools.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we got into commercial cannabis
officially, you know, the first thing we
[SPEAKER_04]: did was establish all those baselines so
we could know where we're starting,
[SPEAKER_04]: so we can know where we're going.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we ended up finding was,
you know, one particular facility had like
[SPEAKER_04]: a perpetual harvest model.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we came in and took samples of each of
the populations that were on this two week
[SPEAKER_04]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we were able to drill down to a
decision that was made by the cultivator
[SPEAKER_04]: that turned things into the direction of
mold.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so as far as four years ago,
we were able to come into a facility and
[SPEAKER_04]: within 48 hours figure out the week that
led to all the problems and what that
[SPEAKER_04]: decision was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just don't think people are still
really ready to wrap their mind around
[SPEAKER_04]: that that's an analytical technique that
can be executed and what they can learn
[SPEAKER_04]: from it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, the people that have
figured out how to use it, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: back to square one of not saying anything
about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so people don't know that it exists
because the people that have used it most
[SPEAKER_04]: definitely don't champion it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the thing that Elaine deals with
them more than anything else is that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, she came in and didn't have any
papers published where, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: the papers didn't exist on any of this
material.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, like soil microbiology wasn't a
common discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly wasn't anything that was able to
be communicated to the point that you can
[SPEAKER_02]: have a conversation and eight or six hour
class in one day and give people more
[SPEAKER_02]: information than they had ever been
exposed to in their entire life,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've been cultivating or farming
for a real long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, and she also comes from this
point of I really like Elaine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think she's she's phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like everyone else has said,
but you know, she her position at least
[SPEAKER_02]: originally Was you know very defensive
against you know traditional ag,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, she has a lot of people That are
trying to argue with her.
[SPEAKER_02]: She has issues with you know, you know
grant money and you know who's funding the
[SPEAKER_02]: university that she was working for at the
time and how all that's like changed and
[SPEAKER_02]: modified in her life and how that's
impacted and driven her to you know author
[SPEAKER_02]: over a hundred papers and really You know
initiate the science in this realm in a
[SPEAKER_02]: whole new way and you know, just like I
said earlier about the gut microbiology
[SPEAKER_02]: This is something that we're gonna be
watching for you know decades to come all
[SPEAKER_02]: of the different tiny little intricacies
of how these microorganisms work together
[SPEAKER_02]: how they work with the minerals how it all
like works with ph and gets into the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: and How all that can be very finicky,
you know, especially with cannabis strain
[SPEAKER_02]: by strain or with different different
species of plants in general This is just
[SPEAKER_02]: something that's going to be developing
over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we all know, you know, what works
what works for some person You know one
[SPEAKER_02]: guy doesn't work for the next one,
you know five miles down the road and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a series of reasons why that's the
case and so you just have to tune into
[SPEAKER_02]: your own your own farm what your What
you've got going on what the benefits,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know what the drawbacks are of your
current situation and Research it to the
[SPEAKER_02]: best of your ability because that's the
other thing too is like we live in a
[SPEAKER_02]: culture where everybody just wants to look
at something on its Instagram instead of
[SPEAKER_02]: actually reading a paper and then in there
if they actually do go read papers They
[SPEAKER_02]: don't know how to determine whether or not
this paper is sound if it has you know If
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a large enough sample size if
there's any statistical relevance to
[SPEAKER_02]: what's being what's being spouted at the
end in a conclusion and You know taking
[SPEAKER_02]: those jumping off points, you know,
Elaine does really you know Spectacular
[SPEAKER_02]: science but taking the jumping off points
that she's providing and the stuff that
[SPEAKER_02]: Scott's giving and putting it into
practice in your own Facility to the best
[SPEAKER_02]: of your ability and coming out with
something that was better than what you
[SPEAKER_02]: had started with before You know,
and I think that we're seeing that You
[SPEAKER_02]: know the quality of the material just
increases day by day, which is great
[SPEAKER_01]: Context is everything needs to be
appropriate to your context what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: capable of You You You You You
