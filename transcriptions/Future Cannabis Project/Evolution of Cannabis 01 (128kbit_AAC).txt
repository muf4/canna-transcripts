[SPEAKER_01]: The evolution of cannabis is really
actually a really, really interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: subject because if you talk to a lot of
people today, the impression that one
[SPEAKER_01]: would get is that, oh my gosh,
we're in the golden age.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technology has dragged this plant up a
hill and it's never been better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's controversial,
actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we have lost some things
along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we're going to talk about
today is both a very, very bright future,
[SPEAKER_01]: an interesting future, but also I think
we're going to address some of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that maybe kind of got lost in the green
rush.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm going to kind of open up with
the panel with very, very short buyouts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to basically just kind of help
the audience get some sense of who you are
[SPEAKER_01]: and what you're into.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am Swami Chaitanya Vishwakarma
Brahmacharya Ganjananda.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you say that again rapidly,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I've been initiated in several branches
of yoga in India by various priests and
[SPEAKER_05]: temples and gurus up in the mountains and
so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: At the moment, you don't need to know
where I went to grammar school,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And at the moment I am a cannabis grower
up at Mendocino County where we grow the
[SPEAKER_05]: best cannabis in the world and we're quite
proud of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I have a 190-acre farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because of our legal restrictions,
I've been able to grow very few plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can't supply all of you just yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I'm hoping to get there someday.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm very happy to be on this panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think the idea of evolution of
cannabis is actually something we really
[SPEAKER_05]: need to pay attention to.
[SPEAKER_05]: So thanks for being here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm Josh Woerzer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the president of SC Labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're an analytical testing laboratory.
[SPEAKER_04]: And before I was a chemist, I loved
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: As soon as I first started smoking it,
then I had to start growing it and see how
[SPEAKER_04]: that worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so through college, from high school
through college, I was beginning in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry, got my degree in
chemistry, moved out to California,
[SPEAKER_04]: worked in the pharmaceutical industry,
electronic materials, doing research and
[SPEAKER_04]: development, and saw a job opening for a
laboratory director that at the time was
[SPEAKER_04]: the only lab in the state that would do
cannabis testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I took that job.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't realize that I could actually
marry my two loves.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from then on, I've been testing
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I worked there for about a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we started SC Labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been doing this now for over seven
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's been really cool to kind of see
the evolution of at least the testing
[SPEAKER_04]: industry for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as such, the lab's kind of the nexus
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: The producers come through.
[SPEAKER_04]: The dispensaries come through.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of patients come through.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's been a really cool window to
be able to kind of just watch the last
[SPEAKER_04]: seven or eight years of the industry
evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Al Frank.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've been writing about marijuana
since 1971.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've written three books, 1974,
1977, and 1988, on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've also been the editor and publisher
for Rob Clark's Hashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And currently, I consult.
[SPEAKER_00]: I still contribute botanical text and
photographs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most recently, the Cervantes Encyclopedia
of Cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over 100 photographs to that and also to
Ken Moro's Marijuana Horticulture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fundamentals, also botanical information
over 100 photographs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Jeff Raber.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm the CEO and founder of the Workshop
and Analytical Testing Laboratory.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got a bachelor's in biochemistry and a
PhD in synthetic organic chemistry from
[SPEAKER_02]: the University of Southern California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fight on for any Trojans out here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I certainly got an interesting
perspective in cannabis being in the
[SPEAKER_02]: testing lab, as Josh mentioned.
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of have a bird's eye view of the
entire industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we've been able to do with that
position is publish five peer-reviewed
[SPEAKER_02]: literature articles, most noted probably
on the chemotaxonomic profiling.
[SPEAKER_02]: How to look at terpenes and many of the
secondary metabolites of the plant to
[SPEAKER_02]: start a identification system that means
more towards patients and doctors and how
[SPEAKER_02]: we can communicate better about which
cannabis compositions we're using as
[SPEAKER_02]: opposed to just calling them an indica and
sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm very grateful to be here today and
appreciate the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to jump right in, this idea that the
evolution of the plant and our
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship with the plant, we
potentially may have lost a few things on
[SPEAKER_01]: the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we may want to look back a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that we've lost, but there are things
that we can learn from the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to have each of the panelists
kind of address what are the things from
[SPEAKER_01]: the past a little bit you're interested in
learning about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether you're a lab or a cultivator,
what kind of opportunities are on the
[SPEAKER_01]: horizon that could enable the past a
little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, in the case for me,
I'm really interested in heirloom
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested in the low-yielding,
ultra-interesting chemistries of some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the tropical varieties that really are
easy to spot by a helicopter, but don't
[SPEAKER_01]: yield much.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm not interested always in the
mythical seven-pound plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm interested in the one pound of crazy
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or I'm interested in that one gram of dry
sieve that really retains a terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profile that I currently cannot find in
conventional extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's where, looking to the past,
I think I can actually bring a better
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd like to have any of your ideas on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we were talking the other day,
and you said, is there any skunk left?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any true skunk?
[SPEAKER_05]: And so in a sense, it's like we don't
really know how to make stained glass for
[SPEAKER_05]: Gothic cathedrals anymore.
[SPEAKER_05]: So stuff gets lost.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with the skunk, well, does anybody
have skunk out there?
[SPEAKER_05]: We want some seeds because we want to grow
it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's something.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I just want to make a little
statement about what we lost in terms of
[SPEAKER_05]: our cannabis culture because of all this
regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the cannabis community could deliver
cannabis to every small town in this
[SPEAKER_05]: country for the last 40, 50 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: California's been doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've done that without brick and
mortar.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done that without advertising.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done that without bank accounts,
without cash.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've done that without any protection.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every police force is trying to stop us,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was no plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was an amazing way that we could
do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And no one quite knows how.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the cannabis community could deliver
all across the country a cannabis to just
[SPEAKER_05]: about anyone, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was done by a million random
decisions of a million different people
[SPEAKER_05]: that Johnny knew Susie back in Ohio and
Sam knew Linda back in Boston.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they'd send them a pound.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this went across.
[SPEAKER_05]: And whatever trillions of dollars have
been spent on it, they couldn't stop it,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's because the plant has this
innate character.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plant has this innate spirituality.
[SPEAKER_05]: That connects to everyone on a base level.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I want to talk about is that
community that we had that $1,000,
[SPEAKER_05]: $100,000 deals were done between people on
a handshake and a look in the eye.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it worked.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we were able to do this.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's something that I don't,
there's this community feeling that we
[SPEAKER_05]: were all together.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's another thing also just about
the fact that it was illegal.
[SPEAKER_05]: That we had an underground community that
actually came out of the anti-war
[SPEAKER_05]: movement.
[SPEAKER_05]: That came out of the civil rights
movement.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were all used to being in opposition as
activists.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were used to being underground.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just cannabis came along and chilled
us all out.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it was that underground community of
recognition that we're a secret group.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's almost like the Harry Potter thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're all the wizards in here.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we keep this knowledge amongst
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we pass it around.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it is a sacred knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's a sacred knowledge that's at
least 10,000 years old.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we want to keep that sacred
knowledge amongst us wizards.
[SPEAKER_05]: But now we're sharing with all the
muggles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's funny is that if you go back to
the 1940s, one of the popular slang terms
[SPEAKER_01]: for cannabis was muggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you go back to Mez Mezra,
the jazz musician.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Josh, what do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the past?
[SPEAKER_04]: I agree with everything Swami just said.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do, 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the same time, I'm glad people
aren't going to get locked in cages
[SPEAKER_04]: anymore for getting cannabis out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is sad to see the culture go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just inevitable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess everything changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I agree 100% with all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is kind of sad.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there used to be the secret place
where you go to any party.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you knew the people.
[SPEAKER_04]: You were like, hey, let's go stand over
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now everyone's showing up to that
circle.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a look in the eye, a little nod.
[SPEAKER_04]: But beyond that, and I'm going to rip on
the lab industry for a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's great that we're finally
getting quality control for the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it absolutely needs it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's such a safe plant that we're very
lucky that we haven't had anyone die or
[SPEAKER_04]: any instances of, for instance,
E.
[SPEAKER_04]: coli outbreaks in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: That would have really put a damper on
legalization.
[SPEAKER_04]: But nonetheless, cannabis does need
quality control, just like everything
[SPEAKER_04]: else.
[SPEAKER_04]: And who knows what's sprayed on your pot?
[SPEAKER_04]: Us doing the testing, there's a lot of
things sprayed on your pot is the answer.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think one of the real detriments the
testing industry has done to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: industry is no one wants to grow a plant
that tests under 20% now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've lost a lot of great strains,
a lot of interesting strains that have
[SPEAKER_04]: really unique terpene profiles,
really unique highs, because no one's
[SPEAKER_04]: growing those 14%, 12% strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one's growing the bubba kushes and the
grapey purples anymore because they all
[SPEAKER_04]: test too low.
[SPEAKER_04]: And hopefully that'll go away as prices
come down.
[SPEAKER_04]: As it said in the brochure, I think a big
part of it was getting the most bang for
[SPEAKER_04]: your buck.
[SPEAKER_04]: And maybe that's one of the good things
that's coming along with legalization is
[SPEAKER_04]: that prices will come down to where people
can afford it and people who want to pay
[SPEAKER_04]: more for really high quality cannabis can.
[SPEAKER_04]: But people who don't have the money and
just need to go and get some cannabis will
[SPEAKER_04]: have their options too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that the laboratory industry
really kind of did a disservice by just
[SPEAKER_04]: testing for THC content.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it got to be just a numbers game.
[SPEAKER_04]: It figures better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that terpene testing is available,
we're realizing that really THC content
[SPEAKER_04]: is, I guess, irrelevant as far as quality
goes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take an extra hit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I enjoy the process of smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather smoke twice as much as smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: Smoke a joint all the way down and get a
few hits in and have to put it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And have it taste good.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's just kind of a byproduct of what
we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so hopefully now people are going to
start realizing that what's interesting
[SPEAKER_04]: about one cannabis strain or another has
nothing to do with how much THC it has.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's all about what's the terpene
profile?
[SPEAKER_04]: How are those terpenes preserved in the
growing process?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who can grow and dry their cannabis in a
way that preserves those terpenes?
[SPEAKER_04]: And who can grow unique strains that have
unique profiles?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll riff on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great comment.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I'm really interested in
is this thing that I interviewed Rafael
[SPEAKER_01]: Moshulam, the guy who discovered THC and
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what he said was he was talking about
the stinginess of nature, where the plant
[SPEAKER_01]: basically only has a limited number of
chemical precursors from which to make
[SPEAKER_01]: these compounds of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you skew the plant towards
cannabinoids, which have no flavor or
[SPEAKER_01]: aroma, then you're sacrificing something.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember the great Hawaiian strains
like Kona Gold in the 70s that probably
[SPEAKER_01]: tested around 10, 12%.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it literally was one of those things
where you opened a bag and you could smell
[SPEAKER_01]: it a block away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smelled like a Christmas tree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that kind of terpene profile has
become rather scarce these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those Christmas tree, the ultra roadkill
skunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where in the case of skunk, you probably
have some kind of sulfur molecule
[SPEAKER_01]: sequestered in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a precursor to coenzyme A.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of the process of making
these chemicals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a little bit hangs out, and it really
reeks.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just one more thing, if I can do a
little bit of math this morning.
[SPEAKER_04]: We test for the Emerald Cup every year,
and we have since we opened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a really great kind of test bed
for A, the Northern California market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you get a lot of unique strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just 20 different flavors of OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: And last year we had 450, 500 flower
entries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you graph the winners, the top 25
samples, and the way they do the testing
[SPEAKER_04]: there, they do a great job of actually
testing each strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they get a really good panel of
experts to do the testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you graph the THC content of the
overall population of Emerald Cup samples
[SPEAKER_04]: versus the winners, versus the overall
population of samples we see in the lab.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: The mean is the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what that means is the amount of THC
has no outcome on whether a sample is
[SPEAKER_04]: judged or an entry is judged better than
another entry.
[SPEAKER_05]: The winner never has the highest THC at
the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since we've been testing, I'm one of the
judges at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: 18%.
[SPEAKER_05]: In fact, the highest THC that year was
number 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you graph the chirping content of
the winners versus the chirping content of
[SPEAKER_04]: the overall population, the chirping
content of the winners is one full
[SPEAKER_04]: standard deviation higher than the
chirping content.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you see all these bell curves line up,
all these distributions line up with each
[SPEAKER_04]: other with THC content.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you graph chirping content,
and the winners are way over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: The top 20, the top 20 served themselves
out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just rise to the top.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so obvious.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the judges in the Emerald Cup,
it's a phenomenal amount of agreement
[SPEAKER_05]: about what are the top 20.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's truly amazing, actually.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can talk to what it used to be
also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I actually had about 200 land races back
in the 70s and early 80s and lost them all
[SPEAKER_00]: in a fortunate legal thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I donated nine land races to the
University of Mississippi in 1977 to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them started because they had heard of
such potent marijuana out in California
[SPEAKER_00]: and they hadn't been testing any.
[SPEAKER_00]: But two things that came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is about the skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that time, I was being visited because
I had books out by growers from around the
[SPEAKER_00]: country.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of them, at that time you had
the Hippie Hash East Trail where hippies
[SPEAKER_00]: would go through Afghanistan and Nepal and
Lebanon and bring back seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't the political situation you have
now where that's very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we would trade seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the seeds that they were
using, especially in the East,
[SPEAKER_00]: were short season Afghanis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these Afghanis smelled like skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of them did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like a skunk.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem was is that all we had then,
we didn't have labs, we had smoke testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they didn't get you very stoned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we now know, looking back,
that that's because they had a lot of CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: in them also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, that small group of us
who were breeding at that time,
[SPEAKER_00]: we basically got rid of all the CBD
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's been so hard to bring
those back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was an unfortunate consequence of
the illegality and the lack of lab
[SPEAKER_00]: testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But speaking of the terpenes, when I
started to grow some of these popular
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties here, I actually thought that
the lack of fragrance was due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: consequence of old age.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was losing my sense of smell because
the smells were so weak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because Dave Watson was one of the
breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought skunk number one and haze to
Amsterdam, along with two varieties that I
[SPEAKER_00]: had, which was Afghani one and Durban
poison, along with one other one,
[SPEAKER_00]: Hindu Kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: He brought those to Amsterdam and
basically that started the entire seed
[SPEAKER_00]: industry out of Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, he had given me a South Indian
strain that was so sweet, when I walked
[SPEAKER_00]: into my greenhouse, I almost wanted to
bite it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it was that overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there were other strains also that
were just really incredible in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: fragrance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a cross between an Afghani and a
Durban that I've never smelled anything
[SPEAKER_00]: like it since.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these were things that you could
literally just walk into the greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, oh my god, this is overwhelming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of that has definitely been
lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, fortunately, the emphasis now is
totally on terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's all I base my breeding on
now is really the fragrance, the fragrance
[SPEAKER_00]: and the taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because once you get up into the teens,
really, it makes little difference whether
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a 20 or you're 15.
[SPEAKER_00]: One other thing about the potency back
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the reason why I gave these strains
to the University of Mississippi,
[SPEAKER_00]: the government, wasn't necessarily
altruistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to get an actual lab result,
which I did get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them tested almost 12%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, that doesn't sound high now,
but when you consider what my sampling
[SPEAKER_00]: was, what I was giving them were lower
buds that were fully seeded and not
[SPEAKER_00]: manicured.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure they tested in the high
teens, the sense of me I had at the top of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, I think this is kind of
mythical that there was nothing really
[SPEAKER_00]: strong back then.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let it go.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I think backwards, and I hear from
other people, they've definitely mentioned
[SPEAKER_02]: how we've lost a lot of varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the Acapulco Gold?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the Colombian Red?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are the things that made me feel
like they did back in the 60s and 70s?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think we've unfortunately had a bit
of unnatural selection.
[SPEAKER_02]: And trying to select against those types
of plants that would smell very
[SPEAKER_02]: effervescent and strong and alert the
neighbor or the authorities or someone
[SPEAKER_02]: else.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've definitely been selecting
against that for rapid highs and very
[SPEAKER_02]: different types of profiles than what we
might see otherwise.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you look at John McPartland's work
and what he's done across the entire
[SPEAKER_02]: history of saying where cannabis may have
evolved from, how it's been spread across
[SPEAKER_02]: the globe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we see today is very tight
genetic constrictions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that's the kind of
restriction inside of at least the western
[SPEAKER_02]: United States.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even over in the Netherlands, we can see
from their terpene profiling that they've
[SPEAKER_02]: got a lot of different varieties that we
don't have over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm hopeful that when looking back,
we can actually try and guide some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding today, like Mel was saying,
using advanced techniques and analytical
[SPEAKER_02]: approaches to say, let's create different
terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's create different cannabinoid
profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And let's maximize the diversity of what
we're seeing instead of restricting it
[SPEAKER_02]: like we have so far.
[SPEAKER_02]: Up to today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm kind of hopeful and looking
backwards, we may have temporarily only
[SPEAKER_02]: lost them.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a flexible plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we bred this way, maybe we can start
breeding backwards and capture a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm hoping that we can accelerate that
using advanced techniques in the
[SPEAKER_02]: laboratory.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks, Jeff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think this idea is really, really
fundamental is that a lot of people will
[SPEAKER_01]: walk into a dispensary that lists potency
and kind of mentally grade the board based
[SPEAKER_01]: on THC content.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the message that we'll try to
convey pretty consistently across the
[SPEAKER_01]: board today is that there really is a lot
more to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of us have embraced this idea of
terpene chemistry as being a fundamental
[SPEAKER_01]: part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guarantee you there's a lot more to
the chemistry than you might imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: A friend of mine, Matt Wall in England,
does functional magnetic resonance imaging
[SPEAKER_01]: of the human brain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he recently did a study of cannabis
users while they were on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he found something really,
really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last six years, neuroscientists
have discovered that our brain is a bunch
[SPEAKER_01]: of modules.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those modules work together in
networks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are three principal networks.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the executive control network.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's the default mode, which is
daydreaming, thinking about your past,
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's funny that it's called default
mode, because it's where we spend most of
[SPEAKER_01]: our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: What am I going to have for lunch today?
[SPEAKER_01]: What did I have for breakfast yesterday?
[SPEAKER_01]: When am I going to call my mom?
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's the salience network.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the salience network is really,
really important to cannabis users.
[SPEAKER_01]: Salient.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's important?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is salient?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what it does is it looks at all the
sensory inputs we have, and it assigns
[SPEAKER_01]: importance to them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you've ever gotten paranoid on
cannabis, you can see that THC can
[SPEAKER_01]: interfere with your salience network,
because suddenly you think that that thing
[SPEAKER_01]: at the door could be fill in the blank.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's really fascinating is that when
Matt was doing these studies, when people
[SPEAKER_01]: were on THC, cannabis alone, Jack Herrera,
they really had salience problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they could have paranoia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they could have dysphoric reactions
and all this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they were on THC and CBD
together, even a small amount of CBD,
[SPEAKER_01]: they still showed all of the kind of
psychoactive impairment associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they had no problems with their
salient network at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their ability to distinguish what was a
threat, what was important, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_01]: et cetera, in their environment didn't
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really important, because there's
evidence coming out of Australia,
[SPEAKER_01]: England, and the US right now that maybe a
tiny, tiny CBD buffer might be a really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really smart thing to have in your
cannabis diet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a reason that all of these
great hash countries around the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: when it's grown as a field crop,
you end up with a considerably higher
[SPEAKER_01]: titer of CBD in your resin than when
you're just singly selecting plants for
[SPEAKER_01]: potency, which have a tendency to skew the
population towards THC content.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm going to talk a little bit about
the future right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to ask you, what in the last couple
of years, as far as the evolution of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, have you been most excited
about?
[SPEAKER_01]: And what have you seen, either in your
garden, or your laboratory, or your life,
[SPEAKER_01]: that really has gotten you kind of excited
about where cannabis is going right now?
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to bring the CBD thing also,
because you said, Mel, that we kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: lost the CBD thing, and we did for a long
while, and then it became kind of the holy
[SPEAKER_05]: grail.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now we've got it back.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can say, some people are
reporting, what, 20% CBD and so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: But the research is showing that all the
different healing aspects of the cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: plant are a function of all the different
400 least elements, and we call that the
[SPEAKER_05]: entourage effect, the totality of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's why extractions don't really,
I mean, the synthesizing a singular
[SPEAKER_05]: molecule or something like that to say
this, it's not really working,
[SPEAKER_05]: because it's the whole plant that really
does it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we've got the CBD back.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've got CBD plants, and the people who
brought Harlequin from Switzerland,
[SPEAKER_05]: and he's a good friend of mine,
and so on.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now the genetics that's happening,
that's the future right now in the growing
[SPEAKER_05]: world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the genetics that are happening up in
Mendocino County, I use seeds that all
[SPEAKER_05]: come from my area with young, young guys
who are crossing this, and they've been
[SPEAKER_05]: doing it since they're 12 years old,
and they're master geneticists,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they're creating some wonderful new
strains with amazing terpene profiles as
[SPEAKER_05]: well.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the other part about future in farming
is that, particularly in the Emerald
[SPEAKER_05]: Triangle, Mendocino County, and so on,
there's a whole movement towards either
[SPEAKER_05]: biodynamic gardening, or probiotic
gardening, and things of nature where
[SPEAKER_05]: you're using only natural ingredients,
and also going more towards
[SPEAKER_05]: sustainability, so that having fewer and
fewer things come off your ranch to grow
[SPEAKER_05]: your plants, that you grow your plants
with plant material, that using compost
[SPEAKER_05]: teas, using Bokashi fermentation things,
and you're using ways to make the soil
[SPEAKER_05]: come alive, that the soil is actually
biologically and fungally alive,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's what grows your plants,
and that's what actually is the best way
[SPEAKER_05]: to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the most natural way that we recreate
the conditions that are in the forest and
[SPEAKER_05]: in nature, and not putting other attitudes
in.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's the way to get the best
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we're seeing too, I think,
along those same lines, is cannabis is
[SPEAKER_04]: going to be a really interesting kind of,
I guess, test bed, because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially until we get directives from
the EPA and whatnot, which pesticides can
[SPEAKER_04]: be used on cannabis, we can't use
pesticides on cannabis, so it's gonna be
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the only crops I know where you're
gonna have a total restriction on,
[SPEAKER_04]: or at least supposedly you're gonna have a
total restriction on pesticide use.
[SPEAKER_05]: Should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly, and it really should be too,
because we're not eating cannabis,
[SPEAKER_04]: we can't wash it off, so it'll be
interesting to see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think some of the things I'm excited
about too is, again, I'm sad to see the
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of, the culture kind of get faded
away maybe a little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is interesting for me to see some of
these people come in who actually can
[SPEAKER_04]: invest money in cannabis, and who can do
it safely and can invest money on creating
[SPEAKER_04]: new cannabis-based products, infused
products.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm old-fashioned, I like to smoke my
joints, but it's really cool to see some
[SPEAKER_04]: of the things we're doing with
concentrates, with infused products.
[SPEAKER_04]: For people with medical conditions,
we're making products that look more like
[SPEAKER_04]: medical products, that use this natural
plant-based medicine, but deliver it in a
[SPEAKER_04]: way that's efficacious for people with
different diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're starting to specialize those
products for people with specific
[SPEAKER_04]: ailments, and so that's been really cool
to see is just kind of, once we can
[SPEAKER_04]: actually safely put some research dollars
into cannabis, what's coming from that,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's been really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of the things that's really
compelling too is this idea that Kevin
[SPEAKER_01]: McKernan, who works for a company called
Cortigen on the East Coast, he's been
[SPEAKER_01]: sequencing the cannabis genome for a while
with other groups around the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States, but what he's also been doing is
sequencing the microbiome of the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: in other words, what grows on the plant,
what bacteria grow on the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's a signaling network.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've always said, oh, there's a soil web,
there's this and that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's hardcore science now that your
terpene expression on your plant is gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: be highly driven by the microbial life on
your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's interesting, because right now,
certain jurisdictions are rushing out
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, oh, total aerobic count is really
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it isn't, it isn't at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like saying, oh, total aerobic count
in your yogurt could kill you.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's pathogens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to be able to distinguish between
healthy bacteria and pathogens on our
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, and if we can't, we're not gonna
know what's safe and what's not safe,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the thing is is that when regulators
come in and try to regulate us,
[SPEAKER_01]: we really need to help them understand
what's important in the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: because I guarantee you, they are not
gonna figure it out themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're gonna have to spoon feed them like
a slightly slow four-year-old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, a couple of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with Swami in terms of
organic growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow organically in Los Angeles here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use two things.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use BT, which is Bacillus thuringiensis,
which is used to naturally kill bud worms,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're a plague here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second thing I use is I use
Tanglefoot, which I put on the,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a sticky substance, I put it on the
stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: That prevents crawlers from coming up,
and other than that, it's just me going
[SPEAKER_00]: out there looking at my plants and pulling
off anything that's got an infection,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's say, by some sort of bug,
and just to keep the population down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that there's always going to be
some sort of insect out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always gonna be grasshoppers or
something else that are eating it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'll just go out there and pick off
what I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way there I know that whatever I'm
smoking is absolutely clean of any
[SPEAKER_00]: pesticides or anything else, and I think
that's the way it should be grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It leads into this market of indoor
growing, where an awful lot of pesticides
[SPEAKER_00]: and fungicides and everything else are
used.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the main things that should be done
with the evolution of cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_00]: development of strains is the development
of resistance to things like buspritis for
[SPEAKER_00]: the outdoor growers and for powdery mildew
for the indoor growers, that sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we're finally going to be able to
grow vast fields of this and actually see
[SPEAKER_00]: what has a natural resistance to it,
these things are going to come about,
[SPEAKER_00]: because so far they haven't, and that's
due to the illegality and the inability to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow massive amounts of plants and find
those unique plants that have a natural
[SPEAKER_00]: resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I just want to mention one other
thing, and that is I've been able to
[SPEAKER_00]: witness something in that I know exactly
what the Afghani one looked like back in
[SPEAKER_00]: 1979.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came from Kabul, a land race,
and the Durban poison came from Durban,
[SPEAKER_00]: another land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: I recently acquired a couple of years ago
a couple of phenotypes of Durban poison,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is nothing like the Durban poison
that went from me over to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_00]: The one now is a much heavier producer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It still has the early flowering quality
to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have any of the smell that a
mine had, and most importantly and
[SPEAKER_00]: disheartening to me is that it doesn't
have the coloration and the stigmas that I
[SPEAKER_00]: saw in that variety, that strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: That strain had purple stigmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stigmas are the little white hairs that
most of you probably call pistils.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or lavender, lavender to purple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never seen it in any other strain,
and I was disheartened to see that it
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't in this strain anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other was Afghani one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Afghani one I got from my original source,
so it's about filial generation 37 now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that also, that had red stigmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: It had red stigmas and it had white
stigmas, and the three females that I grew
[SPEAKER_00]: this year all had white stigmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I asked her about red stigmas,
she said, gee, she couldn't remember
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So she lost that quite a long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: She also lost a lot of the flavor over the
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was pretty much a natural thing
because she wasn't a selective breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: She just picked out a few females and a
few males and just let them go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was interesting to see what happened
to those things, one from selective
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding by Dutch breeders and the other
by just rearing the pollination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So perhaps what I'm most interested in
seeing as we now enter legalization,
[SPEAKER_02]: also standardization should be the next
part of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that we're able to grow and
cultivate under license, we're not fearful
[SPEAKER_02]: of someone coming in and raiding the
plants or taking things away from us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can invest in infrastructure that will
allow us to produce in a much more
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent, reliable, and standardized
fashion so that every single harvest,
[SPEAKER_02]: every single crop has the exact same
cannabinoid and terpene profile as it did
[SPEAKER_02]: the first time that you did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can see consistently in the lab
currently that that is not the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is drifting around quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is exceptionally difficult next to
impossible to create medicine if it's not
[SPEAKER_02]: standardized under those types of
conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with capital coming in, we can invest
in the right infrastructure and put down
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse technologies, other types of
sophisticated farming technologies that
[SPEAKER_02]: exist in other industries, utilize those
tools to become very efficient effective
[SPEAKER_02]: at producing standardized, consistent
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be able to take that cultivated
product and marry it towards other types
[SPEAKER_02]: of technologies, such as pharmaceutical
technologies, delivery devices,
[SPEAKER_02]: other advanced processing methodologies,
and really create the next wave of
[SPEAKER_02]: products that will deliver much more
beneficial therapeutic effects at a
[SPEAKER_02]: consistent rate across a wide range of
ailments.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we've all seen that cannabis can
touch many different types of ailments,
[SPEAKER_02]: many different types of people can
benefit, but we never know which one we're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: We never know which composition is going
to help us and when.
[SPEAKER_02]: This age is where we're going to now start
to be able to see, I know exactly what I
[SPEAKER_02]: started with, I know how I handled it,
I know how I put it in my product form at
[SPEAKER_02]: the end, and now I can deliver and
consistently deliver that type of response
[SPEAKER_02]: for patients who are looking for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only does that benefit patients,
but it also benefits the adult users who
[SPEAKER_02]: may not want to feel sleepy at the
concert.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they are going to also want to pick
their specific product and product types,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I think we're just starting to see
this age come about, and to me that's some
[SPEAKER_02]: of the most interesting aspects in
addition to different cannabinoids showing
[SPEAKER_02]: up, different ratios of cannabinoids,
and different terpene profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be able to capture that and keep
them consistently.
[SPEAKER_02]: To me that's some of the most exciting
aspects of the future that we're all
[SPEAKER_02]: creating here.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point, and I think that the
other thing too is that there's this kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of one-size-fits-all where we're kind of
fooled ourselves into believing that every
[SPEAKER_01]: plant will grow the same way every place
you grow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the truth is that one thing that we've
noticed around the world is that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plants get very, very interesting when
they get acclimated to a particular
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we're seeing right now is that,
I would say, not to insult my friends up
[SPEAKER_01]: north, because the best cannabis is grown
in California right there, but what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing right now is we're seeing people
trying to grow tropical strains in the
[SPEAKER_01]: mountains of Trinity, or trying to get
basically strains that were developed for
[SPEAKER_01]: the Afghani mountains and grow them in
Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is, the plant will adjust,
but I think we have to really look at
[SPEAKER_01]: what's a local strain and let some of
these land races have a chance to
[SPEAKER_01]: reemerge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's going to be really,
really fascinating in California to see
[SPEAKER_01]: what happens in the Acadamian nut belt,
okay, where you could truly grow these
[SPEAKER_01]: late flowering thyme hazes and some of the
things that we haven't seen in a really
[SPEAKER_01]: long time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I talk to that too?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's the thing that you're talking
about is the standardization for medical
[SPEAKER_05]: purposes, and I applaud that 100%.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as we get now away from the strictly,
we had to talk about it's always medicine,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We know it's medicine, but now we're also
talking about the inspirational market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that inspirational market,
which will be approved by Prop 64,
[SPEAKER_05]: that is going to be where you have your
fine Cuban cigar, or you have your top
[SPEAKER_05]: shelf $80 bottle of wine, and those are
going to be artisanal grows that are going
[SPEAKER_05]: to be in nature, and they're going to have
variation, they're going to have
[SPEAKER_05]: fluctuation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And if you think about wine, for example,
the same vineyard has the same vines year
[SPEAKER_05]: after year in the same soil, but you don't
expect 1979 to be the same as 1980.
[SPEAKER_05]: You expect 1984 from any wine strain,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, if we're growing from seeds,
why would you expect our seeds to express
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves the same way they did last year
when the climate's different?
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, the seed's different,
even though we know the strain is trying,
[SPEAKER_05]: we're trying to breed true for the strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think that there's also going to be a
market for that really high end,
[SPEAKER_05]: totally unique, small batch artisanal
grown that is going to be, it's going to
[SPEAKER_05]: cost you, because it's going to cost that
farmer a lot of time and effort to make
[SPEAKER_05]: that, and I guess that's where we're
positioning ourselves to put first the
[SPEAKER_05]: purest medicine out there for people,
but also the most unique kind of spiritual
[SPEAKER_05]: inspirational hide, and that's where I
think there's going to be that high end
[SPEAKER_05]: market we'll be developing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's answers on both sides of this,
which is we need more standardization when
[SPEAKER_01]: we need standardization, but we also need
the artistic expression that comes with
[SPEAKER_01]: craft, and the thing is, is that
winemakers and beer makers have really
[SPEAKER_01]: taken the lead in this in a commercial
sense, and cannabis breeders and growers
[SPEAKER_01]: have done it in an underground sense for a
long time, and having them be able to step
[SPEAKER_01]: into the light, and I mean, I was talking
to Dave Watson a few weeks ago,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he was talking about, yeah,
I'm going to grow 70,000 haze seeds out,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm going to find 12 plants I really
like, all right, and I hear that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it just makes my heart.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what Luther Burbank used to do,
grow a whole field and take three out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, it's just, I mean,
like, having Dave Watson pick the best 12
[SPEAKER_01]: haze out of 70,000, that to me sounds
like, that's the world I want to live in,
so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a dream come true,
yeah, that's a sack come true.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about technology,
and what kind of technologies that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: right now, but also technologies that are
kind of emerging right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some really interesting things out
there right now that I think are kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: fascinating to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that vaporizers today will be
looked upon like tube radios are to
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody who's using a state of the art
laser projector, and that is, but at the
[SPEAKER_01]: same time, tubes have their place if you
ask any audiophile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's going to be this
interesting mix of kind of new and old
[SPEAKER_01]: technologies in service of this plant,
and I think there's some really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting technologies emerging,
and if anybody want to talk about some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the ones that they find intriguing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it'll be a very interesting marriage
of hardware and software, so much like
[SPEAKER_02]: you've seen your eye phone evolve,
you're going to see electronic cigarettes
[SPEAKER_02]: or other delivery devices evolve,
that hardware is definitely going to
[SPEAKER_02]: evolve, and we're going to make the
concentrates and the software that's kind
[SPEAKER_02]: of going inside of them evolve along with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're starting to see compositions that
are improved in people including terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: in different ways, so that's a vast
improvement from what we had seen before.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're seeing very different hardware
technologies, certainly a lot of people
[SPEAKER_02]: gearing up towards making exceptionally
new ones that have very different types of
[SPEAKER_02]: compositions in terms of internal
mechanisms of how they work, how fast they
[SPEAKER_02]: may turn on, what they deliver,
as opposed to when this first started a
[SPEAKER_02]: number of years ago, and I think we may
even see adaption of some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical delivery devices also being
utilized in this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that it is a pretty exciting
endeavor we're going to see, like you
[SPEAKER_02]: said, there's a lot of people that will
say, I still trust the old stuff,
[SPEAKER_02]: that was right for me, but we'll see a
very rapid evolution over the next two to
[SPEAKER_02]: three years, I believe, in seeing very
different types of hardware come out,
[SPEAKER_02]: and hopefully they'll be improved for both
composition and safety, we'll be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: study them to say they're delivering
consistently, because then I think you can
[SPEAKER_02]: really rely on that product being
delivering the exact response every single
[SPEAKER_02]: time that you want it, and we'll also see
other delivery technologies in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: patches, oral consumption, and a lot of
ways of varying what types of molecules
[SPEAKER_02]: are delivered to me and when.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an interesting time, because I
think what you're seeing is you're seeing
[SPEAKER_01]: companies like Psyche coming out of Israel
right now that says they can deliver a
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridge that delivers exactly the same
microgram dose of a cannabinoid-terpenoid
[SPEAKER_01]: entourage to the patient every time.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you ask them, well, how do you do
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a secret processing technique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's a lot of hype out there,
too, but I think what it is is that I
[SPEAKER_01]: still haven't found a vaporizer that can
actually top the taste of my technique
[SPEAKER_01]: with a pipe, and so I want to see that
happen in vaporizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to see somebody be able to deliver
a terpene entourage in a way that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: great, because right now, for me,
a lot of these turped-out concentrates in
[SPEAKER_01]: these E-pens, it's the difference between
crystal-like and real lemonade,
[SPEAKER_01]: okay, where it tastes like, oh,
yeah, yeah, that tastes about as much like
[SPEAKER_01]: grape juice as grape Kool-Aid does,
and what does it say?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: So anyway, love to hear your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, also, one thing about the vape pens,
let's not forget that they are landfill,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the whole sort of, you know,
some of them are better than others,
[SPEAKER_05]: but most of those vape pens out there,
you use them and you throw them away,
[SPEAKER_05]: and that's just one more thing in the
trash heap, so keep that in mind also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, there are other ways to vape,
of course, with the volcanoes and so on
[SPEAKER_05]: and so forth, but, you know, I'm such an
old hippie, I just like to smoke my
[SPEAKER_05]: joints, but the reason I like to smoke my
joints is actually I think that the joint
[SPEAKER_05]: is the only way you get everything,
and what I mean by that is when you start
[SPEAKER_05]: out your joint, it's at room temperature,
and it's already off-gassing volatile
[SPEAKER_05]: organic compounds, terpenes, and you're
taking those in, and you can dry hit and
[SPEAKER_05]: get a really delightful taste,
I recommend that, but now as you light it
[SPEAKER_05]: and that cinder moves through,
the stuff at the end of the joint at your
[SPEAKER_05]: mouth, that goes from room temperature on
a continuous scale all the way up to
[SPEAKER_05]: combustion, so as the cinder moves
through, you are actually getting
[SPEAKER_05]: everything that's in that cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you're vaping, you've got a very
limited temperature range, and THC
[SPEAKER_05]: volatizes at a different temperature than
CBD, and every other compound has a
[SPEAKER_05]: slightly different temperature at which it
vaporizes, so if you're smoking a vape,
[SPEAKER_05]: you're getting two or three, maybe a 10
degree range of thing, but if you're
[SPEAKER_05]: smoking a joint, you're getting the whole
thing, and that's why I smoke joints.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the way, see, that's what happens when
you go to the top of the mountain and
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke the joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bottom line is that kind of insight,
I guarantee you, you won't get that in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lab, but you need to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that kind of speaks to the
standardized experience versus unique
[SPEAKER_04]: experience situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a little something for
everyone that's coming in the future,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I think maybe a lot of these pens that
are more processed, or the terpenes are
[SPEAKER_04]: added back, there you go, you can have
your standardized experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can buy it, you know what you're gonna
get every time.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those people seeking a new experience
every time, a unique experience,
[SPEAKER_04]: chasing that perfect strain, that perfect
taste, then you go with the joint,
[SPEAKER_04]: or some of these extracts that are
minimally processed that also provide a
[SPEAKER_04]: unique experience, a unique flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the rosins.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah, the way that cannabis was
growing that season is gonna also come
[SPEAKER_04]: through in that extract.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think there's a little something
for everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think the infused products
absolutely need standardization.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think if there's one thing we can all
agree on, that if you're gonna eat an
[SPEAKER_04]: edible, you should know exactly how many
milligrams that edible is gonna contain
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's gonna hit you hard if you get
it wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what we see is that's where the
standard, actually we have growers that
[SPEAKER_04]: come through and test every batch with us,
and they're growing the same strain,
[SPEAKER_04]: and if it's off .5% one grow, they're
calling us up and asking us to retest it
[SPEAKER_04]: because they've got it that standardized.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even outdoor growers, or even the same
strain across a few different growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a couple percentage points of
variation where we see the widest swings
[SPEAKER_04]: are with edibles, and there's so many
edibles out there or infused products,
[SPEAKER_04]: but mostly the edibles, where there's
certain edible matrices that are almost
[SPEAKER_04]: impossible to get homogenous.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's, you know, where beef jerky,
if you're gonna infuse beef jerky,
[SPEAKER_04]: the jerky itself isn't even the same size.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think we can all agree that we
need to see standardization.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still have an issue with infused beef
jerky, but that's another thing
[SPEAKER_01]: altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do think, but I'm also kind of,
the libertarian side of me really wants to
[SPEAKER_01]: support the roulette class of edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you buy your ticket,
you take the ride, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: But seriously, I do think standardization
of the juice products is important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we call it becoming a cookie
casualty.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one more thing from Jim, and we're
gonna go to questions, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just following up on what Swami said,
the pens are fine for convenience.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're great for traveling, that sort of
thing, but my preferred method is smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: a joint, and not smoking a giant blunt
either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to smoke a regular old little joint
that I've been, you know, rolling all my
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I've always thought is that when
you're smoking like a blunt with an
[SPEAKER_00]: enormous amount of grass in it,
and you're drumming in on that and
[SPEAKER_00]: creating this huge amount of smoke,
you're really burning this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not vaporizing it at all,
because I've always thought that as you
[SPEAKER_00]: draw on the joint, what you're really
getting is what's heated before that red
[SPEAKER_00]: hot coal ember is burning this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's really that heating process of you
slowly drawing on the joint that gives you
[SPEAKER_00]: everything that's really there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you all those dirt beans that are
boiling off at a much lower temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: than THC and so forth down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why I smoke like that,
and that's because I think that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: you get the most flavor and absolutely the
most effect of what is in that plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And how you roll the joint is key,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I've seen him roll a joint with one
hand on the back of a speeding Ducati
[SPEAKER_01]: motorcycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the thing is, I've watched people
like Kyle Cushman watch somebody
[SPEAKER_01]: incinerate his creation with like taking
the lighter and going, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's one of these things where you
just want to heat.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to just kind of liberate this
kind of incredible entourage from the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I couldn't agree more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if there's one big takeaway today
and insight, it's really take care of your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in how you're consuming it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is the evolution of this.
