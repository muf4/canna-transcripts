[SPEAKER_00]: I have become a little bit more
politically active and interested and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: had a chance to talk to state regulators
and other lawmakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So former lawmakers had come across my
path, they were interested in what labs
[SPEAKER_00]: were doing, saw that this could be a place
where they might be able to help current
[SPEAKER_00]: lawmakers craft laws and regulations and
understanding local state level politics
[SPEAKER_00]: is what they were an expert at and they
were the ones that kind of first got me
[SPEAKER_00]: out there and saying you need to talk to a
state regulator, you need to go talk to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Department of Consumer Protection in
Connecticut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their legislature just said they need to
define pharmaceutical grade medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and no one knows what that would
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So definition is certainly an
exceptionally important part of the law
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's really an exceptionally important
part of all the conversations we have and
[SPEAKER_00]: why many arguments really happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly the same in legal context.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I hear that someone has to be
tasked with pharmaceutical grade,
[SPEAKER_00]: what does pharmaceutical grade represent?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well it really goes towards label
integrity and accuracy and how you go
[SPEAKER_00]: about building up that label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's testing and I think a lot of
people think well testing is to see what's
[SPEAKER_00]: there but really testing is to build an
accurate label into understanding all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the pieces and content that goes into that
label being a representation of what the
[SPEAKER_00]: product is and assurance that it's clean
and the same quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my first goal was talk to different
state regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were some that were asking me to
explain how testing is done, where in the
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain it should be done and some of
them were very astute, very good
[SPEAKER_00]: questions, very informed already about I
can't set a limit to zero because
[SPEAKER_00]: analytical equipment is so sensitive it
will find something at part per trillion
[SPEAKER_00]: level and then it's not zero.
[SPEAKER_00]: That showed that they were definitely very
interested in understanding the details.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were learning the types of questions
to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when someone that has real world
experience and has been doing it in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: unregulated system, we've seen all the
different types of products that
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone's tried to shove cannabis into we
have an appreciation for what types of
[SPEAKER_00]: things the regulators should look to
control, where they can allow things,
[SPEAKER_00]: how labels should be built up and most of
the time it's been questions along the
[SPEAKER_00]: lines of where do I test?
[SPEAKER_00]: What am I testing for?
[SPEAKER_00]: What should be required on the label?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often should you test?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is sampling accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: How is this testing accurate?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how do I protect public health and
safety?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a consumer protection standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another good example was in the state of
Illinois.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had friends that were there that were
interested in working with the lab said I
[SPEAKER_00]: can get into the regulators and talk to
the Department of Agriculture is where
[SPEAKER_00]: that one was at and they've created a
Bureau of Medicinal Plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't have been more excited to hear
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that was very forward-looking,
beautiful type of approach.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were very interesting as a group.
[SPEAKER_00]: They lined eight different people up in
the room and said can you talk to us for
[SPEAKER_00]: about an hour, hour and a half and just
tell us what you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me a presentation about cannabis from
a scientific perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're interested in testing and we just
have a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the end of that they were like
thankfully you were here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had gone to Colorado and thought the
whole world was THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: We thought that's all that there is in
this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've really opened our eyes and
understanding of there's a lot of other
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds of interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of other non-psychoactive
uses of this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we were to regulate this in the wrong
way we won't allow it to reach all of its
[SPEAKER_00]: full medicinal potential and that
understanding and education was very
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial in how we can craft our
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where a testing lab should sit,
what its function should be and throughout
[SPEAKER_00]: their process of developing the
regulations lots of emails and other calls
[SPEAKER_00]: were back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do that as a free service.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a community service that has to
go out there to give the right information
[SPEAKER_00]: to the right people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically it's been either there's an
event where the regulators ask people to
[SPEAKER_00]: show up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll ask for labs to come around.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of Washington's liquor control
board did that while they were crafting
[SPEAKER_00]: the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get anyone who's a lab and tell me
if there's someone that we're missing who
[SPEAKER_00]: should be here around the table to talk
about how do we establish limits,
[SPEAKER_00]: what types of quantities are required for
testing and how do we go about setting
[SPEAKER_00]: these regulations up the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you quickly learn though is
regulations can only be written if the law
[SPEAKER_00]: was written in the right fashion and
there's always a little bit of a rub of
[SPEAKER_00]: what is in the law cannot be changed very
easily.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very difficult and time-consuming to
change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulations are a little bit more fluidic
and dynamic and you can change those on a
[SPEAKER_00]: quicker basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little easier to go back and change
some of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawmakers need to set up a really good
broad-based framework and then regulators
[SPEAKER_00]: can tighten that up and can control that
and make sure it's going the direction
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody wants in the best interest of
society with the best interest of the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer protection in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lawmakers that say well wait a minute I'm
going to try and write half of the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations into the laws if they miss
something or get it wrong you end up with
[SPEAKER_00]: this horrifying scenario that's like why
did you make it in this fashion?
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I can't change that until I get
another legislative session.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone's got to approve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can go through all these committees
until it has to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: This part should not be included inside of
the actual law.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should say regulator go do something
like this and the regulator can define
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly what that should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting to see different
states take different approaches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different lawmakers have different
interests in terms of how much control
[SPEAKER_00]: they might want to exert over the
regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a very complex picture and it's
different in each and every state.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're benefiting from now is that we
see all these different states look at
[SPEAKER_00]: each other figure out which ones have
learned which lessons and as new ones come
[SPEAKER_00]: online you can see them kind of
formalizing, sophisticated themselves and
[SPEAKER_00]: benefiting from the experience of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also understanding hey I can go
talk to these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people in the community
willing to try and get these things done
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like ourselves have been screaming
for regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell us exactly what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have us help you tell us what should be
done and we'll just go do that so that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're sure it's being done the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know exactly where the rules are and
where the lanes are and we can stay inside
[SPEAKER_00]: of those too.
[SPEAKER_00]: To do that though is really a whole
community effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to help them understand the
principles they need to know they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: ask the right questions from that and then
they can craft regulations and be willing
[SPEAKER_00]: to know they might need to change those
over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we are seeing Colorado and Washington
and other states change them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Currently California is talking about
changing laws so that they can appoint a
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory body and then have the
regulators actually go out and write the
[SPEAKER_00]: right rules so that everyone can follow
them the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: The new laws being proposed in California
are definitely in a positive direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: They probably are a little overreaching in
that they shouldn't have all of that in
[SPEAKER_00]: the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that should be left to the
regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It might make it very difficult to change
later down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean let's look at past history right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's taken about 19 years to get here
since they said they were supposed to do
[SPEAKER_00]: these types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when it's wrong or we found a
flaw inside of that in the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long will it take us to get the
legislative body to change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'd be better if they took a little bit
of a step back and said let's make
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations along these lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then the regulator can change in a much
more fluidic fashion as opposed to
[SPEAKER_00]: lawmakers saying I make all the grand
rules of the land.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little bit of an ego thing in my
opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of entertaining to watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like the laws are sort of like
the broad picture and the regulations are
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of the fine tuning and nuts and bolts
of the interpretation.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could say like the laws are we're
going to play a soccer game and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators are here's all the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the timing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the size of the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the number of players that you've
got.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here's the you know all the things
we're not going to allow to use your hands
[SPEAKER_00]: unless you're this one guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be what the regulator does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're like well we need ten
people out there plus one guy with hands
[SPEAKER_00]: because the field's so big.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if the lawmaker said we're going to
play soccer with five people per side and
[SPEAKER_00]: the field is going to be this large.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't work that well and it would
take a while to go back and change it.
So it's
a little bit of an ego thing.
