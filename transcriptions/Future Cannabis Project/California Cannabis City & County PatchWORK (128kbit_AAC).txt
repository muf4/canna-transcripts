[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so this is the city and county
patchwork.
[SPEAKER_05]: As was said on the online little summary,
the state has figured it out, sort of.
[SPEAKER_05]: We just need the local governments to do
their jobs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'll do a quick intro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll let all the panelists kind of intro
themselves a little bit more.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do have one question after you do your
intro, just to let the people kind of know
[SPEAKER_05]: what you do on the day to day.
[SPEAKER_05]: And actually, my name is Isa Perez.
[SPEAKER_05]: I work at Meadow.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a point of sale company.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we build software for dispensaries and
delivery services.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we work with California retailers
across the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: So local government, local regulation is
very, very near and dear to my heart and
[SPEAKER_05]: brain and soul.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm here today also representing
Supernova Women, an organization that is
[SPEAKER_05]: empowering women of color.
[SPEAKER_05]: Color in the industry and also advocating
for social justice and equity in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So our first panelist, we have Arianna Van
Alstine.
[SPEAKER_05]: And she is an attorney with a lot of
expertise with the regulations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Arianna, just give people a little
brief summary of what you do day to day to
[SPEAKER_05]: do this patchwork on the local level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Day to day, I do licensing and compliance
for cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: All over the state of California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly working on local licenses and
preparation for state licenses and then
[SPEAKER_03]: navigating through the regulations as they
change day to day and week to week.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Arianna.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next we have Jackie McGowan.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've probably heard her already.
[SPEAKER_05]: Giving some of the Q&A portions of the
other panels.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's director of licensing and business
development at K Street Consulting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Jackie, tell us a little bit about how
you do patchwork day to day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, hi.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Jackie McGowan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I work for K Street Consulting.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a local licensing consultant.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my background is I am a former Wall
Street stockbroker.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I got into this space,
I realized that there wasn't a centralized
[SPEAKER_04]: location for anyone to go to to get late
breaking news of everything that was going
[SPEAKER_04]: on throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I decided to use my Wall Street
background and create my own news feed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I set up 540 Google email alerts,
one for every city in the county.
[SPEAKER_04]: One for every city and county in the
state.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I decided to dump all of that
data into a Facebook group that I first
[SPEAKER_04]: named California City and County Ban
Watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because at the time, this was early 2016,
when we dubbed Banapalooza as what was
[SPEAKER_04]: going on in the industry at the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've since changed the name to City and
County Regulation Watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have 7,000 members that are all
California residents.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was really important to me to make
sure that the conversation being had was
[SPEAKER_04]: about people that were being affected by
these problems so that we could come up
[SPEAKER_04]: with solutions together as California
residents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have about 14 moderators that keep
that page frequently being updated with
[SPEAKER_04]: late breaking news on and we have probably
about 1,300 individual posts that come
[SPEAKER_04]: through the group each month.
[SPEAKER_04]: And our moderators are making sure that
everybody is being respectful in that
[SPEAKER_04]: content.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're not a member of the group,
I highly encourage you to join.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do run that, but I also work at the
local level in several jurisdictions and
[SPEAKER_04]: have helped cannabis businesses get their
local permits.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Jackie.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes, definitely join the Facebook group.
[SPEAKER_05]: Never a dull moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Next, we have a really exciting mayor of
West Hollywood, John Duran.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give him a round of applause.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is his fifth term.
[SPEAKER_05]: 18 years on the council now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So mayor, tell us a little bit about your
day-to-day patchwork over in West
[SPEAKER_05]: Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greetings from the people of the city of
West Hollywood, where the women are
[SPEAKER_00]: strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the men are pretty.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're very, very proud of that
distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had cannabis on the Sunset Strip
for about 100 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: 100 cannabis has been part of the Sunset
Strip and the nightlife in the city of
[SPEAKER_00]: West Hollywood for a century.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're very proud and happy of
introducing the first ordinance to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually get into the regulation of
cannabis in our city.
[SPEAKER_00]: My mayorship as a local elected official,
like most local electeds, it's a part-time
[SPEAKER_00]: gig.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a real job in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a criminal defense lawyer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I do in the daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my practice, I've been in practice for
30 years, has been representing a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of lawbreakers.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, ACT UP and Queer Nation when they
were blocking government buildings to
[SPEAKER_00]: demand drugs and treatment for HIV and
AIDS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I was the attorney for Clean Needles
Now, which was the very first needle
[SPEAKER_00]: exchange in Southern California giving
clean needles to junkies who we were
[SPEAKER_00]: afraid were going to contract HIV,
passing around dirty needles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I became legal counsel for the
Los Angeles Cannabis Resource Center in
[SPEAKER_00]: the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the very first medicinal marijuana
organized facility on the corner of
[SPEAKER_00]: Fountain and Fairfax in the city of West
Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been doing this a long time,
first as a criminal defense lawyer and now
[SPEAKER_00]: as the man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So really happy to be here with all of
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mayor.
[SPEAKER_05]: And last but not least, we have Charles
Harvey, legislative representative for the
[SPEAKER_05]: League of Cities.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's only his third month in his position.
[SPEAKER_05]: So bravo to you being here, Charles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Issa.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's kind of hard to follow Mayor Duran in
any event.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good afternoon, everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Charles Harvey with the League of
California Cities.
[SPEAKER_07]: I am the public safety lobbyist for the
League.
[SPEAKER_07]: My capacity and my portfolio extends from
not just cannabis, but also working issues
[SPEAKER_07]: relative to police use of force.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going on about three hours of sleep.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a one month old and a 22 month old.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I'm keeping very, very busy at
home.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I'm very excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I told everyone on a planning call earlier
in the week or last week that,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, my goal here today really is to
sort of, you know, be a sponge and listen
[SPEAKER_07]: directly to, I guess, what concerns
everyone has, industry participants,
[SPEAKER_07]: other folks, and really sort of,
you know, develop my own sense of where
[SPEAKER_07]: the League of California Cities can sort
of can help to help to solve problems,
[SPEAKER_07]: help to, you know, find solutions that
work for everyone.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as previous panelists have talked
about, generally speaking, there isn't
[SPEAKER_07]: anything that necessarily comes easy on
this issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a very hot button issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: People get very, very passionate.
[SPEAKER_07]: I understand that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so again, I'm excited to be here today
and looking forward to a robust
[SPEAKER_07]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just before we get into the more specific
questions, this is about local government.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is about, you know, city to city.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is local government?
[SPEAKER_05]: What does that mean to you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who really holds the power in local
government?
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you can talk a little bit about who
actually has the control and where it
[SPEAKER_05]: comes from, those might be two different
answers to the audience and maybe one you
[SPEAKER_05]: have in your head, feel free to share
both.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyone can go first.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it depends on the jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been on the ground in several
different areas where the sheriff,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, is the one making the decisions
and calling it his county.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in the opposite situation where
the sheriff has said, I answer to the
[SPEAKER_04]: Board of Supervisors.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in situations where it's clear
that it's the city manager that is pulling
[SPEAKER_04]: the strings.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, you know, really, you follow the
money.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whoever is supporting the people that are
making the decisions, that's really who's
[SPEAKER_04]: pulling the strings.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to agree with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's exactly right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a proponent of forming a West
Hollywood Police Department on the ballot
[SPEAKER_00]: in 1991.
[SPEAKER_00]: We lost, but we lost 51% to 49%.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just lost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when that happened, the Los Angeles
County Sheriff called me in and said,
[SPEAKER_00]: what do we need to do to improve?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a $14 million contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we gave him a list.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things on the list was that
the city of West Hollywood in 2003
[SPEAKER_00]: declared marijuana enforcement to be the
lowest level priority for the city of West
[SPEAKER_00]: Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sheriff said, well, you know,
I'm going to publicly oppose you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, I don't care what you do publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just don't want you arresting people for
smoking a joint on the Sunset Strip.
[SPEAKER_00]: So can we work together here?
[SPEAKER_00]: You say whatever you need to say for your
election, but we're not going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't want any of the 14 million going
into marijuana enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to enforce drug laws,
go after crystal meth.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a nasty drug that destroys people
in their lives, but leave marijuana alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been the state of affairs since
then.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I, I agree the city manager,
he is the CEO of our city.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most small cities have a city manager who
runs the government, but it's the power of
[SPEAKER_00]: three.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, the three sisters on
the TV show Charmed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got the power of three.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm always trying to find two other
votes.
[SPEAKER_00]: To make a significant policy change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately, I'm in a city that leans
so far left.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't even know rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm the conservative on the council and
I'm the guy doing cannabis reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how far left we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a, it's an exception to the rule.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little like solid blue dot in the
middle of Los Angeles County, but we get,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we are so solidly left,
we get to do a lot of progressive stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why we, we passed our
ordinance last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got to move to WeHo.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I, I'm going to disagree just slightly
with both of you because I think local
[SPEAKER_03]: government is, is one of the rare
opportunities where it is about every
[SPEAKER_03]: citizen.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's much more of an opportunity to
have your voice heard at the local
[SPEAKER_03]: government level than there might be at
state government.
[SPEAKER_03]: And often it really only takes a few
voices to go and talk to your city council
[SPEAKER_03]: members, talk to your city managers,
talk to, talk to the folks at the police
[SPEAKER_03]: department and resolve the issues as
before they get started, ideally.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that is the unique part of local
government that I think is extremely
[SPEAKER_03]: important for, for everybody in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: She, she stole my answer.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a cop out.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't do that one.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned obviously the citizens.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of, a lot of California right now,
like we heard on the other panels have
[SPEAKER_05]: bans everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: 80 to 90% of California has a ban on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So given sort of the differences in who
holds the power, is it the sheriff?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it the city, you know, is it the mayor?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it the people?
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the biggest hurdle in finding out
how to infiltrate these cities and these
[SPEAKER_05]: localities that have bans and get to the
people who hold power when it differs from
[SPEAKER_05]: city to city?
[SPEAKER_05]: How, how do we effectively in your own
jurisdiction know, oh, I am the one that
[SPEAKER_05]: holds the power or no, I got to go to my
sheriff because he or she holds the power.
[SPEAKER_07]: For starters, and I'm curious to,
to kind of get the actual statistics on,
[SPEAKER_07]: on what you're reporting as far as the
number of jurisdictions that have,
[SPEAKER_07]: that have ordinances prohibiting,
you know, prohibiting any form of
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe, maybe canner eggs over there can
help out with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you know, I think part of it starts
with, with education.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's been mentioned before,
but at least with respect to cities,
[SPEAKER_07]: I can't speak for, for counties
necessarily.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, but with cities, you know,
there are, there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: opportunities as, as mentioned with
respect to going to council meetings and
[SPEAKER_07]: whatnot to try and just directly engage an
office, a city council member office or
[SPEAKER_07]: whomever as far as, you know, why,
why you may think that or why you know
[SPEAKER_07]: that cannabis is good for, for,
for someone's jurisdiction or,
[SPEAKER_07]: or why you believe the constituents of
that jurisdiction, you know, want
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where, you know, when, when a council
member or some other elected official,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, might, might see otherwise or
has, or has already put, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: some sort of prohibition in place.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think, you know, it starts with,
it starts with council meetings first and
[SPEAKER_07]: foremost with respect to cities.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, but beyond that, I mean, you know,
whether, whether it's a social media push,
[SPEAKER_07]: whether there's, whether there are,
I mean, I know we have a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: opportunities at the league to,
to have organizations come out and,
[SPEAKER_07]: and educate our members directly and,
and interface with them directly in terms
[SPEAKER_07]: of, you know, offering their services and,
and what it, what, what it is that they
[SPEAKER_07]: believe, you know, should take place at,
at our internal board meetings and
[SPEAKER_07]: whatnot.
[SPEAKER_07]: We, there are different opportunities to
do that, but by and large, I think,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, it needs to start with,
with the council meetings and with the,
[SPEAKER_07]: with the staff at the city level as far as
trying to, you know, trying to just get,
[SPEAKER_07]: get the word out or, or make your point
known from where you stand.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, perhaps this gentleman to
my right can, can give some more poignant
[SPEAKER_07]: examples, but, but I think that's where it
starts.
[SPEAKER_07]: It has to start with communication and you
want to, you want to try to work with
[SPEAKER_07]: cities.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a lot easier to work with us than,
than to, than to fight us.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm learning that every day that I work at
the league, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can just add to that, I'd say first
of all, abandon logic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because logic doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But push common sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a distinction between logic
and common sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 32 states in the United States
now that have some form of regulation of
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: The polling on medicinal marijuana
nationwide is over 90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over 90%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that debate is over.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I think for a lot of electeds who
are worried about their next election
[SPEAKER_00]: usually, if, if going in on the discussion
on medicinal, there's not a person on a
[SPEAKER_00]: council who doesn't have a relative or
somebody who has suffered from some form
[SPEAKER_00]: of cancer or some form of epilepsy or HIV
or all these other debilitating illnesses
[SPEAKER_00]: that the medicine's in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no more debate around that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and getting in there to find out what
the real objections are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the real objections are driving
under the influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't let people smoke and drive,
just like you don't let people drink and
[SPEAKER_00]: drive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's use some common sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's said in politics that rather than
a spectrum of left to right, it's actually
[SPEAKER_00]: a circle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and the left and the right on this
issue I think meet on the policy
[SPEAKER_00]: perception of libertarianism.
[SPEAKER_00]: California has a very strong
libertarianism.
[SPEAKER_00]: A very libertarian bent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay out of my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leave me alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: People on the left or the right seek
privacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want anyone else intruding into my
private decision making.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really strong political argument
for both the left and the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's a common sense
way to get to a lot of these issues from
[SPEAKER_00]: either perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just, I think, takes one heroic
council member.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have friends on the Santa Ana council.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're, they're kind of going through it
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and there are, there are suburban
communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not going to, you know what,
it's just not going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not going to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more business that comes to West
Hollywood, I'm fine with it, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at some point, they're going to wake
up and they're going to say, what's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening in West Hollywood?
[SPEAKER_00]: They got a hundred million dollar reserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, no kidding, because we're
doing common sense policy over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get off your point of view and
get to common sense, you'd see that this
[SPEAKER_00]: is really not what you fear it to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just want to say that the 80 to 90%
statistic that was dropped earlier by Max
[SPEAKER_04]: was a statistic from 2016.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was after the League of Cities
was on a road show, encouraging local
[SPEAKER_04]: jurisdictions to ban, since they felt like
there was a gun under their head,
[SPEAKER_04]: at their head, mandating them to regulate
by March 1st.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was an erroneous deadline and a bill
was then introduced to rectify that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we are at right now, about 35% of the
state that either has regulations on the
[SPEAKER_04]: books or is moving towards creating
sensible regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will just give an example of how
long this process takes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been in Yolo County for three years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And day one of me being on the ground and
attending a Board of Supervisors meeting,
[SPEAKER_04]: I went right up to the opposition,
which was a group of mothers who right
[SPEAKER_04]: away, I could tell that they didn't really
care about marijuana in general.
[SPEAKER_04]: They did believe that it was medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there was guys with guns and dogs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they were living next door to them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they couldn't have their Girl Scout
meetings.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was, solve this problem for me,
and I will go away.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did something that I wouldn't
recommend anyone else do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I went and knocked on that grower's
door and told him that the laws were about
[SPEAKER_04]: to change.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were passing an ordinance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he was going to have to move.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did suffer some consequences for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I did have a friend that was beat with
a baseball bat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was retaliation for that action.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't recommend that anybody does
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, I never had those mothers come
back to another meeting.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have moved forward in that
jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are awaiting the results of an EIR.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we spent, as a community, the cannabis
community spent about $75,000 on various
[SPEAKER_04]: tax measures and supporting local elected
officials that were pro-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we still don't have an ordinance.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are awaiting the EIR.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, in early 2019, we will have a
permanent ordinance in place.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's been three long years of a lot
of work.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I always, and the strategy does not
always work, but I always make a beeline
[SPEAKER_04]: up to the opposition immediately.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to have a conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know what their concerns are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to know if I can fix them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if there is a reasonable solution to
their concerns, or if they are evangelists
[SPEAKER_04]: and this is something that is a religious
thing, then that's a whole other thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually really want to see a religious
debate on this issue, but it's a whole
[SPEAKER_04]: other topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see Bibles come out,
and I want them to decide once and for
[SPEAKER_04]: all, is Jesus pro-cannabis or not?
[SPEAKER_04]: I really want to see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because there are jurisdictions that
that's what the issue is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I haven't always been successful in
that strategy, but more often than not,
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been able to address concerns and
seem like the reasonable one while
[SPEAKER_04]: addressing them with the council members
or the supervisors, whatever the
[SPEAKER_04]: jurisdiction is that I'm in.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think, Jackie, you make a great point
about that, about going to the opposition
[SPEAKER_03]: and finding out what the opposition looks
like and what their real concerns are.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because often the initial concern
presented is public safety.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that can mean a hundred different
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And addressing that and being willing to
listen to what those concerns are is a
[SPEAKER_03]: helpful way to get regulations to
progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to that, I think that going
into a jurisdiction that has a ban on
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial cannabis activity, it's often a
negative or negative or neutral.
[SPEAKER_03]: So looking at a group of advocates who
want to create a regulated cannabis market
[SPEAKER_03]: in a particular city or county.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on the flip side is a negative of
concerns about public safety or the
[SPEAKER_03]: children.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there aren't necessarily points made
on the other side.
[SPEAKER_03]: So going in and saying not just it's a
neutral or a negative, because that makes
[SPEAKER_03]: it very easy to vote down a regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the flip side, looking at this is
how much money is going to be brought into
[SPEAKER_03]: this city or county.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what regulation is going to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Earlier someone said you cannot ban
cannabis, you can only ban legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is accurate.
[SPEAKER_03]: But saying look, we're gonna turn this
public safety risk into a positive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also we're going to create jobs in
this community and we're going to create
[SPEAKER_03]: jobs that require degrees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're, oh, by the way, we as this
particular group are going to put money
[SPEAKER_03]: into early childhood education or building
a public pool or whatever that particular
[SPEAKER_03]: community is interested in.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in order to do that, you have to go
into that community and find out what
[SPEAKER_03]: their particular needs are and listen to
what those negatives are so that you end
[SPEAKER_03]: up tipping the scales and all of the
sudden it's looking at all of this
[SPEAKER_03]: positive and how can the city council or
board of supervisors vote that down
[SPEAKER_03]: because of all those positives and the
negatives have been addressed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Both Ariana and Mayor Durham mentioned
something.
[SPEAKER_07]: They brought up really great points as far
as common sense solutions, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: So with respect to cities, and perhaps all
of you know this already, but cities are
[SPEAKER_07]: scrambling for revenue, okay?
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when you talk about solutions that
are gonna bring revenue, bring tax
[SPEAKER_07]: revenues to cities, I mean, they're
looking at the past and they're seeing
[SPEAKER_07]: redevelopment, gone.
[SPEAKER_07]: Enterprise zones, off the table.
[SPEAKER_07]: So cannabis is, it certainly provides an
opportunity to help build city coffers if
[SPEAKER_07]: done in a smart way.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I think if there's a way to
communicate that message and kind of lay
[SPEAKER_07]: out the how, there are going to be a lot
of jurisdictions, a lot of jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_07]: who are already seeing their neighboring
jurisdictions reap benefits at this point
[SPEAKER_07]: in time that are going to wanna come on
board themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: So just wanted to put that out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you, Jackie, for being panelist
and fact checker.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're not at 80 or 90%, we're at 65.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not great.
[SPEAKER_05]: But let's get maybe a more apt example of
sort of the neutral or negative.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Charles, you're kind of pointing out
like we need the pros.
[SPEAKER_05]: We need why is this good?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it revenue?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it jobs?
[SPEAKER_05]: So let's talk about something that
happened very recently with the League of
[SPEAKER_05]: Cities.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there was, obviously you represent 482
municipalities.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is this delivery regulation in the
proposed regs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where delivery can, you can deliver to any
jurisdiction regardless of whether it has
[SPEAKER_05]: a ban or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously very controversial.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are some of the no's or the reasons
why not or the reasons that are neutral or
[SPEAKER_05]: negative that the League of Cities is
expressing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Generally, obviously we talk about common
sense.
[SPEAKER_05]: The numbers are behind the cannabis
movement.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is the League of Cities so worried
about with delivery in any jurisdiction
[SPEAKER_05]: regardless of whether it's banned or not?
[SPEAKER_07]: The League of California Cities,
contrary to what some may think,
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, so we're neither pro nor
anti-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's never been the case.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, that's not the case despite what
some may think about the organization.
[SPEAKER_07]: With respect to delivery and what a lot of
our cities see as the cons or the
[SPEAKER_07]: negatives, a lot of it does boil down to
public safety for starters.
[SPEAKER_07]: As I understand it, there are,
bear with me, I got you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So with respect to public safety,
and we talk about deliveries in
[SPEAKER_07]: particular, we're not talking about a
retail establishment that has various
[SPEAKER_07]: security measures in place to basically
account for all of the cash on hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just the product, but the cash.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when you lay out a scenario whereby
you have a delivery vehicle going into
[SPEAKER_07]: whatever neighborhood and there's an
opportunity or somebody, for whatever
[SPEAKER_07]: reason, however peeps that there is,
that that delivery vehicle is containing
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis, has cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, you put our cities, there are
cities who don't want to put their,
[SPEAKER_07]: they don't want to have to deal with the
risk of putting their drivers at risk,
[SPEAKER_07]: delivery drivers, they don't want to put
the they don't want to create situations
[SPEAKER_07]: whereby there are robberies, whereby there
are any other crimes, ancillary to
[SPEAKER_07]: robberies where people can get hurt,
since this is still an all cash business.
[SPEAKER_07]: As I understand it, that is one of the
underlying concerns.
[SPEAKER_07]: With respect to the other proposed reg
that's still percolating dynamic delivery,
[SPEAKER_07]: as it's called colloquially, where a
delivery driver can potentially carry up
[SPEAKER_07]: to $10,000 in cash, should that also pass
or be adopted, that's only going to
[SPEAKER_07]: exacerbate the concerns that cities have.
[SPEAKER_07]: Beyond that, cities are concerned,
whether rational or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're concerned about delivery drivers
going to the doors and you have
[SPEAKER_07]: potentially, let's say a 13 year old
answers the door for instance.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah, this cannabis is for my
grandmother.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll just take that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now granted, delivery drivers aren't
supposed to hand that over necessarily,
[SPEAKER_07]: but who's going to enforce that when
you've got cash on the table necessarily?
[SPEAKER_07]: Beyond that, I hear that there is,
I should say the strongest argument beyond
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: The strongest argument against cities and
their concerns that I've heard thrown out
[SPEAKER_07]: there is that obviously, there is a
concern about patients.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have patient access is key.
[SPEAKER_07]: I will say that there, people with cancer,
persons that have mobility issues,
[SPEAKER_07]: patients should certainly have access to
medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is a conversation that I will say
right now, I'm willing to engage anyone on
[SPEAKER_07]: and willing to go back to my colleagues
and say, hey look, we really need to
[SPEAKER_07]: discuss this issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Every single proposal that we've seen on
the table this year, as it relates to
[SPEAKER_07]: delivery, from our vantage point,
it shows that patient access is not at the
[SPEAKER_07]: forefront of the delivery issue.
[SPEAKER_05]: That in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is the League of Cities, just
specifically, are they worried about
[SPEAKER_05]: licensed delivery operators doing illegal
activity?
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, they've put all the work and
money into getting a license.
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they worried about those delivery
operators?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they worried about operators who do
not want to do it legally?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think they're just concerned in general.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some cities that are concerned
just in general about how does that get
[SPEAKER_07]: enforced?
[SPEAKER_07]: How feasible is it to enforce?
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got law enforcement telling our city
officials that we're not going to be able
[SPEAKER_07]: to enforce these delivery provisions and
if stuff goes bad, stuff goes bad in our
[SPEAKER_07]: community from a licensed operator from
another community, that falls on us.
[SPEAKER_07]: Ultimately, to handle.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are some cities like West Hollywood,
like Pasadena, like others who are more
[SPEAKER_07]: than capable, who feel more than capable
of handling delivery in their communities.
[SPEAKER_07]: By all means, we want them to be able to
have that option to offer that to
[SPEAKER_07]: operators.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do any of the other panelists have any
thoughts on delivery and this idea that it
[SPEAKER_05]: can't be regulated, even though there's
regulation in place and lots of money and
[SPEAKER_05]: licenses that delivery operators are going
through?
[SPEAKER_05]: To try to do it the right way?
[SPEAKER_04]: Charles, please don't take any of my
comments personally.
[SPEAKER_04]: I appreciate you actually coming to the
table today to have a discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully, we can work together and open
the league's mind and change this
[SPEAKER_04]: adversarial relationship that I do feel
that we have.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't feel that the league is pro or
anti-cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that they are pro easy route,
which is a ban, and anti the hard route,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is education on regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: The delivery issue is bringing this
adversarial relationship to a peak.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the Stop the Wandering Weed campaign
began, which was introduced by the UFCW,
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys signed on in support of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: On Friday of last week, that campaign came
down off of their website.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't know why, but only after 86 of
your members signed on in support of the
[SPEAKER_04]: Stop the Wandering Weed campaign.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Stop the Wandering Weed campaign was a
cartoon, and we're not allowed to use
[SPEAKER_04]: cartoons because we would be marketing to
children, but yet they used a cartoon to
[SPEAKER_04]: rail us and showed us driving up to
schools and dispensing cannabis to
[SPEAKER_04]: children.
[SPEAKER_04]: As if any licensed operator is going to go
through all of the local and state legal
[SPEAKER_04]: hurdles to get the license to then vend to
children was offensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was repulsive.
[SPEAKER_04]: It made my stomach turn.
[SPEAKER_04]: It still makes my stomach turn.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yet, we have to turn the corner and figure
out how we can come to the table and
[SPEAKER_04]: figure out a compromise.
[SPEAKER_04]: I keep hearing, oh, well, we wouldn't have
had this issue if it was just about
[SPEAKER_04]: medical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, because it always goes back to
local control.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, what about local control?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do local governments have control over
NORCOs being delivered to a home?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do they have control over alcohol being
delivered and making sure a child doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: answer the door when that package arrives?
[SPEAKER_04]: Seriously.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why are they so about local control when
it comes to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: The more that we regulate this,
the less children are going to get access
[SPEAKER_04]: to it, and that is a reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: To conflate the two issues of dynamic
delivery and 5416D, they're two separate
[SPEAKER_04]: issues, yet we got smeared.
[SPEAKER_04]: There isn't another campaign to correct
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say that maybe now the league
regrets this decision to support that
[SPEAKER_04]: campaign, but they're not going out to
those 86 members and saying, hey,
[SPEAKER_04]: we screwed up.
[SPEAKER_04]: The damage is already done.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, no, it's seriously offensive,
and I don't know how we're supposed to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: My issue with the league has been you can
say you're not anti or pro all you want,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you went out with just a campaign with
a gun to the heads of the cities back in
[SPEAKER_04]: late 2015 and early 2016, and no one has
gone out with that same energy to teach
[SPEAKER_04]: jurisdictions how to regulate.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we need.
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Charles.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to do Q&A very shortly.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let me just say that with respect to
the last issue you mentioned, yeah,
[SPEAKER_07]: we had that timeline.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cities had that timeline.
[SPEAKER_07]: Local governments had the timeline to put
an ordinance on the books.
[SPEAKER_07]: Before my time, but I understand that
there may have been conversations that if
[SPEAKER_07]: communities did not want cannabis,
yes, to put an ordinance in place that
[SPEAKER_07]: prohibited cannabis in their communities.
[SPEAKER_07]: Otherwise, they would be preempted.
[SPEAKER_07]: As with anything, local governments or
anyone doesn't like being told what to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: With Prop 64, as we know, there's
divergent viewpoints on this, but yes,
[SPEAKER_07]: it was a patchwork in a sense whereby it
allowed for locals to have a retaining
[SPEAKER_07]: reasonable regulation authority.
[SPEAKER_07]: With respect to the wandering weed,
the stop wandering weed, I don't have a
[SPEAKER_07]: strong answer for you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was out on paternity leave when that
happened.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was probably the last person to find out
about that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I never actually saw the cartoon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let the panelists talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I never actually saw the cartoon,
but the point remains, it just goes to
[SPEAKER_07]: show how much cities are concerned.
[SPEAKER_07]: That however many of them would sign on to
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't think you can separate out 5416D
and dynamic delivery because at the end of
[SPEAKER_07]: the day, if both are adopted, and I
suspect both will be, it is a public
[SPEAKER_07]: safety issue that cities are gonna have to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_07]: Local governments are going to have to
deal with it who feel ill-equipped to be
[SPEAKER_07]: able to handle deliveries.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's where I think the education is
necessary.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not saying it's easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: If it was easy, everyone would do it,
but that's what needs to take place if in
[SPEAKER_07]: fact we're gonna get to a place where we
can have our local officials heed whatever
[SPEAKER_07]: it is that their constituents supposedly
are saying to them.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is an election year, so if you want
to talk to them, if you want them to
[SPEAKER_07]: listen to you, constituents have the power
to do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy's listening to his constituents,
he's not gonna get voted out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you willing, is the League willing to
engage in a conversation about real
[SPEAKER_03]: education for cities and counties and
sitting down at the table with the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis industry if the League is not pro
or anti?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can we have that conversation?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think it's too late.
[SPEAKER_03]: We still have 65% of jurisdictions to
educate and to get regulations through.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's possible the League can be an
ally in that rather than a hindrance.
[SPEAKER_07]: I make no commitment as to the result,
but I'm open to having a conversation with
[SPEAKER_07]: anyone about how the League can help
educate members or how the League,
[SPEAKER_07]: at the very least, can facilitate
education between industry representatives
[SPEAKER_07]: and local officials.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm happy to have that conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a solution.
[SPEAKER_05]: Real quick, Jack.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really quick, I have a solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is what I would like to see the
League do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would like to see the League start with
every jurisdiction, every one of their
[SPEAKER_04]: members that passed Proposition 64,
beginning with a survey on what yes meant
[SPEAKER_04]: in their community.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is where we've gone wrong,
is we don't know what yes meant in every
[SPEAKER_04]: single jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it mean that they want home
deliveries?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it mean they want retail locations?
[SPEAKER_04]: Does it mean they want commercial
cultivation, manufacturing, distribution,
[SPEAKER_04]: all of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or did they just vote yes for social
justice purposes?
[SPEAKER_04]: We need to figure that out in every
community, and then you regulate from
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, panelists.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question pertains to the sales tax on
cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was stated earlier that a lot of the
illicit shops are not paying any taxes on
[SPEAKER_02]: their cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel, with it being a mainly cash
industry, that the licensed shops are
[SPEAKER_02]: paying back their true amount of sales
tax, or do you feel that there may be some
[SPEAKER_02]: false reporting and tax evasion going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, in order to tax,
it requires a vote of the people because
[SPEAKER_00]: of Proposition 218.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the city of West Hollywood,
we will probably have, on the March 2019
[SPEAKER_00]: ballot, a proposal sponsored by the
council to ask the people to vote in a
[SPEAKER_00]: tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taxes of the city, governments can't just
impose a tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually have to go to a vote of the
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, if the tax passes
overwhelmingly, it kind of tells you where
[SPEAKER_00]: the people are.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people are saying, we want this tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: It shows you that they're strongly in
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: On issues of tax evasion, I think that any
time you're dealing with cash,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we have a lot of cash businesses in
West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of bars and nightclubs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They also deal heavily in cash every
night.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's always the opportunity for tax
evasion, but they're smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to get caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to end up like Jimmy Hoffa
sitting in a federal prison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we just have to trust that people
are going to comply, ultimately.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't speak specifically to what any
individual business is doing in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: tax evasion.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can tell you that our clients that we're
working with so hard to get licensed and
[SPEAKER_03]: that that process can take a year or two
years or three years if regulations aren't
[SPEAKER_03]: yet on the books.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are constantly asking questions about
what taxes they owe, how the best way to
[SPEAKER_03]: pay their taxes is.
[SPEAKER_03]: My advice is always to go and talk to an
accountant because I am not an accountant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are looking to be responsible in
paying their taxes because they worked
[SPEAKER_03]: that hard to get their license.
[SPEAKER_03]: They don't want to then turn around and
lose it because they didn't pay their
[SPEAKER_03]: taxes.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think a big issue is how high the taxes
are.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're not the same taxes that you have
for other industries in the same city.
[SPEAKER_05]: San Francisco, they don't have a tax now,
but they want to go one to seven percent.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're obviously going to always be
evasion, but the taxes are breaking
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Dale Schaefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm working with Jackie.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to at least start that the question
is sort of a dialogue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inside of the League of Cities,
do you have a discussion group that
[SPEAKER_01]: understands that every nook and cranny of
the state is having deliveries happen
[SPEAKER_01]: right now with large amount of products
and large amount of cash?
[SPEAKER_01]: You understand this industry is up and
running and we are trying to work with you
[SPEAKER_01]: and other power brokers to try to bring
this regulated, that right now you are the
[SPEAKER_01]: enemy and we don't want you to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to reach out to you like
Jackie did at a group.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the person we've got to try to
please, but you're the people holding keys
[SPEAKER_01]: that are taking us out regularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does your organization want to work with
us?
[SPEAKER_07]: First and foremost, I don't think that
anyone is ignorant to the fact that there
[SPEAKER_07]: is an illicit market out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: All kinds of operators are acting
illegally.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, that is an issue that legalized
operators.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're fighting.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're trying to contend with.
[SPEAKER_07]: As far as the League goes, I came into
this panel expecting to be recognized as
[SPEAKER_07]: the bad guy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to find ways or at least,
yeah, I want to find ways to work with
[SPEAKER_07]: industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: It starts with conversations and civility
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Obviously, there is a lot of, again,
there's a lot of passion and there's a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of hurt feelings based on whatever may
have transpired in the past, both leading
[SPEAKER_07]: up to and since the passing of Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can only speak for myself in terms of
what I'm willing to do.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm certainly willing to have a
conversation with you, further
[SPEAKER_07]: conversation with Jackie and or whomever
else wants to, to see what sort of bridges
[SPEAKER_07]: can be built and we can just hopefully go
from there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I jump in on that question?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been a member of the California
League of Cities for 18 years and the
[SPEAKER_00]: National League of Cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just want to say that this is not
intended.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like Switzerland between the two
panelists here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I will say is the California
League of Cities exerts a great deal of
[SPEAKER_00]: influence in Sacramento on legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do not exert a great deal of
influence on local government.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are members of local government and
what happens a lot of time is the people
[SPEAKER_00]: who are really actively involved in the
California League of Cities come from
[SPEAKER_00]: small conservative towns around the state
and the big city council members don't
[SPEAKER_00]: participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very rare for me to see a San
Francisco supervisor or a Los Angeles City
[SPEAKER_00]: Council member at a League of Cities
event.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what Charles is saying is correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are supposed to be neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would suggest that you all, this woman
here is right, she's gonna get my card,
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, come to the city of West
Hollywood, Santa Cruz, Berkeley,
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francisco, San Diego, Los Angeles and
encourage us to ask the League of Cities
[SPEAKER_00]: because we're all members to let us
sponsor a panel on reasonable regulation
[SPEAKER_00]: at the annual conference of the League of
Cities.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna hold you to that mayor.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll organize it for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, there we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi everyone.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Joseph Chicas.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a director of government affairs for
cannabis advising partners.
[SPEAKER_06]: My question was really relating to equity
and transparency in the decision making
[SPEAKER_06]: for these applications because what we're
finding is that as time goes on,
[SPEAKER_06]: more and more of these decisions regarding
licensing across the board are becoming
[SPEAKER_06]: more and more political, more and more
personal interests and competing interests
[SPEAKER_06]: and conflicts of interest are going into
those decisions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So how do we work together to improve
equity and transparency in the decisions
[SPEAKER_06]: that are being made at the local
government level so that the best
[SPEAKER_06]: applicants can really be the best or can
have their foot in the door rather than
[SPEAKER_06]: the person with the most contacts or the
most contributions toward a political
[SPEAKER_06]: campaign?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we looked at this very carefully
because we did not like the first come
[SPEAKER_00]: first serve method and we didn't like the
lottery as we, you know, didn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: either of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we instead developed a merit-based
system and I gotta tell you, when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: first starting to discuss this,
all of a sudden every pet cause that I am
[SPEAKER_00]: part of was suddenly seeing a great influx
of cannabis dollars going into all of my
[SPEAKER_00]: pet causes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that is the way that, you know,
politics works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were cognizant from the beginning
that there was going to be an attempt to
[SPEAKER_00]: try to curry favors from the electeds on
our council.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we developed a merit-based system where
the applications, we have 300 applications
[SPEAKER_00]: that have come in, are being reviewed by a
seven member committee, none of whom have
[SPEAKER_00]: any interest or business interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, I only know one of the names
because somebody accidentally told me that
[SPEAKER_00]: this person was on the committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the five council members, we have no
idea who even the seven committee people
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're reviewing the applications.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going through it on various
criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote them down, innovative business
model, connection to West Hollywood,
[SPEAKER_00]: business operations, social equity,
product offerings, design concepts,
[SPEAKER_00]: security plan, and experience in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the criteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came up with a point system and these
seven women and men are gonna go through
[SPEAKER_00]: all 300 applications and they're gonna
make recommendations to the business
[SPEAKER_00]: license commission who then gives them one
of the, what I call, the golden tickets,
[SPEAKER_00]: Willy Wonka reference, one of the golden
tickets and then go out and find a
[SPEAKER_00]: location somewhere in the city.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then only if all of that, people are
unhappy, they think something went awry,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it appealable to the council.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have intentionally tried to keep
ourselves away from the decision making to
[SPEAKER_00]: the greatest extent possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, we have to have some concern
because we're the electeds, we have to,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we're responsible for
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really try to create a system where
we're out of the evaluation to avoid the
[SPEAKER_00]: appearance that these golden tickets were
for sale in any which way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a system we've come up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's unique at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still in the middle of the process
and we expect that those licenses will be
[SPEAKER_00]: handed out at the end of October or early
November and then we'll be in the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm hoping that what we've come up here
as a model ordinance at other cities will
[SPEAKER_00]: replicate it as a way to make decision
based on merit rather than just
[SPEAKER_00]: happenstance or first come first serve.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just a quick follow up Mayor,
specifically because the gentleman asked
[SPEAKER_05]: about social equity, is there anything in
place to be assured that these will be
[SPEAKER_05]: sustainable models?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm assuming in the applications they'll
have all the criteria you said including
[SPEAKER_05]: social equity.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there any report that will be given out
quarterly or yearly?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there anything holding these businesses
accountable to the criteria that they
[SPEAKER_05]: applied with to make sure that they
continue that in the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and it'll be like a lot of the other
adult businesses in my community.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of adult businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of bars and adult bookstores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a lot of businesses that,
you know, are people consider not worthy
[SPEAKER_00]: of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got them all.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're happy to have them.
[SPEAKER_05]: A bookstore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that we regulate that is using
our code enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's a commission, a business
license commission who has oversight.
[SPEAKER_00]: We did not want to grant any permits that
ran with the land, meaning we didn't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to give something that ran with the land
but rather goes with the operation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why it's a business license
rather than a permit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a distinction.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a distinction in terms of what it
is that we're giving and how quickly we
[SPEAKER_00]: can take it away if there's a violation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that wraps it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is an incredible panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you again.
[SPEAKER_05]: Round of applause for all the panelists.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sal, John, Ariane, and Jackie,
thank you.
Thank you.
