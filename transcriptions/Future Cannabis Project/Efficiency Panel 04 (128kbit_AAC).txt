[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, you know touching on
operating procedures it's a it's an
[SPEAKER_00]: important part of the new paradigm for
cannabis cultivation undoubtedly,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I would say The majority of
cultivators that are here probably have a
[SPEAKER_00]: methodology that they are at least content
with You know, so perhaps the challenge
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes how do you standardize your?
[SPEAKER_00]: Methodology so that other people can do
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be there seven days a
week?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be hustling?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be building your brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to be networking?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, are you gonna be the guy running
the hose like you used to when you had 99?
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably not, you know, so the reality of
you know Efficiency in terms of is what
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing replicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I convey it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I assess?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it's being done in an efficient
manner, you know, one of the examples I
[SPEAKER_00]: like to use is you know Let's say people
are irrigating a crop right by hand in in
[SPEAKER_00]: a warehouse setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just say and you say well It takes
them four to six hours to do it and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like well, why is it four or six hours?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it because the volume that they're
putting down is different or is it because
[SPEAKER_00]: some people tangle the hose more than
others or you know, and and how do you get
[SPEAKER_00]: any grip on what the reality of your cost
of production there is if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: tracking that how do you decipher actually
20% of my nutrient cost last year was
[SPEAKER_00]: because my guys Screwed up the res mix and
they had to dump it because I had a
[SPEAKER_00]: standard operating procedure, you know
that even so That they knew to do that or
[SPEAKER_00]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of it is is really
developing that system on you know on
[SPEAKER_00]: rolling out those SOPs and and monitoring
them and like you said, you're constantly
[SPEAKER_00]: reevaluating looking at them.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we do this better?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we do this more efficiently and
It's not the same as you know one person
[SPEAKER_00]: or you know a small group of people doing
it by themselves You know as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: scaling Those processes have to be
replicable, you know at scale and so It
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely changes the dynamic not just
how can I do it better?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can I do it efficiently?
[SPEAKER_01]: But how can I do it consistently?
[SPEAKER_01]: which is Perhaps one of the most critical
Endgame components without a consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have a consistent following You
just can't you can't build brand loyalty.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't build consistent expectations
within the marketplace if you can't have
[SPEAKER_00]: consistent output and a lot of ways that
sort of circles us back around to you know
[SPEAKER_00]: facility design right and and what are the
seasonal limitations or You know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are the limitations of what you're
working with and how does that impact?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the model and the end product and
data collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's a setting up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm come back full circle You know,
I mean, yeah if your hand watering,
[SPEAKER_02]: okay, so Are they all doing it the same?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, is it like you said volume of
water?
[SPEAKER_02]: So are they standing there counting?
[SPEAKER_02]: For 10 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, oh my god.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have you know, I Have a phosphorus
toxicity and now like there's water
[SPEAKER_02]: everywhere, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean and speaking of that,
you know I hear a lot of people say well
[SPEAKER_02]: we want to keep hand watering when they've
gone from you know, like 50 plants to
[SPEAKER_02]: 50,000 plants and The argument I always
get every single time is that well it gets
[SPEAKER_02]: us looking at the plants it gets us in the
room so that we can look at the plants and
[SPEAKER_02]: My thought is if you just built into the
SLP walking walk through the room For an
[SPEAKER_02]: hour as opposed to standing there for six
hours and like going like this,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Then you can actually focus on the plant
as opposed to happenstance catching a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem because you happen to be standing
there watering the plant What if you
[SPEAKER_02]: actually scouted on purpose your crop?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was gonna say and if you're looking if
you're paying so much attention to the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant then you're not paying attention to
your Watering that you're doing,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know Yes, the key is to set yourself
up for success, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of the hope, you know,
we only have a few minutes left.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do we are there any questions out
there?
[SPEAKER_04]: these amazingly smart panelists I Hear
you're thinking about them right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're serious questions
[SPEAKER_04]: How can you efficiently design a site plan
for a county that is not Not it's not
[SPEAKER_04]: legal yet
[SPEAKER_00]: Well the thing that all right I'll start
the thing that comes to mind is probably
[SPEAKER_00]: do as much of that Pre-planning as you can
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're not incurring additional costs
Beyond that I would look to you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what the standard, you know, probably for
CDFA CDFA is presently And try and you
[SPEAKER_00]: know and and all the other agencies
involved and try and orient your plan to
[SPEAKER_00]: that You know, there are a lot of good
resources out there in terms of you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how do you draw a site plan?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you know basic stuff like that
So depending on the intricacies of your
[SPEAKER_00]: particular project or parcel or whatever
You know you if you have all the sort of
[SPEAKER_00]: the background information then I would
say go ahead and and be creative design
[SPEAKER_00]: your your dream and You know wait and see
and be patient and don't spend a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: money in the meanwhile I I would agree
with all of those things and add that
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimately Designing a site plan
specifically for cannabis isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily Wildly different than
designing a site plan for other
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some unique capacities but the
components like all the pieces that are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to go into it can be Much the same
as as they are for anything else and so
[SPEAKER_01]: you can start Not worrying about the very
specific components that are going to come
[SPEAKER_01]: in once it becomes legal and Start dealing
with kind of the big block considerations
[SPEAKER_01]: with your power with your water Because
that those it doesn't matter legal or not
[SPEAKER_01]: legal There will be little things that
come up like can I use a residential well
[SPEAKER_01]: versus a commercial well, etc Etc and what
you might have to do to deal with the
[SPEAKER_01]: water, but you can start that process and
Quite frankly not a lot of it may be
[SPEAKER_01]: Impacted once those changes happen and
once those changes come down and in all
[SPEAKER_01]: honesty by the time you're done with your
planning You may already be legal with how
[SPEAKER_01]: long it actually takes to get that
planning in process and underway And I
[SPEAKER_00]: guess you know waterboard compliance if
that's not already already not checked off
[SPEAKER_00]: on your list.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good place start, California To
the water Cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was the efficiency model Feel free to
come up and ask our amazing panelists
[SPEAKER_04]: questions all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: They love talking about this stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: They do it in their dreams Whether they
like it or not promise So yeah big big
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks to the Columbia Schoolhouse for
allowing us all to be here and for
[SPEAKER_04]: flowering for putting this amazing event
on for the community We love you guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you and and if anybody's Local and
has a garden and would like a basil plant
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a bunch of starter basil plants at
our booth the doctor greenhouse booth
[SPEAKER_02]: Towards the front entrance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew them in our little vertical farm
that we have in our office We just heard
[SPEAKER_02]: that harvested them four days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're already in these little Composable
pot so you can just stick them in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground next to your tomato crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great companion plant So feel free
to pick one up first time for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're organic You
