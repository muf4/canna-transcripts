[SPEAKER_00]: So yes, we were lucky to partner with some
really, really bright and wonderful people
[SPEAKER_00]: who have like 30 plus years in tissue
culture and micro propagation that we were
[SPEAKER_00]: able to merge finest cannabis with to
start our tissue culture nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kind of what led us to that was what
we saw as a pretty big issue within the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community, which was plant
quality, plant health, and contamination,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it's from a pest or a pathogen
level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see a lot of that, especially in stock
plants and nurseries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure anyone who's grown plants can
tell a horror story of getting clones from
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody and them having some sort of bug
or disease on them that then spread
[SPEAKER_00]: through their garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we felt that tissue culture micro
propagation was a pretty good solution to
[SPEAKER_00]: explore to try to mitigate that problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of with all that said,
I'm going to do just kind of a quick
[SPEAKER_00]: primer and talk about what tissue culture
is and tissue culture in plants and in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis specifically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tissue culture is really basically the
process of growing cells, tissue or organs
[SPEAKER_00]: in a sterile environment on a nutrient
rich media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that sounds a little bit weird,
but like if you've ever gone to the doctor
[SPEAKER_00]: and gotten tested, like if you had a sore
throat or strep throat, they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: swab your throat and they're going to try
to culture it on a petri dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that essentially is what we are doing
with plants is growing them on a petri
[SPEAKER_00]: dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have this, again, aseptic in vitro
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is a completely sterile environment
that we're growing the plants in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is obviously a lot of advantages
to that, mainly being that the plant is
[SPEAKER_00]: completely contaminant and pathogen free.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is also the huge reduction of
abiotic stress or stress factors on the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants from microbial or pest pressures.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have this media which consists of
nutrients, sugars, vitamins, hormones,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's what we grow the plant on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I wanted to talk a little bit about
tissue culture and the history of tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture in agriculture, if you guys are
okay with that, and why we think it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: viable process and why it's used,
because it is used widely in a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural crops and processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the main reasons that tissue
culture is used in agriculture and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: used on crops from almonds, from grapes,
to every single berry that you buy,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you buy from Driscoll's, every single
one of those plants is grown from a tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main reason that you grow these
things, or you use tissue culture,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, to propagate these plants is A,
the plant is extremely difficult to
[SPEAKER_00]: propagate on its own.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means asexual propagation,
like cloning, doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you guys experienced that with
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is cannabis a hard plant to propagate
asexually?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really in my experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty easy to root, not like some of
these walnut root stalks that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll circle back to that, why it's
effective in cannabis, but the other main
[SPEAKER_00]: reason is if you have really, really
prevalent and virulent diseases that
[SPEAKER_00]: affect plants, and you need to ensure that
you have clean, disease-free, pest-free
[SPEAKER_00]: plant material for your production system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the big crops that you see
tissue culture used widely in are coffee,
[SPEAKER_00]: grapes, and ornamental crop orchids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Orchids are almost impossible to propagate
asexually through traditional cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the seeds, if you ever get viable
seeds from orchid, will never produce the
[SPEAKER_00]: beautiful white phalaenopsis that you buy
at Trader Joe's or wherever else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similar to cannabis, the seeds that you
produce there, if they ever did germinate,
[SPEAKER_00]: would be extremely variable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you want asexual propagation in
cloning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's very difficult to do that
traditionally, so they do that through
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grapes are another big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Veloxera wiped out almost the entire wine
industry in Europe that was thousands and
[SPEAKER_00]: thousands of years old because of an
aphid-like pest.
[SPEAKER_00]: That transmitted a virus to these plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Verticillium is a huge soil virus and
pathogen that affects a ton of
[SPEAKER_00]: strawberries throughout California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it can be passed on systemically
through the plant, so you need to ensure
[SPEAKER_00]: you have clean plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are just a few of the crops that
are already tissue culture is widely used
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So why tissue culture in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, the clean stock material is really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other aspect that we found
that we really weren't betting on as much
[SPEAKER_00]: is the regenerative process that can
happen through tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've seen strains, 20, 30-year-old
strains that were, pardon me, like
[SPEAKER_00]: so-called dotted out that have gone
through the tissue culture process and
[SPEAKER_00]: been regenerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is one of the huge advantages that
we've seen from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's been pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spent about two years, a year and a
half, two years doing R&D trials with
[SPEAKER_00]: initially just over 25 strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we did side by sides from traditional
clone through the plants that were gone
[SPEAKER_00]: through the tissue culture process and
grew them out side by side.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at things like number of
nodes at day 27.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked at overall vigor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at cannabinoid profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We looked at yield, all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're able to see some of the
advantages.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to circle back a little bit,
to try to describe the process a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more, which is a lot more formative.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see it, but you have these plants
growing on gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gel, we call it an agar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, we're using water with nutrients
like you would in hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_00]: but we're adding B vitamins.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adding hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adding sucrose to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can grow these plants again in
this completely sterile environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's lots of different types of
tissue culture, but the one that we
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically focus on is what's called
nodal micropropagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the process kind of looks, if I can try
to kind of walk you guys through the
[SPEAKER_00]: process, you have roughly four stages of
tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have initiation or induction,
which is taking source material from a
[SPEAKER_00]: mother stock plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to sterilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to induce it or initiate
it into the tissue culture stage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to take the plant material.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to sterilize it the best we
can, because again, growing inside that
[SPEAKER_00]: tissue culture tube or petri dish or deli
or whatever you want to call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the only thing living in there should be
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to sterilize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to take whatever organs or
tissues or sections of the plant that we
[SPEAKER_00]: want, and we're going to stick them into
this gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it functions the same way as soil
does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's providing everything the plant needs
for growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the difference is we actually have
very, very low hormone concentrations in
[SPEAKER_00]: that media as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That can steer the plant to do what we
want to do, whether we want it to elongate
[SPEAKER_00]: with auxin, whether we want to branch with
cytokinins, whether we want it to root
[SPEAKER_00]: again with a different type of auxin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are all different plant
hormones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you have the plant growing
actively on a media that you like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can start multiplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we start growing the plants out in
media and we start micropropagating them,
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning them the same way you would clone
traditionally with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're taking very, very small
cross-sections of the plant and getting it
[SPEAKER_00]: to reproduce and grow again on this media
in a sterile environment.
Pardon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also in the gel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we start?
[SPEAKER_00]: So say you had a plant that you wanted to
take into tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got whatever strain it is that you
love.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've been growing it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for whatever reason, you would like to
take it through the tissue culture
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would say, bring in a medium-sized
teen, something that has 40 to 50 lateral
[SPEAKER_00]: nodes off of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just talking about little branches,
lateral nodes on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're going to do is we're going
to take all of those little lateral nodes,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're going to take that little
cross-section off the stem, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to put it onto probably a dozen
different media to see how it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow on different ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these different media have different
hormone concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll put it on.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the first two to three months is this
initiation phase, where after we've
[SPEAKER_00]: sterilized it and stuck it on a bunch of
different media, we're going to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, God, this plant really doesn't
perform with the cytokinin level as high,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's growing well on this media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see the plant's actively growing
inside this little deli container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then we start multiplying it on
that media.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say multiplying, that little X
plant, that's what we call it,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's grown in that petri dish,
we're going to take that, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: chop that up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all those little lateral nodes,
we're going to take it off of that little
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, and we're going to re-stick them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is micro-propagation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our plants start out about yay big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, please, since we've got
such a small audience, which, again,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm totally fine with and happy with,
is if you guys have questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: please raise your hand, ask them out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to have this as more of a
dialogue than me lecturing to you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: about tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if anyone has any questions,
please feel free to reach out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But kind of going back to that process,
we have this multiplication.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're building up the volume of the plant
material that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we can start pulling out some of that
material and start rooting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to root it pretty
much the same way you would root a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant traditionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take, again, our material
is just a lot smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to take this little
material, we're going to stick it in a new
[SPEAKER_00]: media, which has a little bit more,
I mean, you guys have all probably looked
[SPEAKER_00]: at the back of a dip and grow bottle or a
clone X bottle, indyl-3-butraic acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a hormone that causes the plant to
root.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to stick it in a media that
has a little bit higher concentration of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're going to stick it in a
plug.
[SPEAKER_00]: We root it in an ellipod.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a peat perlite plug.
And then we're going to stick it in a new
media that has a little bit higher
concentration of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to stick it in a plug.
We're going to stick it in a new media
that has a little bit higher concentration
of that.
And then we're going to stick it in a
plug.
