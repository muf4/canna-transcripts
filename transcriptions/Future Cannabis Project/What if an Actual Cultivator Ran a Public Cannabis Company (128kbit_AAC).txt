[SPEAKER_03]: OK, so I want to get into your journey
going public.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the original, you're based out of
Portland, and the original company slash,
[SPEAKER_03]: you started as a farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's the name of the brand?
[SPEAKER_02]: So the name of the company that we
originally started was Eco Firma Farms,
[SPEAKER_02]: which was an indoor cultivation facility
in just outside, about 30 minutes outside
[SPEAKER_02]: Portland, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the company was crushing it in the
Portland market?
[SPEAKER_02]: The company was crushing it in the
Portland market.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the Oregon market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eco Firma Farms was the first company in
the country to nationally advertise that
[SPEAKER_02]: they wholesale cannabis and put a phone
number and email address to go with it
[SPEAKER_02]: back in 2012.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we took it a full page ad out in
high times and made that statement with
[SPEAKER_02]: our logo.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest with you, most of my
friends said you're going to go to prison.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we established ourselves as a brand
and kind of took off from there and went
[SPEAKER_02]: down a path of sustainability,
looking at how you could cultivate
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis indoor and be carbon neutral.
[SPEAKER_02]: How could I look at an outdoor farm who
said you're destroying the planet and feel
[SPEAKER_02]: good about myself and say, no,
I'm not?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we took off down that path.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were 100% carbon neutral.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our power was 100% wind power because we
had that opportunity in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that just kind of planted the
seed of how do we get rid of our garbage?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we use light?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we use automation?
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we grow vertically?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we do to be more sustainable?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we learned was that by being
environmentally sustainable, we actually
[SPEAKER_02]: started creating corporate sustainability
and financial sustainability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we went through our public audit,
when we sold the company and we were the
[SPEAKER_02]: primary company in an RTO to go public,
we found in the audit that we had made it
[SPEAKER_02]: to $189 a pound to produce indoor
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is in a lot of cases less expensive
than a good deal of outdoor farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was really access to capital for the
expansion.
[SPEAKER_02]: Looking at Oregon and that market in
particular, I think it was a good
[SPEAKER_02]: representation of what you can see in a
supply demand as it gets larger throughout
[SPEAKER_02]: the country and everyone's going to see it
eventually.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Oregon was a great example.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went in a 90 day period from a
wholesale price of $2,600 a pound to a
[SPEAKER_02]: wholesale price of $600 a pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: In 90 days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the attrition rate there is really,
really high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what happens is you get a lot of farms
then who will start selling cannabis for
[SPEAKER_02]: below their average cost to produce just
to try to get a little back into the
[SPEAKER_02]: retirement account.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us, we saw that and said we need to
A, we need a lot of upgrades so that we
[SPEAKER_02]: can produce cannabis for even lower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found ways to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we also need to create a vertical
integration model here between processing
[SPEAKER_02]: and retail.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in order to do that, we're going to
need a lot of money, a lot more than
[SPEAKER_02]: usually a individual investor is willing
to put out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we looked into doing an IPO or an RTO,
reverse takeover or initial public
[SPEAKER_02]: offering.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in looking at the RTO and trying to
decide how you do an RTO, figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you start?
[SPEAKER_02]: We happened to have an opportunity where
another company had a show already and
[SPEAKER_02]: they were looking for a cannabis company
and we collided in the middle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we helped them take their RTO into
cannabis and they helped us take our
[SPEAKER_02]: company public.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're now basically in bed with this
other group, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like they own a piece of equity in the new
co.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they own a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we did in the, in the sale was we
struck a deal for, and it's a lot of it's
[SPEAKER_02]: public.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can read about it, but we struck a
deal for cash and for investment,
[SPEAKER_02]: future investment to move forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they acquired you based on a
person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now, but you're saying they now own a
hundred percent of the company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you don't have any equity in the
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we did what's called a share purchase
agreement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we took a lot of shares.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you do have equity, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it was an equity deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an equity deal because it was
mostly stock, not a lot of cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's one of my passion subjects
because I'm always curious that implies
[SPEAKER_03]: that you believe that they're share price
is not currently overvalued and will go
[SPEAKER_03]: up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because a lot of these deals that you see
in the press, every time I see a deal,
[SPEAKER_03]: I say, I bet it's like 90 plus percent
stock, a couple million dollars of cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that was your deal, but you were,
so it means you have confidence in that
[SPEAKER_03]: group because they're going to be steering
the ship.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I should say that differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you ever heard the phrase,
the first one through the door takes the
[SPEAKER_02]: most rounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So typically the first one through the
door takes the most rounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also get the best deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the deal that we struck at our time
going with them, I was confident was going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be a multiplier for us in value in the
future.
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, future deals don't tend
to get the same deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of times when you see the Cresco
labs, $850 million purchase of a
[SPEAKER_02]: distributor in California, that's not
their first purchase.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so how much of that is stock and what
is the lift going to be out of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: And where are they looking for in a
merger?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a completely different play than
to be the first company to go,
[SPEAKER_02]: to go public or the first group of
companies to go public.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my opinion, and the great thing
that I got to learn in going public was I
[SPEAKER_02]: got to learn from the very beginning,
how to do an RTO, how to take a cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: company public, how to raise money for
that cannabis company and how to recognize
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of pitfalls that could be in what I
like to call the 1.0 of public cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: companies that's going on right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe the 2.0 is starting now,
which is why I opted to leave the company
[SPEAKER_02]: that I was with and go start this new
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: So leaving the company is the one that
just went public, but you're starting
[SPEAKER_03]: something new.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I was going to say everything
you're talking about is implying that
[SPEAKER_03]: you're going to go through this process
all over again, which implies that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: not working full time at the public co.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically you sold your company,
you are now out of the operations of it,
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're now focused on starting your
next thing with the cash part of what you
[SPEAKER_03]: received from the last deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the cash and the experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are you now doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am now opening, I'm going to do an
RTO and we're going to consolidate
[SPEAKER_02]: companies once we have the companies
consolidated that we want, which we're in
[SPEAKER_02]: LOIs with right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will then, as a group, take all of
those companies public with a shell that I
[SPEAKER_02]: already possess.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what part of the supply chain are
these companies in that you're cobbling
[SPEAKER_03]: together?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at everything from full
vertical integration, so indoor and
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor cultivation, processing,
retail, and then we're also looking at
[SPEAKER_02]: some tech pieces and some manufacturing
pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like your LOIs, are they with a
processing company or a retail company?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes and yes.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically you're three quarters of the
way through getting the whole vertical
[SPEAKER_03]: stack together, the band together,
and then it's announcing the public,
[SPEAKER_03]: going public.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we have them, we build all the
financials and have everything there to
[SPEAKER_02]: show investors what they would be
investing in and our potential for gain in
[SPEAKER_02]: the future and our experience level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we will take it public and go raise
capital for that larger endeavor with all
[SPEAKER_02]: the companies together.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're inspiring to all the dudes who
are actually guys who know what they're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing from a cultivation standpoint.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're an example of somebody who's not
going to be a finance guy coming in and
[SPEAKER_03]: rolling up the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're a cannabis guy who's going to do
what the finance guys have been doing in
[SPEAKER_03]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a cannabis guy who got the opportunity
to learn the finance piece of it over the
[SPEAKER_02]: last three years on the public side and so
I'm going to take that experience with me
[SPEAKER_02]: into this new endeavor and I was also
fortunate enough when we built Ecofirma,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least from what we've seen on public
market and what we've seen with RII and
[SPEAKER_02]: the PowerScore, we also built one of the
most efficient gardens in the country.
[SPEAKER_02]: So being able to take that experience into
other businesses and be able to work with
[SPEAKER_02]: them to create that efficient model,
it's where I would like to be,
[SPEAKER_02]: someone will shoot me for saying this,
but I would like to be one of the first
[SPEAKER_02]: public cannabis companies to right out of
the gate start giving out some dividends,
[SPEAKER_02]: even if they're not much, because it would
be about time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that we can do that,
and that's why I say I believe the 2.0 of
[SPEAKER_02]: public cannabis companies, I believe that
we're right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're not going to be stretched super
thin and trying to madly acquire things
[SPEAKER_03]: and overpay for things.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically it seems like on your pitch
deck you're probably showcasing the fact
[SPEAKER_03]: that you're the lowest cost indoor
producer in terms of capabilities and then
[SPEAKER_03]: you want to scale this across the country
and into different markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're doing the vertical integration
in Oregon, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you want to start attacking other
states?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're doing the vertical integration
nationally.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Oregon will have pieces in it,
and Oregon is just a good example of where
[SPEAKER_02]: vertical integration is key because of the
market that they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But vertical integration in different
states all have different value points.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so looking at a state like Nevada,
which I think is a great example,
[SPEAKER_02]: or Arizona.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nevada, Las Vegas, we're looking at 40
million tourists a year that come through
[SPEAKER_02]: here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the population of California that
come through in a year just in tourism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Having a footprint down here in retail is
a really good idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: That being said, cultivation down here is
substantially more expensive than it is in
[SPEAKER_02]: say Humboldt County or Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once we can open those borders up and
start moving cannabis south, having $10
[SPEAKER_02]: million that you spent on a grow in
Nevada.
[SPEAKER_03]: An indoor facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like where you're going.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's an ROI balance there of really
looking at the markets across the country
[SPEAKER_02]: and figuring out where to put the capital.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what always blows me away about
the money that has been spent on those
[SPEAKER_03]: desert hot springs facilities,
where all you can think of in your mind
[SPEAKER_03]: is, you guys realize that in three years
or five, or whatever it is, that this
[SPEAKER_03]: facility is going to be a complete waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the implication is that yes,
they do know that, but they think that
[SPEAKER_03]: they can make so much money in the short
term to justify that huge cap X.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all an estimation of ROI.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think they're going to make it
up.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to find out in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to find out.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically you're so, but your roll up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have a name by the way?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mantis?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mantis growth investments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to have sexier brand names
than that, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Mantis growth is really just for the
capital public market.
[SPEAKER_03]: In terms of you want to roll up a couple
of companies and then go public with a big
[SPEAKER_03]: tada moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: My question, and I just want to make sure
I understand the answer is you're rolling
[SPEAKER_03]: those companies up in the Oregon market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you say you're doing it
nationally, does that imply that you're,
[SPEAKER_03]: you're, you have an LOI with like a,
a manufacturing company that has
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturing operations across multiple
states?
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So good questions.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are entering an LOI right now in
California to acquire 32 licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, so in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Across the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it could be a distribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's from one company.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's from one company.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're going to, you're about to roll
up a company that has, that is doing well
[SPEAKER_03]: in the California market, like building
out this vision in this market
[SPEAKER_03]: specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you'll have them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, and then we're looking at a
company in Nevada that has cultivation and
[SPEAKER_02]: a retail firm.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you don't like cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, but you're going to sell that
retail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you would keep it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You wouldn't try to immediately sell that
off to someone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it has to be, it has to be factored
into the purchase price of the valuation
[SPEAKER_02]: to understand what are we paying for it
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are we looking at for the retail
side?
[SPEAKER_02]: If we have to close down cultivation at
one year, two year, three year,
[SPEAKER_02]: what are we looking for, for CapEx to be
able to fund that and not take a big hit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really the discussion of the
LOI.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really the responsibility of,
of us to the investors.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I am taking public money from
investors, be it, I bought 10 shares
[SPEAKER_02]: myself, or I am a private placement
investor, my responsibility is to ensure
[SPEAKER_02]: that you may not know the cannabis space
really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my responsibility with your money is to
ensure that I spend it wisely so that we
[SPEAKER_02]: can gain value in those shares,
whether it's for the 10 shareholder or the
[SPEAKER_02]: million dollar investor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, so that's interesting that
you're, so you're going to your tada
[SPEAKER_03]: moments going to be with like vertical
integration in California, like what's up
[SPEAKER_03]: world?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're vertically integrated in California.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're vertically integrated in Nevada and
like maybe one or two other states.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's so, so I am right in thinking
that your, your long-term vision is to
[SPEAKER_03]: basically, you know, since every state is
for a while going to be its own silo of
[SPEAKER_03]: economy, you're going to just build that
out into all the legal states.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then in each state, you're going to
decide which part of the stack we want to
[SPEAKER_03]: be operating in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: How well will it play together when we can
bring all the states together,
[SPEAKER_02]: when we can open up federal borders
sometime in the next 12 to 36 months?
[SPEAKER_02]: I really do think that's probably a good
estimation of timeline.
[SPEAKER_02]: And within that timeframe, if you're
looking at your asset, or at least if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're looking at what you're acquiring
for assets across the country with that
[SPEAKER_02]: mindset that eventually they're all going
to blend together and how are they going
[SPEAKER_02]: to play together?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have we made a giant mistake or not?
[SPEAKER_02]: That, that's what we're looking towards.
[SPEAKER_02]: Am I putting up 10 million square feet of
flowering canopy space in Ottawa,
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I hope not.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, and I'm not saying that it's a
terrible investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not saying terrible things about a
company that's there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying there's a, you know,
there's, there's a reason people don't buy
[SPEAKER_02]: substantial amounts of wine coming out of
Paducah, Kentucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not because Kentucky is a bad place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because grapes grow better in
California.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at acquisitions as a whole for
whether it's retail or technology or
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation, trying to make sure those
puzzle pieces are going to fit together
[SPEAKER_02]: right in the future is what I think we
should be doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Talk tech acquisition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're implying that you'd want to roll
up some tech type operators as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what kind of technology are you
looking at?
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that there is some really
interesting technology out there
[SPEAKER_02]: surrounding genetics and crop management.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultivation has really interesting crop
management across an ERP scale for one,
[SPEAKER_02]: but even on the cultivation side,
if you, if you are a fully vertically
[SPEAKER_02]: integrated company and you think about
what it takes from the time you plant a
[SPEAKER_02]: seed or cut a clone until the time it
sells at a retail dispensary, what the
[SPEAKER_02]: consumer is going to want and how to trend
that and make sure that you have enough
[SPEAKER_02]: Durban poison in the month of July.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause that's when it's the most popular to
sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you know when to plant it and where
to plant it and which phenos to plant and
[SPEAKER_02]: in what environment it grows best at being
able to track that with software and data
[SPEAKER_02]: to ensure that you can put that in the
hands of a $15 an hour employee and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: all done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to be a pinnacle piece
towards, towards crop management for these
[SPEAKER_02]: large companies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, so it seems like with your vertical
integration, you, you could almost build
[SPEAKER_03]: out like what you would want a technology
solution to be able to do for your
[SPEAKER_03]: vertical integration and then take all the
data coming out of all that making sense
[SPEAKER_03]: of it, but then scaling it to then selling
them to other operators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That data becomes very valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I can tell you exactly what plants
yield, exactly how much in every product
[SPEAKER_02]: from tincture to raw flour to BHO,
what our highest price points are,
[SPEAKER_02]: what our best terpenes are, what our best
cannabinoid profiles are and how they sell
[SPEAKER_02]: in each market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all of that is not six people
crunching numbers as cost accountants in
[SPEAKER_02]: an office that we're paying for,
but it's taken care of in software and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's one cost accountant that can look
through it, pick apart the numbers,
[SPEAKER_02]: analyze it, and then the software can
actually tell us what we need to be doing
[SPEAKER_02]: at all the way down to the crop level for
harvest or all the way up at the retail
[SPEAKER_02]: level for distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those pieces are overlooked.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically you'd be looking to either
build or acquire like data analytics
[SPEAKER_03]: capabilities that are servicing and
getting data from different parts of the
[SPEAKER_03]: supply chain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there are companies out there working
on it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've been in talks with a couple
of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like the vision.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I guess the special sauce is,
what do you bring to the table that nobody
[SPEAKER_03]: else does?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's basically I can grow indoor weed for
cheaper and better than anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't say better than anybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: But point being like general.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've started what I like to think of as a
competition for people to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: produce higher quality for lower cost and
at a completely environmentally
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainable way so that we're not robbing
Peter to pay Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, at the end of the day,
we're all polishing the brass on the
[SPEAKER_02]: Titanic around here.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you think that you can rob Peter to pay
Paul.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not Paul, but.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes, I think the experience from going
through the small scale cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation all the way through a public
acquisition and also being able to do this
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation and be able to do it more
efficiently right now than anybody in the
[SPEAKER_02]: country on an indoor scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think those two pieces put us in a very
unique position.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, current as obviously the
technology you're using in your indoor
[SPEAKER_03]: grow operation is going to change over
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like current snapshot in time,
can you walk me through what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: currently using?
[SPEAKER_03]: So using like Fluence lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're using Fluence lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're using packaged HVAC units at this
moment, which are already antiquated
[SPEAKER_02]: because we built the grow three years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're using regular soil that we grow in
that we amend with a higher concentration
[SPEAKER_02]: of perlite so that we have a little better
drainage.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're using an automated feed system that
also tracks all of our feed, all of our
[SPEAKER_02]: data and can back net tie into all of our
environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what system is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Rhythm is the name of the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we use 20 percent salt based
nutrient right now, 10 to 20 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I shouldn't say we, the company that
we sold.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they were using when I left.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you are you making your own like at
what scale would you make your own
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients instead of buying them?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like who do you buy nutrients from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So time to do that right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So maybe I should backtrack.
[SPEAKER_02]: The three most expensive parts of running
an indoor cultivation facility,
[SPEAKER_02]: at least for us when we went through a
public audit, was humans were number one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Power was number two.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutrients was number three.
[SPEAKER_02]: So humans finding ways to you can reduce
humans by upping volume.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more I don't need to double the humans
I have employed.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I double the amount of volume I am
cultivating once we had proof of concept
[SPEAKER_02]: of how we cultivated in more of an
automated fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we could have doubled our cultivation
and probably only added one to two
[SPEAKER_02]: employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can fix the human scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can fix humans there in our costs for
cultivation power.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking at renewable energy like we
had a large greenhouse plant for solar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can start chewing that power away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Solar, batteries, putting up a solar
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Candescent has done a great job obviously
with putting up solar fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you're also using wind, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we use 100 percent wind power.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you have like a little wind turbine on
top of the.
[SPEAKER_02]: So everybody says that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like is it a distributed wind power or.
[SPEAKER_02]: Throughout the gorge in Oregon and
Washington there are massive wind farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we buy our power from the wind farm.
OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then obviously nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nutrient and nutrients the big one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for when I left the company that was
where we were just getting into like being
[SPEAKER_02]: able to dial down on how do we solve this
problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Buying nutrients in a bottle.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got vehicles on the road that are
having to deliver it which is cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got 90 percent of it which is water
which is cost a lot of marketing cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: The waste the recycling of the bottles all
those pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell you right now at five thousand
square feet of flowering canopy space if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're doing it efficiently it is time to
get rid of bottled nutrients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we have dry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So but when you hadn't scaled up like what
were the brands you were like what brands
[SPEAKER_03]: do you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were using.
[SPEAKER_02]: Gosh I got to think through it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Botanica.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dragonfly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some natural back one is that we
were putting in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some sea green that we were using.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you'd go to concentrate some by
bulk like humic acids humic and fulvic
[SPEAKER_02]: acids stuff like that kind of a
combination of all those pieces.
[SPEAKER_02]: The salt base that we were using was the
the A and B base of botanica.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was our only salt.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: So basically your soil alone was not.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're actually adding basically the A and
B.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were adding the A and B and then we
were adding biologicals and beneficials
[SPEAKER_02]: and microbes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were adding microbial life to the soil
along with fungi so that we had a good
[SPEAKER_02]: living.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had we had good life in our soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our microbial life was in the neighborhood
of 400.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget the measurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's that's going to be outside my
education.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I guess my.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the the the A and the B weren't like
killing the.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: No because if you actually look into
botanica and what they're using on the
[SPEAKER_02]: salt side for A and B it's it's it's a
very small amount of mineral salt that
[SPEAKER_02]: they use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was a really big question for us
like well is it really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that's what you hear.
[SPEAKER_02]: But was it true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we added beneficials we would test
it we would test our microbial life from
[SPEAKER_02]: veg all the way through bloom and we would
look at right after we fed two days after
[SPEAKER_02]: we fed when we were when we were if we
were running just a cycle with straight
[SPEAKER_02]: water and no food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like what what were those microbial life
levels were they diminishing were they
[SPEAKER_02]: increasing were they staying the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we found that even right after we fed
we were not losing any microbial life and
[SPEAKER_02]: it would gain over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then because you have the soil I
assume what you're adding from an A and B
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective is super diluted.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like you're just adding a tiny bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plants are really efficient in the
methodology of cultivation that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: using where we're growing in a vertical
stack and we're sharing an environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're tooling up LED light and bringing up
CO2 levels and bringing up feed levels and
[SPEAKER_02]: then monitoring actual runoff of feed in
the soil so that we aren't just throwing
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients down the drain.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could get really precise with how much
each cultivar wanted to consume and it got
[SPEAKER_02]: really interesting because you could put
for example we had rooms where we'd have
[SPEAKER_02]: up to six strains in one cultivation room
and you would see things like the flave
[SPEAKER_02]: you would test it in week three of flower
and it would be at thirty five parts per
[SPEAKER_02]: million of phosphorus and maybe a five
percent difference between the top and
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom of the plant and then you would in
the same room at the same time test the
[SPEAKER_02]: pineapple Kush and it would be at three
hundred parts per million of phosphorus
[SPEAKER_02]: with a 10 percent difference between top
and bottom.
[SPEAKER_02]: So looking at the mobility of the nutrient
and that cultivar you learn that I need to
[SPEAKER_02]: give flave way more phosphorus at week
three but we don't need to put as much
[SPEAKER_02]: phosphorus fin over here and you can
really get finite with your nutrient input
[SPEAKER_02]: and those cost savings get really big over
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right so all right so and then are you
making like teas or anything like that or?
[SPEAKER_02]: When I was leaving we were just moving
down the path of wanting to go into a
[SPEAKER_02]: compost tea but you know it was um being a
coming from the base of being a grower
[SPEAKER_02]: it's always really fun to like throw all
this cool stuff at the plants and watch it
[SPEAKER_02]: happen when really it it was time to be
really methodical so let's take away just
[SPEAKER_02]: this one piece and watch let's add just
this one piece let's test everything and
[SPEAKER_02]: find out so that we could be really
scientific in in our movements and ensure
[SPEAKER_02]: that we weren't hey with did compost tea
plus we're testing for these nutrient
[SPEAKER_02]: levels and we're changing our nutrient
water levels on a regular basis I've lost
[SPEAKER_02]: track of what's affecting what now I'm
just wasting money on labor and time and
[SPEAKER_02]: testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we had just started to get ready to
make compost teas and go down that path
[SPEAKER_00]: when I left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right because there are farms and this is
the direction we wanted to go and I've
[SPEAKER_02]: I've since uh looked at other farms met
with other farms there are farms out there
[SPEAKER_02]: who are using bed cultivation they're
cultivating in beds inside they're
[SPEAKER_02]: rotating their soil they're using a
hundred percent organic input and they're
[SPEAKER_02]: doing it under high intensity led light
which is hard to do because too much light
[SPEAKER_02]: not enough nutrient if the plant even if
you have enough nutrient but the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't capable of uptaking said nutrient
which is always harder with an organic
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrient you're never going to succeed so
just saying hey we're going to recycle our
[SPEAKER_02]: soil and we're going to use all organic
nutrients and we're going to grow under
[SPEAKER_02]: led in a tight proximity that that's not
as easy as it sounds right and a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: trial and error and then you were also
saying before that living what was the
[SPEAKER_02]: living soil comment living soil so there's
a really big you know there's a lot of and
[SPEAKER_02]: it's just kind of nomenclature we use
right we use living soil we use no till
[SPEAKER_02]: that you know it's it's kind of the
catchphrases of the day for cultivators
[SPEAKER_02]: living soil no till soil there their
cultivation catchphrases of the day right
[SPEAKER_02]: the last year or two it's been a really
big catchphrase for we're going to do
[SPEAKER_02]: living soil or we do no till um korean
natural farming is another one right
[SPEAKER_02]: they're really popular and they're popular
methodologies but we sometimes as
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators just trying to get our point
across we'll use that terminology
[SPEAKER_02]: inappropriately and so to say that we're
using a no till indoor maybe you really
[SPEAKER_02]: are doing that but there are a lot of
methods to having a cover crop and a
[SPEAKER_02]: living true living soil which the soil is
not alive it's the life inside the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: but we all know that to have a to truly be
using a no till methodology indoor is
[SPEAKER_02]: extremely difficult to do that efficiently
and that begs the question what efficiency
[SPEAKER_02]: are you trying to accomplish because if
the only thing you're trying to accomplish
[SPEAKER_02]: is say that i use a no till and plant
cover crops indoor well then
[SPEAKER_02]: congratulations like you've accomplished
it but if you're looking at it from the
[SPEAKER_02]: bottom line or mathematically or if you're
looking at it from a sustainability
[SPEAKER_02]: whether it's financial corporate or
environmental sustainability you have to
[SPEAKER_02]: look at it from the point of why am i
doing this am i doing it so i don't have
[SPEAKER_02]: to spend more money on soil because i can
continually reuse it am i doing it because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's better on the environment i am not
flush ing salts down a city sewer system
[SPEAKER_02]: because i grow in an industrial section in
the middle of LA did i build a bioswale
[SPEAKER_02]: out back that will then in ag land be able
to put native plants and they will burn
[SPEAKER_02]: off whatever nutrient organic or
non-organic that goes in all these factors
[SPEAKER_02]: play in what is the purpose and if the
purpose should always be sustainability
[SPEAKER_02]: and sustainability financially and
sustainability environmentally because at
[SPEAKER_02]: the end of the day if you can't keep the
lights on you're not making money nobody's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to hear a damn word you have to say
about saving the planet right okay but so
[SPEAKER_03]: so what i'm hearing is that you're saying
it will cost more to produce in a living
[SPEAKER_03]: soil indoor we're talking about so the way
you'd have to say is yeah but that's my
[SPEAKER_03]: number one priority i'm willing to pay a
little more maybe the market could like
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe there's a branding opportunity where
the market appreciates indoor cultivators
[SPEAKER_03]: who are at least trying to be as
environmentally as friendly as possible so
[SPEAKER_02]: good pullback the actual thing that i'm
trying to say or i've always been trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to say is that that's the myth it's
actually more sustainable and more
[SPEAKER_02]: efficient it is cheaper to cultivate
indoor environmentally sustainably than it
[SPEAKER_02]: is to not to use salt-based nutrients in
smart pots with soil that you throw away
[SPEAKER_02]: every time compared to figuring out how to
use organic inputs that take water only on
[SPEAKER_02]: ef you land in a hundred percent
carbon-neutral sustainable cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: methodology it is less expensive to do
that and you will create a better product
[SPEAKER_03]: for the end user but you're when you left
you guys are using you're not living soil
[SPEAKER_02]: you're adding salts we were because we
were moving because we had changed so many
[SPEAKER_02]: things on an environment to just figure
out how to do it that when i left we were
[SPEAKER_02]: still using that but we were moving down
the path to get rid of it which is why i
[SPEAKER_02]: say we were at 189 a pound when we went
through a public audit i have one hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: percent confidence that had i have stayed
with the company and we implemented the
[SPEAKER_02]: pieces that we had looked at we could have
gotten below seventy five and part of that
[SPEAKER_03]: is adding like a living soil game plan
getting rid of all those bottled so i
[SPEAKER_03]: totally misunderstood what you're saying i
thought you were saying that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: impossible with living soil to reduce the
cost lower than other not at all what i
[SPEAKER_02]: was saying is using a regenerative soil
methodology in door under led light
[SPEAKER_02]: requires a lot of different input it is
not the same as growing under a gavita
[SPEAKER_02]: using advanced nutrients they are one
hundred percent different methodologies
[SPEAKER_02]: and you have to get really comfortable
being uncomfortable changing that and
[SPEAKER_02]: finding your way through it and believe me
we fell on our face figuring out our
[SPEAKER_03]: pieces of it and so so basically as you
launch the new company your grow
[SPEAKER_03]: operations will be soil no salts we will
be focused on a large scale with an ethos
[SPEAKER_02]: around sustainability cool one hundred
percent that doesn't mean that the
[SPEAKER_02]: companies we take have to be there when we
get there they just have to be open to
[SPEAKER_03]: changing to get that right when you're
talking about like what you liked about
[SPEAKER_03]: being able to kind of like you know have
your a and b it seemed like you're saying
[SPEAKER_03]: with what you just left you could say
strain a has its own nutrient supply it's
[SPEAKER_03]: not it's not running the dosatron the
dosatron is not running the same stuff to
[SPEAKER_03]: all the different strains but you're going
to lose that when you move to living soil
[SPEAKER_03]: like full on regenerative soil because
you're not going to be adding that stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: so they're all going to have are you going
to are you going to amend your soil
[SPEAKER_03]: differently based on what strain you're
growing and well there's the amazing thing
[SPEAKER_02]: about plants is once you get into organic
inputs and regenerative soil the plants
[SPEAKER_03]: get the opportunity to take what they want
perfect okay all right so you're so while
[SPEAKER_03]: you like the fact that with the salts you
can dial things in and out you're excited
[SPEAKER_03]: to move to regenerative soil because you
don't need to do any of that right got it
[SPEAKER_03]: got it got it right where I am sir we're
not going to be on the same page you you you
