[SPEAKER_01]: For us, it's really focusing on how to get
the farmer the most money out of retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe direct to consumer, maybe give them
more shelf space, and work with them to
[SPEAKER_01]: have that velocity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also, there's a drought coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people feel it,
a lot of people are talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's maximizing that drought for the
farmer, because a lot of companies are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to try to buy out the farmer for
really low, and then just try to make a
[SPEAKER_01]: flip.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really kind of coaching with the
farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: To not underestimate the drought,
but just be ready to keep on having stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: flow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depths are coming, and there's new cycles
coming through, but there's going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: real drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for us, it's us being the best partner
we can be to our farmers to help pass,
[SPEAKER_01]: not only survive this, but thrive through
this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, just talking about the drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just went through the last few months
where we've been hearing that our harvest
[SPEAKER_02]: date on our packaging, our product's not
worth as much at the retail, and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting beat down on all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know it all comes down to the
curing, how you're packaging your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we've written farmers, I'm going out
there, we're helping consult them all the
[SPEAKER_02]: way through the harvest and into curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know the product's good when it's
coming back.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this harvest date is another marketing
ploy to drop the dollar.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's really what it is if you
have good, if it's decent product.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're hearing that now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he brings up a good point with the
drought coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: So harvest date in the next 30 days isn't
going to mean anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be what product's available,
and is it any good?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the price point on our market is going
to be coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the regulated market is going to be
coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like he said, depths are going to be
coming in the 1st of June.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're going to have a good inventory.
[SPEAKER_02]: But between the middle of June and in the
next few weeks coming from here,
[SPEAKER_02]: like let's say the next two or three
weeks, we're going to start seeing a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: more retail realizing that they don't care
about harvest date.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just need something to put in the
shelf on the floor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you hit that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just want to say one more thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Together, we're all talking about
community and working together and growing
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't, as a seed of soil came to life
in 2014.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soil was much, much forever before.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we had all this community.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I visualize, and I've seen it
happen in the last two years in our market
[SPEAKER_02]: with the small farmers, small
manufacturers, people that were going,
[SPEAKER_02]: is all of a sudden, all the guys that
loved each other, we used to come to these
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers' market, hug each other.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden, we flipped a script and
we're into compete mode.
[SPEAKER_02]: We wanted to compete with one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we broke apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like we were too afraid of you
finding out what we're going to do next,
[SPEAKER_02]: our next move, our next cultivator,
who's broken in our stuff, or are we going
[SPEAKER_02]: to do pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was like this.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of a sudden, nobody wanted to give up
any intellectual property when before that
[SPEAKER_02]: message never came about before because we
were all growing together as a community
[SPEAKER_02]: and rising together and above.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I'm seeing right now since the
last year and the last few months is we're
[SPEAKER_02]: finally realizing as smaller people and as
smaller cultivators that we were so good
[SPEAKER_02]: together and our community was so strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we were out of fear of somebody taking
over what we thought we were going to lose
[SPEAKER_02]: everything and a lot of us have,
that we broke apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we're finding out now is that
coming together and supporting each other,
[SPEAKER_02]: we are a monster.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We created this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the legs in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we are the ones that are sought after.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need us.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't need them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once we become the intimidator instead
of being intimidated and we get that
[SPEAKER_02]: mindset in our head, we're going to go a
long way as a team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm so inspired right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to say thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you guys are licensed farmers
or hoping to be licensed farmers or
[SPEAKER_00]: licensed manufacturers or hoping to be
licensed manufacturers or other
[SPEAKER_00]: distributors, who want to work with
distributors, please introduce yourself to
[SPEAKER_00]: these folks because this is kind of where
it's at.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is sort of the pinnacle of where some
of these transactions are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all want to have amazing transactions
and tons of them and be super successful
[SPEAKER_00]: together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so thank you, each of you,
for your efforts in making that happen for
[SPEAKER_00]: our community.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in California, small farmer,
heritage farmers, sun growers,
[SPEAKER_00]: all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you guys all for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thrive Society, Madrone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's seed to soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say soil king, but for the
distribution, seed to soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have somebody here from
Bloomfield.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it's a local Nevada City
distributor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Clear Lake Growers or Gold Country
Growers is another distributor that is
[SPEAKER_00]: providing services to the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: LBS is another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distributors are out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So farmers, please, it's on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go introduce yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go see what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can help you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really a value add to our
community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
Thank you.
