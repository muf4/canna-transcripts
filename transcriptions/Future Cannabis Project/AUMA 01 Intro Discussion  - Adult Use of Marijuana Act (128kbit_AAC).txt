[SPEAKER_04]: We have, who I've been introduced to just
recently, three very active voices in the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am, Susan explained, a contributing
writer for Entrepreneur Magazine and
[SPEAKER_04]: Huffington Post.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you'll begin to see that the
mainstream media and journalists like I
[SPEAKER_04]: have gone in and began to take an interest
in reporting on hemp and cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_04]: to the mainstream audience, particularly
from a technology and small business
[SPEAKER_04]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: I primarily cover emerging technologies
and so the cannabis industry is of course
[SPEAKER_04]: full of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was selected to moderate this panel
because I come from a unique perspective
[SPEAKER_04]: being newer to the industry and having an
unbiased opinion on Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's interesting because I've been
here, you know, just this is the second
[SPEAKER_04]: day now and I'll go and I'll talk to a
group of folks who were, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: Pro 64 and I'll think to myself,
well, that makes a whole lot of sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, as a journalist, I'm supposed to
remain objective and then I'll talk to
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody from No.
[SPEAKER_04]: 164 about what their concerns are as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think, oh yeah, this
proposition doesn't live up to what it's
[SPEAKER_04]: saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I go back and forth and I think one of,
you know, one of the disciplines that
[SPEAKER_04]: makes writing unique in this space is that
you have to be objective.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I would like to invite everybody in
the audience as we kind of go through what
[SPEAKER_04]: this proposition means for California,
look at it from an objective perspective
[SPEAKER_04]: and see if we can take different parts
from the conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing that we're gonna do is kind
of a different format for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're gonna begin with a brief kind of
three minute introductions, but then we
[SPEAKER_04]: wanna get into, it's a lot, like Betty was
just saying too, we really do envision
[SPEAKER_04]: that this is going to happen at some
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's project out 10 years from now,
what does that ideal solution look like?
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's, we've heard a lot about the
propositions themselves, some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: implications.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start from that arena and begin to
have that conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: To do that, we'll go through what
California Normal is suggesting as some of
[SPEAKER_04]: their recommendations, right, with the
existing proposition, and we'll get into
[SPEAKER_04]: some dialogue on that, then we'll open it
up for Q&A.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'd like to introduce our panelists
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: It seems like many of them are already
well known in the industry, but we have
[SPEAKER_04]: Nathaniel Bradley here, the executive
director of the California Campus Industry
[SPEAKER_04]: Association, Hezekiah Allen, executive
director of the California Growers
[SPEAKER_04]: Association, and Amanda Ryman,
manager of Marijuana Law and Policy,
[SPEAKER_04]: at the Drug Policy Alliance, no clapping,
no clapping till the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we're gonna do throughout this,
particularly if the Q&A gets out of hand,
[SPEAKER_04]: is I like to, because I'm a social media
influencer, I like to follow tweets,
[SPEAKER_04]: right, so I've collected some good ones
that ask questions regarding the Prop 64,
[SPEAKER_04]: but one of the local news reporters in San
Francisco did an online Twitter poll.
[SPEAKER_04]: Jenna Katsomaya, she's the news reporter
for KTVU TV, and simply, should California
[SPEAKER_04]: voters approve Prop 64 hashtag,
and make recreational marijuana use legal
[SPEAKER_04]: in California?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the tweet closes in the next five
hours, it has 1,200 votes, and what it's
[SPEAKER_04]: tracking is 71% yes, 18% no, and 11% are
unsure.
[SPEAKER_04]: On a kind of national level, you have
California Counts recently published their
[SPEAKER_04]: forecast at 71% yes, 26% no, 3% undecided,
USC, the LA Times, it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: lower, it's 58% yes, 34% no, and 8%
undecided.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's kind of what the landscape looks
like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll have each of you go ahead and begin
with an introduction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name's Nate Bradley, I'm the executive
director of the California Cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before that, I, well, I'll give you a
little background on us real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work on numerous issues for the
industry in California state capital,
[SPEAKER_02]: not only do we work on legislative issues,
policy issues, we also act as sort of a
[SPEAKER_02]: resource to the government as well on data
for the industry, things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also work to actively educate the
industry itself so they can understand
[SPEAKER_02]: what's gonna be going on, what's gonna be
happening next down the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Before that, I worked in law enforcement
for about six and a half years.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I got laid off in 2009 is when I
became a patient, got me off about nine
[SPEAKER_02]: prescription pills a day.
[SPEAKER_02]: That got me into activism.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was a right wing homeschooled pastor's
kid.
[SPEAKER_02]: My parents were right wing activists
growing up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from pro-life issues to adoption issues
to some guy made the mistake of selling my
[SPEAKER_02]: mom's friend a sewing machine once that
didn't give her the money back when it
[SPEAKER_02]: broke.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my mom organized a two week protest of
this guy's store at which time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were activists, we were always
getting involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: I saw my dad take a cannon mace to the
face at one point during his time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was always raised up where you see
an injustice, you speak out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started by organizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: My first group was the Yuba County
Grower's Association in 2011.
[SPEAKER_02]: That went on for a year.
[SPEAKER_02]: After that, I had an attorney call me that
I worked with and basically said,
[SPEAKER_02]: Nate, we kind of need what you did in Yuba
County at the state level.
[SPEAKER_02]: You go out with clients in Tracy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got clients in Merced, clients
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we need?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you need a trade association.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's literally an empty parking space
for a trade group with the state capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, well, what do we call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, let's call it California Canada's
Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: He goes, that sounds good.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, I'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The next day I Google searched,
how do you start a trade association?
[SPEAKER_02]: Three and a half years later, here I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we now work now on that level.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have endorsed Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were one of the first industry groups
to come out and endorse it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Largely because there was policy issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many members are in the association?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got 215.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do this pain businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were one of the first groups to endorse
Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey, folks.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Ezekiah Allen.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the executive director of the
California Growers Association,
[SPEAKER_03]: quite similar to the California Cannabis
Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are a public policy outfit working
primarily in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was born and raised in southern Humboldt
County, left-wing extremist, homeschooled,
[SPEAKER_03]: radical.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nate and I actually have more in common,
same sense of justice.
[SPEAKER_03]: When I used to be a rapper in my college
years, my MC name, in fact, was Justice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel very firmly about the need to read.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that you too?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dare you to find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: California Growers Association has grown
quite rapidly.
[SPEAKER_03]: I took the helm in summer of 2014,
about two years ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had about 60 members at the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have about 750 members now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are brought together by a recognition
that California is a very unique cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our metric of success will be the number
of business licenses issued.
[SPEAKER_03]: The more independently owned businesses
there are, the more criminals we have
[SPEAKER_03]: turned into business owners.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our fundamental work is to remove that
veil of criminality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just because I grew up a grower,
child of grower, it does not make me any
[SPEAKER_03]: less than anyone else.
[SPEAKER_03]: I certainly grew up feeling that it did.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up ashamed, afraid, lying,
and feeling very inferior.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that our community and a lot of us
around the state feel those things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our work is really focused on ensuring
that California has the most opportunity
[SPEAKER_03]: possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: We come at this from a very small business
perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our work is definitely slanted toward the
cottage, subsistence, micro enterprise,
[SPEAKER_03]: really focused on ensuring that small
businesses and the most small businesses
[SPEAKER_03]: possible have the opportunity to
participate.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is critical because California has
50,000 or more small businesses.
[SPEAKER_03]: We exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're real humans, and we need to take
that into account as we move forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our organization is neutral with concerns.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our membership is pretty evenly divided on
the question of Prop 64, and what I'm here
[SPEAKER_03]: to tell you today is that we are
maintaining our neutrality because
[SPEAKER_03]: Wednesday, November 9th, we still need
each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: We cannot afford to squander the goodwill
and good faith that we have built over the
[SPEAKER_03]: last several years on this election.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vote your heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: Vote your conscience.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love you.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate you, and I will be grateful
when we wake up Wednesday morning and get
[SPEAKER_03]: back to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ryan, you are next.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please state your YouTube rapper name.
[SPEAKER_00]: White Lightning.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my last name is Ryman, so I guess my
ancestors were rappers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just did not inherit the talent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my name is Amanda Ryman.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the manager of Marijuana Law and
Policy for the Drug Policy Alliance,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we are one of the major supporters of
Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work in our Oakland office, but we're a
national organization, so we're based in
[SPEAKER_00]: New York City.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have offices in Washington,
D.C., New Jersey, Colorado, New Mexico,
[SPEAKER_00]: and two in California, one down in
Southern California, and our Office of
[SPEAKER_00]: Legal Affairs up in Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our organization has a platform of three
issues, one being mass incarceration,
[SPEAKER_00]: so impacting sentencing reform,
the number of people that go to jail,
[SPEAKER_00]: why they go to jail, how long they're in
jail.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second is harm reduction, so overdose
prevention, which is especially salient
[SPEAKER_00]: today with the amount of overdose we're
seeing on prescription opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then thirdly is cannabis reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's one of the three issues we work
on, but it's not our only issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what we see weaving its way through
all three of those areas are issues
[SPEAKER_00]: related to racial and social justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we look at legalization in
California, we're looking at it through
[SPEAKER_00]: the lens of people getting in trouble for
marijuana activity, wanting to prevent
[SPEAKER_00]: that from happening, but also wanting to
prevent the ramifications of having a
[SPEAKER_00]: criminal record as it pertains to
opportunities down the line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recognize that we have had a gray area
industry in California for two decades,
[SPEAKER_00]: and an illicit industry for many,
many, many, many, many decades besides
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a situation where we're
transitioning people from illicit to legal
[SPEAKER_00]: behavior, and we have to ensure that
people that have had criminal histories,
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have had involvement with the
criminal justice system are not prevented
[SPEAKER_00]: from taking advantage of this new
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we talk about what we would
like to see in the future, we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: ensure that the opportunity that's
provided by Prop 64 by allowing people
[SPEAKER_00]: with drug felonies to be in the industry
and to get licenses in the industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: and for people's records to get expunged,
that this happens, and that we hold the
[SPEAKER_00]: state accountable for making sure that
this industry does not look like every
[SPEAKER_00]: other industry in America, primarily run
by, no offense, white men.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting into this industry in the last
couple weeks, I've never, if you remove
[SPEAKER_04]: some of the outliners, the ones that are,
you know, yeah, we want to pass
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization no matter what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the other end, if you eliminate
some that are vehemently just against it,
[SPEAKER_04]: no matter what, you really get in the
middle that we're all kind of marching
[SPEAKER_04]: right towards this same, okay,
yes, we'd really like to see it legalized.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I also haven't met anybody that says
that this Prop 64 is written perfectly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I understand, I haven't seen
somebody that's told me that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what we want to do is take a look at,
well, then if we remove that, again,
[SPEAKER_04]: what would this industry look like in its
most prosperous kind of condition 10 years
[SPEAKER_04]: from now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, speaking to a lot of people,
I came across a set of recommendations
[SPEAKER_04]: from California Normal.
[SPEAKER_04]: The position of this organization is
neutral, but the position of Normal at a
[SPEAKER_04]: federal level, I understand, is for Prop
64.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think this is a good, and I in no
way endorse these, they're just a set of
[SPEAKER_04]: questions I've found to be kind of
pertinent.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we'll go through each one of them and
begin those as talking points,
[SPEAKER_04]: because in this, you know, in this kind of
2016 view of the California cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: economy, how do these considerations play?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the first of their 10 is
decriminalization, decriminalized
[SPEAKER_04]: possession of more than one ounce of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: So where are we at?
[SPEAKER_04]: I know you've got two ounces on you,
so I don't know if we should even begin
[SPEAKER_04]: with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why don't we go ahead, Amanda?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I would say that one of the
things we want to continue to do is push
[SPEAKER_00]: back on the criminal penalties for
cannabis activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to be inflated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're way inflated now because of fears
and misperceptions about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to dial that back as much as
the public is willing to go at this point,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is actually quite a bit given where
we are now versus where we were even five
[SPEAKER_00]: years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think we need to continue to look at
who gets in trouble for cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we need to continue to push back even
further.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the key is that, as a lot of you
probably know working in this industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: when people make up their minds based on
emotion, it's really hard to argue with
[SPEAKER_00]: them that their emotion is wrong and that
their feeling is wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw this with medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of what turned people's perceptions
around on medical cannabis was personal
[SPEAKER_00]: experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was seeing a family member use it or
using it themselves or someone they
[SPEAKER_00]: admired was using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then the belief of punishment
associated with that behavior started to
[SPEAKER_00]: dissipate because their feelings about it
started to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once cannabis is more out in the open,
once it becomes more normalized,
[SPEAKER_00]: the public's fear of six plants versus 10
plants or one ounce versus four ounces is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to start to seem pretty arbitrary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, it's an inflated fear that we
have to deal with, but it's more not
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we have to accept.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is one ounce, then, a good starting point?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where the public is at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's interesting because the public
doesn't, again, because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: reactionary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll give an example from when we started
polling on this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we asked the public if they would be
OK with someone having eight ounces or if
[SPEAKER_00]: they would be OK with someone having one
pound.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were kind of like, how do you feel
about this amount?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you feel about this amount?
[SPEAKER_00]: More people were OK with a pound than
eight ounces because one is less than
[SPEAKER_00]: eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it didn't make sense, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It didn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to the public, they're reacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, oh, I want them to have one
marijuana, not eight marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're getting from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, the executive director of DPA,
who you all heard yesterday, Ethan
[SPEAKER_00]: Nadelman, is very fond of saying
legalization is for people who love
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, hate marijuana, and don't give
a shit about marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we have to consider them because
it's not just people who love marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: that are voting on the initiative,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's people who have never used marijuana
or people who happen to have kids and are
[SPEAKER_00]: scared.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of the proposition.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, Nathan.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real quick, I'd just like to say,
most likely, we're going to say yes to
[SPEAKER_02]: that entire list.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are all good ideas.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'd like to- It's not so much,
are they good ideas?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, is there an ideal solution out
there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, the ideal solution is that
it's just treated like every other herb
[SPEAKER_02]: out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, sure, that's the ideal solution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, when was the last time law
enforcement had an opinion on a bill
[SPEAKER_02]: sponsored by the California Almond Farmers
Association?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a non-issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't think about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so sure, I think we do want to go up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But from my perspective, honestly,
legalizing one gram right off the bat is
[SPEAKER_02]: acceptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reality is, the second you even
legalize a gram, the protections you have
[SPEAKER_02]: from your odor, law enforcement can't get
in your car anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: I remember when I was working on Prop 19
in 2010, one of the narcs I worked with
[SPEAKER_02]: called me up and was just like- And they
used to whisper on the phone, because it
[SPEAKER_02]: was weird.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'd be like, all right, I support what
you're doing, but you're going to fuck it
[SPEAKER_02]: up for all of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because once we lose odor, we lose
everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we need to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: And taking away a tool they use to get
into our cars, to go after minorities,
[SPEAKER_02]: to go after people, is going to be key.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we can move on from there.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we have to start somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was the silver agreement here,
it looks like, that was the starting
[SPEAKER_04]: point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hezekiah?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, there's no limit on how many 12
facts you can buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: There shouldn't be a limit on how many
ounces you can buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their second consideration is,
of course, remove cannabis from the state
[SPEAKER_04]: list of controlled substances.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that an imperative?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But until it gets descheduled at the
federal level, anything done at the state
[SPEAKER_02]: level to remove it from the state's
controlled substances act will more likely
[SPEAKER_02]: be a, I'm trying to think of the word,
symbolic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Symbolic adjuster.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll briefly agree, though I'll take the
opportunity to caution against
[SPEAKER_03]: rescheduling.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's not go down in the controlled
substances list.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's deschedule, not reschedule.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amanda?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, DPA's position is the descheduling
of cannabis at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their third consideration is to forbid
local bans on deliveries of cannabis from
[SPEAKER_04]: licensed providers to qualified
individuals.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to clarify, we have that enabled
currently for medical marijuana users,
[SPEAKER_04]: where dispensaries either aren't brick and
mortar, or just prefer to have delivery in
[SPEAKER_04]: place.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this was left out of 64, Nate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what it is is locality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Localities have the ability to ban
cannabis activity from within their
[SPEAKER_00]: borders.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the right to ban commercial
medical cannabis activity, and if 64
[SPEAKER_00]: passes, they'll have the right to ban
commercial adult use activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we're thinking about are people that
live in those areas that want to order
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis via delivery from places and
surrounding cities and counties where it
[SPEAKER_00]: is allowed and have those deliveries made
into their county that's a dry county.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in reality, policing that is
difficult, especially if you have an
[SPEAKER_00]: unmarked vehicle because it's like trying
to police Uber or trying to police food
[SPEAKER_00]: deliveries.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reality is, is it's one more way
that we need to ensure that particularly
[SPEAKER_00]: patients have access even though
localities have that ability to ban.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Prop 64 does not allow localities to
ban the personal indoor cultivation of six
[SPEAKER_00]: plants for adults, and so that is one
point of access.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we really want to try to ensure that
given this local control framework that we
[SPEAKER_00]: still have as many ways for people who
live in those jurisdictions to have access
[SPEAKER_00]: to what they need.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anybody else have a different perspective
on that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Number four is increased tax breaks for
qualified medical marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you see that taking form?
[SPEAKER_04]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll say that there are really four policy
considerations that our membership has
[SPEAKER_03]: concerns with, and taxes are certainly one
of those policy considerations.
[SPEAKER_03]: The proposition as filed is largely a cut
and paste of two pieces of legislation
[SPEAKER_03]: that were introduced at the end of the
legislative session in 2015.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those bills were reintroduced in the
beginning of the 26th legislative session
[SPEAKER_03]: and through the course of about a dozen
legislative hearings, that policy evolved
[SPEAKER_03]: tremendously, including the specific
provision that you point to, which is at
[SPEAKER_03]: the time it was exemptions for low income
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we probably all agree that we
would go further and exempt patients
[SPEAKER_03]: entirely, but there is more that we can do
on tax policy, which is what we learned in
[SPEAKER_03]: the legislative deliberation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two key policy amendments that we were
successful in advocating for in the
[SPEAKER_03]: legislature that are not in Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_03]: First and foremost, removal of a leaf tax.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've said this a number of times to a lot
of you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not sure what leaf is.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been growing all my life,
and I still can't tell you what leaf is or
[SPEAKER_03]: what the value of leaf is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that water leaf?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that trim?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that shake?
[SPEAKER_03]: A flat rate value tax across the board for
products of that variable value is going
[SPEAKER_03]: to be very problematic.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were able to replace the leaf tax in
the legislation with a manufactured
[SPEAKER_03]: product tax.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't tax the product going into the
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tax the homogenous product coming out,
where you can actually establish that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Secondly, we were able to successfully
advocate for a tiered tax rate,
[SPEAKER_03]: where specialty producers, the smallest
producers, would be paying a lower rate
[SPEAKER_03]: and the largest producers would be paying
a higher rate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, you know what our bias is.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our bias is to as many small businesses as
possible.
[SPEAKER_03]: Creating a marketplace that provides a
level playing field through a progressive
[SPEAKER_03]: tax rate is very important to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is one of those places where I think
Prop 64 simply suffered from how quickly
[SPEAKER_03]: we moved.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't have the opportunity to do six
months of policy deliberation,
[SPEAKER_03]: but we certainly hope that everyone will
work together to ensure that those tax
[SPEAKER_03]: provisions are changed if Prop 64 is
successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone else have a different perspective?
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of the 10 recommendations, those were the
four that I found most interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: The rest of them can be found on the
website for California Normal.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to pull up and just get to before
we open it up to audience Q&A,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I know you're all eager for.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some quotes or tweets that I've
come across and ask your perspective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reuters recently reported that the Mexican
president, Enrique Pena, stated that if
[SPEAKER_04]: Prop 64 is passed, Mexico may follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can elaborate briefly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly why we're doing this in the
very first place.
[SPEAKER_02]: California leads the nation in a lot of
ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: You'll see it change in Mexico,
but you'll see it change in many of the
[SPEAKER_02]: other North American countries and South
American countries as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are the sixth largest economy in the
world, so we will set the stage for the
[SPEAKER_02]: rest of the world on how to do it and
hopefully how to do it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now playing a devil's advocate here,
and we'll keep this conversation going,
[SPEAKER_04]: just like Betty Yee just said,
opponents are going to be looking for
[SPEAKER_04]: missteps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we're talking about international
opponents too.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're being looked at under a global
microscope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't they become more severe and more at
risk for 64?
[SPEAKER_00]: We already are under a global microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: California, like you said, is the sixth
largest economy in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're innovators.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of stuff that happens in the world
happens here first.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think when we talk about the
international implications, what we're
[SPEAKER_00]: really talking about is pressure on the UN
treaty on drug abuse, signed back in the
[SPEAKER_00]: 1960s by a whole smattering of countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It said that no country on the list would
legalize any illegal drugs.
[SPEAKER_00]: For any reason except for medicine and
science, and if they did, they would have
[SPEAKER_00]: UN sanctions placed against them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The idea that marijuana isn't legal
anywhere in the world because everyone in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world hates marijuana is not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason marijuana is only legal in
Uruguay, which became the first country to
[SPEAKER_00]: challenge the treaty, is because they
don't want to be sanctioned by the UN.
[SPEAKER_00]: The United States is a bully, and I know
because DPA works with these countries
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally, and they do want to
change their drug laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the ones that withhold funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our National Institute on Drug Abuse funds
90% of the world's drug research.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of folks do not want to rock the
boat with us, and we're saying that if you
[SPEAKER_00]: legalize cannabis, we're not going to be
your friends anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it really is that silly and
juvenile.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uruguay became the first country to do it,
and despite what we said, and now it looks
[SPEAKER_00]: like Canada is going to move forward with
that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if California legalizes, what we're
going to have is a smattering of Latin
[SPEAKER_00]: American countries with economies that are
way smaller than ours who have experienced
[SPEAKER_00]: unbelievable damage and death at the hands
of the war on drugs that is now going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to go to the UN and say,
hey, the sixth largest economy in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world just legalized pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why can't we?
[SPEAKER_00]: And believe me, Mexico's thinking about
it, and they're not the only ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this has implications for California,
sure, but the implications for South
[SPEAKER_00]: America and other countries that have been
completely ravaged by the drug war,
[SPEAKER_00]: it becomes even more of a human rights
issue than it is here in the United States
[SPEAKER_00]: in some ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those countries
[SPEAKER_03]: have also been ravaged by economic
consolidation and the economic injustice
[SPEAKER_03]: of corporate focused globalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, we're not comparing Prop 64
to prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not go to jail or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in a gray area.
[SPEAKER_03]: California already has very progressive
policies on this subject matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been leading the way since 1996.
[SPEAKER_03]: The economic justice element of this
conversation is one that's easy to
[SPEAKER_03]: overlook, particularly in politics where
budgets make campaigns.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fact of the matter is that cannabis is
a very unique crop, and here in California
[SPEAKER_03]: we have a very unique community of farmers
that are producing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The social and economic and cultural
benefits derived from economically viable
[SPEAKER_03]: small scale family farms is a tremendous
bulwark against the injustices that some
[SPEAKER_03]: of these very same countries that we are
facing have dealt with.
[SPEAKER_03]: And preserving those values is very
important from our perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, the current regulatory
framework for medical is significantly
[SPEAKER_03]: more protective of those interests.
[SPEAKER_03]: Shifting gears though, I also want to say
that I didn't support Prop 19.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're neutral here, so we've made some
progress.
[SPEAKER_03]: They told us the same things.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys don't do it, it'll be the end
of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: The train will stop moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: The train didn't stop moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Two years later we saw two states.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen several states since.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen several countries.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not perceiving the urgency the same
way that some stakeholders are.
[SPEAKER_03]: This boat has left the station.
[SPEAKER_03]: Could we speed it up?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, but I've made a lot of mistakes
because I moved too quickly through
[SPEAKER_03]: complicated subject matter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just want to be sure that we
realize that public opinion is not going
[SPEAKER_03]: back on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not going to lose the ground that
we've won.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tide is going to continue to move
forward, and sometimes it's important to
[SPEAKER_03]: take care, to be mindful, and to be very
mindful of the nuances because this is not
[SPEAKER_03]: a simple question.
[SPEAKER_03]: There will be outcomes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Real people's lives will be impacted by
the different policy decisions we make.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't need to write 64 pages.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could have done it very, or 62.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could have done this with a lot less
words.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could have taken a more incremental
phased approach.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no reason we needed this to be the
domino that fell.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me get Nathan.
[SPEAKER_04]: You
[SPEAKER_04]: have nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's interesting actually, Hezekiah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great because one of the statements,
the LA Times editorial board said the
[SPEAKER_04]: reality is that California has already
essentially legalized marijuana,
[SPEAKER_04]: to your point, Nathan.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun talking point, but people still
go to jail.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we just had a raid in Yolo County
three days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: 20% of my board members have had their
doors kicked in over the last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fun talking point to say,
oh, it's pretty much legal now,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's just not true.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are still people in jail for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cops still use the odor of it to get into
people's cars.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still harassing people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Black people and brown people are still
being harassed on a daily basis over the
[SPEAKER_02]: smell, so it's not fair just to say that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just politely have to disagree.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prop 64 was also the only initiative that
had small business protections cooked into
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unlike all the other, I would quote,
more activist initiatives, or people would
[SPEAKER_02]: say well-written initiatives, which were
just an open market that had no
[SPEAKER_02]: protections.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it do everything people want?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, but I think what it doesn't do is
create, for example, a $500,000 licensing
[SPEAKER_02]: fee, which would kill small business,
which they've done in East Coast,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is a way, if you want to allow
corporations, that's what you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what you're saying is that it does
effectively legalize, not what is
[SPEAKER_04]: essentially legalization, which is what
they're saying here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any other?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, just on the marijuana is already
legal in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'll just say, for a white lady
living in Oakland, marijuana pretty much
[SPEAKER_00]: is legal in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for people of color living even in
progressive places like Oakland,
[SPEAKER_00]: where African Americans make up 25% of our
population, but 77% of those that get
[SPEAKER_00]: citations for cannabis, marijuana is
definitely not legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not legal for the folks who have
their kids taken away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not legal for the folks who are
losing their jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is very real.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to give you some information,
in the past 10 years, okay, this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: past decade in California, we've seen
almost 500,000 felony arrests for
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, a felony is not just you go to jail
and pay your time and get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: A felony is every job you apply for,
every bank loan, every housing
[SPEAKER_00]: application, you have to talk about that
felony.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're at risk of not getting that
benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that impacts not just you,
but your kids and your communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, I would never say that there's
not gonna be growing pains or that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: not gonna have to be really, really
cognizant and aware of how these policies
[SPEAKER_00]: land at the end of the day, because that's
why the work continues and even ramps up
[SPEAKER_00]: on November 9th, because now we have to
create the kind of industry that we want
[SPEAKER_00]: to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, we can't wait,
because every day people are getting in
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every day someone else is losing the
opportunity to move forward with their
[SPEAKER_00]: life.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, we did make marijuana from a
misdemeanor to an infraction in 2011.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the misdemeanors plummeted among
adults.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know where that left us?
[SPEAKER_00]: With our misdemeanors in California,
two thirds of them being made up by
[SPEAKER_00]: minors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are kids 18, under 18,
that are getting misdemeanor records
[SPEAKER_00]: before they're even out of high school.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prop 64 eliminates all jail time for
minors, for marijuana activities,
[SPEAKER_00]: and instead replaces it with counseling,
drug education, and then destroys those
[SPEAKER_00]: records at age 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are benefits that we're gonna see
November 9th at 1201 a.m., and then we're
[SPEAKER_00]: all gonna get to work so that we can
ensure that the small businesses do have a
[SPEAKER_00]: leg up and that we take this culture that
we've spent so long cultivating and bring
[SPEAKER_00]: it to the world rather than let the world
change who we are, which I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just to speak briefly to the last decade
of arrests, there really is a story that's
[SPEAKER_03]: obviously being investigated by that
statistic, which is the impact of the
[SPEAKER_03]: policy change in 2010-11.
[SPEAKER_03]: We went from one of the more atrocious
arrest rates in the nation at upwards of
[SPEAKER_03]: 80 to 100,000 arrests a year to 20,000 or
less for every year since.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is part of why we don't feel the
urgency, because we have seen a comparable
[SPEAKER_03]: rate in the reduction of arrests that the
states have legalized have.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a good case study for what
happens when a state that has our specific
[SPEAKER_03]: policy regime legalizes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also don't have a good case study for
another state that has the community of
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're not confident that as written,
the marketplace will provide enough
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity for drug dealers like me to
become small business owners, and if we
[SPEAKER_03]: don't address that fundamental injustice,
we probably missed the point.
[SPEAKER_03]: The bottom line here, of course,
is that we are gonna keep working at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a done deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: What frustrates me is that we did it wrong
in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: We missed the point in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: We could have done better if we would have
taken a little bit longer to really
[SPEAKER_03]: articulate our outcomes, and ultimately,
unfortunately, if campaign donors weren't
[SPEAKER_03]: making policy decisions.
We could have done better if we would have
taken a little bit longer to really
articulate our outcomes.
