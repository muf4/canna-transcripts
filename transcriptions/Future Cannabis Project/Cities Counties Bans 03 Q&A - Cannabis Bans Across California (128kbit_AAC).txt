[SPEAKER_04]: Susan, you want to take over with some
questions?
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, my name is Paul Bregman.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a physician in Colorado, consultant
for medicine women.
[SPEAKER_05]: My question is, as you develop policy,
I think it's important to think about
[SPEAKER_05]: education, mandating education for the
blood tenders and also the pharmacies,
[SPEAKER_05]: the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'd just like to get your impression
about that because I think that would go a
[SPEAKER_05]: long way to furthering the cannabis cause
in the communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: I absolutely agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think one of the positive things about
regulating is the opportunity to do
[SPEAKER_03]: education, both with the growers,
with the retail and with consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so here in Long Beach, what we're
doing is we're making sure that these jobs
[SPEAKER_03]: are also good jobs and we're working with
UFCW to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, I think comes a level of
professionalism where we can say,
[SPEAKER_03]: here's an opportunity to go through some
training, some professional development
[SPEAKER_03]: with the doctors, with the growers,
again with retail, that this is the
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunity about having it be public
because we get to talk publicly about not
[SPEAKER_03]: only from a professional point,
but from a consumer point.
[SPEAKER_08]: For many years, I volunteered at LAPD.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was on the board of directors of several
non-profits.
[SPEAKER_08]: And one day they came to us with a
proposal.
[SPEAKER_08]: They wanted us to buy them equipment to
bust the cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I voiced my strong opposition and we had a
long debate about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I said, you know, it's legal now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they said, well, it's legal to sell,
but it's illegal to grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my response was, okay, you bust the
local growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now the drug cartels are going to come in
and they're going to take up the market
[SPEAKER_08]: share.
[SPEAKER_08]: The demand isn't going to go away.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as you know, Councilman Koretz,
we have overcrowded prisons.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have people going in for violent
offenses and they're getting out early
[SPEAKER_08]: because our prisons are overcrowded.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now what they seem to be doing is that
they're following these growers on the way
[SPEAKER_08]: to the dispensaries and busting them for
possession.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they get a felony record for something
that shouldn't be a felony.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm wondering how we can work with our
local law enforcement and kind of just
[SPEAKER_08]: curb this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, these people are coming to me
because they have mold, fungus,
[SPEAKER_08]: yeast, algae.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and I'm trying to help them make
a pharmaceutical product, but they're
[SPEAKER_08]: scared to come out with what they're doing
and they're scared to ask for help.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I think it's difficult in Los
Angeles because we have laws on the books
[SPEAKER_09]: right now that make it illegal.
[SPEAKER_09]: So it's difficult as a council that hasn't
come up with any consensus on how to
[SPEAKER_09]: change it to say, hey, stop enforcing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, if it was my call personally,
we would do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'm one council member and Los
Angeles, one council member really can't
[SPEAKER_09]: do anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: It has to be a majority of the council.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I just don't think we're there yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think our only real step is to try and
do this as quickly as we can and come up
[SPEAKER_09]: with a process whereby it's legal to grow
within the city and it's legal to
[SPEAKER_09]: transport within the city.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have some control over how it's
grown so we don't have a lot of pesticide
[SPEAKER_09]: use and all the right steps and then just
do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think in between, I'm not sure I have
any other good advice other than don't get
[SPEAKER_09]: caught.
Be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ordinance that we gave the city in Los
Angeles includes manufacturers,
[SPEAKER_01]: standalone cultivation, edible makers
because we want to be included in the
[SPEAKER_01]: umbrella that MRSA created.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want those cultivators that have been
and edible makers and manufacturers that
[SPEAKER_01]: are illegally producing right now just
because the way the law is set up,
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to step up to a permit so that
they don't get busted.
[SPEAKER_01]: So hopefully they'll pay attention and
we'll do an ordinance that does all that
[SPEAKER_01]: for everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, my name is Laura Claver and I'm an
attorney.
[SPEAKER_02]: My question is, especially to Mr. Taylor
from the county of Yolo, are you aware of
[SPEAKER_02]: the new case that just came down?
[SPEAKER_02]: It came down August 16th, 2016 on the case
of US Assistant McIntosh where the
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Justice is being prohibited
from prosecuting entities, cultivators,
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries, and people who transport as
long as they're doing it within the legal
[SPEAKER_02]: permits and legally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's tied to an appropriations bill by
Congress that is supposed to end September
[SPEAKER_02]: 30th, 2016, but there's some changes
taking place that are gonna put a stop to
[SPEAKER_02]: some of those rates.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not aware of that case, but I'm
excited to hear about it and the challenge
[SPEAKER_06]: in this case and I think many others,
the example that I'm talking about,
[SPEAKER_06]: is that there's no charge filed,
there's no court proceeding, there's no
[SPEAKER_06]: due process, and the property of the
farmer was confiscated.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it really is something.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you all have suggestions about how to
deal with this kind of, it seems like a
[SPEAKER_06]: rogue law enforcement activity to me until
I hear something more, that's the way I'm
[SPEAKER_06]: thinking about it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So even what you're talking about,
we're not even talking prosecution.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm speaking about this because I know
that many of the people involved in this
[SPEAKER_06]: industry and doing this work are very
familiar with this, but you might not have
[SPEAKER_06]: heard somebody from who's not a grower and
not a user and I don't have the story,
[SPEAKER_06]: the personal narratives that many of you
bring, but it's shocking.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm a grower from Northern California and
I just kind of wanted to put a Northern
[SPEAKER_07]: California tinge on this because we have
Central and Southern California.
[SPEAKER_07]: What I want to say is marijuana law,
excuse me, cannabis law, that's a very
[SPEAKER_07]: important distinction.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cannabis law in most of California is
based on nuisance law and if you're
[SPEAKER_07]: familiar with nuisance law, it's driven by
a complaint.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's not a search warrant that's
needed.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's only a neighbor's complaint and you
are never knowing who that complainer was.
[SPEAKER_07]: Likewise, you don't get a day in court,
you don't get an appeal.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be cut down immediately right in
front of your eyes and in addition to
[SPEAKER_07]: that, they charge you for coming to do
that and the police force keeps the money.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is police busting you for profit and
this happens all over the place in
[SPEAKER_07]: Mendocino County and Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know of at least 150 personal issues
that I've talked to people in the last
[SPEAKER_07]: couple of years.
[SPEAKER_07]: This still goes on.
[SPEAKER_07]: Children are absolutely abducted from
their families out of their mother's arms.
[SPEAKER_07]: Calm down, calm down.
[SPEAKER_07]: I really don't have a question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to make sure that everyone
here knows that this is going on up north
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm applauding you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm applauding all of you for being
progressive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Mendocino County is still stuck in
nuisance ordinance and I wish all of you
[SPEAKER_07]: would call our supervisors in Mendocino
County and point out the reality of jobs,
[SPEAKER_07]: of money, of patients and also of what we
want, the farmers want to work with the
[SPEAKER_07]: regulators and they don't seem to want to
work with us in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, this is our last question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello, my name is Dr. Maria Teresa Ferrer
Rosen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a pain specialist for 40 years at
UCLA Medical Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a professor and I started the first
pain center at UCLA way back in 1974.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I don't look that old.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyway, some of you weren't born yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, I followed what you call the WHO
guideline for treating pain with opioids
[SPEAKER_00]: at the top and we didn't have cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: I retired 14 years ago, happy,
traveling around and all of a sudden,
[SPEAKER_00]: about six months ago, I started reading
about medical cannabinoids and I
[SPEAKER_00]: resurrected my license because I said I
need to help people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is a gift from God.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an herb.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to ask a question,
please, because I'm going to open my own
[SPEAKER_00]: clinic.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm deciding which county I'm going to go
to and it seems like each county has their
[SPEAKER_00]: own different ordinances that seem to be
different one county to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like to start it in a friendly place
that's not going to close me down.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's you, Jackie.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that a question to me who is regulating
at the moment?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that what you want to know?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have it all in my head.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm obsessed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I will talk to you after this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can certainly give you my own advice.
[SPEAKER_09]: My advice would be LA could be friendly,
but we're not there yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if you're thinking about going into LA,
I'd wait to see what our regulations are
[SPEAKER_09]: that we implement.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's actually what I want to close
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking to Amanda Raymond before I
got up here and she gave me a really great
[SPEAKER_04]: quote.
[SPEAKER_04]: She said, politicians have a feeling about
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: They know what that feeling is.
[SPEAKER_04]: What they don't have a feeling about is
us, you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to create these relationships
with these people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was able to call YOLO supervisor Don
Saylor when I got the call about the raid
[SPEAKER_04]: right on the phone to get him involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I have that relationship.
[SPEAKER_04]: We cannot expect our regulators to make
sensible regulations if they don't know
[SPEAKER_04]: what we need.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really hard for these people
sitting up here to vote against us if we
[SPEAKER_04]: have a relationship with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've communicated with them what our
needs are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So get involved in progressing the
conversation about regulations with your
[SPEAKER_04]: local elected officials.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do not wait for anyone to do that for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to close with my favorite
quote.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't know who came up with this,
but if you are not at the table,
[SPEAKER_04]: you are on the menu.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it, guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Congratulations.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
