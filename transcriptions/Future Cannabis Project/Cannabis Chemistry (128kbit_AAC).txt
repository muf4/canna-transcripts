[SPEAKER_00]: So today just a little brief background.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up here is a little bit about the
endocannabinoid system and what you
[SPEAKER_00]: realize is we don't know much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only been discovered in the early
90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know very little and there's more and
more that we learn every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was part of the calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fascinating biological world.
[SPEAKER_00]: It keeps getting broader and more and more
interesting as we learn more about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its key function is to regulate the body's
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you hear the word homeostasis or a
system of balance and really that's what
[SPEAKER_00]: the endocannabinoid system does.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a series of receptors and molecules
that are activated for mood regulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep regulation, pain regulation,
inflammation and it was this critical part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the body that was never taught to
anyone in medical school and still isn't
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's quite amazing and fascinating as a
scientist that you're thinking about the
[SPEAKER_00]: forefront of how to regulate the body's
key functions and you hear all of these
[SPEAKER_00]: ailments that can be treated with cannabis
and you wonder why.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because that endocannabinoid system
is so critical to what the body does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just know that it is regulating your
equilibrium and you're trying to find the
[SPEAKER_00]: right mixture of cannabis products for
yourself to balance yourself out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like this slide the most because you'll
see all the possible ailments that are on
[SPEAKER_00]: there around the circle and you'll see
things like anti-cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatory, bone growth and what
you'll notice about the circle is THC is
[SPEAKER_00]: not in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's probably most interesting is
that all we hear about in the media and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone has talked about for a long time
was tetrahydrocannabinol or THC and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps not the most interesting medical
molecule inside of cannabis and it really
[SPEAKER_00]: is all of the molecules at once that makes
medical cannabis special as opposed to a
[SPEAKER_00]: single molecule like Marinol or just CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is you know the reason that we're
all here today is if it was a single
[SPEAKER_00]: molecule that could be effective and it
could be isolated and used as a efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: therapeutic in a pharmaceutical sense we
wouldn't have medical cannabis interests
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But many patients speak of the whole plant
products as being superior and really
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding all of the molecules the
plant has to offer is what makes that
[SPEAKER_00]: unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's very different when you offer to
the body here is a whole host of molecules
[SPEAKER_00]: and this is your body's choice to choose
which ones it wants to balance itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: A good analogy is probably if I have a
piano in front of me and I just pound on
[SPEAKER_00]: the C key a lot that's kind of like
hitting one receptor with THC but when I
[SPEAKER_00]: say here is the whole plant I can play
chords I can play really nice tones much
[SPEAKER_00]: more pleasing to my ears and the body kind
of feels the same way when you offer all
[SPEAKER_00]: the molecules at once from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So understanding what's in the plant how
that's going to be effectively delivered
[SPEAKER_00]: to the patients and which combinations of
those molecules are best of interest to
[SPEAKER_00]: which patient population is kind of the
complexity of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was certainly what got me
interested and then I got to kind of dig
[SPEAKER_00]: through all these wonderful molecules and
what you'll see is there's predominant
[SPEAKER_00]: ones called cannabinoids that we talk
about mostly THC but there's a whole host
[SPEAKER_00]: of other ones there's terpes which are
related to the smell and the sensory
[SPEAKER_00]: perception of that and also a
physiological activity and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: anti-inflammatories of the flavonoids as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people you know hemp is just
another version of cannabis it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis so marijuana and hemp are two
different legal definitions and I won't
[SPEAKER_00]: get into the details of that but I'm happy
to explain it to anybody it is technically
[SPEAKER_00]: the same plant split in two different
legal parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowers are marijuana stalk stems and
seeds are hemp but the same plant kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: produces all those beneficial molecules so
hemp products are very beneficial that
[SPEAKER_00]: means you could get them from the cannabis
products that you have in the store in a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical sense too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: So synthetic cannabinoids are things like
spice we hear bad things about those we
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to talk about those phyto
cannabinoids are the ones that the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's up there on the screen are the
cannabinoid acids these are the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules that the plant makes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll hear more about THC and CBD but
those are processed cannabinoids you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to heat the plants natural molecules
before you form the neutral cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: in THC or CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way the plant does this is it takes
two precursors a lipatolic acid and
[SPEAKER_00]: geranyl pyrophosphate stitches them
together to make CBG acid which is the
[SPEAKER_00]: common intermediate that the plant
utilizes to make its other cannabinoids so
[SPEAKER_00]: it depends what the genetics are and how
they're expressed but it will start with
[SPEAKER_00]: CBG acid and go either to THC acid or CBD
acid sometimes CBC acid but we don't see
[SPEAKER_00]: much of that in any of the plants out here
today.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may see trace of CBG acid depending
upon how many copies of the enzymes are
[SPEAKER_00]: there to produce THC acid or CBD acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are all different cannabinoid
markers that we can watch and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: people working on developing high CBG
strains so that it's not converted to THC
[SPEAKER_00]: or CBD and there is also interesting
medical benefits from that as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do we go from the cannabinoid acids
to the neutral cannabinoids?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a process of heat and I'm often asked
what's the right temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Theoretically it happens at every
temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will happen at room temperature or just
take till after you're dead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really long period of time so
that's the smartass answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most effective temperatures are
typically boiling water.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have this transformation happen in
about 12 to 24 hours depending on exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: how you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're sauteing butter at home,
double boiler is probably the best way and
[SPEAKER_00]: longer is typically better than not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the technical definition of the
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called decarboxy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabinoids are what most people talk
about but in 2011 we started testing for
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and those are the other things
that make each of the unique plant
[SPEAKER_00]: differences out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we saw was three different plant
varieties all had the exact same
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid profile, the same amount of
THC and next to nothing else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yet they gave very different physiological
responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: They smelled very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something else is here causing this to
happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was that and those are what chemists
call terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we started it was entertaining to
me, other labs, so they're just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: charge you for another test.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing useful there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I think it's one of the more
popularized words.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it terpie or terp sauce or crazy
things around the word terpenes and what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're recognizing is that these are
important for the entourage of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what makes medical cannabis special and
different are these molecules also going
[SPEAKER_00]: with the cannabinoids that really help
everyone benefit from the medicinal power
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just an example of one of the
profiles that we provide and it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like a chemical fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can see if the bars are longer or
shorter on different ones and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: start to look at a label and understand
what medicine is going to be of most
[SPEAKER_00]: interest to you as a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's additional information for
caregivers to provide or for patients to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand which version of cannabis is
right for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just THC and it's not just the
most THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just CBD either.
[SPEAKER_00]: So single molecule isolates are very,
very different.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want as much of the whole plant in
your product as you can get in the end and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes are key part of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're very, very complex.
[SPEAKER_00]: The word terpene represents 20,000
different chemical molecules in the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: kingdom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plants use them to talk to each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They use that to talk to their environment
and they often use it to ward off pests or
[SPEAKER_00]: predators.
[SPEAKER_00]: So sometimes they're irritants,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So some people create an allergy to
cannabis because the plant saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: leave me alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just this helpless little thing
standing here in the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not making them for our benefits,
but more for their own benefit to survive
[SPEAKER_00]: and thrive in their own environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fortunate enough to be able to
harness them and utilize them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes can be used in things like tape
and they can be as complex as Paxol,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a breast cancer medicine that
comes from a specific uterine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a vast world of chemistry and it's
very fascinating.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we know is a little bit about single
molecules by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I wrote up here is, you know,
pining has a pine odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be useful as a bronchodilator.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that might open the airways for an
asthmatic if they were to inhale some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may also increase absorption and up the
intake of THC through your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we don't know very well is how
these things all work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just because I have a little linole
that may be sedated does not mean this
[SPEAKER_00]: brain that has a little linole will put me
to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be other things that
counteract that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There might be other things that really
change that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what the whole complex
picture looks like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do believe terpenes hold the future
in terms of tailoring medicine for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients and really helping them
understand what's going to be the right
[SPEAKER_00]: product for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we cannot make marketing claims of
that type today.
[SPEAKER_00]: If someone says, I really know the secret
sauce to telling you everything,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's too far ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the cart in front of the horse and
drives the scientists crazy, but it makes
[SPEAKER_00]: the marketing people happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm definitely on the other side of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we were able to do is take both
cannabinoid and terpene data and look on a
[SPEAKER_00]: vast survey of thousands of different
strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were 2,000 in this data set and
really start to compare them by their
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical fingerprint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we wanted to see was what was
different about them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are the names?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is indica and sativa and what really
makes sense?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we found out was THC was not the
differentiator.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's THC in everything and it averaged
out to be about 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're seeing, unfortunately,
some labs say that there's 30 even 40% THC
[SPEAKER_00]: in a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bad lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, or they're doing the math funny or
they're not doing things in an ethical
[SPEAKER_00]: fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're going to extract that,
you'll find out the hard way that you
[SPEAKER_00]: never got anything out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not useful to a patient to just
say, here's a lot of THC is what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: right product for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that produced in the same fashion every
single time?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had witnessed people changing the
name in a dispensary or what I feel is
[SPEAKER_00]: immoral and unethical is saying to an
insomniac, this indica strain will make
[SPEAKER_00]: you go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can you make that claim?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can you tell that individual that
when you have no idea if it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: work for them that way, they go home,
they try cannabis, they're awake till five
[SPEAKER_00]: in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: They say, cannabis is not right for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they think that all strains are the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now that person who could find great
benefits is unfortunately misled and
[SPEAKER_00]: misdirected and thinks that cannabis
doesn't work for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was a big problem for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's something that we need to
clarify.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what this data shows in a bigger
picture is that in a perfect world,
[SPEAKER_00]: if all those claims are right,
we'd see sativa, hybrid and indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we see is this continuum and the
smear and a bunch of stuff up on the
[SPEAKER_00]: corner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all the colors together here really
indicate that you can't say one indica
[SPEAKER_00]: does this and a sativa does that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really means each plant its own unique
version.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a morphological description of
how long it would take to do flowering or
[SPEAKER_00]: grow cycle times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not indicative of what the medicine
is going to be like to that patient in the
[SPEAKER_00]: end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took a smaller subset of that with just
five names at a time to try and discern
[SPEAKER_00]: are there even tighter groupings of those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a small study with Jack Hair found
that 30% of the time it's misnamed.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not even Jack Hair at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very distinct chemical profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can see it clearly in the data
that it was misnamed and abused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see some of these names cluster
like harlequin because it's so distinct
[SPEAKER_00]: and different.
[SPEAKER_00]: But other ones are kind of all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't put much stock inside of
just the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to know who's doing it and
why.
[SPEAKER_00]: The major terpene differentiators,
by the way, were terpenolene and nirol.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were the ones pulling Jack Hair and
trainwreck up to the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're prevalent in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And linalorum limonene pulled things to
the right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a methodology called
principal component analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we saw with just four names,
this was trainwreck Jack Hair,
[SPEAKER_00]: OG push and sarah diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we looked in California and
Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you see there is a little bit of some
of the clustering.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at it in 3D, though,
you'll see that it's kind of scattered and
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you'll notice with something as
popular as OG push, it goes across the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who knows which OG push you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: So push or OG whatever, good luck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may be some person or some cultivars
are special to a certain dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might be something you can rely on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go to another state or you go
somewhere else and they say, I have the
[SPEAKER_00]: best OG push, it's probably not what
you've seen here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is important to a patient and to
doctors recommending those things so they
[SPEAKER_00]: know what to consume and they can rely on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now we have no standardization of
the naming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really what we need are producers or
cultivators if there are cultivators here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can build a brand around consistently
producing the same product every single
[SPEAKER_00]: time and putting your name on your OG
push.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our effort would be to authenticate
that and validate that you're doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: the same every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can then talk to doctors to recommend
that to certain types of patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can kind of advance the ball down
the field in terms of how we can raise the
[SPEAKER_00]: level of play.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can not just call it whatever we want
or a flavor of the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not really going to help anybody
get to where we want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are an enormous amount of product
types that go along with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what we've seen is there's a lot of
different molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can be up to 200 that I've just talked
about in terms of terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that you can see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have all these product
diversities.
[SPEAKER_00]: So whether it's just the flower material
or if it was some sort of trim that is
[SPEAKER_00]: very different composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Keith that was pulled off of that
and that concentration is different?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or was it made into an extract or a
derivative product for oral or sublingual
[SPEAKER_00]: use?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those deliver different types of
medicinal benefits to different patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to understand what you're
ingesting in which manner to know if
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the right medicine for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to understand how can
this be variable or the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you talk about cultivation pushing
that in the same direction every single
[SPEAKER_00]: time you're trying to control something
natural and wild.
[SPEAKER_00]: Its idea is to be diverse and not
consistent and uniform.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is doable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So controlling the temperature,
humidity, nutrient cycle, lighting,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, phase of the moon.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure what they all are but there
are a lot of things that go into making
[SPEAKER_00]: that reproducible every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is doable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dutch do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been doing it for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just as a matter of sophistication
and paying attention to the products that
[SPEAKER_00]: you produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you talk about an infused product it
becomes a little bit more different.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it extracted?
[SPEAKER_00]: What may or may not be left behind?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it fully decarboxylated or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what other, you know, molecules might
be present in the end extract or are not
[SPEAKER_00]: present that were there from the flower
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: That creates another type of experience
for the patients as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how am I consuming it is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: How is it made is another big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And anyone looking to make products you
just have to keep doing the same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: every single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are ways to standardize your
products and improve your value and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: the best way to be I'd say a provider of
medicine to people out here who would find
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits from it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't change the formula.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't do something different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once it works for someone let them rely on
that and then you're going to be in far
[SPEAKER_00]: better shape as a brand and the patients
are going to be better off too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So which ways might you consume that?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important for doctors to
understand and for patients what's my
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption method.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower material and concentrates you can
do via, you know, combustion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vaporization is becoming much much more
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vaporization is lower temperature,
less destruction of certain molecules,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit more friendly to the airway.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is the best way to ingest the
molecules directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like injecting them
without having to go through the needle
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get the right molecules in the
bloodstream directly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sublingual does the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually takes a couple extra minutes
but you'll get THC and CBD predominantly
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bloodstream that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Topicals, not so sure all of those are
going through the skin or if you're really
[SPEAKER_00]: getting a good amount of that maybe more
of a surface action might help with
[SPEAKER_00]: inflammation or arthritic types of pains
but it might not help, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: head pains depending upon what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your concentration in the blood just
doesn't get that high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oral products though go through the liver
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they go into the stomach, they're
absorbed at different rates and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: liver transforms that and makes different
molecules than just THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it actually makes the molecules that
you fail in your urine test if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: driving.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that molecule that it makes,
it's called 11-hydroxy-THC, is five times
[SPEAKER_00]: more active than the cannabinoid 1
receptor.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very different molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if I took the same amount inhaled
or orally, I could get two drastically
[SPEAKER_00]: different responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: I could have two different side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really THC that's doing the
activity when you take it orally,
[SPEAKER_00]: nor CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's something the medical community
is not fully caught up on and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: research is not on those metabolites
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's important that if you're looking
for what am I going to get and how long is
[SPEAKER_00]: it going to last and is this the right
stuff for me, that you understand that
[SPEAKER_00]: there are some differences and there's not
one product fits all for everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very individualized thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how the concentrate is actually
manufactured is a key part of what goes on
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of medical cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're seeing more people say I have
high-purity CBD or I have high-purity THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well high-purity THC is Marinol and we've
already said that that wasn't the best
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that we want.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we keep it more like the plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are a variety of like extraction
methods, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dry sifting, water extraction for bubble
hash, CO2 or hydrocarbon extraction,
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those will form some extract,
but all of those extracts are very
[SPEAKER_00]: different and all of them are very
different compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most of the time you've lost a lot of
terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I go and winterize it where I add
ethanol, make it cold, filter that off and
[SPEAKER_00]: evaporate the ethanol, I've evaporated a
lot of terpenes as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have no way of controlling the
product composition or reproducibility of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not going to be the same every
single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to get some cannabinoid base
with a little bit of fats or other stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: that went with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a very different product
than what you've got off the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are people trying to introduce
terpenes in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that we'll see more and more of
that coming in the future, but how you do
[SPEAKER_00]: that, which ones you have, is it
reproducible and is it still safe to
[SPEAKER_00]: ingest?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there are still question marks
that the regulator is looking to catch up
[SPEAKER_00]: on, but we'll hopefully get broader
diversity of products out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we did was we looked at
concentrates in that same fashion we did
[SPEAKER_00]: to all the strains and you see that most
of them are all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really that's because they're pretty
much just the cannabinoids and there's no
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes left.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you compare them with the flowers,
you see that all the concentrates are over
[SPEAKER_00]: here and the flowers are over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a little bit of overlap and
when you look at it in 3D they're not on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what that says is concentrate products
are a different type of product than the
[SPEAKER_00]: flower product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the goal should be how do I make the
concentrate products more like the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: products?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not seeing a whole bunch of that
just yet, but I think that that's coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an important picture that tells
you I don't want just any old
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to really know what's the
composition of that concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: It used to be, here is my goo,
don't you want to buy it from me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure there's a lot of CBD or THC in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're moving past that,
we certainly need to, and we're headed in
[SPEAKER_00]: a much better direction where we can look
at a broader scope of molecules and
[SPEAKER_00]: understand this is what a standardized
product really is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in terms of understanding for yourself
as a patient and if you're providing for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients, how is this product formed?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the homogeneity of that product in
an edible product?
[SPEAKER_00]: So chocolate products are excellent
because it's easy to get the THC
[SPEAKER_00]: distributed uniformly throughout it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I have drink products or topical
products that are higher viscosities or
[SPEAKER_00]: other types of products that don't mix
well, like say cookie batter, like do I
[SPEAKER_00]: have a lump of my concentrate in one part?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did I cook it with the tray a little
crooked?
[SPEAKER_00]: And now this brownie is twice as thick as
the other one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sure that every single unit has the
exact concentration and has the exact same
[SPEAKER_00]: size is going to be critical as
regulations come about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I did hear a little bit of a comment,
I don't like regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unfortunately I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say regulation is good in terms of
making sure we stay safe and within the
[SPEAKER_00]: right bounds and give us clear guidelines
and rules to operate by.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're too restrictive, they're not
good.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't exist, then it's not good as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because what we see today is a lot of
pesticide contamination, which no one
[SPEAKER_00]: that's sick should be exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unregulated products, I can tell you that
with Johns Hopkins researchers we studied
[SPEAKER_00]: a broad diversity of infused products.
[SPEAKER_00]: 87% of them were not within the label like
spec that they put on the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't know what you're getting 87%
of the time when you orally take this
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank God it doesn't kill you,
but it's definitely not what you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to want and then it might also not be that
experience that someone benefits from and
[SPEAKER_00]: therefore they're not going to be a
cannabis consumer in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple to work with a lab and
have some tests to say I'm on point,
[SPEAKER_00]: my products are definitely consistent,
how do I make sure I've got the same
[SPEAKER_00]: concentration in all my products?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's going to be the way that your brand
succeeds today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's kind of the important
thing for entrepreneurs out here to
[SPEAKER_00]: remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in summary, what the profiling tells us
was the whole idea of indica sativa hybrid
[SPEAKER_00]: telling you a physiological effect is a
misnomer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does not work that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what specific plant and which
composition causes these reactions for
[SPEAKER_00]: which types of patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know yet today, but that's the
way that we have to look about those.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're hoping to start a new dialogue and a
new way of classifying those to really
[SPEAKER_00]: make it much easier to understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And don't rely too much on the name,
but you can trust your nose.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ways to say I know that this
smells the same as it did the last time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It looks visibly the same color.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't get the baby switch.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm more likely to have this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's the same profile and it's just
more or less, then you just need to take
[SPEAKER_00]: less or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not bad to have it at a different
concentration as long as it's the same
[SPEAKER_00]: composition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what that profiling tells us is
terpenes are really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the part that no one likes to
talk about, but this is why regulations
[SPEAKER_00]: are important.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we understand what's not on the
product?
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis doesn't kill people,
but some of the stuff that may go along
[SPEAKER_00]: with it actually could.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important to know that that's not
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you have patients who are
immunocompromised or undergoing
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapy treatments or exceptionally
weak and frail, they cannot afford to be
[SPEAKER_00]: exposed to pesticide contaminations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not in their interest and it's
not good for anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we kind of looked at in this picture
is there's stop work orders in Washington
[SPEAKER_00]: and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: But back in end of 2012, we did a small
study with a handheld pipe and a glass
[SPEAKER_00]: water pipe as well, both with and without
the filters that you see there,
[SPEAKER_00]: which are coconut, carbon, and cotton.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we determined was rather alarming
that we looked at these molecules that are
[SPEAKER_00]: known as pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pesticides are cultivating agents that are
put on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's a plant growth regulator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Up to 70% of what we put on the plant
could be introduced into the airways and
[SPEAKER_00]: into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are combusting and inhaling a
product that has pesticides or plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth regulators on it, you're literally
injecting those things right into your
[SPEAKER_00]: bloodstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't set daily intake limits on
vegetables because you're inhaling them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We set them because you're orally
ingesting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's an absorption and there's a
toxicity limit that goes with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have those for inhalation
products in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was why we did this study to see
how much you could be exposed for,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're looking at getting that way,
and how do we set regulations about when
[SPEAKER_00]: these things should be applied and how
much should be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's important science that needs to be
done before we understand how we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: set the regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we know these kinds of things,
I think more of the regulators are saying,
[SPEAKER_00]: so how do I fix this problem?
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I or should I not allow on
these products?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is a matter of what am I using the
product for in the end and which ones did
[SPEAKER_00]: I put on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fortunately, most of the regulators are
going towards products that did not have
[SPEAKER_00]: any intake limit thresholds, things that
we deemed exceptionally safe like cinnamon
[SPEAKER_00]: oil or other types of natural products
that you don't have to worry are harmful
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals that would be exposed to people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's starting to trend in the right
direction, but it's still gonna be a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I won't put a time frame on it,
but it won't be tomorrow until that
[SPEAKER_00]: problem is fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our goal was absolutely, how do I put
this information on a label?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I inform patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do doctors, patient providers,
and patients themselves get to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what's in their product?
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a variety of different labels.
[SPEAKER_00]: These two are flowers, and this one's an
edible product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can see as much information as we
could put on there was placed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We modeled it after the nutritional facts
panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have one of these on our website,
and you can certainly download a large
[SPEAKER_00]: version and it explains all the little
components and the different pieces that
[SPEAKER_00]: are there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the goal is to provide information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with a label like that, you can say
these are the top turpings I'm used to
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the product types that are
working for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: No matter what name you call it,
I still know what I'm looking for as a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those of you who are really sharp at
looking at that label, you'll notice that
[SPEAKER_00]: it wasn't the simple sum to say THC acid
plus THC equals this amount of maximum THC
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's based on molecular weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to lose a CO2 molecule,
and THC actually weighs less than THC
[SPEAKER_00]: acid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a little algebraic equation
that I put up there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty simple when you think of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just 13% of the weight is gone as
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 100% THC acid would be 87.7% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's important to know if you're a
processor and you're looking to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: where'd all my stuff go?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did I lose this weight?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's supposed to eliminate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's important to know how that math
is done so that your lab is giving you the
[SPEAKER_00]: right values that you can look at and that
you're kind of comparing apples to apples
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're looking at labels at a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fortunately, you can learn the math for
two molecules because CBD weighs exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you only have to learn the math once.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the labs should do that right,
but we don't see them all do that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So unfortunately, you'll see other labs
just sum the numbers to make it look
[SPEAKER_00]: larger.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's to try and get the marketing height
behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's really not an accurate
representation of what you're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: and won't lead you to an accurate dose
understanding or dialogue with your
[SPEAKER_00]: doctor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, in general, I hope I've been
impressed upon you that it's a very
[SPEAKER_00]: complex world with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's part of the fun and
excitement of it, at least intellectually.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's part of the challenge when you're
a patient trying to find the right product
[SPEAKER_00]: for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or if you're a product producer or a
patient provider, how do I know which
[SPEAKER_00]: product works for which patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: We really don't know today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd encourage diversity and lots of
different creativity, what product types
[SPEAKER_00]: that you think are good, what things you
like to see in them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, I would think that we're not
going to hurt ourselves with more product
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's about knowing that your product's
made consistently and that you can educate
[SPEAKER_00]: about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really the bottom line,
I think, in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And basically, that's all I have for
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you guys very much for your
attention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm a lawyer, and I represent people
who are classes and companies and whatnot
[SPEAKER_01]: up in the state of Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been also asked to represent a clinic
in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question I have is I don't entirely
come from this sector, but I know that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're seeing almost a deregulation up in
the state of Washington with medical
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana being eliminated as its own
class, and it's now being sold in the same
[SPEAKER_01]: place as the recreation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're seeing a transition where
they're folding the two systems together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So medical will be folded into the
recreational system, and they'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: through the same stores then, same
dispensaries in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you'll charge the patient differently
based on their medical status.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, with this trend and with the fact
that you're talking about products,
[SPEAKER_01]: medicines, they have very specific remedy
goals, whether it's an inflammation or a
[SPEAKER_01]: cancer or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you seeing in the spring along the
West Coast with California, Oregon,
[SPEAKER_01]: and Washington, are you seeing sufficient
analysis similar to non-cancerous products
[SPEAKER_01]: to understand the medicinal consistency?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, simply no.
[SPEAKER_00]: We see very inaccurate testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't have the labs regulated well
enough, especially in Washington.
[SPEAKER_00]: Three labs have folded up in Washington
because of what's going on up there,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the regulator has not regulated the
labs to be accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot get good information about
your product with an inaccurate lab,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you can't know any medicinal benefits
from that if you don't go further.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we really should not be making
claims whatsoever, even if we are working
[SPEAKER_00]: with a good lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just doesn't work out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you can get good standardized
medicine if it's clean, and it's the right
[SPEAKER_00]: one for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is a little bit of a patient has to
kind of figure out which one's right for
[SPEAKER_00]: them based on a dialogue with people
around them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is trial and error, and that's all
that we're left with as the best for
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to work for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may work for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most likely it could, but it's not a
guarantee.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the best thing you can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not a lawyer, but...
[SPEAKER_03]: So my question is, in relation to the
previous question, too, what are the Dutch
[SPEAKER_03]: doing to stabilize it and make it more
consistent?
[SPEAKER_03]: What would we do if we knew that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is, what are the Dutch
doing that is different?
[SPEAKER_00]: So theirs is a federally regulated
medicinal cannabis program.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cultivation of that is standardized
like a pharmaceutical product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cultivator had to prove that it was
consistent and the same every time within
[SPEAKER_00]: a very narrow range.
[SPEAKER_00]: They over pressurized the rooms,
the methodologies they used to clone and
[SPEAKER_00]: propagate are different than what we're
doing, and they religiously tested and
[SPEAKER_00]: made sure that it was the same every
single time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was, I mean, expensive facility was
kind of one way of looking at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not cheap to build that, but they
tested where were the lights, how high
[SPEAKER_00]: were they in the room, was the lumen
difference the same across all the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: and was I really, really accurately,
repeatedly doing good agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: practices, GMP style for plants,
that I made sure it was the same time that
[SPEAKER_00]: it was watered, the same amount of water,
the same type of water, the same
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients, all the same for each specific
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's doable, it's just a lot of
diligence and a lot of work, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: doable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, sure, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One more lucky question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, our testing service, you know,
offers the labels as part of the testing,
[SPEAKER_00]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, Jeff, what a great talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all.
Thank you.
Thank you.
