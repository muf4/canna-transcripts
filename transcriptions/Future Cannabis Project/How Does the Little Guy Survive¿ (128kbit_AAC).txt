[SPEAKER_01]: So we're the founders of Newell's
Botanicals and we founded our company on a
[SPEAKER_01]: set of core values.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the first thing we did is we
incorporated as a benefit corporation so
[SPEAKER_01]: that we could never be forced by a board
of directors or some situation like that
[SPEAKER_01]: to change any of our core principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is, you know, to focus on the
sustainability of the ingredients and the
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging as soon as it's possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Damn child resistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: To highlight sustainability, but
ultimately to actually use what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing with our products, with our company,
to create real change in the agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you integrate a lot of the
botanical ingredients that we grow into a
[SPEAKER_01]: conventional agriculture system,
like on a hemp farm, on a cannabis farm,
[SPEAKER_01]: you not only increase the health of the
plot, you also build soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: You attract beneficial insects that fight
off insects that predate on your plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you increase the value of your
crop, because now you're not just pulling
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis or hemp out of it, you're pulling
calendula extract and chamomile extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these can be high value essential
oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the end of the day, if we can
create a very high value, high price tag,
[SPEAKER_01]: end user product, that's supports systems
of regenerative agriculture, that's the
[SPEAKER_01]: ultimate goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't really say it any better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, being able to make doing good work
profitable has been one of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: have made me stick in this fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we can actually do good works and
actually earn a living doing it is really
[SPEAKER_00]: something that sparks my heart.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we can move it forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say, I'm glad I found a
partner that actually believes in that
[SPEAKER_00]: ideal, because it's out here on the
struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: We eat beans and rice more than a few
times just to make it do, trying to make
[SPEAKER_00]: it ends me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so slowly but surely, I kind of feel
like that cat hanging in there until this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry settles down and can actually be
an adult industry where it functions like
[SPEAKER_00]: regular businesses rather than this little
fledge in the industry that has regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: hurdles that cause problems for us to stay
in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I have to say a shout out for my
friends that are developing vertically
[SPEAKER_00]: integrated silos, their own cooperatives,
farms, manufacturers, distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: centers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to start building our own
vertically integrated silos cooperatively
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like a Blue Diamond Almond or
Ocean Spray, as far as getting a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: small farmers to be competitive against
these large, large, large conglomerates
[SPEAKER_00]: that are coming after our lunch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We built this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We should not be allowing people that just
can capitalize.
[SPEAKER_01]: We baked the cake, but they're eating it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're taking our cake back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're willing to work with anybody who
wants to work collaboratively with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to be competitive,
then hopefully we'll see you in the rear
[SPEAKER_00]: view mirror.
[SPEAKER_00]: Collaborative works, moving forward,
helping the planet, helping our fellow
[SPEAKER_00]: man, building up equitable pay for people
that work in the trimming industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to make that possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And big industry just wants to turn it
into a cash cow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means the people that work in
those communities are going to be undercut
[SPEAKER_00]: rather than the good, high-paying job it
used to be in these communities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to keep it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over the last 12 months, that's really
been something we cared about a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we were on stage accepting our
award last year, it was like every person
[SPEAKER_01]: who came up to take their award gave their
acceptance speech followed by their
[SPEAKER_01]: retirement speech.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like, thank you for this wonderful
award.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great thing to go out on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Peace.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, wait.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all giving up?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so by the time we got up there,
it was like, maybe if we all worked
[SPEAKER_01]: together, we could still be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've actually spent the last 12 months
doing something very non-businessy and
[SPEAKER_01]: very counterintuitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been actively giving a hand up to
our competitors whenever we find them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I run into one of my competitors and
they need a manufacturing space,
[SPEAKER_01]: they need a connection to a distributor,
they need a connection to a lab or a piece
[SPEAKER_01]: of inventory, source material,
always, always.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're a bro, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corporate carpetbaggers, fuck them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can be my bro and be my competitor
and I will help you out because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're part of the real industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'd rather work with someone who I
have to compete with in the market if
[SPEAKER_00]: they're real because at least we're
establishing what the market is,
[SPEAKER_00]: that true core of what the market's
supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, gosh.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was Churchill that said we can
either hang together or fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's seriously what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to build and work together or
we're going to fall apart.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to take us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I ain't down for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's still enough market space left
for all of us little guys to have our
[SPEAKER_01]: brands out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have to compete with each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have to compete with overly
capitalized, low value products that are
[SPEAKER_01]: just kind of being pumped out there to
steal market share.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, I think we're seeing in
general in the world that that market
[SPEAKER_01]: tactic is not going to fly anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: People want good shit and we will never
equivocate on that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will always make the best product that
we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will always make the best product that
we can.
We will always make the best product that
we can.
