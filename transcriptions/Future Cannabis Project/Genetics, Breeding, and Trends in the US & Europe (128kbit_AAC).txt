[SPEAKER_00]: We just watched a panel on tissue culture
and one of the very last comments was that
[SPEAKER_00]: in like three to five years breeding will
be done at a molecular level like other
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and that the role of the current
breeder who basically breeds actual plants
[SPEAKER_00]: won't really exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think there is going to be a lot of
people that you know breeders breeders now
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it's a lot of people say they're
breeders a lot of pollen chuckers you know
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of pollen chucking is going on
people just backyard breeding not doing
[SPEAKER_01]: any selection I think those type of people
yeah they're gonna be done but I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: the actual breeders the real ones right
now that are relevant will still be
[SPEAKER_01]: relevant in five years I think they have
that potential.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's you know it's kind of like they're
gonna work side my vision is they'll work
[SPEAKER_01]: side by side with the guys that are doing
molecular to help you know understand and
[SPEAKER_01]: develop the SOPs kind of drive drive the
breeding because I feel like it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: connoisseur thing you know maybe I'll be
proven wrong but I really I really you
[SPEAKER_01]: know being a breeder I sure hope I'm still
relevant five years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I mean I agree I think instead of
working with plants you'll be working with
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists sure but you'll still be
relevant in the same way you're relevant
[SPEAKER_00]: in turn like with plants you're still the
one to say we we bred it we grew it out I
[SPEAKER_00]: approve that's good shit yeah like that
scientist dude or the business guy in that
[SPEAKER_00]: company won't be the one to make that
decision.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm probably not gonna be breeding the
high THC or the minor cannabinoid you know
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding projects that some people will be
able to do with molecular processing you
[SPEAKER_01]: know Cas9 and CRISPR and stuff like that
yeah that's that's not my expertise but
[SPEAKER_01]: working with those people and helping them
understand the plant I feel like there's
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that it's gonna work synergistically
I feel like a lot of people are afraid of
[SPEAKER_01]: CRISPR and Cas9 and the kind of direction
that that's going in you know the people
[SPEAKER_01]: GMO they're freaked out about genetically
modifying stuff but I feel like they've
[SPEAKER_01]: been doing it in hops they've been doing
it in a lot of things and I'm really
[SPEAKER_01]: interested to kind of see what it brings.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about the man who just passed and his
contribution what he means to you and his
[SPEAKER_00]: legacy as a breeder.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's funny because his impact was so
great and I feel like most people can't
[SPEAKER_01]: even really comprehend how big of an
impact Neville's contributions were it
[SPEAKER_01]: took me an actual day to write a post
about it on Instagram because I really
[SPEAKER_01]: want to think about you know all this
stuff all the work he's done and you know
[SPEAKER_01]: the development of haze strains you know
solely responsible for a lot of it
[SPEAKER_01]: Neville's haze super silver haze the
development with greenhouse was super
[SPEAKER_01]: silver haze I mean that strain its impact
he changed generations you know and he
[SPEAKER_01]: affected you know on a large scale more
than anybody else in the industry anything
[SPEAKER_01]: else that anybody's done I feel like his
contributions are greater.
[SPEAKER_00]: So he's like the what is it the Genghis
Khan is like his DNA is attacked because
[SPEAKER_00]: he had sex with so many he's like the
Genghis Khan of cannabis in Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: especially you know and I feel like people
in the States don't really have an
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciation for haze and most people that
have seen it haven't seen it grown
[SPEAKER_01]: properly feel like over in Europe if
you've been able to spend time in Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: in you know Amsterdam the Netherlands and
Spain in Italy even like you'll see haze
[SPEAKER_01]: or you'll see haze isolator or hashes and
you know grown properly is some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: most amazing you know amazing strains on
the earth it's a but it's funny because
[SPEAKER_01]: haze is a particular thing that not
everybody agrees with because our bodies
[SPEAKER_01]: are so unique it's something like my wife
is not a huge haze fan although she's big
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's like if she'll smoke a little bit
of haze so she can clean the house stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: like that but yeah and then other people
it's like too much for them so it's really
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting the direction it's gone and I
feel like we have guys like short Brooks
[SPEAKER_01]: and Mojave and Karma and these guys are
gonna kind of continue with the breeding I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean I've done breeding with super silver
and would like to get some especially
[SPEAKER_01]: after Neville's passing we'd like to get
some more genetics back into like the mix
[SPEAKER_01]: of what I'm doing but yeah so I believe
shorts do a huge breeding project on haze
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically isolating some phenotypes
they're doing huge phenohunts down in
[SPEAKER_00]: Arizona like if you reflect on him was he
like a mentor no I think I think everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: in that you were you friends with them I
was not no but I felt his impact you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and I just I've appreciated the haze and
the lineage you know and you know it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it's one thing that's you know it's
affected you know I feel like chem dog
[SPEAKER_01]: also is another strain that was a bag seed
by the way haze was actually developed and
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like there's a handful of real
breeders out there that have really bred
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant and worked with the plant and
improved the genetics over time Neville's
[SPEAKER_01]: one of them Simon from serious seeds
actually took from like he won land races
[SPEAKER_01]: he started with two land races created
real f1s most people think like f1 is
[SPEAKER_01]: something we see every day but it's what
we're seeing these f1 poly hybrids that
[SPEAKER_01]: have really complex genetics in them you
know and and a lot of over breeding done
[SPEAKER_01]: with specific strains like OG and cookies
now it's kind of what's happening I think
[SPEAKER_01]: the interesting thing back over in Europe
especially in the Netherlands is there was
[SPEAKER_01]: a time where haze just dominated
everything people found it they fell in
[SPEAKER_01]: love with it and it went from these really
long flowering hazes to amnesia but it was
[SPEAKER_00]: still haze for a long time it's
interesting to kind of see like the
[SPEAKER_00]: fragmentation globally of cannabis like
what people appreciate like you're saying
[SPEAKER_00]: in Europe they appreciate things that here
people just it's so subjective it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: like real Moroccan hash or red Lebanon
like the red Lebanese or you know any of
[SPEAKER_01]: these different hashes like we don't
appreciate them here in the States we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really have access to them like they
do in Europe but uh you know our standards
[SPEAKER_01]: are very different and and what we think
of as quality is so different and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: one thing that makes cannabis so beautiful
is it's so subjective just like food food
[SPEAKER_01]: wine beer it's so subjective to the actual
individual that there's almost something
[SPEAKER_00]: for everybody yeah no my my introduction
to hash was uh I lived in France for two
[SPEAKER_00]: years the first year was in high school
when I was 16 so I was like by myself no
[SPEAKER_00]: family you're drinking and then like
you're not smoking weed you're smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: Moroccan hash with yeah tobacco and as
someone who smokes weed that shit knocked
[SPEAKER_00]: me out like I couldn't handle it I don't
normally smoke tobacco well the other
[SPEAKER_00]: thing is like there was never any weed
around no well you're talking about like
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff they're growing and appreciate or
have grown and appreciate in Europe and in
[SPEAKER_00]: my head I'm like where was it all because
coffee shops coffee in Amsterdam had it
[SPEAKER_01]: you know Spain it was available in Spain
but it was really people were in the
[SPEAKER_01]: shadows for a long time until maybe the
last five years where people started
[SPEAKER_01]: opening coffee got coffee shops with
social clubs in Spain you know it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: really and it's funny because the quality
has just progressed so much in Spain
[SPEAKER_01]: whereas Amsterdam has kind of stagnated
it's regressed well it really hasn't it
[SPEAKER_01]: hasn't grown I feel like I went to
Amsterdam for the first time in five years
[SPEAKER_01]: and when I went back it was almost exactly
the same coffee shop same layout all my
[SPEAKER_01]: restaurants pretty much we're still there
so really interesting red light was a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller yeah I'm still thinking about like
being 16 and yeah it was I think mostly
[SPEAKER_01]: was mixing the tobacco yeah well so I
smoked I don't smoke tobacco at all so my
[SPEAKER_01]: friend was diagnosed with esophageal
cancer last June and so I quit tobacco
[SPEAKER_01]: completely no blunts you know just no
tobacco I don't you know I don't need it
[SPEAKER_01]: and it doesn't really give me joy and if
it's bad for me why would I consume it so
[SPEAKER_01]: although a good cigar is nice yeah why so
I have a humidor that has 500 cigars but
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah why if you're not smoking yeah I will
take you down some cigars idea every time
[SPEAKER_01]: people come in my house I give them cigars
but I quit smoking and then I go to Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: and my friends like you want to smoke
chillin and I'm like well I don't smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: tobacco but fuck it let's let's do it it's
you know and it's basically sterile to a
[SPEAKER_01]: degree the tobacco that goes in there it's
just a you know it's like a little basket
[SPEAKER_01]: to put the the hash in when you're smoking
it but it still gets you really high like
[SPEAKER_01]: that's some of the most high I've ever
ridden in my life is from smoking chillin
[SPEAKER_00]: with friends it's my whole point like I
went from like so I went in high school
[SPEAKER_00]: and then again in college and it was like
you're like I smoke a lot of weed and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you go there and and we would go I'd go
with my French friends and before we go
[SPEAKER_00]: into a club we'd smoke yeah and I'd be
like you know what I'm just gonna hang out
[SPEAKER_00]: in the car you guys go on the club like I
couldn't move and they're like all right
[SPEAKER_00]: dude you're sure you're cool in the car
like see you later I'd be like no I'm good
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a trip but most of those guys can't
hang with us peer smokers right so funny
[SPEAKER_01]: so like they're like they'll take a hit of
the peer and that's it for the day but uh
[SPEAKER_01]: well yeah and I really appreciate I got to
smoke some 20 year old Moroccan when I was
[SPEAKER_01]: in Spain they yeah the Mario Barros Club
so this brings me to the Frenchie comment
[SPEAKER_00]: of hash gets better with age so and go and
go I don't it's a 20 year old hash we
[SPEAKER_01]: smoked 20 year old Moroccan it was held by
a Moroccan that was there and it tasted
[SPEAKER_01]: good it tasted very it didn't have a lot
of flavor I feel like it loses something
[SPEAKER_01]: you know like I feel like it just like
wine wine has an expiration date where it
[SPEAKER_01]: goes over and then even red wine like so
so it was smooth but there wasn't a lot to
[SPEAKER_01]: it it wasn't like that I like that fresh
creamy especially that creamy smoke that
[SPEAKER_00]: you get from really good hash but since
the sample size was one you'd almost need
[SPEAKER_00]: like a hundred different sort of hashes to
be stored for 20 years and then to see if
[SPEAKER_00]: some of them like because like with red
wine some peak seven years later seven to
[SPEAKER_00]: ten somewhere like ten oh yeah depending
on the lipid content there's so many
[SPEAKER_01]: different things like you you're looking
at lipids they try the terpenes that are
[SPEAKER_01]: in there terpenes will help degrade it
depending on what type of terpenes are in
[SPEAKER_01]: there but you know I think the sweet point
that I know the cats have inherited the
[SPEAKER_01]: sweet point is two years I smoked some
two-year-old Moroccan hash that was
[SPEAKER_01]: probably the best hash I've ever smoked
you know and right up there with and
[SPEAKER_01]: strength wise right up there with the best
isolators that I've smoked but but so to
[SPEAKER_00]: Frenchy's point that's huge because that
means that here's a product within the
[SPEAKER_00]: can't the broad cannabis product suite
yeah that actually gets better with age
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah and Frenchy creates a boutique
product that's like you just don't see it
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a it's a it's it's a lost art there's
people definitely that are trying to carry
[SPEAKER_01]: it out but it's like butchery butchery is
another one of those things how many I
[SPEAKER_01]: know butchery but how many people do you
know that they know how to break down
[SPEAKER_00]: animals well it's also I think one of the
interesting things I learned about
[SPEAKER_00]: butchery is like in the US supermarket we
have all these generic cuts but there's
[SPEAKER_00]: like innovation and cuts right and like we
we only gravitate to like five six
[SPEAKER_00]: different cuts that it's like finally
understanding that there are more cuts
[SPEAKER_00]: than the ones I always see in the grocery
store yeah and that they're actually
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty cool and good well and everywhere
you go in the world the cuts are different
[SPEAKER_01]: like yeah you go over to Europe they're
completely different from over here and
[SPEAKER_01]: then they're called different things and
the way they section is a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: differently but yeah I totally forget why
we were on the topic it's that girl's got
[SPEAKER_01]: cookies you're sucking but uh no so we
were talking about because Frenchy right
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a dying art it's something that will
be preserved by some but only a handful
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it's like these people are
stewards of the lost art of hash making
[SPEAKER_00]: well so I mean he's doing his courses so
do you feel like in those court like he
[SPEAKER_00]: spent what I love about his story is the
way I understand it is here's this crazy
[SPEAKER_00]: old French dude who spent 40 years like a
hummingbird going to every hash producing
[SPEAKER_00]: region of the world and learning each of
their respective hash making total
[SPEAKER_00]: methodologies and then which none of them
do like Moroccans aren't hanging out in
[SPEAKER_00]: Thailand right so he's like the one guy in
the world who's actually done that and now
[SPEAKER_00]: can synthesize like what do you like it's
it's like an MMA fighter who's fluent in
[SPEAKER_00]: like wrestling Mai Tai kickboxing Wing
Chun in the quality of his stuff I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: the price of it speaks for itself you know
if you're looking at buying it on the on
[SPEAKER_01]: the rec market in California the you know
it's phenomenal it stands up there right
[SPEAKER_01]: with the best like live resin for
extraction bubble you know there's some of
[SPEAKER_01]: these things in the quality it's just
amazing all right so you so talk about the
[SPEAKER_00]: things and the non-flower category that
you're smoking and liking oh man I got
[SPEAKER_01]: some amazing stuff so live rosin is my new
favorite where you know it's just puffco
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah yeah I'll get my let's give a little
plug we'll give a little plug maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll hook me up with one of these
someday so this is the live rosin so so I
[SPEAKER_01]: got some stuff well no this is actually a
butane that has the diamond separated a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit this is live rosin right here I
talked to John McKay nice John McKay good
[SPEAKER_00]: friend really nice guy work with him yeah
so we were taught I was asking it like one
[SPEAKER_00]: I was asking him about how much fresh
frozen material he's now doing but he was
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about a new process he has which I
don't know if he's talked to you has he
[SPEAKER_01]: talked to you I know all about well so so
you know so John and I flew up to Oregon
[SPEAKER_01]: with a bunch of other people with the
company I work with new bridge they flew
[SPEAKER_01]: us up there and they John gave a present
are you're working with you because he's
[SPEAKER_01]: with new bridge yeah I work with you all
right so you guys are like the same
[SPEAKER_01]: company we're the same company yeah John
and I yeah we're good guys so it's funny
[SPEAKER_01]: cuz so new bridge is like this this team
of like top industry elite people we got
[SPEAKER_01]: it Silas his names always weren't in dank
on Instagram but Silas is in my opinion
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the top cultivators in the world is
he the guy who started the company no he
[SPEAKER_01]: is not okay so he is the cultivator I do
genetics Eric Tran is the guy who started
[SPEAKER_01]: the company Eric is also industry elite
very business minded super professional
[SPEAKER_01]: and super calculating it's a great guy to
have on your side he yeah he's so you
[SPEAKER_00]: actually respect the guys who started the
company I do okay so yeah I'm thinking of
[SPEAKER_00]: like all the big like yeah like companies
and it's like all these finance guys and
[SPEAKER_00]: they roll up a bunch of other companies
and so he's a black market guy like me he
[SPEAKER_01]: came from the black Eric yeah okay so Eric
came well we all did yeah John John came
[SPEAKER_00]: from that company but a lot of the
companies it's like dudes who came from
[SPEAKER_01]: Goldman Sachs who came from wherever yeah
no and I think that's one thing that kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of separates us apart from some of these
other big companies it's industry people
[SPEAKER_01]: industry people running at the same we
were in the shadows together you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: especially you know Oakland was kind of an
innovative place in its own its own right
[SPEAKER_01]: Oakland kind of was a boundary-pushing
community the oakster dam you know we kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of paved the way for legalization you know
it's pretty impressive what's going on
[SPEAKER_01]: over there but with new bridge new bridge
is kind of pushing boundaries especially
[SPEAKER_01]: with putting together like these superstar
teams right so we got a lady who really
[SPEAKER_01]: knows what she's doing her name is B Scott
she runs the she's part of the team she's
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the team so what she does is she
runs the nurseries she does large-scale
[SPEAKER_01]: you know nursery production and she's all
about where she has roots in Oakland
[SPEAKER_01]: that's coming out and she has the Bay
Clonery and the Bay Clonery is in Santa
[SPEAKER_01]: Rosa 12,000 square foot facility that
should be ready later this year where I'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be working with her she's absolutely
amazing and how long has she been running
[SPEAKER_01]: a nursery for she's been I think around 10
years she's been working and then you know
[SPEAKER_01]: with cultivation and nursery but her
clones are by far like the best clones
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen so she understands the process
and she doesn't skip steps and I love her
[SPEAKER_00]: was it Voltron where like all the
individual robots came together as one big
[SPEAKER_01]: robot yeah and we're gonna create one
badass boutique company right that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the metaphor or analogy I'm
painting yeah and I feel like yeah and
[SPEAKER_00]: Eric is really he's basically Eric's like
I'm dope in this skill set yeah you got
[SPEAKER_00]: that you got the breeding and genetics you
got the nursery skills you got the
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever yeah okay so that's what the
company is all about and so you're all
[SPEAKER_00]: like everyone has equity and everyone is
exactly like Eric's the guy who started it
[SPEAKER_01]: but you're all this is the guy what Eric
is yeah he is he's he's the decision-maker
[SPEAKER_01]: the cheerleader so are loud seeds under
that umbrella so that well I can't really
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about right now so loud see it so
loud loud seas is going with another
[SPEAKER_01]: direction they were we're working it out
with the company called next green wave
[SPEAKER_01]: the acquiring of loud seeds so loud seeds
may go with them we'll see okay well
[SPEAKER_00]: that's big so that means that the company
your baby you may sell to someone else yes
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's funny because I have the ganja
farmer seed company I have green light
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics gunja farmer seed companies with
Marlon Asher it's our little collaboration
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're actually doing through new
bridge I have a new seed company coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out called ganja farmer seed company with
Marlon so some stuff you're doing with
[SPEAKER_00]: them through new bridge some stuff you're
doing separately right I do well I do
[SPEAKER_01]: consulting like for cultivos so I do
genetic consulting for them yeah I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: in talks with several other companies
abroad in here for genetic consulting so
[SPEAKER_00]: so talk about give me like a genetic
consulting like example or case study like
[SPEAKER_01]: you want so Columbia so Columbia is
interesting you know getting genetics down
[SPEAKER_01]: there Fino hunting potentially I think
there's there's big talks of Fino hunting
[SPEAKER_01]: and getting specific cultivars and stuff
that works within their climates I also do
[SPEAKER_00]: why are you still learning what works well
there I think they are still learning I
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't been down there so because at some
point you'll need to like be like this is
[SPEAKER_00]: the shit that will grow well here yeah for
sure you're perfect growing so so we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been talking about auto flowers in
Columbia and people are like why would you
[SPEAKER_01]: bring out of flowers down to Columbia I
also breed out of flowers that's one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the things I do right now which is unique
in the US right it is unique in the US but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's starting to become more popular
especially for large-scale cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: it's very but I'm not imagining that that
like Europe is bigger and auto flowering
[SPEAKER_01]: than the US or like historically
historically if it's a completely like it
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean in France and you'll see people
grow like not in France but like in
[SPEAKER_01]: Barcelona there's people in in their
apartments that have auto flowers just you
[SPEAKER_01]: know their porches outside where you can
look up and you see their auto flower
[SPEAKER_01]: plants so the typical grower in America
does not grow auto flowers they will go by
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized or they will go by regular but
the last thing most people do but it is
[SPEAKER_01]: catching up I mean I think you can see
statistically through some of these seed
[SPEAKER_01]: banks that are selling the auto flower
seeds like I so these guys are starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell more auto flower seeds and some of
these companies that make auto flower
[SPEAKER_01]: seeds in Europe you know they'd be 50% of
their sales in auto flower 50% and
[SPEAKER_01]: feminized and no regular so what's are you
so me I'm doing for large large scale for
[SPEAKER_01]: AG so that's auto flower I feel like is
the future for certain scenarios I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think it's right for everybody but I think
in in the given circumstance where you
[SPEAKER_01]: have problems with mold and mildew if you
have to tarp in specific times of year
[SPEAKER_00]: auto flowers are ideal so if like October
or like September October are super moist
[SPEAKER_01]: sure you want to come early you want to
come early yeah okay well auto flowers can
[SPEAKER_01]: also if you start them in May you can do
two seasons true yeah there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits I think there's people that are
afraid of bottle flowers they think
[SPEAKER_01]: they're shit I think for biomass they are
one of the most ideal situations
[SPEAKER_01]: especially if they're stabilized or
there's very little phenotypical variation
[SPEAKER_00]: so what's he smoking oh wait so yeah what
were we talking about one point we were
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about so live rosin so Silas is
the one who's turned me out really turned
[SPEAKER_01]: me on the live rosin especially in the
last like six months I always run an egg
[SPEAKER_01]: so trichome heavy extracts that's the
company he works with but he grows some of
[SPEAKER_01]: the best best cannabis I've seen on the
planet where does he grow he's gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: growing for new bridge so Silas no till
organic living soil absolutely amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: super super greasy pot like the cannabis
the flower is so greasy it's ridiculous
[SPEAKER_01]: like next level but where so where was he
growing so I believe he was going on a
[SPEAKER_01]: medical side over he's in California in
California all right in like Mendocino or
[SPEAKER_01]: no I think more towards the desert so in
the terpene profiles so so Silas the thing
[SPEAKER_01]: is is like B and Silas and I we we all
connect on this one level right where we
[SPEAKER_01]: all agree on GMO is amazing now I think
there's a lot of people out there I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know GMO cookies if you're familiar with a
garlic cookies it's a chem D times
[SPEAKER_01]: thin-knit Girl Scouts and it has a very
specific terpene profile that they that he
[SPEAKER_01]: gets from the chem D not from the cookies
the cookies add some back notes to it but
[SPEAKER_01]: it is just one of the it smells like dirty
armpits it smells like going to a Grateful
[SPEAKER_01]: Dead show on a hot day that's how I feel
about the smell it has like a cheese smell
[SPEAKER_01]: not not cheese no no more like more of
like a funk I think you can kind of smell
[SPEAKER_01]: it with this this right here it's it
almost burns your nose a little bit right
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's got that it smells good that
smells good right but it also yeah but it
[SPEAKER_01]: smells like good armpit yeah but yeah so I
feel like it's an acquired taste it's it's
[SPEAKER_01]: something that most new smokers don't
appreciate you know it's like if the cat
[SPEAKER_01]: piss is another one where I like just the
name turns people off they're like I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to smoke no cat piss we haven't seen
cat piss in a while like the real one but
[SPEAKER_01]: that was like super ammonia it's an nl5
haze yeah it was ammonia but the thing is
[SPEAKER_01]: is the the cat piss that we had 20 years
ago you would have a tenth of a gram in
[SPEAKER_01]: your pocket and you would be scrambling
around your room trying to find it because
[SPEAKER_01]: it smelled so strong there's no weed I
know that if you have a tenth of a gram
[SPEAKER_01]: right now tenth of a gram that it's gonna
smell your whole room up to where you
[SPEAKER_01]: start panicking because your parents are
gonna find it right so yeah it's funny and
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's the big the big step that
people are gonna do next I mean I feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like my buddy John that's up in Mendo he's
doing it I'm trying to do it we're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to go to these land race varieties and
incorporate them back in or at least
[SPEAKER_01]: closer to land race I feel like the stuff
that's going on with all the wedding cakes
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the the sherbert crosses and all
these new things they're great and people
[SPEAKER_01]: love them but what we need is genetic
diversity back into the cannabis it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the one thing that's missing and it's
the one thing that over time it causes
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic depression was and does that come
from something becoming super popular in
[SPEAKER_00]: the market wanting it and then everyone
thinking they need to cross with it to
[SPEAKER_00]: call it come up with their own version of
it oh yeah that's exactly what it is and
[SPEAKER_01]: so what happens is we either are putting
OGs or cookies on friggin everything it
[SPEAKER_01]: seems like everybody's doing that it's
like okay so you just put an OG on another
[SPEAKER_01]: OG and you know you got a new OG well it
doesn't work like that and then like Joan
[SPEAKER_00]: Rivers shoulder pads it goes out of style
as the 80s come to a close right and well
[SPEAKER_01]: and then the thing is is so many people
are like I only like cookies or I only
[SPEAKER_01]: like OG and I I have a very like open
palate I like all that I like good
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis doesn't matter whether it's a
haze or whether it's sour diesel or
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's OG or whether it's cookies if
it's good if it's grown properly you like
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis tapas a little bit of
everything oh I do and I like having that
[SPEAKER_01]: variety it's like over in Amsterdam when I
was over there last time we ended up in
[SPEAKER_01]: Spain and I got some really good gorilla
goo and the gorilla goo was phenomenal
[SPEAKER_01]: where I wanted to smoke it in the morning
and it was just such a strong smoke that I
[SPEAKER_01]: decided to switch over to Liberty Hayes
and I walk into the park we had an amazing
[SPEAKER_01]: time switching over and it's like the only
difference is really the terpenes right
[SPEAKER_01]: but absolutely going back to Hayes
absolutely amazing but part of the problem
[SPEAKER_01]: that they had was they basically loved
Hayes so much that was all they had over
[SPEAKER_01]: there for a long time too there was not a
lot of diversity I mean I think since he
[SPEAKER_01]: was bringing some stuff in they're
bringing some derbins and they're bringing
[SPEAKER_01]: some other unique things in but people
were like I want Hayes Dr. Grinspoon 26
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks okay well as you evaluate kind of
Europe generically and the US right what
[SPEAKER_00]: trends are you seeing well I see things
like history repeating itself here well
[SPEAKER_00]: start with Europe because you're saying
Hayes was their jam what is their jam now
[SPEAKER_01]: their jam is American strains they want so
they want to explore they want skittles
[SPEAKER_01]: okay they love skittles over there and you
know how can you know I have skittles in
[SPEAKER_01]: my bag I got both extract and I got flour
and I love skittles and who grew it what's
[SPEAKER_01]: that who grew it so the skittles that I
have in my bag was one of my my friends
[SPEAKER_01]: grew his little little small grow but the
extracts it came from a local place around
[SPEAKER_01]: here maybe in Vegas yeah it's some
California stuff okay so but but it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: skittles skittles sherbert people are
wanting they want high terpene profiles
[SPEAKER_01]: and they want unique in that's good yeah I
think over in Europe and in the States
[SPEAKER_01]: we're looking for that there's still a
little bit behind us so we kind of set the
[SPEAKER_01]: trend and then they try to scoop it up
like the California more than anybody sets
[SPEAKER_00]: a trend yeah I feel like well so so it's
interesting like I think of US chocolate
[SPEAKER_00]: versus European chocolate yeah the
Europeans are a little more sophisticated
[SPEAKER_00]: and have what I consider a better palette
for things like chocolate with cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: like I feel like here a everyone wanted
the highest THC so like there's the
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciation of sort of the full bouquet
and body of what you're smoking like a
[SPEAKER_00]: wine or whatever is I mean you do you
appreciate about your average person but
[SPEAKER_00]: did your average European have a better
appreciate like five ten twenty years ago
[SPEAKER_00]: a better appreciation for hash yeah that's
true perhaps you know they have an
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciation for hash on another level we
don't see that in the States we have
[SPEAKER_01]: appreciation for extracts but not like
that old-school hash and that old-school
[SPEAKER_01]: hash is kind of like smoking a cigar it's
got real nuances that if you don't smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: ash all the time it all just tastes the
same you know same thing with the cigar
[SPEAKER_01]: you you don't smoke a cigar you pick one
up it just tastes like a fucking cigar but
[SPEAKER_01]: back to the you know and it's funny
because I had a conversation with Lance I
[SPEAKER_01]: think a little bit about reference points
you know going through life with all the
[SPEAKER_01]: and breeding I'm a chef as well and so the
more things you taste the more reference
[SPEAKER_01]: points you have the more you understand
something and so real interesting and I
[SPEAKER_01]: feel like I breathe I try to breed by
reference points I try to cook and
[SPEAKER_01]: understand cultures by reference points by
having a broad number of reference points
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah I'm constantly smelling jars so like
this I'm constantly smelling these flavor
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles to see kind of what would what
would potentially go together you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you mix in that so I do some weird
stuff we rolled joints together of two
[SPEAKER_01]: strains and see if they taste good as well
as yeah a lot of that is fun too and
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes it's applicable and sometimes
it's not so so the you're right the
[SPEAKER_00]: Europeans are like wanting America sadly
wanting American stuff the thing is is so
[SPEAKER_01]: you look at what it takes to cultivate and
sell in Amsterdam compared to California
[SPEAKER_01]: it's very difficult the systems that you
like from a regulatory standpoint yeah I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean from a regulatory standpoint just
from a person wanting to acquire good
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis the process that goes through in
California and the process that goes
[SPEAKER_01]: through to get it to that same quality
standard in Amsterdam you rarely see that
[SPEAKER_01]: a triple plus that you have in California
in Amsterdam it's rare but it's also humid
[SPEAKER_01]: and cold and really really friggin cold
and it's also illegal to grow there so
[SPEAKER_01]: people are basically you know they don't
put people in jail but there's take all
[SPEAKER_01]: your stuff and they'll find you so it's
illegal to grow there whereas California
[SPEAKER_01]: people still have rooms in their houses
right and you know the the standards are
[SPEAKER_01]: higher it's funny though that the people
that were growing that mediocre stuff five
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago that were making money they're
not making money anymore so so what about
[SPEAKER_00]: in the US like are you seeing because one
of the things for example Kevin Jodry
[SPEAKER_00]: talks about is like you know different
markets have different wants right like
[SPEAKER_00]: the east you know I grew up selling in the
East Coast oh yeah so you grew up in Rhode
[SPEAKER_01]: Island Boston and then I went to Brown
yeah so so you guys like Sour Diesel and
[SPEAKER_01]: Chem Doc yeah pretty much exclusively like
Sour Diesel like me going to New York when
[SPEAKER_01]: I was younger it was like the Sour Diesel
was the best like people didn't give a
[SPEAKER_01]: shit about any OG nothing else Sour Diesel
was the one and you're paying sixty to a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred dollars an eighth straight up for
that stuff but are you seeing so what are
[SPEAKER_00]: you seeing either generically in the US
now so like where are the trends going so
[SPEAKER_01]: it used to be just like yeah five years
ago it was cookies OG basically Sour
[SPEAKER_01]: Diesel we had maybe some perps but it's
not specific right and that was the black
[SPEAKER_01]: market the white market is wedding cake
lava cake birthday cake and all these
[SPEAKER_01]: trends right and the thing is is like we
were breeding very stable genetics you
[SPEAKER_01]: know before 2012 we focused on like
stabilizing genetics releasing f4s
[SPEAKER_01]: releasing f5s not releasing f2s like that
was kind of against what we believed in at
[SPEAKER_01]: the time but nowadays people want f1s and
that's it and so they want the latest and
[SPEAKER_01]: greatest and three months down the road
they want something they kick that one of
[SPEAKER_01]: the curve and they're like now I want this
and it's because the white market broke
you you you you you you
