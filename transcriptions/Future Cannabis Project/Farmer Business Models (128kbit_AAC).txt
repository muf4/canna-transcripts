[SPEAKER_05]: Casey, we've been talking about,
you know, big ag, big pharma, and also the
[SPEAKER_05]: corporate reality.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, a lot of us have corporations,
but when we're referring to the corporate
[SPEAKER_05]: entity, we're talking about, you know,
mergers and things that are much larger
[SPEAKER_05]: than anything that we've dealt with as
farmers or as small business owners or
[SPEAKER_05]: even as educators.
[SPEAKER_05]: Casey, could you talk a little bit about
the uneasy compromise in this industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so my farm is about an hour from
here, born and raised on the mountain,
[SPEAKER_01]: and in 2014, you know, we're doing the
farmers markets, we're doing the
[SPEAKER_01]: collective, and we find ourselves suddenly
very public.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got the alphabet soup of various
media arriving on the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the first, like, significant
media interaction I ever did was CNN,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the story title was Dope in the
Drought.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was essentially like, hey,
your team's down by about nine runs,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's nobody on base, you got two outs,
you want to swing the bat or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, so for us at the time,
you know, being food producers,
[SPEAKER_01]: being, you know, farmers market vegetable
farmers, CSA farmers, and small scale
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, very small scale cannabis,
you know, we really felt that there was
[SPEAKER_01]: this typification of cannabis farming
happening in the media that was very
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, it was a very difficult
decision in terms of that whole going
[SPEAKER_01]: public process, but suddenly we found
ourselves like very much in the limelight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And still to this day, you know,
a big part of my social change agenda,
[SPEAKER_01]: my focus, my goals is to be able to engage
in a conversation that reaches as far out
[SPEAKER_01]: as possible to be able to speak to the
values that I hold and the beliefs that I
[SPEAKER_01]: have around food production, around small
farming, around regenerative practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the difficult part of that is that
when you wade into that center,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's public policy, whether it's
public media, there's a lot of compromise
[SPEAKER_01]: inherent to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, for me, one of the great,
you know, philosophical and deeply
[SPEAKER_01]: personal questions is like, where,
you know, where can the compromises be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are the compromises?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we accept those compromises?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an emotional roller coaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are times where I'm like,
you know what, fuck it, I quit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are times where I see something
or, you know, or I receive feedback like,
[SPEAKER_01]: you said this thing that really touched me
from, you know, from Michigan,
[SPEAKER_01]: from Illinois, you know, from all over the
country in this broader perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the things that's very,
very important for us as farmers is to
[SPEAKER_01]: recognize that we all have different
context and we all have different reality
[SPEAKER_01]: under which we find ourselves and we make
decisions accordingly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think there's a tendency with many
social movements and cannabis is a social
[SPEAKER_01]: movement to end up in a place that's very
dogmatic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when we do that, we take away
something that was possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, you know, a big part of my
focus is local food security and food
[SPEAKER_01]: systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I look at ways that I can help to
promote local food security and food sales
[SPEAKER_01]: for food farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a big part of my initial
foray into public policy work was this
[SPEAKER_01]: idea that food farming and cannabis
farming here on the North Coast have often
[SPEAKER_01]: gone hand in hand, you know, going to the
farmers markets and realizing after a
[SPEAKER_01]: while, like all these other old timer
farmers are all totally growing weed too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I'm like hiding around the corner
smoking my joints and they're like,
[SPEAKER_01]: hey, so are you going to share or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was a big realization for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's part of what drove me into the
public policy conversation was wanting to
[SPEAKER_01]: see food farmers have access to the
regulated cannabis market to see it
[SPEAKER_01]: continue as this support tool that it has
been for our communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of those things are still what
drive me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I look at the landscape of the current
cannabis regulatory environment and the
[SPEAKER_01]: current marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's very, very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in terms of being here in a
solutions-oriented perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, what I see are, for lack of
better terminology, organized by buyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I see that we still do not have not
been able to achieve the role of organized
[SPEAKER_01]: seller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we build that out moving
forward?
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of those points where,
you know, for me, I'm very comfortable
[SPEAKER_01]: doing media interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm very comfortable talking to the
government.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a terrible businessman.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of one of these like we
each bring our skill sets to this puzzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I sort of have this analogy,
my brain lives in analogies, of there's
[SPEAKER_01]: this puzzle and we all got different
pieces of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somebody took the box away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all trying to figure out,
like, what does this puzzle look like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are the pieces?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who are the pieces?
[SPEAKER_01]: What pieces do we need to still pull in?
[SPEAKER_01]: And how do we evolve into this arena in
which, as small farmers, we can be
[SPEAKER_01]: organized so that we can negotiate with,
on a scale, the organized buyers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at this point, as a farmer,
you know, for me, I faced this hard choice
[SPEAKER_01]: of like, well, you know, I had a business
model that was a farmers market business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had a business model.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were doing the collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: It worked really well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now I'm a wholesale farmer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can choose to either sell my product
or not sell my product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I choose to not sell my product,
I go out of business and get a different
[SPEAKER_01]: job.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of those realities pile up on us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, it's the emotional roller
coaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: Any given day, like, I can totally do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're all in that at the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, I think that's one of the things
that's really important about these
[SPEAKER_01]: gatherings is that, you know, we're all at
different places on the emotional roller
[SPEAKER_01]: coaster on any given day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the gathering gives us the ability to
modulate and go back forth to continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: do the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: So long story short, you know,
what I see looking at the playing field is
[SPEAKER_01]: there are giants.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we've talked about these huge
multinational corporations, the publicly
[SPEAKER_01]: funded marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are giants within our space which
are massively larger than us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I wish I could say,
like, I've got the answer silver bullet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the reality that we're all facing
and trying to figure out how to navigate
[SPEAKER_01]: as very small players in a world that is
essentially based on corporate and
[SPEAKER_01]: government superstructures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one, we're trying to find our
places within it and figure out how to
[SPEAKER_01]: navigate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But two, we're trying to figure out how to
change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's the old saying, like,
don't change a paradigm, build a new one,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the old one will cease to exist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I definitely resonate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for me, in my opinion, in my role,
I've always been more of a centrist.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's been my job to go and talk to
policymakers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And generally to be able to come to an
agreement, yeah, I see where you're at.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, this is our compromise in the
center.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think it again comes down to each
of us has our own specific path and our
[SPEAKER_01]: work that we must do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where we are called to fit into that
puzzle, we must find that place and go
[SPEAKER_01]: forth and do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, one of the things that
I've struggled with a great deal from a
[SPEAKER_01]: personal perspective is the judgment that
comes with and from this process in which
[SPEAKER_01]: we're dealing with both ideology,
we're dealing with business, and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to figure out how to navigate those
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that for me is the heaviest burden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that is the hardest about
the process is that I often don't feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like I have the right answers,
but I feel like I have to continue on the
[SPEAKER_01]: path to try to figure them out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the same for all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so one of the things that I really
want to call in for our community is to
[SPEAKER_01]: remain supportive and to hold space and
understanding for each of us for where we
[SPEAKER_01]: are and be able to come to a commonality
around that and continue to move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this whole thing is, you know,
watching the changes in the last five
[SPEAKER_01]: years has really ripped us apart in some
ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think if we're not able to create
space for people to be where they are
[SPEAKER_01]: while we try to put together what we want
to be, we're going to have a really tough
[SPEAKER_01]: time with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Casey, have you found the formal
cooperative model in California to help
[SPEAKER_06]: bring your larger voice to independent
farmers?
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the difficulties with this whole
process is that public policy is always
[SPEAKER_01]: iterative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we started off with the
very vague SB 420 collective cooperative.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 2016, 2017, I'm part of a project
that's operating an agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: cooperative.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was, you know, it's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's sun kissed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's Oregon Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a ton of like big ag co-ops
that, you know, Pacific Coast producers
[SPEAKER_01]: controls 80 percent of fruit packing and
tomato packing in the country and from
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're cooperative, farmer owned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we moved into this this
iteration of like, yeah, we're going to do
[SPEAKER_01]: cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the state said, well,
actually, we made a cooperative rule and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can only be four acres in cultivation
to be an in the quarter to your
[SPEAKER_01]: cooperative can't exceed that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've kind of gone back to the
drawing board in which, well, OK,
[SPEAKER_01]: can we do a C Corp that is, you know,
that has B Corp principles and cooperative
[SPEAKER_01]: bylaws, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is very much the solution I
hope to see in us becoming an organized
[SPEAKER_01]: seller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the hard thing about it for me is
having gone through three iterations of
[SPEAKER_01]: it, like I've come to realize,
like I want to join it and follow in it
[SPEAKER_01]: and put energy towards it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't lead it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's really, again, you know,
I said it in the panel earlier today,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm going to call it out again,
like those of us in this community who
[SPEAKER_01]: have those business skills to lead that
type of project, like we need you because
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that's the biggest part of it is
that as farmers were pulled in a million
[SPEAKER_01]: directions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you start a cooperative,
it's a whole other layer of business that
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as farmers were like, man,
I have my own business I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think that this is the
time and opportunity for us to organize
[SPEAKER_01]: with the limited resources that we have to
try to become an organized seller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, you have to be
really careful in that conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not talking about violating antitrust
laws, but that we be able to engage in
[SPEAKER_01]: aggregation and grading.
[SPEAKER_01]: If as small farmers we had aggregation and
grading so we could say these facilities
[SPEAKER_01]: have this weed at this grade, that would
change the marketplace completely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's something that given the number
of locally owned businesses that we have
[SPEAKER_01]: now, who have facilities, you know,
we're starting to have the pieces on the
[SPEAKER_01]: board to be able to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just requires enough leadership and
impetus to be able to draw those pieces
[SPEAKER_01]: together into something cogent.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really the difference between the
big corporate structure.
[SPEAKER_05]: They have this, you know, bottom line.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the thing about our community is that
our line is bottomless.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are going to be forever trying to
figure out solutions and how we're going
[SPEAKER_05]: to be putting medicine out to the people
because it's what it is that we inherently
[SPEAKER_05]: do.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're here to do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And as a collective, we have to keep our
revenue streams rolling in a way that is
[SPEAKER_05]: productive because when each farm is doing
well financially, then the entire
[SPEAKER_05]: community is doing well financially.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I wanted to start to move into the
idea of creating revenue and revenue
[SPEAKER_05]: streams as a collective.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one thing that I had thought about
that I think could be very poignant and
[SPEAKER_05]: very accessible to us right away is that
many, many, many of us have secondary
[SPEAKER_05]: products that we produce on our farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whether we produce chicken eggs,
whether we produce gorgeous jewelry,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether we produce consulting services,
education, whether we are coming to your
[SPEAKER_05]: local zone and area as a group,
I believe that we can take all of these
[SPEAKER_05]: secondary products that we have and put it
on an international marketplace that is a
[SPEAKER_05]: pure certified marketplace that could be
easily put up, that people could ship
[SPEAKER_05]: products from their own location.
[SPEAKER_05]: They could, you know, go online to book
their consulting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just think that I would like to put
that on the front burner as a discussion
[SPEAKER_05]: in moving forward for this collective and
start talking to the people here in this
[SPEAKER_05]: room that are absolute wizards at helping
to create something.
[SPEAKER_05]: This could be education forward,
education number one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of people in this room
who already have incredible successes with
[SPEAKER_05]: multiple products.
[SPEAKER_05]: As well as secondary products outside of
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Forrest and Patricia, you guys are
really on top of it with your secondary
[SPEAKER_05]: products and what you offer from the
community.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you talk a little bit about that and
how you can see that as something to move
[SPEAKER_05]: for in the collective and as individual
farmers?
[SPEAKER_07]: I love that this got brought up because I
do actually want to bring this up before
[SPEAKER_07]: that really on this international
marketplace, we should be as part of
[SPEAKER_07]: education and as part of what we are
allowed to do is be selling other products
[SPEAKER_07]: such as tea blends and, you know,
using the diversity that you have on your
[SPEAKER_07]: farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not just tea blends.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can be creating canned products and
ferments and all these different creations
[SPEAKER_07]: that you do.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't even have to be with food.
[SPEAKER_07]: It can be some kind of blend or some kind
of wizardy or magic that you truly embody
[SPEAKER_07]: and can put out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So like on our farm, we have a lot of
products that I sell mostly at one place
[SPEAKER_07]: which is a little co-op in our town.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we hope to start extending it like the
tincture making and the herbal tea blends
[SPEAKER_07]: and fermented food products from our farm.
[SPEAKER_07]: Salves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anything that we can get creative with and
that does lead in part to the education
[SPEAKER_07]: because there are so many people and times
that I've heard from city folk who I work
[SPEAKER_07]: with and I grew up in the city so I have
that kind of connection where people just
[SPEAKER_07]: want to be tapped into a different source
of medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not just about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's food as medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's herbs as medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's earth medicine, spirit medicine.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's all these different facets of what
we're doing on our farms that connect us
[SPEAKER_07]: back.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we can share and put it out there as
part of the story that it's not just one
[SPEAKER_07]: little portion.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all of it encompassed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Kate and Bobby got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You all really are doing a lot of multiple
products in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're really diversifying your brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're creating more products than I've
seen a lot of other people create.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm seeing huge successes.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how can that help other farmers in
moving further into the industry and for
[SPEAKER_05]: the success of multiple products?
[SPEAKER_08]: OK.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm a silversmith by trade.
[SPEAKER_08]: I haven't quite figured out the link
between cannabis and plants and
[SPEAKER_08]: silversmithing yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's kind of something that remains
very close to my heart but very much on
[SPEAKER_08]: the back burner.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we primarily started out producing
flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: From there we moved into extracts.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do CO2 because we were finding we
needed more revenue streams.
[SPEAKER_08]: So currently we produce a line of THC
products and a separate line of hemp CBD
[SPEAKER_08]: products.
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason for this is because the THC
products are not, I have a hard time
[SPEAKER_08]: distributing them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our market is mostly the end consumer.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are in a few stores.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will be gaining momentum in 2020.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just got product liability insurance.
[SPEAKER_08]: This process took us over six months and
it was just a whole lot of back and forth.
[SPEAKER_08]: And now we're like, insured all over the
place, like in case something happens,
[SPEAKER_08]: everybody can feel good about knowing that
our products have insurances.
[SPEAKER_08]: So with that being said, we have picked up
a few new stores.
[SPEAKER_08]: We create a salve.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's like our main product.
[SPEAKER_08]: Actually, every product we've created has
been for his mother.
[SPEAKER_08]: She's basically like our guinea pig.
[SPEAKER_08]: She has more ailments than anyone can
imagine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've always been making things and
testing them out on her.
[SPEAKER_08]: We started with a salve.
[SPEAKER_08]: It fixed her sciatic nerve.
[SPEAKER_08]: One of our other products, we make a
elderberry-medicated sleep elixir.
[SPEAKER_08]: This got her off sleep medications.
[SPEAKER_08]: This has gotten several family members off
of sleep medication.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then these people tell other people,
so yes, we should be mostly selling to
[SPEAKER_08]: people with a medical card.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is not always possible.
[SPEAKER_08]: So our products are kind of expanding this
way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm able to make CBD products and sell
those over the internet.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we just keep diversifying.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is how we're growing.
[SPEAKER_08]: We do other things.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have vegetables for sale sometimes.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're working to open a farm stand on the
property this year so we can give people
[SPEAKER_08]: an address to come to because meeting up
and delivering is just not really fitting
[SPEAKER_08]: in our schedule.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if you can come to our farm and buy our
products from us, and we can stop in the
[SPEAKER_08]: middle of the day and sell them to you,
like yes, this is what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or ancient green farm.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is that the same product label?
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: The products are all branded under ancient
green farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: I do all the product labeling and
marketing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I do put my art school degree to use.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can have the greatest product in the
world, but if your label looks like shit,
[SPEAKER_08]: you're really not going to sell it.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is something I will get to.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have a lot of ideas.
[SPEAKER_08]: It comes down to time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Creating also a brand that's really
recognizable.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm looking in this room and I'm seeing
incredible recognizable brands and people
[SPEAKER_05]: that have put out a lot of energy to
create a brand that people see and want to
[SPEAKER_05]: have.
[SPEAKER_05]: Steve and Quanine, you all have an
incredibly recognizable brand and I know
[SPEAKER_05]: that it's the both of you and Quanine.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're definitely a lot of the backbone of
this.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'd love for you all to talk a little
bit about how other companies here in this
[SPEAKER_05]: room can put out a brand that is really
recognizable and that the community is
[SPEAKER_05]: asking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It kind of touches on what you caught me
off guard with earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Building a brand is extremely important,
especially if you don't have a storefront.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to be able to get your product
to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: If no one knows my lavender versus Joe
Blow's lavender, it's really hard for me
[SPEAKER_00]: to get it in a store if they don't want
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So building a brand that people can trust
has been key for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to give an idea of where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started off in Nevada about five years
ago when this whole regulatory system
[SPEAKER_00]: really kicked off and got really
stringent.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, microbial testing was just this
horrible thing that no one could really
[SPEAKER_00]: get past.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even the synthetic hydro guys are
having a hard time, let alone indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, we stayed true to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We adapted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's really important in this
industry right now is just being able to
[SPEAKER_00]: adapt to some of these regulations and not
being so stuck in your ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: But anyways, so yeah, we designed this
trustworthy brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were really able to connect with the
local scene at a more organic way versus
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to go big and get billboards and TV
ads and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would do simple things like shirts and
hats.
[SPEAKER_03]: Something we did at the beginning that was
pretty cool that no one really did was we
[SPEAKER_03]: would host little gatherings like these at
dispensaries called Know Your Farmer
[SPEAKER_03]: because a lot of the people in Nevada,
in Las Vegas, needed education as to what
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis was, the way we grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we, these gatherings, inviting the
community to the dispensaries and teaching
[SPEAKER_03]: them about permaculture, teaching them our
methods, what we did to be dam pure,
[SPEAKER_03]: clean-grain certified, and just growing
clean cannabis was a key thing to getting
[SPEAKER_03]: our brand out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just still to this day, I think 70% of
our consumers are still local,
[SPEAKER_03]: so getting the local communities involved
was a key thing to getting our brand out
[SPEAKER_03]: there and loyalty.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's one of the things that I can think
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that and producing a good crop,
a good crop, a good branding.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard someone say having a good
packaging is obviously key not to go
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, you really gotta dress your
product up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's market is extremely competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also taking into consideration when
you're putting all that effort into
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging, make sure that you're also
still thinking regeneratively and how can
[SPEAKER_00]: we minimal or keep our carbon footprint
low as possible at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: make a statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And right now we have the attention of
more young people that want to go into
[SPEAKER_05]: farming than ever before.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of a sudden now cannabis has become
this beautiful amazing catalyst for young
[SPEAKER_05]: farmers to want to go out there and learn
about planting crops and wanting to do it
[SPEAKER_05]: right.
[SPEAKER_05]: They know that there's problems within the
big ag model and they wanna do it
[SPEAKER_05]: correctly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's so many problems and hoops
that we have to jump through in order to
[SPEAKER_05]: become a regulated cannabis seller.
[SPEAKER_05]: But one thing that we can do when we first
start our farms is we can be producing
[SPEAKER_05]: food.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there's a lot of you here in this room
that are producing food.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know that that sometimes is often
the backbone of how we're able to pay our
[SPEAKER_05]: mortgages and how we're able to move,
paying for the paperwork basically of
[SPEAKER_05]: becoming regulated in the cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_05]: So Daniel Stein, I'd love for you to talk
for a minute about producing food.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, great.
[SPEAKER_05]: Producing food on your farm that's helping
your family and not only bringing
[SPEAKER_05]: fertility in the soil but fertility in
your economics as well.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, economically it was kind of the
opposite of what you were just saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: The cannabis supported getting our food
farm and that business model to a point
[SPEAKER_02]: where it was actually a viable business.
[SPEAKER_02]: I started about 25 years ago, food farming
on a little lettuce farm in Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_02]: The same lettuce farm that Daniel of
Radical Herbs also farmed on a long time
[SPEAKER_02]: ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I was passionate about it and I loved
it but it didn't buy me any weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I started growing weed around the same
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And noticed that that could supplement my
income enough so that I could have that
[SPEAKER_02]: lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we've been doing a commercial
production food farm about an hour west of
[SPEAKER_02]: here in Bryseland for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we started really small with the space
that we had doing a lot of sprouts,
[SPEAKER_02]: doing sunflower sprouts and pea shoots and
sauerkraut and things like that that we
[SPEAKER_02]: could on a small scale while also devoting
the small amount of area we had to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've expanded slowly trying to
incorporate what we consider best
[SPEAKER_02]: practices the whole time.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the last eight years we discovered no
till and trying to implement a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: these regenerative practices on a
production scale of food farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: And are finding it the most rewarding
thing in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last night I almost called Brassica into
the circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a gentleman that did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every time we were talking about
potatoes, which came up a lot,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was just like, and the broccoli that
goes on top of them with some butter and
[SPEAKER_02]: cream.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because this time of year there's like,
this is this testament to the soil we've
[SPEAKER_02]: built.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've never seen anything like it where
the Brassicas we grew up in the summer
[SPEAKER_02]: when we were busy with our kids and taking
care of our house and all this homestead
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff sat in start trays in the greenhouse
for such a long time that they were almost
[SPEAKER_02]: dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: They looked all purple.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were nutrient deficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: We put them in this living soil out in the
farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we do about an acre of this kind of
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we put them in and forgot about them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there was a drought.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't have any water to water all
through the fall until it recently rained.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have cauliflower and broccoli heads
that are the size of my head.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cabbages and all this food for us
through the winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're not doing it as much
commercially anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the food and the way you get rewarded
in the quality of your cannabis from doing
[SPEAKER_02]: these practices is the same for food.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have this market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do two farmers markets.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we feed a lot of people that come to
us first when they come to the farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: market because you can taste this quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can taste the medicine in food that's
grown in these systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a natural overlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the challenges with it right
now in the California market is I'd love
[SPEAKER_02]: to be selling cannabis to the same people
I'm selling food to because they taste it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They understand that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that naturally bridges across to
what's this other product you're growing
[SPEAKER_02]: and how's that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're working on solutions for that
too.
[SPEAKER_05]: Food be thy medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: So totally important.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also Blair, Claire, you all are also doing
a lot of secondary products as well as
[SPEAKER_05]: ethical raising of livestock for meat and
vegetables.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'd love to talk to you about it too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi, everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Blair from Radical Herbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, totally everything you said
really resonates about growing food.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think there's a lot of farmers out
there these days in commodity farming and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything who have to talk about having a
second job to fund their farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I like to say we get to farm to be
able to farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think that's a beautiful gift
that cannabis has been able to give to us.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a very diversified farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: We raise sheep, cows, chickens,
sheep for wool and meat.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a variety of vegetables that we
grow and herbs as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do our little farmers market out in
Kovalo.
[SPEAKER_04]: And sometimes we don't quite get there
right on time.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we always have a line at our booth and
people are constantly telling us that
[SPEAKER_04]: they're addicted to our vegetables.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, me too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's people calling us when it's
raining just the other day because we
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't do farmers market prepping for
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just needing to get their vegetables
that week.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's such a good feeling.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that is in cannabis,
we're disconnected in that way with the
[SPEAKER_04]: way that the system is.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not being able to be face to face
with the consumers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that there's a beautiful story
to tell there and a beautiful connection.
[SPEAKER_04]: That in contrast, you can see I think we
have a lot to gain and learn from how just
[SPEAKER_04]: the organic vegetable production is
comparing cage free chickens versus
[SPEAKER_04]: pasture raised chickens.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have amazing imagery that we can use,
sun grown versus indoor or smart pots
[SPEAKER_04]: versus in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like people see that imagery, I think it
would easily tell a story of like what
[SPEAKER_04]: we're doing that's different.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just like people can taste that and
what we're producing, they taste it in the
[SPEAKER_04]: vegetables and the cannabis and the meat
and everything else.
[SPEAKER_05]: Casey, you've also been doing a bunch of
CSA stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's sort of a whole other
commitment that you make to your community
[SPEAKER_05]: in that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Could you tell us about it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think one of the things
that's very important to me in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: this local food security question is the
fact that it inherently builds community.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in this last few years,
in this time of transition, the farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: market has been kind of one of those
anchor points for us where like we all get
[SPEAKER_01]: together and like sometimes we're having
the same conversation again and again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's did you hear what the county did?
[SPEAKER_01]: But but but but it's we're still coming
together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I think that for a lot of
us, cannabis was the portal back to
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so as we walk through that portal,
we see that it becomes this ever expanding
[SPEAKER_01]: bounty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, farming is a huge amount of
work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, Daniel and Taylor and us
are, you know, we've kind of been this
[SPEAKER_01]: funny mirror image, northern Mendo,
southern Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And seeing, you know, you get to a certain
point and you see like, holy shit,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is working.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just, you know, for instance,
we just got a plow and a rotary plow that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm using to put in swales and I'm
gathering up seeds from all over the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, I can gather up two dozen,
three dozen, four dozen different species
[SPEAKER_01]: and put them in the in the swales.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you see biodiversity become self
replicating.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that those types of systems
create foundations on the farm for
[SPEAKER_01]: diversity in crops and diversity in value
added products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then from that foundation,
how do you get it to the consumer?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the CSA model has always appealed
to me a lot because there's no choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no choice involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's whatever I harvested that day.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what goes in the CSA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, and it can be difficult from the
consumer perspective because it's exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't get a choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't like eggplants,
and I put eggplants in three weeks in a
[SPEAKER_01]: row.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but one of the things that I've really
become fascinated by is this idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: institutional CSA purchases in which
working with a cannabis company or a
[SPEAKER_01]: hospital or a school district or,
you know, any place in which employees
[SPEAKER_01]: come to every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: If part of the employee benefit or
wellness program is a CSA purchase,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it takes out that, you know,
for the, for the average consumer buying a
[SPEAKER_01]: CSA, you're always stacking up the
valuation of I paid 20 bucks for this and
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like eggplants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe it's not so good for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it's part of your employee benefit
program, then you essentially don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: that valuation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you say to yourself, well,
either I'm going to eat it or not,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I'm going to try to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I, and this bag comes every week from
the farmer's perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: I take all the stuff and I drop it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to do distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to do billing.
[SPEAKER_01]: All I have to do is provide it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's a significant package it into
something that people can take home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that changes the dynamic
dramatically in terms of from my farm
[SPEAKER_01]: having to do a bunch of individual
accounts and individual interactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, you know, Bob didn't make it to
the farmer's market because he was busy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bob went to work on Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when the thing was at work,
when he left work on Friday, then he can
[SPEAKER_01]: take it home.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, the CSA model in terms
of, of looking at systems thinking,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do we fit into this modern bifurcated
convenience driven society with the types
[SPEAKER_01]: of products that we produce?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's something that is,
is to me very important.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you look at value ads,
like right now in the, in the winter
[SPEAKER_01]: local, the local food system in the
winter, there's the, it's wide open.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's not enough production and
there's all kinds of value ads that can be
[SPEAKER_01]: sold.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for instance, like we do salty
Susie seasoning salts and we bag up,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we dry out herbs all season and
then we mix them with salt and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and sell them in the winter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's, you know, there's all
kinds of little niche, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: we used to do sour, like Daniel said,
sauerkraut at market is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so essentially just figuring out like,
these are the things that I want to do for
[SPEAKER_01]: myself that I like to consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet other people would like to also.
[SPEAKER_05]: Talking about all of these value added
products is, and, and, and the thread that
[SPEAKER_05]: we have between all of our value added
products and, and something that we're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to wrap up this session with and go
to lunch is Holly, you, you, you were
[SPEAKER_05]: talking to me and I know a lot of the work
that you have and putting forward is how
[SPEAKER_05]: do we achieve a higher value added product
by utilizing this stream of ethics that we
[SPEAKER_05]: call regenerative at this time,
put it on our packaging or, or how can we
[SPEAKER_05]: better highlight that to help us out in,
in gaining better revenue streams?
[SPEAKER_06]: Certainly the certification, your
certification, the dump your certification
[SPEAKER_06]: mark, the sun and earth mark, these
certification marks that are able to get
[SPEAKER_06]: out to a broader audience helps to inform
the consumer.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, I think that Appalachians are
going to provide a broader framework for
[SPEAKER_06]: the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: At helping to identify cannabis that is
produced in alignment with the environment
[SPEAKER_06]: and at the same time to protect our
practices.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is this the, should I talk about
Appalachians now or is that tomorrow?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I, I really believe that Appalachians
are going to be the best framework for
[SPEAKER_06]: putting the certifications and putting the
farms together and gaining recognition
[SPEAKER_06]: very easily for the consumer, very easily
at the retail space.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, I'm sorry, my expertise is not in
economics.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think I have a lot to say about
this other than I think Appalachians are
[SPEAKER_06]: going to be a very good tool for
everybody, consumer and producer and to
[SPEAKER_06]: help us to elevate the value of the
primary and secondary products.
[SPEAKER_06]: We see it in, with other agricultural
products that are produced even in
[SPEAKER_06]: Appalachians, even if they're not produced
by those methods that are in the
[SPEAKER_06]: Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_06]: So excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you all so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going to wrap up this first session
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So much information.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll be able to go have lunch.
Thank you.
