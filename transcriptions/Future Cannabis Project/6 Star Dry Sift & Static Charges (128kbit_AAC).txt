[SPEAKER_05]: Pre-roll is two or just flour?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've been sort of talk about what
you're excited like?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you been doing it for a while?
[SPEAKER_01]: Bubble.
[SPEAKER_01]: All kinds of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not solvent-based hash or rosin really,
but like hash, you know like resin,
[SPEAKER_01]: either dry sift or ice water.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very Frenchy brown.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's kind of what I did before like so
when I was like you know like 20 years old
[SPEAKER_01]: and we were in music school and we went
we're like into classical music in Europe
[SPEAKER_01]: was like we were all about you know Europe
and doing it how they do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were I've been making hash like
that before I even knew about Frenchy or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything like that where you're like but I
would I would put it so he's not doing dry
[SPEAKER_01]: no but so this is what I would do is I
take my dry sift and I put it in like like
[SPEAKER_01]: a little like a bag like a plastic bag
right and then I would fold that bag up
[SPEAKER_01]: really tight around the resin and then I'd
wrap that in a piece of paper and tape it
[SPEAKER_01]: up and I get the paper soaking wet and I'd
put that in the oven so that it didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: burn right and I put it in there for like
a little bit on really low and then I
[SPEAKER_01]: would roll it with a rolling pin I put in
the freezer and I take it out and I do it
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple times and the thing is pretty
much the same thing you know it would be
[SPEAKER_01]: like whatever I could get from my grinder
what you know what I mean like that's kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of how it started and I didn't roll splits
and you know that's what I like so you
[SPEAKER_01]: know like hash I've always just been into
hash and then once we got into farming
[SPEAKER_01]: we're like got more into like good hash
and and doing a lot of ice water but then
[SPEAKER_05]: you can't do that with the current
regulations as a farm you know so I mean I
[SPEAKER_01]: just love hash but I want to like you know
like I want to make good hash and I want
[SPEAKER_01]: to share that with people but I also you
know I don't know if I want to get another
[SPEAKER_01]: license to do that I don't think it's
worth it to do that for just my farm you
[SPEAKER_01]: know but the dry save I can create like I
can basically make a similar it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: equally pure product you know like we're
isolating to ninety nine point nine nine
[SPEAKER_05]: percent pure resin lands and so it's very
beautiful some will be better for dry sift
[SPEAKER_01]: for sure but the the cool thing is with
the cleaning of the dry sift we're able to
[SPEAKER_01]: use we're able to work with a lot of
strains that we've couldn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: work with in ice water because well so in
ice water if you have a very very greasy
[SPEAKER_01]: melty strain with a thin wax membrane you
have to be very careful to not damage
[SPEAKER_01]: those resin glands like in the washing
because if you do they're going to break
[SPEAKER_01]: and they're just going to stick to your
material and they're not even going to end
[SPEAKER_01]: up in your yields and so a lot of hash
makers are like like really sand sandier
[SPEAKER_01]: strains because they break off and they go
through the bags easier and stuff like
[SPEAKER_01]: that so we're able to actually dry you
know these oilier resin heads and still
[SPEAKER_05]: make a full melt it's kind of a secret
proprietary thing yeah I mean I will share
[SPEAKER_01]: it I don't know if it's like yeah I might
as well share it with you we're gonna do
[SPEAKER_01]: it like we're gonna have the edge for so
long Carla says I don't know I'll share it
[SPEAKER_05]: with you someday once we get it out I
understand I mean that's what it's like a
[SPEAKER_02]: home is an interesting thing all by itself
just as far as I'm concerned this idea of
[SPEAKER_02]: like I want to share these certain things
but there's all these times and places
[SPEAKER_05]: that make sense and like for me yeah I
mean you can find the info on the internet
[SPEAKER_02]: for sure well it makes sense for you guys
but like I'm just kind of information sure
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean it's hard to say you know what I
mean because it's like well we could have
[SPEAKER_00]: you know an edge really trying to focus on
quality and on on picking at the right
[SPEAKER_00]: time and if you're interested in actually
producing something with your biomass or
[SPEAKER_00]: with like your seconds or like other than
you know smokable flower and if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: into into concentrates and hash is a
beautiful thing and dry stiff is amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're not even having to use the
water you're really doing like the least
[SPEAKER_01]: processing possible when you start using
water for non-farming things you get into
[SPEAKER_01]: like the Department of Public Health and
so it's a different kind of inspection
[SPEAKER_01]: level on your farm that you know depending
on the size of your farm may or may not be
[SPEAKER_01]: you know worth it so dry so it is a great
way to go and essentially you know we're
[SPEAKER_01]: using a tumbler and we're we're doing a
cleaning on that so I'm like a paddle guy
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've also done some interesting
experiments with for making vortexes
[SPEAKER_01]: through various means different things you
know like I'm definitely so we have like a
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like a stainless steel cone bottom
brewing tank yeah and really depending on
[SPEAKER_01]: what I'm doing I would will yeah like a
first like exactly like a brewing tank
[SPEAKER_01]: with it and then I'll have like the little
thing and it has like a nice wide valves
[SPEAKER_01]: so it comes out really easily and yeah and
then you know there's a we'll put like a
[SPEAKER_01]: grade inside so it doesn't all drop into
the cone and then like kind of like a
[SPEAKER_01]: standard hash machines Frenchies doing but
then we do a hand stir in that
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah yeah I don't know there's a few of
them there's one I know there's a company
[SPEAKER_01]: that sells like like I was doing this and
then I saw a company selling these things
[SPEAKER_01]: exact it was like the exact same tank with
like their logo on it with likes you know
[SPEAKER_01]: like little hash thing but they were doing
something cooler they were like shooting
[SPEAKER_01]: co2 in into one of the valves to keep it
like super cold you know so that you could
[SPEAKER_01]: do a minimal agitation and and not have to
and just very gently knock off your fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: frozen but I'm not I they don't have any
ice in
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah but we've done we make our own ice
usually yeah and and so now I mostly am
[SPEAKER_01]: making fresh frozen like for myself
because I enjoy it and not doing a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of it like just because of the whole
it's cured material yeah and so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like to keep the maximum terpenes
yeah well the flavors blends differently
[SPEAKER_01]: when you cure it so it's a different it's
a different component and the melts you
[SPEAKER_01]: know people are very concerned about the
melt the melt is like the thing is with
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh frozen like because I'm I enjoy it
right but when you take fresh frozen you
[SPEAKER_01]: put it in a freeze dryer you're freeze
drying it beyond where I dried my resin
[SPEAKER_01]: right and then a lot of these freeze
dryers depending on where you put your
[SPEAKER_01]: settings or whatever they'll have they'll
suck out terpenes and you'll lose terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: from your from your hash because you
freeze dried it and that'll get and if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're some people put these cold trap
things in there and they'll get the
[SPEAKER_01]: they'll collect the terpenes that they're
losing but you're gonna lose terpenes from
[SPEAKER_01]: that rapid amount of drying absolutely and
so I haven't really done test comparisons
[SPEAKER_01]: but I feel like the enjoyment level is is
equal and and the cool thing I think about
[SPEAKER_01]: dry sift is because people are always
saying like oh hash is so hard to dry well
[SPEAKER_01]: these resin glands are dried individually
and like because they're hanging right
[SPEAKER_01]: they're in your room they're hanging on
the plant and they're just they're drying
[SPEAKER_01]: tiny fruit drying in the air so when you
have finish your trimming and you have
[SPEAKER_01]: your trim and your your smalls and stuff
and you're gonna do dry sift now you have
[SPEAKER_01]: these perfectly dried individual heads and
then if you don't have to go through
[SPEAKER_01]: getting them wet again you keep them dry
and you have and you have the right way to
[SPEAKER_01]: clean them and you you have an equally
pure equally dabble you know equally high
[SPEAKER_01]: quality product that actually looks like
individual single isolated trichome heads
[SPEAKER_01]: just like when you take it out of a freeze
dryer and you put it through a sieve and
[SPEAKER_05]: it becomes powder again my one curiosity
question on fresh frozen is like there's
[SPEAKER_05]: nothing else you would eat from the garden
where you'd be psyched to put it in the
[SPEAKER_05]: freezer and then take it out and eat it
yeah so how come trichomes are okay with
[SPEAKER_01]: that because they're hard to dry and they
take a long time to dry and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: finicky and they do different resin is
it's an expression of the plant right so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just like it's its own creature it's
its own you know it's its own expression
[SPEAKER_01]: of that being and and so like yeah and the
freezer it's you can dry like so if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be like air drying some of these
really greasy strains while you're drying
[SPEAKER_01]: them they're gonna want to grease together
they're gonna want to oxidize on the
[SPEAKER_01]: outside they're gonna turn more brown you
know what I mean and you're gonna end up
[SPEAKER_01]: with a brown patty of goo and people are
gonna be like dude that's shitty hash I
[SPEAKER_01]: want the white stuff you know what I mean
because that's just what happens cuz like
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're like well okay I'll smoke it
because it's good but but you really like
[SPEAKER_01]: really the market once once these these
looks you know and there's a couple ways
[SPEAKER_01]: to get them and you you can either dry it
air dry it in a very cold room and get
[SPEAKER_01]: those you know and plane it and sieve it
and get them separated into a powder but
[SPEAKER_01]: you need very cold temperatures you need
it to be you know maybe a short window in
[SPEAKER_01]: the winter is how it kind of used to be
but now people are using freeze dryers or
[SPEAKER_01]: cold rooms to make you know and so that's
really to make a lot of ice water hashes
[SPEAKER_01]: is energy-intensive you know what I mean
and and we're seeing like as people are
[SPEAKER_01]: making like 20,000 gallon washing machines
you know what I mean and it's like well
[SPEAKER_01]: that's 20,000 gallons of water just to
wash the resin off you know what I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: like do you really is that route really
gonna be the best way to make mass produce
[SPEAKER_04]: products you know no and that's the other
thing with the dry sieve is like I now am
[SPEAKER_01]: able to keep all of my plants material and
compost it and I've just you know made a
[SPEAKER_01]: smaller amount of and a value-added
product it's a value-added product I can
[SPEAKER_05]: make you know but just quickly do you guys
ever do that when you do a wash you then
[SPEAKER_05]: use that water back in the soil yeah we
put them on the garden usually what I do
[SPEAKER_01]: is so you know like I've I've been able
fortunate to like hang out with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: hash makers and I have like access to some
of the great people who have taught me
[SPEAKER_01]: some amazing things it's like not all my
invention totally but you know like what
[SPEAKER_01]: well the best thing to do is to reuse your
water you know so because you've already
[SPEAKER_01]: got it like on the farm when you're doing
it small and you're gonna wash it again
[SPEAKER_01]: you you read like you catch the cold water
when you see your bags and then you put
[SPEAKER_05]: that back into to wash it again yeah and
then you have a huge advantage it's only a
[SPEAKER_01]: detriment if you've broken the material
and you're making green come through you
[SPEAKER_01]: know if you're if you haven't if you
haven't done it if you didn't do a clean
[SPEAKER_01]: wash and you broke the green chlorophyll
out of the material and that's mixed in
[SPEAKER_01]: with your plant it with your resin then
yeah but yeah your garden will love it the
[SPEAKER_02]: first batch of hash was rough too then
probably though in that case yeah yeah if
[SPEAKER_02]: the water is contaminated then probably
the first hash was probably pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: charcoal briquette and that's the thing
with having to go through that whole
[SPEAKER_00]: extensive process and there's risk there's
a lot of factors that can affect the yield
[SPEAKER_00]: the ultimate outcome and it's a lot of
work and so it it's kind of it's been kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like a blessing that's been cool to
have that we had that we had to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: that out and and it's yeah and it's been
good on a scale of like well we want this
[SPEAKER_00]: to be fully full metal product and
actually I you can it's something we can
[SPEAKER_01]: make right so it's just our well I have
some I have some that I pressed out you
[SPEAKER_01]: know like I I didn't just like with a with
a little hot thing no I think it's an
[SPEAKER_01]: Eli's pocket it's kind of breaking up
because it's like glass but uh you know I
[SPEAKER_01]: just I pressed it out yeah but um this is
dry sieve that was just pressed out and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like shatter so we're happy with the
product and we can kind of this is really
[SPEAKER_02]: really nice in my my simple tim logic I'm
a flower person but I just I love this I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean the goal is to isolate the resin
heads right so however you do that it
[SPEAKER_02]: doesn't matter and like yeah that that
look just yeah I break it up it's like
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah you should put your light on it when
you start about cleaning them I'm not
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to pry all your no it's like it's a
post it's a post seeding cleaning that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing then so we do okay I might as
well share it yeah so basically we do a
[SPEAKER_01]: rough sieve that's full spectrum and
everything goes on to one one surface
[SPEAKER_01]: right so the interesting thing about the
resin is that trichomes heads have a
[SPEAKER_01]: static charge so if you create the right
kind of static situation you can use the
[SPEAKER_01]: static to make the resin cling to that
object yeah and then you can brush it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you have pure it's just like when you were
a kid and you'd play with the balloon yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: you know like or like pull the iron out of
the soil or like any of those magnetic
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of games it's just it's just using
static electricity and they just come
[SPEAKER_00]: right out and so you'll have all your
material will separate out and you'll have
[SPEAKER_00]: this perfectly clean is just all the heads
and then on the other side you'll just
[SPEAKER_00]: have like this tiny little dust kind of
which was just like whatever was left
[SPEAKER_01]: through this sifting and to me okay so
this is one of the most beautiful things
[SPEAKER_01]: about it to me is because the resin is
totally dry when you do press it it
[SPEAKER_01]: retains this like glass marble like
texture and stability it's like stable
[SPEAKER_01]: like that it's not gonna turn into a wax
it's not gonna butter up like hash makers
[SPEAKER_01]: always complain about when their ice water
hash but butters which means it's getting
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture in it it's totally dry and it's
like glass
[SPEAKER_01]: this was done like like a hot water bottle
press you know yeah like in the parchment
[SPEAKER_03]: but I don't do it that hot I don't like
rosin and I'll tell you why so rosin you
[SPEAKER_01]: know like do you like juice from okay yeah
and I'm not knocking on rosin this is just
[SPEAKER_01]: my personal thing you know but you know
when like all rosin kind of tastes the
[SPEAKER_01]: same to me because it's it tastes like
juice from concentrate you know like where
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not a lot of there's no pulp left
and there's not a lot of the stuff where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're like hmm this is like like if you
make like the connection to that yeah if
[SPEAKER_01]: you like like if you're gonna make like
how Frenchie talks about wine or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like that if you're gonna make I
don't really drink wine or make wine but
[SPEAKER_01]: we like to make like ciders and we just
but it's like if you're gonna like strain
[SPEAKER_01]: out the cider or you know like a wheat
beer it's not quite the same kind of thing
[SPEAKER_01]: you know what I mean it's like something
about that is in the like when you when
[SPEAKER_01]: they all stay together and they blend they
blend together differently and it's like a
[SPEAKER_01]: fermentation where when you press rosin
it's like making juice from concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of further extraction yeah you have a
maybe the only the most intense dominant
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects of it really come through and
they're powerful but because they're
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrated but then you lose a lot of
the nuance and complexity that I really
[SPEAKER_00]: enjoy and I know about the product
initially and I also feel like when you're
[SPEAKER_01]: growing you feel like this well when
you're growing a six-star melt you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: need to rosin pressing you know what I
mean because the rosin press like making a
[SPEAKER_05]: rosin you put your pants on one leg at a
time just like the rest of us but once
[SPEAKER_05]: your pants are on you make six-star melt
yeah yeah yeah I know I really like I have
[SPEAKER_02]: been sitting with this like because the
hash thing interests me because it's part
[SPEAKER_02]: of every growers reality like even like I
am so into the flower but I know that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's you know there's a lot of
byproducts of this plant so then when I
[SPEAKER_02]: look at it from that aspect I say like the
thing that the rosin crowd and people are
[SPEAKER_02]: even even hydrocarbon people is this
ultimate refinement in their eyes and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're removing the excess they're with
the skin from the head however you want to
[SPEAKER_02]: describe that process but that might in
some ways be a detractor that there is
[SPEAKER_02]: it's so complex that there's got to be
parts of that that aren't just the fats
[SPEAKER_02]: and lipids and whatever they complain
about but maybe it is different types of
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes and other minor the casing is
also part of the preserving of it and I
[SPEAKER_00]: wonder a big part of it to me is the
second to me the second that press goes
[SPEAKER_00]: down and that heat supplied you just see
all the terpenes everything just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: gets burst open and so immediately it's
going to change and then with the rosin it
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't necessarily burst it open but it
burst it open and it's forced it through a
[SPEAKER_00]: screen you know what I mean so it's like
it's kind of like when you get into like
[SPEAKER_01]: olive oil pressing and you're like is it
virgin is it extra virgin wonder the temps
[SPEAKER_01]: they did it at you know is it cold pressed
you know because like definitely a fresh
[SPEAKER_01]: cold pressed olive oil is something that's
amazing and so some of those rosins where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like they're fresh and they're
pressed at really low temps they are
[SPEAKER_01]: amazing being so fresh and I'm not rocking
rosin because there's great rosins out
[SPEAKER_01]: there but not to press flour I've pressed
dry sieve and the thing about rosin is
[SPEAKER_01]: like for me it was like you had to be at
the machine and to get what I wanted out
[SPEAKER_01]: of the rosin I was making I had to fuck
around so long and I don't just don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: fucking around with machines if you like
to do that you probably really get into it
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot more it's just wasn't me you know
and I don't I totally get why people are
[SPEAKER_01]: into it and I totally get like the melts
that you get from rosin but I like to see
[SPEAKER_01]: like how when I grow my hash you know or
make hash from when I grew it's like how
[SPEAKER_01]: good how did I do you know what I mean how
good how well did I grow it and that's how
[SPEAKER_01]: I get to feedback is how well rosin also
how good of a hash because you know the
[SPEAKER_01]: hash it is only as good yeah so it's it's
a great way to like learn about your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants and what you're growing and what
happens after you cut it cut it down to
[SPEAKER_02]: and the ability for the different types of
hash to really either show off the quality
[SPEAKER_02]: and the need for that type of hash to have
good starting material and then as you
[SPEAKER_02]: move down the line towards the whatever
the the less that's kind of important
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's all these refinement
techniques and now like with the medias
[SPEAKER_02]: that people are pushing product through
that is able to hide that but with
[SPEAKER_02]: something like you know just real real
hash with sift it needs to be a really
[SPEAKER_01]: good starting it's kind of funny because
I've been having actually the last couple
[SPEAKER_01]: years I've been having a lot of difficulty
with my hash shields and they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: really you know kind of on the lower end
and with the dry sieve I've been able to
[SPEAKER_01]: like use bigger screens and like a lot of
my a lot of big stuff is just I'm not be
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not able to get it in the ice water
like I'm not able to get stuff that's
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger than 190 190 microns in my ice
water screen it turns out really dirty and
[SPEAKER_01]: gross but when I'm cleaning my dry sieve I
can keep that and I can keep it all
[SPEAKER_01]: together and it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like it's working you know like but
how do you get to enjoy that part where it
[SPEAKER_01]: gets just lost in the water so it's been
cool
[SPEAKER_02]: this this is I mean you could both touch
on this but let's just go Carla like so is
[SPEAKER_02]: this partially a cultivar thing or you
think it's the way that you're cultivating
[SPEAKER_01]: it that you're seeing yes um I think
partly it's the way we cultivate it it's
[SPEAKER_00]: the time when we cultivate it doesn't
necessarily do that and I think it has
[SPEAKER_01]: something to do with our app like our
region it's unique to that we're at a low
[SPEAKER_01]: elevation in a high elevation mountain
area we're only at 1200 but the mountains
[SPEAKER_01]: around us are all five you know it goes up
to five six and so we get these really
[SPEAKER_01]: dramatic swings of very hot days very cold
nights like almost we can count on 40
[SPEAKER_01]: degree temperature swings pretty much and
so we get very little coasts I mean we get
[SPEAKER_01]: some coastal influence but it's it's kind
of blocked by this big mountain range and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the place that I've kind of found
where I'm like okay I could feel like I
[SPEAKER_01]: can grow indoor looking weed outside but
it's totally different because now the
[SPEAKER_01]: resin is doing different things and
honestly I don't know why the resin has
[SPEAKER_01]: they're so huge it's it's a mystery I mean
it's cool things are starting to happen
[SPEAKER_01]: area do do also have similar pronounced
they're noticing the same thing yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: people at the same altitude but it's
interesting because it affects because
[SPEAKER_02]: what they're talking about you know trying
about 190 or two that's going into like
[SPEAKER_02]: what they've been hashed what they call
like work bags there isn't a lot of sizes
[SPEAKER_02]: that are bigger than that so really that
typically would catch minor plant matter
[SPEAKER_02]: contaminants and that if your guys is glad
I can see why it's a difficult situation
[SPEAKER_02]: for making water hash we're like dry stiff
all of a sudden allows me more flexibility
[SPEAKER_00]: in that range it's kind of amazing I mean
it took us a while to even and like the
[SPEAKER_01]: thing is the amount of weight that's in a
head that's between 190 and 220 is amazing
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah that's your those are your numbers
right yeah people in your region at
[SPEAKER_05]: different altitudes not seeing those big
tricompens we just notice well like we've
[SPEAKER_05]: because you notice the inverse which is
other people at the same elevation
[SPEAKER_00]: noticing the same we've seen people at
slightly you know how we just have started
[SPEAKER_00]: to really explore this further because we
didn't really know that that was the case
[SPEAKER_00]: until recent years where you can really
look at micro imagery of your tricomes on
[SPEAKER_00]: a regular basis I mean that just started
