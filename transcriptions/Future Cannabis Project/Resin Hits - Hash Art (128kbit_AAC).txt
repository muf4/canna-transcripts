[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to Functional Art where we look at
glass and hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had a closer look.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I'm with Zach from Resin Hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: How you doing buddy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then today you brought us a,
who makes this piece?
[SPEAKER_00]: Rycraft.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rycrafted glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's based out of Medford, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where'd you find this piece at?
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it directly from him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: At a show or?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I went to his house and got to choose
from his current stock at the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, can't wait to hit it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also a hash maker, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resin Hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resin Hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Resin Hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: We make ice water hash and rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is semi-rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one's GMO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Garlic cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: That funky offensive smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We heard you recently took second place at
the ego clash for cold water extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the strains?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a mix of papaya and banana OG 90
micron mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: That sounds very nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you happen to have any with you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pop it open.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ooh.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not rosin?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not rosin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight up bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Straight heads.
[SPEAKER_00]: 90 micron.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is gorgeous.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you say this is a full metal cold
water extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, just ice and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: No solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: No solvents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will melt like an oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, it'll melt like water.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you describe that flavor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost like a fermenting bananas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really know how else to describe
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got the eyes almost got a,
almost a rotting fruit smell to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the banana just comes through
with like a creamy sweetness almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what got you into making bubble hash?
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a bunch of roommates that lived in
Mendocino County growing up and their
[SPEAKER_00]: family grew weed and every harvest time a
little bit after actually around now
[SPEAKER_00]: Christmas time.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is hash season.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd always come home and bring some
hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was my favorite thing to throw on
bowls and smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just really enjoyed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so did you wash a lot of trim when you
started or buds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, started out with trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get our stuff trimmed, freeze it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used to make BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't really like the way that was going,
the taste or just the potential hazards
[SPEAKER_00]: that involve or involved with me getting
BHO.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I personally just really wanted to get
into bubble hash and it's a cleaner
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, clean product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just ice, water, agitation, no solvents,
no chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: That tastes exceptionally good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get that real banana OG on the
front end and a lot of the papaya coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out in the back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like a tropical smoothie.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got lucky with that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will say that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's the second best hash in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now, guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got a trophy for that,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, sir.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I did.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll show that to you in a sec.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you can heat me up while I pop that
sucker out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who made the trophy?
[SPEAKER_00]: JD Mapleson.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope I'm saying that correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been making trophy or he's been doing
glass for quite some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's made trophies for the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe he did the trophies last year
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the ego clash.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's definitely a pretty coveted artist
when it comes to this scene.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a three hole bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the old style of true bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need a three hole bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ball it up, stick it in there and you
use a glass rod with a rounded kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: marble end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heat that up and you just kind of like
hold it over, press it in and kind of dab
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because with good bubble hash,
it's essentially oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you try to hit it with a pipe,
it'll just turn to oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, thin membrane and just kind of melts
away to almost nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you hand stirring or are you using
machines or a paint stirrer?
[SPEAKER_00]: I use machines, bubble machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't really have time to hand stir.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes some time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously you get a great product
using machines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, I mean, I think you get
just as good as a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you do with the hand stirring,
it just maybe takes a little bit more time
[SPEAKER_00]: to clean up here and there, but it allows
you time while the machines are spinning
[SPEAKER_00]: to do the other things you need while like
cleaning, sanitizing, prep work for
[SPEAKER_00]: pulling the bags and getting everything
ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of my reasoning behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't just justify standing there for
hours using an ore and hand stirring.
[SPEAKER_00]: Time is money.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when you grow your own
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't really got all the time in the
world and you got to spend a lot of it
[SPEAKER_00]: processing and cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The term glorified janitor has been tossed
around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, 100%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to try some of this GMO because it
smells, I don't know how you describe that
[SPEAKER_00]: smell, but it's very unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very offensive, off putting almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's funky.
[SPEAKER_00]: Real interesting flavor on this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know how to describe it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like a garlic and burnt rubber
maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of offensive, but it reminds me
of like the old school cat piss almost or,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, something where you smell it,
you're like, ew, that smells disgusting,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I need to smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's the weird thing about weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely some offensive flavors that you
smell and you're just like, ew,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to smoke that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this second place trophy is,
that's a beautiful piece of work with the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichromes all up top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, he's got some nice marble.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fume worked wig wags, fumed marble right
there on the front.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That guy did a really great job on those
trophies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up in Sonoma County.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of glass artists here.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of smoke shops growing up,
you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always loved going in and just
looking at the glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when I didn't smoke, even when I was
a kid and younger, you know, before it was
[SPEAKER_00]: a law that you had to be 18 to go in,
you could just kind of walk in and look at
[SPEAKER_00]: the stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hypnotizing, all the colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've always loved it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just the craftsmanship that is put into
it, the pride they put into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: the hours they put into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hours they've learned how to mold
their craft and to make these beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: pieces.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it takes definitely a lot of time
and dedication.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's cool to, like, smoke your art out
of someone else's art, kind of,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it takes almost as much time to
really master.
[SPEAKER_00]: The glass community and the hash community
are very close-knit because they're both
[SPEAKER_00]: forms of art.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always pushing each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: They push each other and they work with
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they rely on each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for coming by and showing
us these amazing glass pieces and this
[SPEAKER_00]: award-winning hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hell, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for having me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully I get to smoke some more of your
product here in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quite tasty.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, congratulations on the
second place in the ego clash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And next year, you'll take it for the
first, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shooting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got to find some new flavors, possibly
make some new flavors, and really kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: just push it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
