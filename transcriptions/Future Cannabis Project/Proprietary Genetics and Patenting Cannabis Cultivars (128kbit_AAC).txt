[SPEAKER_01]: So you're a grower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so I'm actually really curious about
your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your thoughts on proprietary
genetics and patenting things like
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis cultivars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well I don't know very well how you go
about patenting a plant and naturally the
[SPEAKER_00]: variance that we see in our crops and even
in fairly stable crops, the speed in which
[SPEAKER_00]: we go through these different varieties
and subsets of these varieties that I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't see the viability of patenting a
plant and what do they mean when they say
[SPEAKER_00]: patent a plant?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was talking about patenting a name,
patenting a strain, a chemo type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you draw the line?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good question and I can spend
a lot of time answering it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess and I will in a second but I think
before I get to like all the technical
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff, I'm curious as to your thoughts
around really because there's really like
[SPEAKER_01]: a higher level question on the table which
is like do you want like do you feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: the things that you grow and that you
cultivate and more specifically that you
[SPEAKER_01]: like that you breed like let's say you
breed something like oh my god this is
[SPEAKER_01]: like my very favorite this is like
Reynolds dream you know what I mean this
[SPEAKER_01]: is my Reynolds dream strain it's perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that something that you would want to
get in intellectual property protection
[SPEAKER_01]: for?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it something that you you know because
you think it's new or is it something that
[SPEAKER_01]: you want to just be out and free and open
and that kind of thing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what are your thoughts on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I definitely think the latter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think of what I've been able to do
because of the open source nature of all
[SPEAKER_00]: the varieties that I've grown that I've
never had to purchase intellectual
[SPEAKER_00]: property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had maybe there was a steep
entrance fee at some point to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: certain type of genetics but in general it
was it's historically been open source.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've given and traded and been fairly
loose with our genetics and that's how
[SPEAKER_00]: we've kind of proliferated it and that's
how we've gotten to where we are and I see
[SPEAKER_00]: with people that are coming in that they
have great business plans but they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a cultural understanding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not seeing what's happened in the
last 40 or 45 years in the you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: undergrowth in forests and in basements
and closets with people fearing the
[SPEAKER_00]: government while they pushed forward with
this hybridization of this plant and how
[SPEAKER_00]: we've come to a place with this standard
higher potency than we've seen in the past
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially better taste and we've done
that out of a love for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of it higher yields and things of the
nature have typically gone with
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were things that needed to be done
for the sake of prohibition but other than
[SPEAKER_00]: that the majority of it was done for the
love of the plant and when we have people
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in that want to monetize every
single aspect of it it's disheartening and
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as what I want to protect not much
from people that share a similar viewpoint
[SPEAKER_00]: but from people that want to take my work
for free essentially and then turn around
[SPEAKER_00]: and monetize it it's a hard pill to
swallow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I completely agree with you like I
should admit that I'm like relatively new
[SPEAKER_01]: still to like the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been using cannabis for 20 years and
you know so I'm well familiar and it seems
[SPEAKER_01]: like I think that what's been the saddest
thing for me in the year of running open
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis project has been seeing this
influx of people that just like give no
[SPEAKER_01]: fucks about the community and about the
culture and the other thing that makes me
[SPEAKER_01]: really sad and I don't this is maybe more
true in Oregon than it where are you
[SPEAKER_01]: based?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm at a Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're at a Humboldt okay so then okay all
right so then this will probably hit close
[SPEAKER_01]: to home like it really bums me like I'm a
rule follower like I like fought like I
[SPEAKER_01]: like you know dotting my I's and crossing
my T's and making sure my shit is all
[SPEAKER_01]: lined up and it really bums me out that
because of the way that like the
[SPEAKER_01]: legislation and all the regulations have
rolled out there are a lot of people who
[SPEAKER_01]: have started to go jump through a bunch of
extra hoops because they believe in
[SPEAKER_01]: legalization and they believe in like
getting this plant out there and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: getting screwed financially you know like
that's something that like really like
[SPEAKER_00]: gets my goat in a major way I'm right
there I'm very deep into this process I've
[SPEAKER_00]: spent a lot of money and I mean forget
invest investors or investment capital
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never had a credit card in my life
I've done everything from the the first
[SPEAKER_00]: flower to the next to making it all work
then when you see 10 20 million dollar
[SPEAKER_00]: angel investments come into these
companies they can they can do things they
[SPEAKER_00]: can make moves that your average person
can't totally and that's actually part of
[SPEAKER_01]: my big issues with patents and so to get
back to sort of your technical question
[SPEAKER_01]: around like how do you can go about
patting a patent you know like you I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: the the long and the short of it is you
need to prove you need to prove that you
[SPEAKER_01]: invented something like just generally
speaking for kind of any invention of
[SPEAKER_01]: which like new plants fall under it and by
the way I should always say like I'm not a
[SPEAKER_01]: lawyer this is not legal advice you know
always if you have legal questions you
[SPEAKER_01]: should always consult your lawyer sure
working in your jurisdiction of choice you
[SPEAKER_01]: know whatever but you know there needs to
be an invention and like proof of
[SPEAKER_01]: inventorship and that invention needs to
be new enough and unique enough and if it
[SPEAKER_01]: is then with the help of legal counsel you
can file for a patent and get a patent and
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that what's been and the really
ultimately they're having been very many
[SPEAKER_01]: patents have been issued on plants like
the vast majority of patents that are out
[SPEAKER_01]: there are on like like cannabinoids and
uses and on formulations and processing
[SPEAKER_01]: methods and some of them are really crazy
like one of the lawyers who we work with
[SPEAKER_01]: Dale Hunt just put out this thing called
MJ patents weekly calm and it shows like
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the cannabis patents that are being
issued and all the applications that are
[SPEAKER_01]: published in the US and in Canada and
internationally and like the shit that
[SPEAKER_01]: people are patting is crazy you know like
but when it come and that's like a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: other tangent that we all should be
looking at and paying attention to because
[SPEAKER_01]: it has a similar documentation problem as
cannabis but for patenting a plant like
[SPEAKER_01]: you basically need to like follow the same
rules of any other invention and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: what's really problematic especially for
there's a family of utility patents that
[SPEAKER_01]: have been issued on plants with at least
3% CBD and a certain terpene profile and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not just like this one cultivar it's
like any plant that fits this definition
[SPEAKER_01]: any product made with this any new plants
that are bred with it and you know I have
[SPEAKER_01]: a major problem with these patents in part
because you know they were issued at a
[SPEAKER_01]: time when there was very little
documentation about the plants and of
[SPEAKER_01]: course there's very little documentation
about the plants because it's still
[SPEAKER_01]: federally illegal you know what I mean and
so and the way that you get that is you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to have money you have to have
capital and like farmers don't have it you
[SPEAKER_01]: know what I mean by and large you know and
like if we wanted to fight back against it
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd have to like work together and come
up with like some crazy awesome legal
[SPEAKER_01]: strategy which you know I'm interested
talking to people about but yeah anyway so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's kind of the deal with a lot of the
patents that are out there so what was
[SPEAKER_00]: your initial starting point or the
catalyst for this open cannabis project
[SPEAKER_01]: even working on so the project was
actually started in 2015 by Mowgli Holmes
[SPEAKER_01]: of Filos Bioscience and Jeremy Plumb and I
was brought on just about just over a year
[SPEAKER_01]: ago to help basically to make open
cannabis project its own nonprofit in part
[SPEAKER_01]: because the I think that like Filos was
getting some flack from people about
[SPEAKER_01]: asking them for data and they're like wait
a second you're a genetics lab like we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't want to share data with you and
they're like oh wait it's nonprofit wait
[SPEAKER_01]: it should be separate from us and so they
hired me initially to separate it I
[SPEAKER_01]: believe in open information and I believe
in open data and I believe that we should
[SPEAKER_01]: have transparency in this space in
particular because you know both both
[SPEAKER_01]: patent law and intellectual property law
and intellectual property law around
[SPEAKER_01]: plants which are different by country and
you know like have different governing
[SPEAKER_01]: bodies and all kinds of things like that
is one area of knowledge that has been
[SPEAKER_01]: that is for the most part pretty opaque to
people you know what I mean it takes a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of digging to really get in there and I
think for cannabis because of the
[SPEAKER_01]: underground nature of it it's also
something that's been completely like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know opaque to a lot of people and so
there's this opportunity to like bring
[SPEAKER_01]: information into the fold and if nothing
else help to bring clarity around like
[SPEAKER_01]: what is out there and then for people to
give people the option to ask the question
[SPEAKER_01]: of like okay if I really want to develop
something that is new and unique like what
[SPEAKER_01]: is really new and unique you know I mean
like it's anyway I think it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: fascinating I think when we look at these
these multi-generational hybrids of
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrids where do we start drawing the line
at when you are simply crossing and you
[SPEAKER_00]: the breeder may be doing their due
diligence as far as producing a stable
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic line yeah but still they they took
two varieties and cross them together and
[SPEAKER_00]: typically at this point in the game those
two varieties were a cross of two other
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties and so on and so on and we go
back to what people call land race strains
[SPEAKER_00]: are really inbred lines because they were
cultivated in these regions of the world
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not wild product and at what point of
people stop getting credit is it like
[SPEAKER_00]: whoever cares to get the credit gets the
credit and that's really interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's like a place where like
plant biology and open source like kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: diverge right because and like open source
software and open and open source like
[SPEAKER_01]: anything which really falls more under
typically really comes out of like
[SPEAKER_01]: copyright law you know like there's an
automatic authorship like if you like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know like make a postcard like you know
like you get to have copyright over that
[SPEAKER_01]: postcard right sure so and like if you
want to open source it then you can say
[SPEAKER_01]: like okay anybody can use this with
attribution as long as you know they say
[SPEAKER_01]: like hey Reynolds make this made this
postcard like you can use it for free and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't do that with plants like you
know what I mean like you can't like have
[SPEAKER_01]: like so I don't know where to draw the
line you know what I mean and I feel like
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not really a great answer to that
question because the lines have been
[SPEAKER_01]: blurred so many times to me it seems like
you know maybe we shouldn't be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: patent these plants but at the same time
the law says something different and so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where things get really tricky
right and and I think it goes down to for
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people that I know that that do
their own breeding at whatever level they
[SPEAKER_00]: do it for the most part it's not financial
in terms of what they want it's
[SPEAKER_00]: recognition that they they did something
that is popular now and I think a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: those same people it's it's more the issue
they take of somebody else making money
[SPEAKER_00]: off of this work that they take that they
take issue with and how much of that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: down to the actual variety or the cross
involved how much of it comes down to the
[SPEAKER_00]: naming of that product and I mean I think
that there's other there's other
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses that we can look to that that
deal with this the difference between the
[SPEAKER_00]: product itself and the name that's put on
it oh totally yeah and so where where
[SPEAKER_00]: these what I think a lot of people coming
from the outside world think of must be
[SPEAKER_00]: nicknames because we know some of the
names for these flowers that those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual name of that variety and there
isn't something you know more scientific
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no Latin version of it to go back
to and subsequently how how tied is that
[SPEAKER_00]: name to that variety and how truly unique
is that variety and could the majority of
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers of the product tell the
difference between that variety with that
[SPEAKER_00]: name and a very similar parental cross
right that goes under a different moniker
[SPEAKER_01]: totally and then what about like growing
so what about growing like the same like a
[SPEAKER_01]: clone of the same variety but at two
different farms under two different
[SPEAKER_01]: methods you know what I mean is that the
same variety or is it something new now
[SPEAKER_01]: because its chemical outputs are different
because they've been grown differently
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely I mean I think even taking it
further to to outdoor versus indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that that I see greater
differences in the same clone grown under
[SPEAKER_00]: different environmental conditions and
maybe the same basic type of growing
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor greenhouse outdoor but in different
environments with the different
[SPEAKER_00]: nutritional inputs then I do often between
two different varieties that are similar
[SPEAKER_00]: but are produced in the same environmental
factor and right and I think that's
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting I think it's really
interesting too and part of what I think
[SPEAKER_01]: is really interesting about that is that
the way that patents work and even plant
[SPEAKER_01]: variety protection work is in the US
specifically internationally it's a whole
[SPEAKER_01]: different ball game that I'm only
beginning to realize I really wrap my head
[SPEAKER_01]: around but we don't really take growing
method into account like that's kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like brushed aside as a trade secret but
for cannabis that's like part of the magic
[SPEAKER_01]: and I wonder like one of the things I
think about all the time is like could we
[SPEAKER_01]: as a community create like an alternative
an alternative intellectual property
[SPEAKER_01]: system that was really based on that also
had legal teeth right because we can come
[SPEAKER_01]: up with all kinds of shit but if like like
the USPTO and the feds don't look at it
[SPEAKER_01]: then it's kind of like we're kind of
wasting our time so but what if we had a
[SPEAKER_01]: system that was similar to you know like
Appalachians or something like that and I
[SPEAKER_01]: know that the Mendocino Appalachians
project is working on this and I cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: wait to talk to them about it but like
what if we had a system that was really
[SPEAKER_01]: like okay there is the the cultivator and
the cultivation method right like the farm
[SPEAKER_01]: the environment plus like the genetic
variety whatever equals the output and
[SPEAKER_01]: that output and like that whole process is
taken into account as an intellectual
[SPEAKER_01]: property thing absolutely right but then
like would that be a I mean I don't feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like because the community is so like
based in open source like it doesn't feel
[SPEAKER_01]: like a patent doesn't seem like the right
thing and a plant variety protection isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: the right thing so like I don't know I
don't know what the right answer is I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know what that thing is but it's
something I probably think about I see
[SPEAKER_00]: that when I look at some of my methodology
and as some of the the the modifications
[SPEAKER_00]: I've made over the years to make my
product superior at least to what I've
[SPEAKER_00]: done in the past I'm not sure at what
point whether I really came up with that
[SPEAKER_00]: where I got it from and to try and claim
that that's mine as a little bit of a
[SPEAKER_00]: stretch but I can fairly safely say the
way that I've compiled these pieces of
[SPEAKER_00]: information does make it to some degree
mine and I have not come across anyone
[SPEAKER_00]: that does it exactly like I do just like
any other farmer that I come across we all
[SPEAKER_00]: follow some basic similar paths but
because we do have these different
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches we come out with different
flowers in the end and like something I
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of like to throw out to people is
that it's an easy plant to grow and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult plant to grow well and the
difference I grow other things besides
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and I've yet to see a terrible
amount of difference between zucchinis
[SPEAKER_00]: that I grow from one season to the next or
seed versus a start in different locations
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've grown it or whatever you want to
throw in it seems to carry more similarity
[SPEAKER_00]: and with this plant I see such great
differences with fairly minute tweaks to a
[SPEAKER_01]: recipe totally and from what from what I
understand and I'm also not a botanist
[SPEAKER_01]: like it seems like the the heterozygous
nature and then in the high hybridization
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis is part of why it is so like
you know there's a stable seed lines are
[SPEAKER_01]: possible you know what I mean it's not
like you can't make a stable seed line but
[SPEAKER_01]: most of them are varied within their seed
line sure that's correct I mean and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think most of these words that would be
thrown thrown around are very subjective
[SPEAKER_00]: right and stable is one that we throw
around and what is stable really good what
[SPEAKER_00]: is stable mean to the grower or what is
stable mean to the breeder and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: there's two big big points that I bring up
as far as stability one is how similar is
[SPEAKER_00]: one seed to another when they grow up to
be a plant and the almost at this point
[SPEAKER_00]: the more important thing is what is its
tendency towards turning hermaphrodite
[SPEAKER_00]: that's become a huge thing and that's a
lot of what the word stability is being
[SPEAKER_00]: thrown around these days when we talk
about stability we ask does it have a
[SPEAKER_00]: propensity to be a hermaphrodite and so
those are kind of like two very different
[SPEAKER_00]: things but we're using a word like
stability so then you can see how you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going down the line it becomes a little
bit confusing when somebody says is this
[SPEAKER_01]: stable I never thought that I would spend
have any desire to like go and look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: word stable in terms of like legal
documentation but now I really am
[SPEAKER_01]: wondering I'm like okay like like what is
and I think I've actually seen this
[SPEAKER_01]: written I can't remember what it is but it
would be interesting to compare like the
[SPEAKER_01]: definitions of stable like you're talking
about with like the definitions of stable
[SPEAKER_01]: that the that the plant variety protection
office uses you know what I mean they're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about stability there's so many
words like this and at least in in my in
[SPEAKER_00]: my world in the cannabis world that have
you know kind of been maybe not hijacked
[SPEAKER_00]: but certainly taken by the canvas
community and maybe sometimes used
[SPEAKER_00]: correctly or aptly and other times
misappropriated I was talking with with
[SPEAKER_00]: the geneticist and a biologist a couple of
weeks ago and we got onto the topic of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic drift and he's what is that what
is genetic drift well if you were to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: to to a biologist they're gonna have one
viewpoint on what genetic drift means and
[SPEAKER_00]: then if you talk to the majority of the
cannabis community and what they have
[SPEAKER_00]: co-opted that word or that phrase to mean
it's gonna be two different things in the
[SPEAKER_00]: growers cannabis growers world genetic
drift seems to predominantly apply to
[SPEAKER_00]: people talking about their mother stock
and seeing that over time they take
[SPEAKER_00]: cloning loans off of the same mother stock
and they have a typically a degradation
[SPEAKER_00]: but at least a shift that the plants
aren't coming out the same as they did in
[SPEAKER_00]: the past and I was asking him is is that
possible and he said that he didn't see
[SPEAKER_00]: how that would be possible especially in
the time frame that most people are
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about two years three years four
years and that the reality would have way
[SPEAKER_00]: more to do with my hypothesis to him was
the reality would have more to do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: mismanagement not properly taking care of
that mother stock and it getting sick and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe it rebounding but that it never
being the same and the important part of
[SPEAKER_00]: it was him being so shocked by the way
that we use the word genetic drift because
[SPEAKER_00]: he said that's not accurate and so I see
this over and over again in these words in
[SPEAKER_00]: the way that we communicate here in the
community that doesn't always line up I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean that has to do so much with the
underground nature and not being able to
[SPEAKER_01]: like have access to decent research for so
long right and to like really participate
[SPEAKER_01]: in it along those lines like there's this
like whole debate around like this is not
[SPEAKER_01]: really don't really feel like it's a baby
like the strong feelings around like the
[SPEAKER_01]: use the word strain versus the use of the
word like cultivar or a variety of our
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah exactly and so like and I and I like
you know as somebody who likes to be
[SPEAKER_01]: technically correct of course I'm I want
to use like cultivar whenever possible
[SPEAKER_01]: because like that's technically correct
and also I feel like there's like some
[SPEAKER_01]: validity to the vernacular that has come
through the cannabis industry that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like needs to be addressed like I don't
like I think it feels shitty for me to be
[SPEAKER_01]: like no I'm sorry you can't use the word
strain anymore hi I'm new and I know
[SPEAKER_01]: science so you know like what's the best
like how do you address that and what do
[SPEAKER_01]: you think is the best way for us to
address that as a community I I'm not a
[SPEAKER_00]: fan of people correcting correcting other
people but at the same time that a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: base level understanding of what we're
talking about is important so when people
[SPEAKER_00]: go into a conversation that they're able
to convey themselves well enough that the
[SPEAKER_00]: other person understands and I find myself
kind of going back and forth between the
[SPEAKER_00]: two different worlds and I don't know so I
picked up from somebody I forget where and
[SPEAKER_00]: they were like strain is in reference to
bacteria and before that I'd never cared
[SPEAKER_00]: and after that I was kind of like oh that
kind of put a distaste in my mouth so I
[SPEAKER_00]: find that that kind of funny what
companies in the industry are looking
[SPEAKER_00]: towards open source as the way forward
versus people that are looking towards
[SPEAKER_00]: more proprietary nature to their business
and patenting the various varieties with
[SPEAKER_01]: regards to genetics yes that's a really
good question I actually don't know that
[SPEAKER_01]: many companies that are like openly on
board with open source but that's actually
[SPEAKER_01]: something that we're hoping hoping to do
it open campus cannabis project next year
[SPEAKER_01]: is to create a program that gets people
kind of like on board is like a membership
[SPEAKER_01]: to be like we're about open science and
open data they have like some similar
[SPEAKER_01]: things in the psychedelic community that I
think would be really good fits for our
[SPEAKER_01]: community in terms of the people who
either have patents or seeking patents
[SPEAKER_01]: there is one in the United States there is
one man named I think it's Stephen cubby
[SPEAKER_01]: and he has a plant patent which is
actually very narrow patent on a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: plant called Ecuadorian sativa that
apparently produces something like 45%
[SPEAKER_01]: limonene by weight there is there is a
patent family issued to a company called
[SPEAKER_01]: the biotech Institute LLC and those are
some of the broader utility patents that I
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned earlier they have a narrow
version of their patent family that also
[SPEAKER_01]: just got recently accepted in Canada and
biotech Institute LLC is associated with
[SPEAKER_01]: napro and I believe Phytex but biotech
Institute is the name on the patent and
