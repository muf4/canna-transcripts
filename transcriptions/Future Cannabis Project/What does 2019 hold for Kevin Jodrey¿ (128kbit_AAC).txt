[SPEAKER_00]: You've been around for a minute,
and you've seen so much go on.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were even just talking about how things
have changed at the Emerald Cup with the
[SPEAKER_00]: Segway from 2015 to 64 for the last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you see it in a year?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you see happening this next year?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you focused on there?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, for me, I'd say the primary
focus is just to be able to understand how
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the transition from what we did to
what we're doing, because there's no map.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a new industry that you're
creating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nobody really has a book to buy that
says this is the steps you take.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you watch even these large
companies make missteps, you realize that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's just a tricky thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of it is to make sure that you
emotionally keep yourself stable so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you can make the transitions and allow the
businesses that you're able to develop and
[SPEAKER_01]: the pathways through this new maze are
able to be presented so you can see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the main point is to stay on
focus with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's the reality of, you know,
the new industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the same time, you know,
I'm getting to do incredible projects
[SPEAKER_01]: because we're able to work with scientific
technology that we never had access to
[SPEAKER_01]: before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're able to work with people from
the new industry coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so everybody's all the green rushes,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, a lot of the green rushes are green
rushes, but a lot of the green rushes are
[SPEAKER_01]: actually pretty good people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're intelligent, and they have a
desire to be in a new industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they realize their position because
they've been in other industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they see that this is a different one,
and they're not trying to necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: model this one after the other one so
much.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know that this will be its own
organic development because it's a unique
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of a sudden, you get to really
have intelligent data acquisition and
[SPEAKER_01]: genomic scientists and high level plant
consultants that work on really intricate
[SPEAKER_01]: large projects that help you understand
some of the nuances people face at these
[SPEAKER_01]: scales and at these issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're having, with the regulations,
as strict as it is, you're bringing in
[SPEAKER_01]: incredible levels of organic
methodologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a resurrection of how does one
work without chemical ag?
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, on the other page,
it's how do you use the most modern
[SPEAKER_01]: technology to lift the production values
and get the margins into a tighter range?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's fascinating in that
respect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for all of us that were in industry
all these years, we always wanted to have
[SPEAKER_01]: the tools to use, but you couldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that you can, it kind of scares
the shit out of you because you see that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, I'm excited about that,
man.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm digging it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like that hemp just is going to move
across the board because it'll open up
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural methodologies throughout the
country for biomass, for fiber,
[SPEAKER_01]: for hemp seed oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll transfer it to cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll go back in California under the
BCC.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this way, it allows the farmers that
are growing cannabis and cannabinoids to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to focus on a multi-use crop,
not just oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: THC driven, but THC, CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as we go forward, you know,
CBGs, THCVs, CBNs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it'll allow a much more greater
diversity for the cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not all trying to stick OG
cushion gelato into a jar and sell it at
[SPEAKER_01]: the store, but you're able to go at
populations that want some very
[SPEAKER_01]: interesting things because it works for
their situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of a sudden now you have a much
larger population of total potential
[SPEAKER_01]: customers and clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it isn't like it's going to compress.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to explode.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, I'm digging it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I heard you're working on a bit of a skunk
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, literally skunk work project,
trying to get some land race.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm bringing back all the old genetics
because we partnered up with Node Labs out
[SPEAKER_01]: of Petaluma.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Node Labs is our tissue culture
facility where we're going to do all our
[SPEAKER_01]: tissue culture production and then we'll
move it into the new wonderland and
[SPEAKER_01]: develop it there to grow out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what it does, it lets us have this
ability to use modern tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm using the modern tech to go and
open up old seeds from the 70s and from
[SPEAKER_01]: populations that were held by people who
held them because they really liked it and
[SPEAKER_01]: they just didn't want to get rid of the
seeds, but they also knew they couldn't do
[SPEAKER_01]: anything with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we can go into them now and preserve
some of them and pull some of that
[SPEAKER_01]: genealogical material out and use it to
steer the directions different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those building blocks, we really kind of
shifted away from them and now they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: present.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing is that there's all this
incredible, beautiful material to be
[SPEAKER_01]: delved into.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the ability to do that stuff is
unreal, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can go back to my roots, which is a
simple guy just wanting to smoke the
[SPEAKER_01]: grass.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I can go all the way to the top
of the tree, which is we're touching some
[SPEAKER_01]: really high science.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's an unbelievable time to be able
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, you're terrified most of the
time that these companies are going to
[SPEAKER_01]: gobble you alive, but at the same time,
they need to deal with you to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you really have a very unique moment in
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wish I had been in tech and saw the
dot com in person, because I bet it was
[SPEAKER_01]: similar where in the same room,
you had all these people just for one
[SPEAKER_01]: period of time before they all fragmented
out into their respective specialities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's my background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't even know if I share it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But years ago, it was post dot bomb,
as we say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's more of the early 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're spot on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I felt that I was very fortunate to
be a part of something that was such an
[SPEAKER_00]: evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I think this one's a more important
evolution.
[SPEAKER_00]: Truth be told, I'm an advocate from a
medicinal side, definitely respect the
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use side.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is very similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had these people that were just these
think tanks that they didn't even realize
[SPEAKER_00]: it was so much bigger than even anyone
could understand or comprehend at the
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, that's what I love about we've
had conversations about that you and I
[SPEAKER_00]: both where I'm the same way like to see a
true Acapulco gold or northern lights or I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, not crossbred, not backbred,
not because we I love we talked about this
[SPEAKER_00]: too.
[SPEAKER_00]: These trendy cakes, I know cakes are hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had cakes, we had cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the OGs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went through these hazes, all these
phases over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you get into and this is something
that no matter what big company comes into
[SPEAKER_00]: the scene, you're the one who has the keys
to this to this castle that can tell them
[SPEAKER_00]: this is why the genetics went this
direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why everything started shifting to
less pungent or to a little more
[SPEAKER_00]: restrained on the on the terpene side,
you know, a little less flavonoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know that you were there,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: When they brought everything in door to
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doors post dare back in the early 80s,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So looking back, like, are you just not
ever amazed you ever just stop and go,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, my God, this really just happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not just your lifetime, but just in
the last 20 or 30 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the last couple of years that blew my
mind, because that was the change of pace
[SPEAKER_01]: that was fastest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was really pretty stable for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had a stability that was built in
from regulation, meaning a legal
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that gave a price stabilization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which allowed people to be able to have
resources to be able to operate
[SPEAKER_01]: independently.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when that got shut out,
it compressed the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the new influx of capital and new
people coming in is re blowing it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just trying to figure out,
you know, how do you how do you get some
[SPEAKER_01]: of these things from the past,
genetically speaking, culturally speaking,
[SPEAKER_01]: and have them transcend and move forward
through time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just so strange to be watching it
in real time because we knew this was
coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we prepared for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we work with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no one ever knows the future in real
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you have no idea what's next.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're talking about synthetically
growing terpenoids in yeast solution and
[SPEAKER_01]: growing cannabinoids in yeast solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're manufacturing stuff that we need
specifically in lab for very specific
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The genomic, the projects, we can start
getting stabilized lines going through and
[SPEAKER_01]: developing plant populations that have
high resistance so that cultivation is
[SPEAKER_01]: easier and a lot of areas going at
specific combinations of cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_01]: terms for medicinal purposes, because now
you can get medicinal research,
[SPEAKER_01]: expungement on cases, people that got
caught a case getting expungements like in
[SPEAKER_00]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, like on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're an East Coast guy born East
Coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was floored when I was hearing that a
place like mass was turned on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blowing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Even the Canadians are like, this makes
sense, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the Canadians are going off.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I could see that because, you know,
they they've said, hey, this is an
[SPEAKER_01]: excellent opportunity for us to enter an
industry before the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: gets involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because once the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: gets involved heavily, it's going to be
hard to compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's tough to it's tough to beat
better climate with ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Mexico is killing us with
agricultural products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, we'd be exporting to them
because they have the water, the flat
[SPEAKER_01]: ground, good soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they they also have a looser labor and
environmental controls.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it allows them to be more competitive
in those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so Canada to me is the front front
runner right now, but I don't see the
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to hold that position with ag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Technical breeding is very specific,
but not on a broad production once these
[SPEAKER_01]: other countries can start producing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're in a situation that's
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the East Coast, which has been
traditionally draconian.
[SPEAKER_01]: So New England's draconian on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they're bracing it, you know,
to fang and claw.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and I'm looking at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, whoa, because I remember
catching a case in 83.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, I think I'm good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out of there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm out of there when I graduated school
in 84.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I never had a desire to go back and
do cannabis in New England.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now right now, it's a it's exploding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just so strange for me to see it
because that's something I can mark in a
[SPEAKER_01]: reality because it was my reality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I was there as a New Englander.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I knew what it was like then.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's just as as gobbled up as can
be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got to tell you, I think you were
down there, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a couple of volunteers from Utah,
Canada came by our booth down in San Jose.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, these guys are like,
we're from Utah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're thinking about putting together a
show.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I'm in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really thought if someone asked me to
force rank the 50 states, honestly,
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought Utah and Texas would be last.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, Texas even has a CBD program.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people don't know there are
dispensaries nobody knows about.
[SPEAKER_00]: They keep it under wraps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very much a red state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Utah, I was so embarrassed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They know they went for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just shows an incredible awareness
to the homeopathic medicinal properties
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis can and can be derived from
provide to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all of a sudden you have this
radical paradigm shift of the value of the
[SPEAKER_01]: product, not just financially,
but actually as a product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now they're saying, hey, we can we can
work with opiate addiction.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can work with all the seizures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have the new EPA approved or the FDA
approved of dialect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it may be thirty seven thousand dollars
for a year's treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the point is that it has been accepted
at a level that nothing else has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it begins the belief and the
acceptance so that you can start to really
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out how to use this varietal or
this family of varietals.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people finally get some benefit they
need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the stigma is not on them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't have to be ashamed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their children find relief from products.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have to go illegally get in other
states and they risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, they don't have to.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm digging it, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: For any beating I'm taking in business
over the last couple of years,
[SPEAKER_01]: where we always felt like we were getting
pounded out making the transitions.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where every time you were shifting,
you were like, well, and then the cost of
[SPEAKER_01]: building your own world was really,
really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people say that, you know,
the naivete that we didn't understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's that nobody understood it because
the regulations change so frequently that
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to modify, modify, modify.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just an incredibly expensive
process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for anybody that got involved in
cannabis, they bled money.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all have the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The investors coming in, I'm bleeding,
growers, I'm bleeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what it is when you build.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a real world.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think people understand how tough
things have been.
[SPEAKER_00]: They think it's all business as usual in
the triangle.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll take the beaten for the benefits
of the general population, where if the
[SPEAKER_01]: general population can use cannabis to
alleviate issues that they really could
[SPEAKER_01]: benefit from and it allows them to have a
better quality of life, then what do you
[SPEAKER_01]: really put a value on that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the thing is that for us in
cannabis, we just have to accept that
[SPEAKER_01]: there was a huge trade, that we traded a
lot of our personal freedoms for a greater
[SPEAKER_01]: good.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they say large companies are taking
the money, but regular people are
[SPEAKER_01]: benefiting in a way they couldn't prior
because access wasn't allowed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, well, just move to
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that simple, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't just pick up and move when
you're poor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially not to a state like California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be a transient, and then it's
just a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so finally, you get individuals that
have the ability to easily access stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: readily available, tested, no more
predatory products.
It's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's huge.
It's huge.
It's huge.
