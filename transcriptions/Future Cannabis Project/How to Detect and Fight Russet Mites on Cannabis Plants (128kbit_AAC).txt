[SPEAKER_01]: Russet mites are toxic to the plant,
different than a normal mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a normal mite basically drains a plant
of its sap and dehydrates it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a little baby vampire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flee.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of it like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: A russet mite would be more like a brown
recluse bite.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where it has toxins that kill the plant
and thin it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you see is in vegetative growth
you'll see plants that suddenly look where
[SPEAKER_01]: the stems on the new growth look half the
thickness of the old growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you almost characteristically see
incredible leaf roll up as if it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: magnesium deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you notice a very paling in color
almost like it's a zinc iron deficiency.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see all these weird little signs
and none of them would be present normally
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of a sudden you start to see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll typically see these problems in the
lower leaves first because russets usually
[SPEAKER_01]: come in from the bottom and come up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the bottom line is if it's wind born,
which I know it had to have been on my
[SPEAKER_01]: farm, they landed on the top of the damn
plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: They landed all over the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we look for these damages.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now in vegetative you can see it and if
it's in vegetative I think sulfur couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: be a better choice because for us it's
cannabis farmers with the prices we're
[SPEAKER_01]: facing, the idea of using extremely
expensive control methodologies is really
[SPEAKER_01]: not applicable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not to knock enzymatics.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like enzymatics and they work well if
one understands how to use it and if one
[SPEAKER_01]: understands that they are rough on the
epidural layer of plants just like sulfur
[SPEAKER_01]: can be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So both of them can chew up a plant a
little bit but sulfur is exceptionally
[SPEAKER_01]: cost effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just can't use sulfur in flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: It will flavor the cannabis and it will
flavor the extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sulfur is something you can't use once
we're into flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all through vegetative purpose it's
fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fantastic miticide too and absolutely
aggressive on all insects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just do it in the morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: All sprays should be done in the morning
when the plant hasn't heated up chemically
[SPEAKER_01]: and you can lay this on and just follow
your IPM programs.
[SPEAKER_01]: The problem with using sulfur is if you
mix it with like an agricultural oil and
[SPEAKER_01]: they start to become aggressive on the
leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're using sulfur you have to
really agitate the material otherwise it
[SPEAKER_01]: comes out in too much of a heavy chunk.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so enzymatics can bleach a leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur can bleach a leaf.
[SPEAKER_01]: Potassium bicarbonate which you use for
powdery mildew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same thing if you don't shake that up
enough it will leaf bleach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all products have a phytotoxicity to a
degree if it's too concentrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But ultimately potassium bicarbonate
couldn't be any cheaper to use for powdery
[SPEAKER_01]: mildew control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sulfur couldn't be any cheaper to use
as an anti-fungicide and pest control.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once we get into flour now to me the
only thing that you really want to work
[SPEAKER_01]: with there is predation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And predation is like I said is really
simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just what you're going to do is
you're going to talk to your bug company
[SPEAKER_01]: and you're going to tell them what your
environmental conditions are and if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these things really make a difference
in the reproductive rates, quantity and
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because entomology study of bugs is
so complex I always work with a bug
[SPEAKER_01]: supplier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll find one that you want to work
with.
[SPEAKER_01]: My guy's out of Oregon and he's my
consultant on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we do is we've just had him come in
and help us understand pest IPM and then
[SPEAKER_01]: we run by him what we're working with and
anything new in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people breed these bugs,
create these bugs for these purposes and
[SPEAKER_01]: as pathogens change the bugs need to
change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're in a situation where it's
colder and wetter you need something
[SPEAKER_01]: different than a predator that likes it
hotter and drier.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this is a speciality.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't where you just go grab a couple
of lady bugs from the local store and just
[SPEAKER_01]: throw them in your grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's really that simple once you get
down to it where you're just applying
[SPEAKER_01]: living predation to do the work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what you have is you have plants
that are not covered with any kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: product at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you can really sell these plants in
the concentrate market which for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: people is where a lot of this should be
going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the concentrate market's a huge
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for a lot of people that have bulk
cannabis that no longer has a black market
[SPEAKER_01]: value and it's got a very slow white
market value, it has excellent value in
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate if it can be made into
concentrate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody keeps talking about this
eight times increase of cannabis in
[SPEAKER_01]: California where the legal market has got
eight times the amount of pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eight times the amount of clean pot?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if 88% of the cannabis in California is
considered dirty and unsellable it means
[SPEAKER_01]: only 12% of the total exists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well 12 times 8 is 96.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gives it right back up to 100 again.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think we have eight times the
cannabis in the state that people think we
[SPEAKER_01]: do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they have eight times too much
pot.
[SPEAKER_01]: But not cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not medical grade cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not food grade cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not testable cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the whole point of this is to get
the farmers to be able to get a product
[SPEAKER_01]: that makes it through these tests because
these tests are going to hold you back.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to be where in the past you
could take a sample and if it failed,
[SPEAKER_01]: well then you could go and find another
source for that cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as we go forward the distributors will
hold the batch lot and then the test
[SPEAKER_01]: invalidates the batch lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now you have a batch lot that's
invalidated and the state will make you
[SPEAKER_01]: take it off your inventory on all your
track and trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of individuals who are in
cannabis do not really understand what
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated cannabis is.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all 215 guys and they sell to the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're not running anything legal in any
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: shape or form in terms of a real legal
transaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: The real transactions are going to occur
through a highly regulated track and trace
[SPEAKER_01]: methodology that's going to be able to
hold batches and then determine these
[SPEAKER_01]: batches are no longer good.
[SPEAKER_01]: These batches will have batch lots.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a batch makes it through the system and
comes out dirty, they'll go back and track
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll be held liable.
[SPEAKER_01]: There'll be class action lawsuits because
all the states have followed suit with
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something that you've got to be
crystal clear about.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to create products that have
nothing on them that will cause you
[SPEAKER_01]: problems or the people problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's above moral.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a legal issue now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for people whose morality is a little
askew, well their wallets going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: little askew too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of those should get you back on
track.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with russet mites, what are some of the
ways that fighting russet mites can make
[SPEAKER_00]: your cannabis dirty?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about, so you're saying
sulfur is safe to use, but only up
[SPEAKER_00]: until...
[SPEAKER_01]: Only up until flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people try to use just different
pesticides that you can use.
[SPEAKER_01]: Russet mites aren't hard to kill
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a tremendous different number
of families of pesticides that one can use
[SPEAKER_01]: that are all available illegally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, if you're a grower,
you know how to get illegal pesticides
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're not hard to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: And any of those families of illegal
pesticides work.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no, I'm not going to tell you which
ones to use because then you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: go use them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sulfur and beneficials is what you need to
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And enzymatics, if you're able to work
with that also, those are good strategies.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main point is that you have to be
highly vigilant on your plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for a lot of individuals when
you're running new cultivars, you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know what to expect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you start to see changes in performance
and you don't know if it's what's supposed
[SPEAKER_01]: to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that in the test plants and
plants we don't know is where we get the
[SPEAKER_01]: problems first because we don't see it
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So plants that you're most familiar with,
you'll be able to do an IED on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're really doing what you're
supposed to be doing, which is actually
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping an eye on the crop, you're walking
through your fields and you're looking for
[SPEAKER_01]: changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if everything looks the same,
then it's easy to see what doesn't match.
[SPEAKER_01]: When people do a shoddy job, then
everything looks different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one can't find the unusual.
[SPEAKER_01]: One has to find something that is just
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: When everything's different, it's
impossible.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're doing a good garden and
practice where you standardize on what
[SPEAKER_01]: you're doing, then what's going to happen
is you're going to be able to go through
[SPEAKER_01]: and in veg, you'll start to see this
change in the apical tips of your plants
[SPEAKER_01]: where they literally look like they're
radically thinner and smaller and tailor
[SPEAKER_01]: with extreme zinc and iron and nag
deficiency all in one shot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're going to go, there's no way I
have this problem because the rest of the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant looks great.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that point, you've got to get yourself
a good quality microscope, loops,
[SPEAKER_01]: and get down into these leaves and start.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, all the russets and broads,
they hide in the node.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they burrow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're tough to see and they move
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you almost can never see the bug
itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what you'll see is little silicone
nodules.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's their eggzacks.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you can find some, you can find the
damage and then flip the leaves and look
[SPEAKER_01]: for these little trails of egg,
you clearly know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as soon as you see that top growth,
don't think you're having a nutrient
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where did it suddenly happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: It wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would not go from full health to no
health overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has happened over a period of like a
week or two.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've seen a sudden change.
[SPEAKER_01]: This isn't slowly happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you have to respond to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you can respond to it, you can get
the plant to get this toxin out of its
[SPEAKER_01]: system through more vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe we only get in a heavy
infestation only half of what we were
[SPEAKER_01]: going to get, a third of what we were
going to get.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's better than none.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the farmers have to see
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once they are aware of that this is
something that exists in the world,
[SPEAKER_01]: you just know that you should be spraying
your vegetative plants and keeping them
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy as an inoculation, as IPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you treat the flower and plants,
like I said, with the beneficials the
[SPEAKER_01]: whole time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you see, you know, a wave that come
in because you're having an infestation at
[SPEAKER_01]: a neighbor's garden, then we can add
adults.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you don't have to add adults and
juveniles if you're trying to do
[SPEAKER_01]: protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: The juveniles are all you have to add.
[SPEAKER_01]: The adults come out pre-hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're ravenous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they'll just get the population up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the juveniles release over the course
of a month out of a satchel.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're these little, basically look like
a dryer sheet with a little hook.
[SPEAKER_01]: And inside them, different types of mites
exist, different type of predator bugs,
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on what we're trying to kill.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you hang these on the plant about six
to eight inches off the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this way, as they release, they move up
and start to colonize through the plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: chasing the russet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we go forward, we'll find better
methods to deal with all this,
[SPEAKER_01]: biologically speaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, it's pretty much equivalent
to the fire.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the russet probably took out as much
cannabis as the fire took out.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, easy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we go back to talking more about why
the russet mite has been such a big
[SPEAKER_00]: problem this year?
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you seeing that throughout
southern Humboldt County?
[SPEAKER_01]: Russet mites everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all through California now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been spread everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Russet mites all over the United States.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because plants move all over the United
States.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people have russet on indoor all over
the place now, because that's a buffered
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have russet all over Mendo,
all over Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it is it's in all the
neighborhoods.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I see it most, where you have
everybody has their home garden in the
[SPEAKER_01]: yard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Russet mites came through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they come in through some other plant
that came from the nursery?
[SPEAKER_01]: Typically, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, I don't and I'm not saying that
because I have a nursery, because I don't
[SPEAKER_01]: think the russets are coming from
everybody's nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes, yeah, some russets might be
coming from a nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you would damn well know you had
russet at your nursery, because what does
[SPEAKER_01]: russet prevent?
[SPEAKER_01]: Propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the mothers are covered in russet,
they're not striking roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's hard to have a russet mite
infestation and sell the russet mite
[SPEAKER_01]: clones, because you're not going to
produce any russet mite clones,
[SPEAKER_01]: because they don't want a root.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you end up having pathogens that might
get on the clones themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: But typically, if the mothers are infested
with russet mites, they don't want to
[SPEAKER_01]: strike a root.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what I know is that's how we
learned what these were from the initial.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like a broad mites in a nursery probably
nine years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got them into a flower room, got them in a
nursery.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it completely changed the propagation
rates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's how we knew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wiped out an entire operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we know is that if we use IPM
correctly, and we're using sulfurs,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're using frasses on the nursery
here, too, the frass is good for all the
[SPEAKER_01]: spidermon eggs, that we compost tea,
brew it up so we get a little
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrated, and then we just fold it or
spray the whole facility with it every
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Instead, frass works really well on most
eggs and sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'd kill anything else.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the mite problems are predominantly
people are not aware of this problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so most growers are growers,
but does that mean that you're a
[SPEAKER_01]: professional farmer?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you got tomatoes in your
backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean you have an ag degree?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does that mean you don't identify that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't need an ag degree to
identify it, but are you that involved?
[SPEAKER_01]: So like ultimately, what is your level of
involvement in the thing you're in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Most people with cannabis are 20%
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have a full-time involvement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to come to your patch and go,
wow, I don't know what's wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then a week later, you go, wow,
it's dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then a week later, it's died.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you go, I got russet mite.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then you go online to the crop that's
in 20% infestation, and the news is to
[SPEAKER_01]: burn it to the ground and kill every plant
and burn you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm laughing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, and you're going to burn your
neighbor's crop, too, and you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: burn the world around you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody tells you to burn your crop,
and they're giving you some horrible
[SPEAKER_01]: advice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they'll share their crop with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: What you want to do is you want to fight
the problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm telling you, organic biology can
really control this to a degree.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to be able to spend the
money to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you're going to have to
figure out, is the cost worth what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: about to grow or lose?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just think that as these problems
become more and more prevalent,
[SPEAKER_01]: people become smarter and smarter in how
they deal with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be able to understand what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't see a lot of the issues that we
saw prior.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd say the powdered mildew issues don't
seem to be so prevalent, because people
[SPEAKER_01]: started to learn how to grow OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started to realize that you can't
grow it in north slopes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't grow it in shady areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you overfeed it, it'll get PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you dep it and you don't vent it,
it'll get PM.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so pretty soon, people started venting
the dep.
[SPEAKER_01]: They started lack of overfeeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they don't grow OG in situations where
you're going to get pathogenic issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so lo and behold, the amount of OG
that's available this year that isn't
[SPEAKER_01]: fungally infected, that's clean,
is high, because 20 years after growing
[SPEAKER_01]: the cultivar, people kind of figured out
what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you're going to do is you're going
to have the same thing with russet.
[SPEAKER_01]: The people in 20 years will figure out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know what to do with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the easier the solution, the less
people want to take it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if it's kicking their ass,
it must be really complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, this is what you've got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to work on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we figured out, we tried a lot of
different methods, but I'm really happy
[SPEAKER_01]: with what we've done this year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I like the fact that the nursery is
able to contain all the issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had russet come in here one year and hit
my CBD bed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And same thing, airborne.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blew right in.
[SPEAKER_01]: All airborne, windborne.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blew in from somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone had a truckload of something in
dirt, maybe, who knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it blew in and got in the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we saw it on those CBDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I know that I said,
listen, I'm going to attack this thing
[SPEAKER_01]: agriculturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to knock it out with sulfur.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we blasted it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blasted out of the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: Never had it come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I challenged people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come through the loop and find it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no russet in the damn building.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wiped it out of the building.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we wiped it off those cultivars
because we're going to burn the building
[SPEAKER_01]: down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like really, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have the tools to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what you're going to find is,
like for me personally, I noticed that the
[SPEAKER_01]: issues are primarily in plants that are
older.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I saw myself was that in plants
that had the most infestation,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was older cultivars, meaning,
you know, stuff from the 90s.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things had been, you know, cut and cut and
cut and cut and cut and cut and cut and
[SPEAKER_01]: cut.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you chose cultivars, it had a
little bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sometimes some cultivars which you
poorly chosen where they liked the
[SPEAKER_01]: product, but they should have went through
another 150 seeds and found the one that
[SPEAKER_01]: all so grew heartily.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are prone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the immune system, you know,
plants technically don't have one,
[SPEAKER_01]: but let's just use it as a way to explain
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The immune system is reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then this problem is real.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in plants that are healthy and solid,
they can fight it with very little help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And plants that are compromised,
they don't do well at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what that means is that on your
strain list, just whatever got hammered
[SPEAKER_01]: this year, don't grow next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just realize that that's how you approach
it in ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's whether the market wants it or
not.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it can't be produced, the market can't
have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's just how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Someone else will produce it where they
can.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need to find what works for you in
your garden, works for you in your
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And predation and control of these
pathogens is part of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: What works for you where you're at and
what can you use to not make it so
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd rather have cultivars that didn't need
the help because that's just more money I
[SPEAKER_01]: have to keep spending.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when pounds were a lot more valuable,
I don't think anybody even cared.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, just spend the money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're seeing people breaking out
calculators right now for the first time
[SPEAKER_01]: on the phone when they go to the grow
store.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my whole purpose on this this whole
time is to be agriculturally efficient
