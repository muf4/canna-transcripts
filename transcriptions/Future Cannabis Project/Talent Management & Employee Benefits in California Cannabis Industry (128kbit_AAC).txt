[SPEAKER_07]: We're going to talk about something that
has been very near and dear to me my
[SPEAKER_07]: entire career, which is employee benefits.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, the benefits arena has
changed dramatically over the last five,
[SPEAKER_07]: eight years with the ACA and, or
Obamacare.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, the employers getting fined
for not having employee benefits and just
[SPEAKER_07]: basically Corey's going to talk about,
you know, what you need to do for your
[SPEAKER_07]: employees, what you can do for your
employees, what options you have out
[SPEAKER_07]: there.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, I'm really excited because I've
worked with Bolton for many, many,
[SPEAKER_07]: many years.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, Corey, if you will enlighten us,
I'd appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have been working in the cannabis
industry for about two years now,
[SPEAKER_04]: but the insurance industry for about seven
years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, one of the biggest things that I see
is in the employee benefits and retention
[SPEAKER_04]: of employees, and especially in the
retail, as I'm sure she'll speak to,
[SPEAKER_04]: is there's a lot of turnover.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, one of those areas is not offering
employee benefits and not taking care of
[SPEAKER_04]: those employees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, they are your most valuable asset
that need that taken care of, especially
[SPEAKER_04]: here with the Affordable Care Act.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that needs to be offered.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, there's a couple of handouts going
around that we have described what those
[SPEAKER_04]: employee benefits are, when it comes to
penalties and so on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything under 100 employees in the state
of California is considered small group.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you're basically rated based off of
your age and your zip code.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anything above 100 employees, you get
composite rating and much better rates and
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes much better benefits.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, one thing that we have done is
partnered with Oakstradam, a university
[SPEAKER_04]: that has an association called Oakstradam
Business Association, that has created a
[SPEAKER_04]: composite rating for small group employers
to give them access to large group health
[SPEAKER_04]: benefits and rates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, just to give you an example is most
small group benefits as it's rated based
[SPEAKER_04]: off of age, if you were paying,
and this is an example, full disclaimer,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you're paying let's say $400 a month
for this employee in a small group,
[SPEAKER_04]: in the large group it may be $189 or $200,
which is a big savings for small
[SPEAKER_04]: businesses out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's definitely important to learn and
understand what the employee benefits are
[SPEAKER_04]: and what's available to you guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, when you're looking at getting
benefits for your staff, it is an amazing
[SPEAKER_07]: retention tool, but it is a cost to the
company.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, it's really a great idea to speak
with somebody like Corey that can really
[SPEAKER_07]: help you understand how you can structure
it so that maybe it's not so damaging to
[SPEAKER_07]: the company finances.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or, if you're doing really, really well,
like I know all of you are doing,
[SPEAKER_07]: then maybe you could be a little bit more
giving to your staff, which trust me,
[SPEAKER_07]: they appreciate a lot of people out there,
even with the ACA, they don't have
[SPEAKER_07]: benefits, they can't afford it.
[SPEAKER_07]: California Care, it's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: If you're really young and really healthy,
you get great rates.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, the older you get, the more you have
to pay.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an unfortunate truth.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, talking to a broker, somebody like
Corey is so invaluable, even if you're
[SPEAKER_07]: just thinking about it, you know,
go into your thought process with some
[SPEAKER_07]: really good information behind you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, now we can talk about going into
retail and bringing it all together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right now, we're kind of on the smaller
end of not hitting that 100 employees,
[SPEAKER_06]: but it's still really important to be
thinking, like he mentioned, in terms of
[SPEAKER_06]: turnover, that as you're bringing people
into this industry, what's gonna keep them
[SPEAKER_06]: here, what's gonna keep them growing,
what's gonna turn them into tomorrow's
[SPEAKER_06]: leaders, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of turning them frustrated right
away, running out the door because this is
[SPEAKER_06]: crazy, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: But, some businesses might not feel ready
yet for things like health benefits,
[SPEAKER_06]: but there's also some other creative
benefits that you can move towards to
[SPEAKER_06]: start getting yourself there as you budget
for a little bit more stability for your
[SPEAKER_06]: employees.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've partnered with an HR company that
offers things like employee assistance
[SPEAKER_06]: programs.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, maybe that's not full on health
benefits, but if you have somebody dealing
[SPEAKER_06]: with a specific issue, they can reach out
and get some support.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there are benefits like that
mentioned, or even things like flex time
[SPEAKER_06]: with your scheduling or paid time off that
can show your staff that you do appreciate
[SPEAKER_06]: that they're here for you and that you're
here for them as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, even if you feel as though you're a
business that's maybe not ready to start
[SPEAKER_06]: investing in things like health insurance,
vision, dental, all that good stuff,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's definitely some creative solutions
that can make your company more
[SPEAKER_06]: competitive to bring people to your place
and working their talents for you instead
[SPEAKER_06]: of with somebody else.
[SPEAKER_06]: You touched a little bit in the last panel
about this transition from the gray
[SPEAKER_06]: market, if you will, to the new legal
market.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I think that this is a really
important place to have some of these
[SPEAKER_06]: conversations because what we were doing
before, again, I don't think people were
[SPEAKER_06]: intentionally doing things wrong.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just maybe didn't have to do things a
certain way.
[SPEAKER_06]: But now that you guys are reading through
the regulations, we see that labor law
[SPEAKER_06]: violations are serious violations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, getting to know your labor codes and
doing all that is something that's really
[SPEAKER_06]: important now that maybe was easy to gloss
over before.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think as a retailer, manufacturer,
whoever you are, to stop looking at
[SPEAKER_06]: yourself as a cannabis business that
applies to cannabis rules and start
[SPEAKER_06]: imagining what it would be like if you
were selling or manufacturing a totally
[SPEAKER_06]: normal product.
[SPEAKER_06]: What kinds of things as a retailer would
you have to abide by?
[SPEAKER_06]: Instead of going to cannabis regulations,
you'd be going to the labor code,
[SPEAKER_06]: to the business and professions code.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, looking to these places and pretending
like we're any other industry is a really
[SPEAKER_06]: great place to start.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are you seeing as far as the
day-to-day challenges in the industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, the challenge is twofold in this
transition, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have employers who have done things a
certain way for a long time who are maybe
[SPEAKER_06]: afraid to change procedure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this is a good strategy in some ways
because, you know, when you're constantly
[SPEAKER_06]: changing policies, that's bad for employee
morale.
[SPEAKER_06]: And right now, we kind of have these,
what's the law?
[SPEAKER_06]: What's not in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, the good thing about HR is there's
not a whole lot of questions about what
[SPEAKER_06]: the law is.
[SPEAKER_06]: California labor laws are easy to find.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, figuring out what that is allows you
to be compliant in that way almost right
[SPEAKER_06]: away.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are things that are not going to
change in another two months.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, there's sometimes resistance from
employers in that way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, hey, I've always paid people cash at
the end of the day, so I just want to stay
[SPEAKER_06]: doing that before, you know, things change
again.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, that's not something that's going to
change in 2019.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're still going to have to abide by the
labor laws.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think that that's really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do often see resistance from employees
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: Certain people who were coming to the
industry before wanted benefits,
[SPEAKER_06]: if you will, like not having to show up to
work on time or being able to be medicated
[SPEAKER_06]: all the time, getting paid cash at the end
of the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, those were, some people considered
those things benefits and the transition
[SPEAKER_06]: to, no, you're going to get direct deposit
every two weeks and I'm going to take out
[SPEAKER_06]: your taxes and pay my payroll taxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are difficult transitions.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for me, I keep coming up with
transitional strategies, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, for both my employers and my
employees, this might not be what it is
[SPEAKER_06]: forever, but this is what we're going to
try now to get to a more compliant place.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, taking those baby steps is a lot
easier for people than recreating your
[SPEAKER_06]: entire business model overnight.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have personal knowledge of a cannabis
broker who buries his money in his
[SPEAKER_07]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know if he does it today,
but I know that if he ever moves,
[SPEAKER_07]: I know where I'm going to start digging
because it's a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I know that that's how people were
keeping their money because they couldn't
[SPEAKER_07]: put it in a bank.
[SPEAKER_07]: They couldn't do anything traditional with
it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, now the thought of paying taxes on
that money, that's got to be mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you got that free and clear,
but now you're legal, you're in the
[SPEAKER_07]: system.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, we have to pay taxes,
all of us do.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I don't like it either,
but you know, you just have to help
[SPEAKER_07]: everybody make that transition and I think
we can help you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you know, you may have questions and
you may get really, really angry at times
[SPEAKER_07]: because it's the way you've always done it
and nobody should be able to tell you how
[SPEAKER_07]: to run your business.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I got to say, sorry, Uncle Sam,
he tells us all how to run our business.
[SPEAKER_04]: I briefly touched on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it is, as I mentioned, a health
insurance platform.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you get employee benefits,
medical, dental, life, vision,
[SPEAKER_04]: long-term disability, short-term
disability, and a few other benefits.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is for the employees of small
businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what that does is it gives small
businesses the opportunity to offer health
[SPEAKER_04]: benefits, but they are large group health
benefits.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's like if you have 2,000 employees,
you're getting benefits as if you had
[SPEAKER_04]: 2,000 employees even though you only have
10 employees.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, they're very broad benefits and they
are affordable as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, right now what we're working on,
Patrick back here, he is working with me
[SPEAKER_04]: on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We would collect information on the
employees and the employer and the
[SPEAKER_04]: employees, and we will submit to the
health carriers and look at rates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it should be going live November 1st.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, there is a couple of handouts.
[SPEAKER_04]: One is on health care, but also one is on
coverages that are very important for the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of manufacturers,
distributors, growers, et cetera,
[SPEAKER_04]: and how to protect that product and
protect your assets.
[SPEAKER_04]: In some of those handouts, my contact
information is on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it just kind of gives you some
descriptions on what those coverages are
[SPEAKER_04]: and why they're important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, take a look at those because I know LA
County in itself is requiring certain
[SPEAKER_04]: coverages to be able to get the license.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, just look at that and be aware of that
before going in to apply for those
[SPEAKER_04]: licenses.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a retailer, I've noticed one of your
strongest strengths for good morale and
[SPEAKER_06]: efficiency is to have very accurate job
descriptions.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, instead of having people who fit,
you know, oh, hi, you're my employee and
[SPEAKER_06]: you're going to do all of these things for
me.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually a little bit easier to have
an organizational structure that supports
[SPEAKER_06]: this is your role and your expertise and
to fit people into that and to grow out
[SPEAKER_06]: those places.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, I understand that not everybody is
necessarily ready for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I'll move on to you guys for some more
maybe legal advice.
[SPEAKER_06]: But just in general, I feel like I've seen
people thrive a lot more when the
[SPEAKER_06]: expectations are very clear about what
they're supposed to be doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: For multi-state employees, and I'm going
to just address this from a payroll point
[SPEAKER_07]: of view, when you're paying your folks in
different states, you have to abide by
[SPEAKER_07]: those payroll laws within that state.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, if cannabis was not legal in another
state, I'm not sure how that would work as
[SPEAKER_07]: far as I'm sure it would be fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're a licensed entity, then you have
a license in that state.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's fair.
[SPEAKER_08]: You could have an entity that serves
another purpose for your corporate
[SPEAKER_08]: structure and potentially is not in a
licensed state.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, that's important.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you could have a sales rep that
lives in some other state that's not
[SPEAKER_07]: licensed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Georgia.
[SPEAKER_07]: Georgia.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, when you release their checks,
you release them based on Georgia.
[SPEAKER_07]: Georgia's taxes, and you have to fall
under Georgia's legal employee laws.
[SPEAKER_07]: But even though they probably work in
multi-states, so I don't know if that
[SPEAKER_07]: would be a huge issue at this point in
time, but it's something to remember and
[SPEAKER_07]: consider.
[SPEAKER_08]: Corey, do you have any corporate strategy
you'd like to share with us?
[SPEAKER_08]: Perhaps we have a licensed entity in
Nevada and in California, and then we have
[SPEAKER_08]: a call center in Michigan.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, the way we do it on the insurance
standpoint on the risk management is we,
[SPEAKER_04]: different state, we'd write a different
policy for each state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just because crossing state lines,
obviously you can't do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of other things within the
insurance side.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we would do.
[SPEAKER_04]: But keep in mind, aside from that,
on the health insurance side, if you have
[SPEAKER_04]: over 50 employees, whether you're local or
you're multi-state, you are subject to the
[SPEAKER_04]: Affordable Care Act and the penalties that
they have as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I can't tell you how many cannabis
accounts that are being acquired are all
[SPEAKER_04]: over the place that may have 100 employees
and they don't offer employee benefits.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could literally cripple the business
overnight if there was an issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: In the state of California, is there a
threshold for the number of employees that
[SPEAKER_08]: you would want to have from that
perspective?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if you have over 50 full-time
equivalent employees, and there's some
[SPEAKER_04]: information on that on the handout,
you are subject to the Affordable Care Act
[SPEAKER_04]: and offering, you have to offer benefits
if you have 50 full-time equivalent
[SPEAKER_04]: employees.
[SPEAKER_08]: May we all be in that position?
[SPEAKER_08]: Brett, you have a question for us?
[SPEAKER_10]: So, maybe in a different applicable
version of what the gentleman just
[SPEAKER_10]: said, very common is management companies.
[SPEAKER_10]: So, say you have somebody that you all do
packaging, you have a microbusiness,
[SPEAKER_10]: and you work a third of your job in each
one of these jobs.
[SPEAKER_10]: More and more now with management
companies because a management company can
[SPEAKER_10]: come in and serve as many of the HR and
banking issues for, let's say a
[SPEAKER_10]: microbusiness, that's three different
licenses.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you noticing that you're working more
with management companies versus I mean,
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm just pulling a name out of it,
like, either, you know, distribution or
[SPEAKER_10]: you're working with, like, their
management companies.
[SPEAKER_10]: Are you seeing that, not the specific
reason to give it a say?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's called outsourcing and businesses now
are looking at the need for having
[SPEAKER_07]: in-house because when you have somebody
in-house and under your employment,
[SPEAKER_07]: then you're paying your payroll taxes and
you're having to give them sick leave and,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, benefits.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, a lot of times, like for my service,
small companies would absolutely not need
[SPEAKER_07]: a full-time HR person.
[SPEAKER_07]: That would absolutely not be financially
responsible, I don't think, because it's
[SPEAKER_07]: something that, you know, once I get in
and get you compliant on an ongoing basis,
[SPEAKER_07]: it's a very simple thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I, from my point of view, I'm seeing a
lot of outsourcing out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: To touch on the management companies,
very common.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll see most of the distribution
companies, manufacturers, all of them in
[SPEAKER_04]: separate entities.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the risk side, depending on the
common ownership, we can structure that
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's fine to protect that business,
but it still correlates with the common
[SPEAKER_04]: ownership when it comes to the Affordable
Care Act.
[SPEAKER_11]: This is
[SPEAKER_08]: a question about transitioning in our
industry and this is open to all of our
[SPEAKER_08]: panelists, but the question was about
integrating the OG, our original gate that
[SPEAKER_08]: would be individuals who have been in the
industry for potentially 20 plus years or
[SPEAKER_08]: longer, legacy cultivators, for example,
and then those individuals who see the
[SPEAKER_08]: green rush and want to be a part of this
flourishing industry, the greatest,
[SPEAKER_08]: fastest growing industry of our day.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we bring them together to work as a
cohesive group towards the common goal of
[SPEAKER_08]: the corporation or the entity as it may
be?
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'll leave it to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, I like to refer to these as
start-overs instead of start-ups because
[SPEAKER_07]: you have to deal with the legacy and the
OGs and that is probably one of the most
[SPEAKER_07]: difficult things to deal with because you
have the attitude of it's always been done
[SPEAKER_07]: this way versus somebody coming in and
saying we can make it better.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, what I recommend is that you put
change management, a strategy in place,
[SPEAKER_07]: and you really try and respect both sides.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's very easy to say, you know,
well, you've been here for forever and you
[SPEAKER_07]: just don't know how to change your way of
thinking and they really do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Some people, you know, to be brutally
honest, some people won't make the cut.
[SPEAKER_07]: They won't last, but if you have a really
strong respect for your old employees,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I talk time served, never age,
and the incoming employees and you really
[SPEAKER_07]: try to get them together and you put
together a strategy that everyone can
[SPEAKER_07]: agree on and then you monitor it and you
really make it, you help them understand
[SPEAKER_07]: why it's necessary and the more you
communicate with them, the more apt they
[SPEAKER_07]: are to change.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you just have to pay a little bit more
attention and I guarantee in the long run
[SPEAKER_07]: it will probably be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_06]: I definitely want to touch on this because
I've had some very real experience with
[SPEAKER_06]: this as a retailer and I would definitely
second what you were saying about making
[SPEAKER_06]: really clear expectations and
communicating that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like there's a lot of, first of
all, if the new people coming in want in
[SPEAKER_06]: on the green rush, they're definitely
going to have to understand that it's
[SPEAKER_06]: patrons first because all of us,
retailers, manufacturers, regulators,
[SPEAKER_06]: who do we work for, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's these people who are trying to come
in and get access, the people who fought
[SPEAKER_06]: for medical cannabis and it voted for
adult use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, we have to make sure that first and
foremost, this is not about us as
[SPEAKER_06]: employees, this is about those patrons and
a retailer, you are absolutely dealing
[SPEAKER_06]: with that on the front lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think that integrating those two
different ideas is really important and I
[SPEAKER_06]: would go a step further and say that
diversity within your staff is essential
[SPEAKER_06]: because cannabis, with the exception maybe
of Osterdam University, there's nowhere
[SPEAKER_06]: you can go to get groomed for cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Some people are going to learn it in the
gray market, some people are going to come
[SPEAKER_06]: in brand new here, but the idea is
everybody has a different experience with
[SPEAKER_06]: this plant and has a different experience
maybe from another industry that they're
[SPEAKER_06]: going to bring a lot of strengths.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if your new people think they
understand what's going on and they're not
[SPEAKER_06]: going to listen to your older employees,
they're going to miss out on a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: valuable knowledge about the history of
how we are here, which is really
[SPEAKER_06]: important.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I also think at the same time,
if you've got people who are like,
[SPEAKER_06]: no, I'm only going to work here if I can
get cash at the end of the day and dab
[SPEAKER_06]: while I stand here, yeah, they're not
going to make it because I say this all
[SPEAKER_06]: the time, one of the biggest
misconceptions in the cannabis industry is
[SPEAKER_06]: that being a bud tenderer or a customer
assistant or whatever your store calls it
[SPEAKER_06]: is an unskilled position, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: These people need to understand body
systems, complex regulatory systems and
[SPEAKER_06]: product lines that change, oh,
what, every two weeks?
[SPEAKER_06]: Lately, that's kind of how it feels,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So, if you're going to have people coming
in here, they're going to have to be
[SPEAKER_06]: people who are engaged and I think that
you can find these people from all kinds
[SPEAKER_06]: of walks of life.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, coming in as a manager and saying,
hey, these are my expectations and all of
[SPEAKER_06]: these people from diverse populations have
to come to this, I think you're really
[SPEAKER_06]: going to see a lot of strengths and listen
to your staff as well, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: sit down with them and say, hey,
maybe I'm newer to this and you been in
[SPEAKER_06]: this for five years, what can we learn
from each other?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because maybe I'll learn something from
somebody who's been in cannabis for 15
[SPEAKER_06]: years and they're going to learn something
from my experience which comes from an
[SPEAKER_06]: outside industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think that this is a great strength
that we have here when we're building
[SPEAKER_06]: something, you know, 10 years from now it
might be, oh, yeah, it's just this guy
[SPEAKER_06]: went to cannabis college and so he's a
shoe in, where right now we can actually
[SPEAKER_06]: build some of these relationships that
create a stronger workforce and diversity
[SPEAKER_06]: is literally written into these
regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, I think that this is important,
not just from OG cannabis people to the
[SPEAKER_06]: newcomers, but all across the board we
have to make sure that everybody's voices
[SPEAKER_06]: are being heard and we're using our best
ideas.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're in it for the green rush,
I think you're going to find that the
[SPEAKER_08]: community does not support you in that
effort.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're in it to bring medicine and help
people and to restore the medical access
[SPEAKER_08]: that we had prior to prohibition,
then you're going to find that people come
[SPEAKER_08]: out in big numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: To help you build something.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter, do you have anything to add?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, Peter says no.
[SPEAKER_08]: Peter says thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Santa Monica Task Force is holding your
resolution.
[SPEAKER_08]: They would like your signatures.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am a contributing member.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're one of our industry partners.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, if you have information that you'd
like to garner, Jude can assist you with
[SPEAKER_08]: that and you can also sign up for
resolution.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here in Santa Monica, we do have a unique
experience in that we don't have any
[SPEAKER_08]: retailers, not medical, not adult use.
[SPEAKER_08]: An ordinance was passed in 2015
authorizing two retailers and as of right
[SPEAKER_08]: now, we've had a hold up with live scan.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those, what I call winners, not been yet
announced, but stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_08]: We will have access to medical cannabis
here in Santa Monica very soon and
[SPEAKER_08]: potentially the Santa task force will be
able to provide some crucial information
[SPEAKER_08]: regarding public safety.
[SPEAKER_08]: I spoke to the city of commerce this past
week and we talked about medical cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: and the audience really wanted to provide
some Q&A feedback because they wanted more
[SPEAKER_08]: information about public safety.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the questions were, how is
cannabis use affecting the number of
[SPEAKER_08]: accidents on the road?
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, these are very
controversial questions, the answers to
[SPEAKER_08]: which are debatable according to the
source.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've just been legal for adult use here
since January.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just got our regulations.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, having that data and being able to
report on it is quite difficult,
[SPEAKER_08]: but potentially we can put that together
and we'll be able to communicate more
[SPEAKER_08]: succinctly on issues pertaining to public
safety in the future.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right, gentlemen in the back.
[SPEAKER_08]: Follow up question.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to work with both mom and pop
entities.
[SPEAKER_08]: We also want to work with some of the
larger corporations.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're seeing that mom and pop entities are
maybe having a difficult time with cash
[SPEAKER_08]: flow and be able to purchase our MOQs or
minimum orders.
[SPEAKER_08]: How do we provide a more level playing
field for both mom and pops and those
[SPEAKER_08]: larger corporations?
[SPEAKER_10]: So, as a buyer who's also dealt with your
company among many other companies is
[SPEAKER_10]: consistent communication.
[SPEAKER_10]: When I reach out to you, get back to me,
let me know what you have in stock right
[SPEAKER_10]: now.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everybody has varying amounts of product
and stock from stores to distributors to
[SPEAKER_10]: vendors.
[SPEAKER_10]: As soon as you know something,
even if you're knowing that that week,
[SPEAKER_10]: hey, I still don't know where we're at,
communicate that with us.
[SPEAKER_10]: Keep your leaf link up to date.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a big issue as many of us use leaf
links.
[SPEAKER_10]: Leaf link or cantile or handshake and all
these different, you know, platforms to
[SPEAKER_10]: allow us to order.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like keep that stuff up to date.
[SPEAKER_10]: Don't allow me to go place an order on
there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you call me back or you shoot me a
text, which I've asked you to email me
[SPEAKER_10]: only.
[SPEAKER_10]: So really just everybody is the
distributor.
[SPEAKER_10]: To answer your question is just step up
your game and communication.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're talking about HR and staffing,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: And now all of a sudden we're going to
talk about distribution.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think this industry is really
interesting because we have the choice to
[SPEAKER_06]: make some ethical choices, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So you're sitting here and now you as a
distributor have choices to make.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have X amount of product.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can determine, you know, how can I
increase maybe for these corporate clients
[SPEAKER_06]: who have a lot of cash flow and money to
burn and they're like, they don't have as
[SPEAKER_06]: tight of a budget.
[SPEAKER_06]: And can I use that business to literally
sustain maybe something that's a little
[SPEAKER_06]: bit near and dear to my heart,
which is supporting mom and pop
[SPEAKER_06]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe as a distributor, that's really
important to you.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's different ways to make this
decision.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, some purchasers are saying,
you know, well, it's not only enough to
[SPEAKER_06]: have good product at a good price point.
[SPEAKER_06]: You also need to make sure that everybody
on your staff has held these moral and
[SPEAKER_06]: ethical standards, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's purchasers all over the place
that are making stamps like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think distributors can do an
equal thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you know, okay, well,
that person can order tens of thousands of
[SPEAKER_06]: cartridges at one time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So obviously they're able to get that
lower price point.
[SPEAKER_06]: What can you do to make that money work
for these smaller businesses?
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's something that you want to see in
your industry?
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody that you want to see on your
corner.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you guys as distributors
don't only want to see Walmarts of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis, well, then guess what?
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to have to build into your
business model.
[SPEAKER_06]: How am I going to be sure to protect the
little guy, if you will?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think instead of, instead of
wondering how small businesses are going
[SPEAKER_06]: to be able to compete with large ones,
think, well, what can I do to make my
[SPEAKER_06]: business more attractive to these,
to these smaller companies?
[SPEAKER_06]: So maybe you don't offer net 15 to big
corporations, offer it instead to the mom
[SPEAKER_06]: and pop who you trust.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am preparing for this event this
evening, actually had a similar
[SPEAKER_08]: conversation with someone and it was kind
of a debate of, you know, well,
[SPEAKER_08]: are the retailers in LA mom and pop
organizations?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I got a rose caregivers,
for example, they got bought, I think
[SPEAKER_08]: maybe six months ago.
[SPEAKER_08]: A lot of the shops are getting purchased
by bigger companies.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it kind of made me question,
well, are they mom and pops?
[SPEAKER_08]: And the answer on the other side of this
conversation was yes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Many of these retailers here in LA have
been in the industry for 15, 20 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are mom and pop.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's been difficult to maintain their
storefronts in the face of regulations,
[SPEAKER_08]: in the face of a declining consumer base,
in the face of all these new things that
[SPEAKER_08]: we have to adapt to.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they are mom and pops.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if there is a way to support those
entities that you think could use a leg
[SPEAKER_08]: up, then yes, absolutely, let's do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a comment or question over here.
A comment just kind of on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's also a way now with the
inclusion, hopefully the upcoming
[SPEAKER_05]: regulations of the distributor to
distributor abilities here to work with
[SPEAKER_05]: just more local regional distribution
companies that can actually be hubs for
[SPEAKER_05]: the dispensaries in that particular area
that don't have large order placement that
[SPEAKER_05]: you can create relationships with.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a technology provider for retail
operations.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a lot of dispensaries in the San
Francisco area that aren't looking to
[SPEAKER_05]: necessarily make huge orders, but smaller
orders more frequently and looking to
[SPEAKER_05]: partner with more regional distribution
hubs where folks, larger distributors can
[SPEAKER_05]: now bring that product in that's already
been tested, store it somewhere,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then purchase smaller quantities and
do like.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_08]: He just pointed out that distribution
companies are actually required to store
[SPEAKER_08]: their inventory in warehouses and
potentially they could be dispatching that
[SPEAKER_08]: in smaller orders.
[SPEAKER_08]: Retailers historically have had difficult
time managing inventory or holding
[SPEAKER_08]: inventory in what is a small retail space.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they typically prefer to have more of
a turnover.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they're ordering smaller orders more
frequently.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's a great solution.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, right here.
[SPEAKER_06]: All of the above.
[SPEAKER_06]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that I am somebody who's very
excited for the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_06]: I love the idea of lab tested cannabis and
all of these different things,
[SPEAKER_06]: but absolutely throwing a whole new set of
rules on a 20 year old industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Creates an awkward transition.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that that's that's absolutely
true.
[SPEAKER_06]: And many people have talked about the
changes in budgets, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So from going from paying people cash at
the end of the day to paying payroll taxes
[SPEAKER_06]: and all these things, things.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are huge hurdles.
[SPEAKER_06]: The fact that and maybe we've got people
here from all over California,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I think we can all talk to about the
fact that the black market is not being
[SPEAKER_06]: particularly regulated.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for me as a retailer, well,
guess what?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm paying my state taxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm paying my county and city taxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm paying my labor taxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I can only sell edibles that are 100
milligrams where the guy down the street,
[SPEAKER_06]: he's not paying any of those taxes.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's not playing his employees correctly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And he's got all the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these these are huge hurdles that I
think we're facing in this present moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that, you know, and hopefully
in the future, we're looking back at like,
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, well, the regulated market did get a
leg up because we have access to things
[SPEAKER_06]: like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: HR companies and health insurance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Good thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But right now, I think it is a big
struggle and a big risk.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, if you're somebody who's been in
this industry for a while and you're
[SPEAKER_06]: looking at, hey, I've made this business
from the ground up and I've made it really
[SPEAKER_06]: successful and I have to do literally a
180 just to compete.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that 180 comes with a pretty big price
tag.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think, you know, I can really only
speak to the retailer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if there's anybody who wants to speak
on maybe if there's bigger hurdles to
[SPEAKER_06]: manufacturing, cultivation, something like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think just the constant transition
is really tricky, not only for employee
[SPEAKER_06]: morale and turnover, but just for
operating costs.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's it's difficult to make a perspective
plan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Where do I want to be in a year from now?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, what are the rules going to be a
year from now?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think there's anybody in this room
who can say that for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's I think these are big hurdles.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even though we're excited to move
forward into the right related market,
[SPEAKER_06]: it doesn't mean it's simple.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did that answer the question?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think I think the support that we can
all make an effort to go to those licensed
[SPEAKER_08]: entities when we do purchase cannabis
products.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's make that effort, because it's true.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's been that's actually been an issue
for retailers here for quite a long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they've been reporting them to
authorities.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's been no enforcement and it's
continued.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think it's really up to us as
consumers to educate our fellow consumers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And really support this license movement
so that we are protecting our industry and
[SPEAKER_08]: those individuals who have put a lot of
money on the line.
[SPEAKER_08]: And they've hired attorneys and they've
gone through the application process.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not easy.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we really need to make sure that we're
supporting those individuals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also to touch on that, get involved with
the local associations or CCA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really, you could meet some other
operators that can can help out with some
[SPEAKER_04]: of those hurdles that you're struggling
with and and ask for their help.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're more than happy to help and lend a
helping hand.
[SPEAKER_08]: Neil is here with Irva and he would like
to know if anyone would like to comment on
[SPEAKER_08]: the closing of the comment period and how
we can actually contribute our opinions
[SPEAKER_08]: through the comment period.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did anybody attend that today?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe we can jump in on that as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a hearing today in downtown Los
Angeles from the BCC to discuss these
[SPEAKER_08]: matters.
[SPEAKER_08]: She says it was 90 seconds and it was a
joke.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nobody could say what they needed to say.
[SPEAKER_08]: They were enthralled.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have comments or any questions and
stuff that you need addressed,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we all do in the industry, go to bcc
.gov and say what you need to say to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't have people not showing up to
those get togethers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys have stuff that you're not happy
with in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our industry to make right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in its infancy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speak up and show up to those meetings and
support your fellow industry members.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can send an email to the BCC or the
CDBH.
[SPEAKER_08]: They are very receptive.
[SPEAKER_08]: They will respond.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dean wants to say something.
[SPEAKER_03]: To piggyback off what Rico was saying and
give it a more concrete sort of avenue for
[SPEAKER_03]: you to do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the things I've been really
impressed with over the last three,
[SPEAKER_03]: four months with the CCIA is it has
committees that are dedicated to the
[SPEAKER_03]: different industry segments and the supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there is a manufacturing committee.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a retail.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a distribution committee.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you are a retailer and you've got
concerns that you don't think are being
[SPEAKER_03]: heard or you don't know where to go with
them or you don't know what the industry
[SPEAKER_03]: is doing for you, that's a great place for
you to go and speak with retailers that
[SPEAKER_03]: are all sitting in a room figuring out
what comments do we want to provide.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're a manufacturer or a grower and
you can't get product through a testing
[SPEAKER_03]: lab where it's getting bottlenecked and
you're getting frustrated or you send it
[SPEAKER_03]: out to test and it passes and then you
send it to a manufacturing facility and
[SPEAKER_03]: then it comes out as a finished product
and then it fails and you're saying how
[SPEAKER_03]: the hell is this possible?
[SPEAKER_03]: Get involved in that group.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're right now, the manufacturing
committee, the testing committee,
[SPEAKER_03]: the retail committee, they're all sitting
around a room saying, what's your fault?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're screwing up my product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the testing labs are saying,
don't kill me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just doing what the law says.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they're saying, oh, really?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're starting to listen to each
other and figure out how you put these
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations together in a way that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So go find a group like that and do
exactly what Rico said.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't sit here or have a couple of drinks
tonight and say it's bullshit,
[SPEAKER_03]: the BCC is out of control, the regulations
suck, and I can't.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not going to make you successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's going to make you successful is
going out and doing something about it and
[SPEAKER_03]: finding an organization like that where
you can contribute an idea to a group
[SPEAKER_03]: that's actually sitting in Sacramento and
trying to make these things work and put
[SPEAKER_03]: it into action.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm seeing it happen first hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: Get in there and make yourself heard
before this comment period closes,
[SPEAKER_03]: because we don't know when there will be
another opportunity once these regulations
[SPEAKER_03]: get fully bagged, plan sort of intended as
it was coming out of my mouth.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are monthly events.
[SPEAKER_08]: The last event, last month, we actually
had a panel and we talked about the open
[SPEAKER_08]: comment period.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's quite important.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you can reach out and just put
together a list of what you think is
[SPEAKER_08]: relevant, send it over.
[SPEAKER_08]: You doesn't have to be exhaustive.
[SPEAKER_08]: It can be what's most crucial to you.
[SPEAKER_08]: And just be aware that, unfortunately,
some of these things are built into Prop
[SPEAKER_08]: 64 and we can't change them.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of them require a referendum,
but you can certainly voice your concerns
[SPEAKER_08]: and potentially someone on the other line
is going to make a note of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the future, those things will
change.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are here to affect policy.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're not here just to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're here to bring awareness and space
for you to talk about these issues.
[SPEAKER_08]: So thank you for being here.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_08]: You've taken the first step.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's more that you can do.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll help you do it.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: How are we doing on time, guys?
[SPEAKER_02]: Raffle.
[SPEAKER_08]: Time for the raffle?
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
Raffle.
Time for the raffle.
