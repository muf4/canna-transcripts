[SPEAKER_01]: This is Richard Mendelson.
[SPEAKER_01]: Richard Mendelson is an internationally
recognized wine lawyer with Dickinson,
[SPEAKER_01]: Peetman, and Fogarty in Napa.
[SPEAKER_01]: He also directs the wine law and policy
program at UC Berkeley Law School,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he is the sole proprietor of Mendelson
Wines that produces a Pinot Noir and
[SPEAKER_01]: fortified dessert wines.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a graduate of Harvard, Oxford,
and Stanford Law.
[SPEAKER_01]: He is the author of From Demon to Darling,
A Legal History of Wine in America,
[SPEAKER_01]: Wine in America Law and Policy,
and Appalachian Napa Valley, Building and
[SPEAKER_01]: Protecting an American Treasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without further ado, please take us
away into the Appalachian world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Chris, and thank you, Blake.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Welcome to my home in Napa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been asked to set the stage for our
discussions today by giving you kind of a
[SPEAKER_00]: tour de force of Appalachians and
geographical indications around the world
[SPEAKER_00]: and how we get to the point we are today
of crafting our cannabis Appalachians and
[SPEAKER_00]: what the background to that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to divide my remarks into the
following sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you could move the slide to the next
one, please, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, I'm going to talk about the road to
GIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: GIs, we're going to be using a lot of
acronyms here.
[SPEAKER_00]: GIs stands for geographical indications,
and it started with the Paris Convention.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an international perspective all
the way forward to TRIPS.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the trade related aspects of
intellectual property rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an agreement, as we'll see,
that was adopted by the World Trade
[SPEAKER_00]: Organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will tell us what Appalachians
and geographical indications are and the
[SPEAKER_00]: issues that we've been trying to deal with
both nationally and internationally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we're going to move roughly equal
time segments for each of these sections
[SPEAKER_00]: to wine Appalachians in both the Old World
and the New World.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because really, while by no means is wine
the only commodity for which Appalachians
[SPEAKER_00]: apply, it's primarily the focal point
because it's of such long standing,
[SPEAKER_00]: particularly in the Old World,
that we have a lot of lessons to learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, we have the experience in
the United States and other New World
[SPEAKER_00]: countries of our American viticultural
areas, which is the third bullet here,
[SPEAKER_00]: AVA's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to tell you basically what
the experience has been with AVA's in our
[SPEAKER_00]: country, what we've learned, what we've
created, what the regulations say.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an area in which I've participated
actively throughout my career in actually
[SPEAKER_00]: forming AVA's in California and elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to spend a little bit of time
talking about what I regard as a very
[SPEAKER_00]: important subject, conflicts between
geographic trademarks, that is a mark that
[SPEAKER_00]: includes a geographic term, and GIs,
which primarily are geographic terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes they appear in both,
both a geographic mark and in a GI,
[SPEAKER_00]: and there can be conflicts between them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we have a session later in the
webinar on that specific topic,
[SPEAKER_00]: and so all I want to do is introduce the
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm going to leave time for Q&A.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the roadmap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's start.
[SPEAKER_00]: Section one, the road to GIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It started in 1883 with the Paris
Convention for the Protection of
[SPEAKER_00]: Industrial Property.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an era in which rapid
industrialization was occurring around the
[SPEAKER_00]: world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really the first legal
agreement that deals with, they use the
[SPEAKER_00]: terms, indications of source and
appellations of origin, but that agreement
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't define either of those terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: That came in later agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll see, down at the bottom,
that there are 177 contracting parties to
[SPEAKER_00]: the Paris Convention, including the United
States.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very, it's an agreement that was
broadly adopted around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the important thing about the Paris
Convention is that it only addressed false
[SPEAKER_00]: indications and not misleading
indications.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, for example, the agreement at large
did deal with both false and misleading,
[SPEAKER_00]: but not with respect to origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Article 10B of the agreement is the
provision that says that not only would it
[SPEAKER_00]: be prohibited to use a false indication of
source or appellation of origin,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, if I said on a wine that it's
Napa Valley, and in fact, the wine,
[SPEAKER_00]: none of the grapes come from the Napa
Valley, that's false.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it also the agreement wanted to get at
misleading or deceptive uses of those
[SPEAKER_00]: names.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can take many forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can take the form of just saying that
this is like Napa Valley or similar to or
[SPEAKER_00]: Napa Valley type.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be one indication where it's
not really from there, but it could be
[SPEAKER_00]: misleading or variations in spelling.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see that the agreement
prohibited not only false indications,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also those that were liable to mislead
the public as to the nature, the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing process, the
characteristics, the suitability for
[SPEAKER_00]: purpose, or the quantity of the goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, it doesn't say origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Origin was in an earlier draft of the
agreement, but it was pulled out because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's always been a controversy about
the use of generic terms, which we'll talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about in a minute, and other kind of
indicators to tell someone that a wine is,
[SPEAKER_00]: for example, like a Bordeaux, even though
it's not a Bordeaux wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the next agreement in this litany is
the Lisbon Agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why the heading, ooh,
this is very garbled.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not exact.
[SPEAKER_00]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Lisbon Agreement, we roll forward all
the way to 1958, but it's a very important
[SPEAKER_00]: agreement because it, for the first time,
defines an appellation of origin,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll see that in the first bullet.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a geographical denomination of a
country, region, or locality, designating
[SPEAKER_00]: a product originating therein,
and these are the important words,
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality or characteristics of which
are due exclusively or essentially to the
[SPEAKER_00]: geographic environment, including natural
and human factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the causal link that we talk about
between product and place, that it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: just that a product is manufactured in a
place or even that the raw materials come
[SPEAKER_00]: from that place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, the final product, whether it's
an agricultural crop, a handicraft,
[SPEAKER_00]: textile, whatever it is, whatever kind of
appellation system we're talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: the quality or characteristics of that
final product are tied directly to the
[SPEAKER_00]: geographic environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the case of an agricultural crop,
that's actually where the crop is grown,
[SPEAKER_00]: which we refer to as terroir, all of the
aspects of the natural environment,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it also includes the human factors.
[SPEAKER_00]: By that, I mean how you farm that land.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your planting density?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your root stock?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your trellis system?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you make the wine and the winery?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those human factors that result in
this final product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Finally, in 1958, we have a definition of
appellation of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a registry maintained by
WIPO, the World Intellectual Property
[SPEAKER_00]: Organization in Geneva, where you can let
the world know that you, as a contracting
[SPEAKER_00]: state of the Lisbon Agreement,
have recognized an appellation of origin
[SPEAKER_00]: in your state, and you'd like all the
other contracting states to abide by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are given notice by WIPO,
and within a year, they have the right to
[SPEAKER_00]: refuse protection, but they have to state
why.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those can be, for example, that a wine
name was in use in that country for a very
[SPEAKER_00]: long time without being an indication of
origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a pre-existing use of that name.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other reasons why a name may be
refused to protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, the Lisbon Agreement covers
not only false uses, but also any
[SPEAKER_00]: usurpation or imitation, even when used in
translation or accompanied by words such
[SPEAKER_00]: as kind, type, or like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once a name is protected, it cannot fall
into genericide.
[SPEAKER_00]: It cannot become a generic name once it's
protected in the contracting state.
[SPEAKER_00]: This goes much, much farther than the
Paris Convention in protecting against
[SPEAKER_00]: false indications, protecting against
misleading indications, and also defining
[SPEAKER_00]: in a very direct way the link between the
product and place in order to qualify as
[SPEAKER_00]: an appellation of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the downside, Chris, if you go to the
next slide, is that there were very few
[SPEAKER_00]: contracting parties, and you'll see that
they were mostly in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in Canada, the United States,
et cetera, Australia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did not join.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when there was an amendment to the
Lisbon Agreement, which took place in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2015, the Geneva Act, because the Lisbon
Agreement was seeking to make this treaty,
[SPEAKER_00]: this agreement, more widespread.
[SPEAKER_00]: They amended it in 2015 to cover not only
appellations of origin, but also,
[SPEAKER_00]: excuse me, good reason to turn off your
cell phone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, they covered the registration of
GIs, which is the agreement that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna turn to next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this is the World Trade
Organization Agreement on Trade-Related
[SPEAKER_00]: Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights,
TRIPS Agreement, 1995.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for the first time, we have a
definition of geographical indication,
[SPEAKER_00]: a GI.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you're gonna see here is that GIs
are a more liberal, a looser definition
[SPEAKER_00]: than an appellation of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or to put it another way, appellations of
origin are a subset of GIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: A GI, according to Article 22 of the TRIPS
Agreement, identifies a good as
[SPEAKER_00]: originating in the territory of a member
or region or a locality.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's identical to the appellation of
origin definition so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Except for the bold-faced language,
where a given quality, reputation,
[SPEAKER_00]: for the first time we see the word
reputation, or other characteristic of the
[SPEAKER_00]: good is essentially, not exclusively,
essentially attributable to its
[SPEAKER_00]: geographical origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are 164 member states that signed
this agreement, including the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it, like the Paris Convention,
it's widespread approval around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, in Article 23, there is a
protection that is more elevated than for
[SPEAKER_00]: any other goods and services for wines and
spirits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically, like the Lisbon Agreement,
the GIs are protected against false and
[SPEAKER_00]: misleading deceptive uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas all the other goods that are GIs,
that aren't wines and spirits,
[SPEAKER_00]: are not protected against misleading and
deceptive uses, but only false uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Article 24 contains exceptions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have exceptions for geographic
trademarks, which we'll talk about later,
[SPEAKER_00]: for generic names, where a name has been
used in a country for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, a lot of the cheeses in
America, like feta and parmesan,
[SPEAKER_00]: that really don't come from their original
sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's important to know about the TRIPS
Agreement is it's a minimum standards
[SPEAKER_00]: agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meaning that member states have the right
to put in place stricter rules governing
[SPEAKER_00]: GIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have their own GI systems,
we call those sui generis systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others, as we'll see in the next slide,
will use their trademark laws to recognize
[SPEAKER_00]: GIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last point about the TRIPS Agreement
is that there is no multilateral register,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you can look to, as you can at WIPO
for the Lisbon Agreement, and see the list
[SPEAKER_00]: of GIs around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are examples, photographic examples.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you click one more time, Chris,
I think some more will come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Names that you all know, parmesan cheese,
Parmigiano Reggiano in its translation to
[SPEAKER_00]: Parmesan, Darjeeling tea, Parma ham,
Indian river, naval oranges from where I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: from in Napa, Kona coffee, which is a
story unto itself, and even things like
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional knowledge, on the bottom left,
Ayurveda system of health in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was mentioning the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: protects GIs through the existing
trademark laws and does not have a sui
[SPEAKER_00]: generis GI system as occurs in the
European Union and other countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use certification and collective marks,
and I've just listed some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: certification marks and the registration
numbers in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: to give you an indication of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Parma ham, Darjeeling, Jamaica Blue
Mountain coffee, Vidalia for onions coming
[SPEAKER_00]: from Georgia, Parmigiano Reggiano,
and Roquefort, and here I give the
[SPEAKER_00]: definition.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were to look this up on the PTO,
Patent and Trademark Office site,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'd see that Roquefort is a cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been manufactured from sheep's milk,
cured in the caves of the community of
[SPEAKER_00]: Roquefort, in accordance with
long-established methods and processes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These methods and processes are the
natural, are the human factors that go
[SPEAKER_00]: along with the fact that the sheep's milk
and the caves are inside of the area of
[SPEAKER_00]: the Roquefort Appalachian, and these are
protected in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: as a certification mark.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, what are the differences then
between GIs and Appalachians of origin?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just in summary, GIs require a link
between the quality, other
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics, or reputation of the
product, and its place of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachians of origin require a stricter
link, namely that the product's quality or
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics are due exclusively or
essentially to the product's geographical
[SPEAKER_00]: origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: This means that the, usually means,
doesn't, every country will set up their
[SPEAKER_00]: own rules, but typically it means that the
raw materials are sourced in the place of
[SPEAKER_00]: origin, and that the processing of the
product takes place there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, on the bottom of this slide,
are the SEALs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we're gonna talk about SEALs,
I think, in the next session, for the
[SPEAKER_00]: PDOs, which are the Appalachians of
origin, for the PGIs, which are the GIs,
[SPEAKER_00]: the geographical indications, and then
they also have traditional specialty
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the three SEALs that are used in
the European Union to differentiate.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is, the European Union doesn't just
pick one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just that every product in the
European Union is an Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an Appalachian of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are PGIs, and some are traditional
specialties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to choose one or the
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Chris, yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One important thing to note about
Appalachians of origin and GIs,
[SPEAKER_00]: or any GI, we'll call Appalachians of
origin a subset of GIs, is that there is
[SPEAKER_00]: an ongoing tension between tradition and
innovation in these GI products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, an Appalachian of origin for a
product that's been around for a very long
[SPEAKER_00]: time has history and tradition to
encapsulate in the production methodology
[SPEAKER_00]: and all the, well, what we call in our
cannabis Appalachian regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: standards, practices, and cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is tradition to respect,
but there's also innovation that's
[SPEAKER_00]: important for any GI, because a GI can
die, and there are lots of examples of
[SPEAKER_00]: deceased GIs, because they didn't keep up
with the times, methods, the consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: demands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we find tension.
[SPEAKER_00]: I gave two examples here below.
[SPEAKER_00]: We won't spend any time on them,
because I'm going to move quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Mastodomascasac in the Languedoc
region of France, and Tinianiello,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is an Antonori wine, one of the most
famous super Tuscans.
[SPEAKER_00]: Both of these wines and their wine
properties were innovators, and they
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't like being bound by the Appalachian
of origin controls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to innovate, they literally
had to sell their wines as table wines,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they broke out of the AL system.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it was the AOC and the DOCG
systems in their respective countries in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to do their own thing, to try to
show that their innovation would make a
[SPEAKER_00]: better product, a higher quality,
with even better characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: More recognizable and distinctive
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, they were both successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what happens is then the Appalachian
authorities recognize that and change the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not a static process.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a dynamic process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide, please.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, let's turn to wine now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you click through all of these
bullets, Chris, you'll see the bottom one
[SPEAKER_00]: is typically Piscite, and you'll know
you're done.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to start with the controlled
Appalachians of the old world.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Appalachian d'origine
controle, meaning control, or DOC,
[SPEAKER_00]: denominazione d'origine controllata,
controlled.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does it mean to be a controlled
Appalachian?
[SPEAKER_00]: What it really means is that you are,
in essence, an Appalachian of origin and
[SPEAKER_00]: not a GI.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're getting into the issue of
standards, practices, and cultivars in a
[SPEAKER_00]: way that typically a GI does not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the old world, and I show the
example of Latache, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most famous Burgundy wines, and it's an
AOC, the grapes have to be totally grown
[SPEAKER_00]: within the Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only permissible grape varietals can be
grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow anything you want in that
area, but you just can't use the AOC.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't call yourself Latache if you're
not using Pinot Noir grapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to grow Cabernet there,
you'll be a rebel, and you can sell your
[SPEAKER_00]: wine as a table wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there are a host of other
criteria, both in farming and in
[SPEAKER_00]: winemaking, that you need to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've given some examples here,
the yield of grapes, minimum and maximum
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol percentage, but it's actually much
broader than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is called a cahier de charge,
is what the French call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not a recipe, it's a range of
parameters, so that you can still,
[SPEAKER_00]: as a wine proprietor, practice your
artistry and produce a unique product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have to stay within these given
ranges, and then ultimately you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: pass a chemical analysis and a topicity
test, literally, where a judge tastes the
[SPEAKER_00]: product and says, is this typical of a
Latache wine, given all the vintage
[SPEAKER_00]: variations and everything else that can
cause variations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's not typical, then it can be
thrown out, and it's not allowed to use
[SPEAKER_00]: the AOC on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, we didn't really
have much of a concept of provenance
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of the ashes of Prohibition in
1933, and trying to pull ourselves up by
[SPEAKER_00]: our bootstraps, largely through innovation
and technical expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: It really wasn't until the Paris tasting
of 1976, when some actually Napa Valley
[SPEAKER_00]: wines bested the wines of France,
that people started to use, on a more
[SPEAKER_00]: routine basis, geographical indications,
appellations of origin on their label,
[SPEAKER_00]: but nobody knew where they were,
they weren't regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here are two examples of Louis Martini
California Mountain Cabernet Sauvignon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure you all know where California
Mountain is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's wherever you think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no such thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Northern California, well,
all of us Californians can tell you where
[SPEAKER_00]: there is no real definition of Northern
California, and people have their own
[SPEAKER_00]: views.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a result, if you go to the next slide,
Chris, we ended up adopting a system,
[SPEAKER_00]: an appellation system, in the late 70s.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took effect in 1983, where we have,
for our appellations for wine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can use the United States,
a state or a county.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are political appellations,
of course, those boundaries pre-existed,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all know where they are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the new invention was this concept of
an appellation, or an American
[SPEAKER_00]: Viticultural Area, an AVA, that would
going to be created and established by the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal government.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not at the state level,
it's the Treasury Department, and the Tax
[SPEAKER_00]: and Trade Bureau, Alcohol and Tobacco Tax
and Trade Bureau that does, that runs this
[SPEAKER_00]: program, but AVA's would be created anew.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for each of these appellations,
because American Viticultural Areas are a
[SPEAKER_00]: form of appellation under the American
system, you would have to have a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: percentage of your grapes from that area
in the wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it did not control, and it does not
control, which variety of grapes you use,
[SPEAKER_00]: your yields, your farming methods,
your winemaking practices, only where the
[SPEAKER_00]: grapes come from and where the wine is
made.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you use an AVA on a label,
the wine must be made in the state in
[SPEAKER_00]: which the AVA is located.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in order to form an AVA, well,
let's go to the next slide, we'll get into
[SPEAKER_00]: how you form an AVA in a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the definition, defined as a
delimited grape growing region,
[SPEAKER_00]: distinguishable by geographic features.
[SPEAKER_00]: Interestingly, those are the same words
that we find in our proposed cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations, the boundaries of which have
been recognized and defined by TTB.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are two examples down below,
the Ohio River Valley on the right,
[SPEAKER_00]: Finger Lakes in New York on the left,
appearing on the label in direct
[SPEAKER_00]: conjunction with the grape varietal,
the Viognier and Roussaint on the right,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the Pinot Noir on the left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go to the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just to, and one more click,
please, just to show you examples,
[SPEAKER_00]: let's take the Hagafen label, that's a
Napa Valley wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that it says Napa Valley means
that 85% of the grapes are grown in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Napa Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fact that there's a vineyard
designation, Heston Vineyard, increases
[SPEAKER_00]: that percentage to 95.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, there's even more information
on the label, which you're allowed to use
[SPEAKER_00]: the L block of that particular vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, we have formed 245 AVA's in the 32
states of the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not supposed to read all that small
type, but this is right out of the Code of
[SPEAKER_00]: Federal Regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go to the next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here is how you form an AVA.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, you must show, and this is anywhere
anyone can do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be someone who's not in the wine
industry at all, doesn't grow grapes and
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't make wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can file an AVA petition with TTB.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever files that petition, whether
usually it's a group of vintners and
[SPEAKER_00]: growers together filing it, you must
adduce name evidence that currently and
[SPEAKER_00]: directly associates the name with the area
in which viticulture exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there has to be some grape growing
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the area within the boundaries must
be nationally or locally known by the name
[SPEAKER_00]: specified in the petition, although the
use of that name may extend beyond the
[SPEAKER_00]: proposed AVA boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have names that are
over-inclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have names that are
under-inclusive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they must, remember this is all done,
all of these regulations for wine in the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States are under the Federal
Alcohol Administration Act, which is in
[SPEAKER_00]: part a consumer protection, a consumer
information act, and this is to give the
[SPEAKER_00]: consumer information to guide their
purchasing decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's boundaries, obviously,
and they tell you, if you'll see down in
[SPEAKER_00]: four below, those are based on
characteristics seen on United States
[SPEAKER_00]: geological survey maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are topographic maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most boundaries are done based on
elevation contours that show on those
[SPEAKER_00]: maps, rivers and roads, mountain tops and
the like, not like in France where we
[SPEAKER_00]: actually use parcel lines, the lines of
your property to define an appellation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the most important point from my
perspective is distinguishing viticultural
[SPEAKER_00]: features, climate, soil, geology,
physical features, and elevation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The petition must explain with specificity
in what way these features affect
[SPEAKER_00]: viticulture and how they are distinguished
viticulturally from features associated
[SPEAKER_00]: with adjacent areas outside the boundary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many of these criteria reappear in our
proposed cannabis appellation regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have had over the course of what is
from 1983 to today, so that's 37 years,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've had the process of actually
subdividing appellations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We call them nested AVA's or sub AVA's
where, for example, on the left there,
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll see that Napa Valley in that
lighter tan tone has been subdivided into
[SPEAKER_00]: many other smaller area AVA's that capture
more distinctive geographical features,
[SPEAKER_00]: more distinctive grape growing
environments within the Napa Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Similarly, it's happened in the Wolsey
Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also happened in the Lamette Valley,
as you'll see on the right, in Lodi,
[SPEAKER_00]: in Paso Robles, and many other places.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is around the world a very common
thing, whether it's coffee or tea or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever the commodity is, to have nested
AVA's, larger down to smaller,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the consumer can play the,
I call it the appellation name game.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to know about Napa Valley,
that's one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I want to spend more money,
because it usually is more money,
[SPEAKER_00]: and buy a Howell Mountain wine and explore
those differences, I can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a way of understanding for the
consumer, better understanding the final
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Chris.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, well, this point is just to reiterate
what I said.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certain appellations command higher
prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the value add that comes through
an appellation that isn't the owned by one
[SPEAKER_00]: individual farmer or winery.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a collective of growers and vendors
inside the appellation that collectively
[SPEAKER_00]: own this property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in fact, when you put Napa Valley on a
wine, compared to California wine,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to spend $19.80 more on
average, according to, this was a UC Davis
[SPEAKER_00]: ag extension study.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go and use Oakville or Howell
Mountain, you'll be $40 plus more than
[SPEAKER_00]: that California wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're paying more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the question I always ask in the
classes I teach is, this is why we do
[SPEAKER_00]: tasting, is it worth it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it worth it to pay more for that Howell
Mountain wine than a California wine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, only you, the consumer will know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And hopefully the producer is producing
something that has, to go back to the
[SPEAKER_00]: definition of appellations, that has
characteristics and qualities that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: find and refine the next time you buy that
wine and help guide your education and
[SPEAKER_00]: purchases.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, quality, in fact, is not a criteria
of the AVA system because we don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the standards practices and cultivars that
are required to use an appellation name.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's much more leaving it to the
collective to experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's part of the American pride and
innovation rather than, well, we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have as long of a tradition, particularly
the traditions we had were interrupted by
[SPEAKER_00]: 13 years of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nevertheless, the successful appellations,
of which I would certainly include the
[SPEAKER_00]: Napa Valley as one, if not the foremost,
will do their own efforts at consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: education.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do the research.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll do the promotion.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be interested in sustainability,
whether it's social, environmental,
[SPEAKER_00]: or economic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is important to their having
loyal customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even though it may not be regulatory,
it is aspirational and voluntary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now a real effort on the part of AVA
is that want to succeed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are two examples, Coro Mendocino and
Lodi rules, each of which take the form of
[SPEAKER_00]: a logo.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are certification marks,
by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not, they are AOC style controls
but on a label, you will still find Lodi
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll find Mendocino on the label as
the appellation, but you'll find this logo
[SPEAKER_00]: that tells you what additional grape
growing or winemaking rules that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: voluntarily adhered to in order to put
this sticker on the label.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again, going back to this tradition and
innovation, this is the AVA's that don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have the tradition seeking to have more
AOC style controls, wanting to honor the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditions that are now being established
in those areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Next slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're just going to take a few more
minutes and then we're going to leave
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves open for questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to keep us on a tight timeline,
but I want to talk for a minute about the
[SPEAKER_00]: conflicts between geographic marks and
GIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would be an example of where somebody
comes into an area and they pick the name
[SPEAKER_00]: of their town or of a creek nearby and
they may be unwitting, that's the only,
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't want to use their family name
and they call their brand by a geographic
[SPEAKER_00]: name.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later, or maybe it's even before
the appellation was established.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether the appellation was established
before the trademark or after is
[SPEAKER_00]: important, as the third bullet there
shows, first in time, first in right,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a common trademark principle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just as important, and number one,
for me is the fact that nobody owns
[SPEAKER_00]: exclusively a geographic name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody owns the Napa Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody owns the name Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may use it and you have to use it
descriptively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's called a fair use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone can say, I live in the Napa Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_00]: I live in the Mattel Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want people to be misled.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, I think, and then this goes back
all the way to where we started with these
[SPEAKER_00]: international agreements.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you don't want people to be
misled.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a geographic mark, just make it up,
you know, well, I'll use it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mattel brand is put on products that do
not come from Mattel Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether the Mattel Valley is recognized
prior to that or after that, it misleads
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, with respect to the third
bullet, typically most intellectual
[SPEAKER_00]: property lawyers would say that this
should be resolved in who registers first.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the trademark preexisted the
Appalachian, well, they get to continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a believer in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's much more complicated than
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe in the rights of
Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a collective right and it's
an important one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the priority is legislated as it
is in the EU, which is much more akin to
[SPEAKER_00]: my views of giving priority to the
Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes it turns on good or bad faith.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I've got great stories here that I'm
not able to tell you because I don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's go to the next slide,
Chris, because I think this will set the
[SPEAKER_00]: stage perhaps for the later session on
intellectual property rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are the kinds of things that should
be taken into consideration in determining
[SPEAKER_00]: how to resolve differences between
trademarks and GIs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by trademarks, I mean trademarks that
include GI names.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reputation of the region, the
reputation of the mark, the length of time
[SPEAKER_00]: that either the trademark or the region
has that name has been out in the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: The extent to which the reputation of the
trademark assisted in the development of
[SPEAKER_00]: the reputation of the region and vice
versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: The value of the trademark and whether the
trademark holder is likely to be
[SPEAKER_00]: prejudiced or would the Appalachian holder
be prejudiced if one is given priority
[SPEAKER_00]: over the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know from the proposed regulations
that CDFA has proposed a three year
[SPEAKER_00]: sunsetting period for anyone who has a
trademark incorporating the name of a GI.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would have three years to continue to
use it after which you'd have to
[SPEAKER_00]: discontinue, pick a new brand name unless,
and this is an important exception,
[SPEAKER_00]: unless your wine or your cannabis or
whatever the product is, is descriptive
[SPEAKER_00]: and does qualify for the Appalachian of
origin name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So no one is putting a trademark holder
out of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just saying you must use that
name.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it's after three years after a
sunset period, you must use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Descriptively and accurately.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last thing I'll say about this and
then we'll open it up to questions is that
[SPEAKER_00]: we are at the beginning of the Appalachian
program for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what excites me so much about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was at the beginning of the American
wine Appalachian system too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an exciting time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the chance to minimize right now
the number of conflicts between geographic
[SPEAKER_00]: trademarks and Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, I would say anybody who after
the proposed regulations were made public,
[SPEAKER_00]: who goes out and registers a geographic
name that later becomes a GI, they should
[SPEAKER_00]: not get the benefit of grandfathering.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on notice that we will have a
geographical indication system or an
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachian of origin system for cannabis
in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So use geographic names at your
discretion, but also at your potential
[SPEAKER_00]: peril if they later become an Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with that, I think I've kept to my time
and I'd love to answer any questions that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a wealth of knowledge and I have
to admit that I have been flooded with
[SPEAKER_01]: text messages telling us how valuable this
has been so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I really, really appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much information that it's
almost hard to come up with sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: cohesive questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: But one of the things that you really hit
on was the purpose of the Appalachians
[SPEAKER_01]: from the consumer perspective is to be
able to experiment, to be able to find and
[SPEAKER_01]: refine certain qualities of a product that
you like, that you want to continue to
[SPEAKER_01]: experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the U.S., you mentioned that the AVA's
are primarily geographical, whereas in the
[SPEAKER_01]: EU, they sort of take everything into
account, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They take in the soil, the farming
practices, sort of the human aspect of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're talking about the ability to
communicate to a consumer, sort of the
[SPEAKER_01]: region, how helpful is it to sort of
include more of those factors rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: less?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: system, it seems like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just having the geographical indicator is
the bare minimum.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much more utility is there in an
Appalachian system that has those higher
[SPEAKER_01]: identifiers that we saw in sort of like
those Lodi brands that you brought up or
[SPEAKER_01]: the other ones there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think the answer to that,
Chris, is in part will a consumer,
[SPEAKER_00]: once they know what an Appalachian product
is, will it help them?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they be willing to pay that extra
price?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will they be willing to say, now I know
what a Mattel Valley cannabis is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know it's these cultivars.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's grown with these standards and
practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can rest assured when I buy the next
one, even if it's somebody, some other
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator, I'm going to find again those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what will allow that customer to
pay the additional dollars to invest in
[SPEAKER_00]: that region.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, even with AVA's, even though we don't
have that by legislation, the AVA's are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing it themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ventner grower groups inside the AVA's
are seeking to bring that value-add
[SPEAKER_00]: proposition, that education, that
guarantee of certain characteristics or
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities to the consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing it through privatization,
through voluntary certification marks and
[SPEAKER_00]: the like.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a sense, GIs and Appalachians end up,
it's a dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go back and forth and ultimately
you're trying to have loyal consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of that consumer question,
this is actually a question from Rebecca
[SPEAKER_01]: Stamey-White who's running our business of
Appalachians panel a little bit further
[SPEAKER_01]: down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's wondering, is this a chicken or the
egg problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that consumer investment in a
particular reason what drives an
[SPEAKER_01]: Appalachian or is the Appalachian itself
and the producers that are coming up with
[SPEAKER_01]: these Appalachians what drives that
consumer interest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a feeling about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's both, but it's the producers
first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones who are going to pay for
this to go through this process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones who know their product
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're the ones who will know what the
collective, they're going to be the ones
[SPEAKER_00]: who collaborate on all the information
that goes into a petition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to express this to their
consumers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's not just the onus or the
responsibility, the desire really comes
[SPEAKER_00]: first and foremost in my estimation,
my experience from the producers,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the consumers, they're the bottom,
they're the final test.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why in my class we taste every
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you can't see the difference,
if an Appalachian's standards practices
[SPEAKER_00]: and cultivars and everything that goes in
it is meaningless, then your Appalachian
[SPEAKER_00]: will die on the vine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, if it doesn't have those
characteristics that are recognizable for
[SPEAKER_01]: the rest of us, then what good is it in
the first place, I guess is the question.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much, Richard.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are unfortunately out of time for this
first very introductory presentation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so much there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're on our next panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
