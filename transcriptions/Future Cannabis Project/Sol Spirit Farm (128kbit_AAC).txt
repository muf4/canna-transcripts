[SPEAKER_01]: Go down the line and talk about kind of
the genetics and like, when you personally
[SPEAKER_01]: smoke each one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, how many of you are like,
I smoke this when I start my day and I got
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of shit to get done.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the shit we want to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So right here we got some clementine,
which great, even though really high
[SPEAKER_02]: mercine, it's still a sativa and keeps you
going and focused.
[SPEAKER_02]: A really great pain relief with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the clementine right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you also tell us how long?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, we've been growing these
strains just this one season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Trying things out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've switched up our way to do these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're getting them from some of the local
legal nurseries.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year we're running Hendrix stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running Mother's Milk, Charlie's
Girl.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're running Blueberry Muffin.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you kind of like pick what you're
going to do next season based on what's
[SPEAKER_04]: available or what you think the market's
going to be interested in?
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, it's a kind of combination of
what the market's going to be interested
[SPEAKER_02]: in.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do know currently we need to hit those
high THC numbers to make sure that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: easy to sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a silly game and not really how I
pick my own weed, but it is how I have to
[SPEAKER_01]: sell it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about what you like to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would be on this table if people
listened to you?
[SPEAKER_02]: We grew this amazing Colombian gold,
Oaxacan gold cross a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to get that going again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was called Zapitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any of that here today?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have any of that here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that was some really great sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, I like smoking a good sativa
mainly for the most early half of the day
[SPEAKER_02]: so that I can focus and work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that clementine is a great job with
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then this sour diesel here.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really, you know, nice focused and
a totally different flavor spectrum than
[SPEAKER_02]: the than the clementine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's still a good focused energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: How recent were these harvested?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are these pretty fresh?
[SPEAKER_02]: These are from last September.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year is the latest.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, they're not super,
super fresh, but they're at their peak.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're still, you know, they're testing
at twenty five percent, twenty four
[SPEAKER_02]: percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just quickly talk about what we were
talking about before, where you're growing
[SPEAKER_01]: and why having greenhouses like what
having greenhouses now allows you to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that you couldn't do before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, currently we're using the light
deprivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we came once the sun goes down off the
hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: We pull tarps down over the plants and
make some things at night time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then like an indoor scene,
you can have multiple harvests through the
[SPEAKER_02]: year and we can also bring it in early and
before the rains come.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so then that gives us the chance to
use a microscope and really look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes and figure out where,
you know, when they're at their most peak
[SPEAKER_02]: perfection and bring it in that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Versus harvesting when the rain versus
raining, you know, being like,
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, this is starting to mold and this is
going to mold now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, OK, it's time to harvest it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did that for a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've reduced your mold problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really, you know, and and we're really,
you know, we're we're getting on it now
[SPEAKER_02]: where we're inter planting other crops in
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about what cover crops are you
digging?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, we've really been liking
this clover we've been growing the
[SPEAKER_02]: perennial clover and but it's growing
underneath the ganja.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we can take and harvest that feeds
the soil mulches everything out.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't have to bring in any straw or
anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's that coming from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does it have pesticides on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to mess up, you know,
our product?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just closing those loops and
keeping everything from on on site.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, the perennial clover is
definitely part of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It breaks up pathogens and all that
because they don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just not straight one type of plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're breaking that up.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's the other types of plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rehouse raised beds or is it pots?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not raised beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're on a little bit of a hill.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so they're across the hill in a
contour fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you're in the ground in the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, that's a question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the farms we visit up in that
area, they're not in the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in the ground and we've been
nurturing them next to one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been nurturing the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's no till.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all like I said, there's that
perennial cover crop growing in their bed
[SPEAKER_02]: in our beds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we just take and replant in those
same spots again.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said two greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have four greenhouses, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many plants in each?
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's 900 plants in each, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, 450.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry, 450.
[SPEAKER_02]: 450 plants in each greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have generally about 1800 plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Per run.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we do two runs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a while where both runs are
around.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, and that way gives us a chance
to have eight different strains really
[SPEAKER_02]: easily and keep them all separate and
clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you talked about breeding and
developing a strain that you guys want to
[SPEAKER_01]: be known for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that in the works?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's in the long term.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're definitely going to be planting some
different plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's always interesting to see how
something does in this greenhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: situation versus what we used to do with
the full long term plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You grow those big monster plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a whole different game now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You said you're in between Humboldt and
Trinity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're in Trinity.
[SPEAKER_04]: So talk about Trinity a little bit,
because we don't really hear it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the Forgotten Emerald.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what I call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is some of the really ideal land.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's just not as many folks out in
Trinity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we kind of get lost on the wayside
on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But is it a tight community nonetheless?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so we're actually in the Humboldt
community.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're right there on that border,
like I say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we have a lot of friends that are
in Trinity that come into Willow Creek as
[SPEAKER_02]: their town, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, it's just a beautiful community
out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been out there for 20 years now and
just trying to improve that land.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got pigs, chickens, goats,
you know, growing our own eggs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's all trying to close those loops,
you know, trying to not have to import
[SPEAKER_02]: anything really is the long term goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're just trying to grow the cleanest
flower we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are your pest management
strategies?
[SPEAKER_01]: Multi-dention.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we bring in good bugs, is one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we surround our plants with various
types of supporting plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: That will help keep those good bugs
around.
[SPEAKER_03]: Companion plants, barrier plants,
and host plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's kind of three plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want Habitat?
[SPEAKER_03]: Stand right next to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned this from him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most good bugs that we want are
predatorial.
[SPEAKER_03]: They thrive off a perennial flower that
doesn't die every year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of bad bugs are annual.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we give a perennial flower that that
particular bug likes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if you want to keep it out of the
marijuana, then it might be a host plant
[SPEAKER_03]: for them or a barrier plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you do what you can do in an organic
way as a living thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like he was saying, bugs are transitional,
especially as bad bugs are here for a
[SPEAKER_02]: moment and gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we can build those perennial
cultures where, you know, live in forest
[SPEAKER_02]: and living and living surrounding
structures that are just helping support,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the gonogen the best way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have you found that your loss to insects
has decreased over the years?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or is every season different?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you know, we haven't had any
issues the last couple of years,
[SPEAKER_02]: knock on wood, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some of those mites.
[SPEAKER_03]: The ladybug growth and we saw it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was hard to press to take a picture of
a bud without seeing a lot of that
[SPEAKER_03]: ladybug.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ladybugs just crawling all over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, that was nice.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we've we've been yeah, we had a rust
that might problem a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: But did everyone have that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone did.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we just, you know, kept bringing
in, you know, good bugs until finally hit
[SPEAKER_02]: the right one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, we've been like,
say, bringing in then supporting plants to
[SPEAKER_02]: help keep those alive and trying to just
build that ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_04]: How many people do you have?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's there's three,
four of us right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you know, we got one of them right
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you spend a lot of time community with
the plants, huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're you know, they're they're this
special medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, you know, that's why I grow is
because the ability to provide this
[SPEAKER_02]: quality medicine that is earth conscious,
that's not not using lights that are then
[SPEAKER_02]: like having to be cooled off in an
artificial environment and trying to keep
[SPEAKER_02]: it just as natural as we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I grow grow what we can in the same
quality as any indoor better, in my
[SPEAKER_02]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, I the end, you know,
the test results are shown the same to
[SPEAKER_02]: these are some of these are in the twenty
four, twenty five percent THC and plus a
[SPEAKER_02]: couple percent terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now you're down here in Southern
California, Hollywood, the land of the
[SPEAKER_04]: sort of like outdoor bias.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But is it changing?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, I've always people come
look at the flower and they they don't
[SPEAKER_02]: recognize this.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: As being outdoor, it doesn't look like
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's that's been my goal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're just so they have this idea in
their head.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I have this idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But, you know, we talk to them.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, they have this idea,
the paradigm of what's good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't mean it's true.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: How wonderful that science is catching up
to the world and like we're educating.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel really ignorant around the young
people who are so aware of what the
[SPEAKER_03]: different things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a hard time with the vernacular.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of know what they're doing,
the terpenes and what not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Learning as we go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it is exciting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's not all about the THC.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, and what about the minor
cannabinoids and all of that?
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we go to the state test and,
you know, it does not test for a whole.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's only a very short list
of the cannabinoids that are being tested
[SPEAKER_02]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really because, you know,
we had this gelato.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the tests did 17.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the tests are lower than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really nice flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: It tastes great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It covered with crystals.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really nice looking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, all those flowers are available.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then those are probably the last to sell
because they've got that low number.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the cariphalene is a difficult thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's for anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a larger molecule than the mercy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like in its so like you feel like the
effects of no pain, like it doesn't affect
[SPEAKER_03]: you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have an effect in your mind because
you have an absence of pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's from the CV2.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which is what this is what I'm learning is
the largest molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the only terpene.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is a CV2.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think is what I read today.
[SPEAKER_03]: So educating myself in that regard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly, I think about finding a way to get
the most that we can in a healthy way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the general?
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to be what we're capable of
excellence.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just an understanding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Relax.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're learning every day and responding
and spiraling up.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And is this like you figure that like six
strains is a good number of strains for
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys to have?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Six to eight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Somewhere in that neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, plus you got a couple of little
experimental plants or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just keep that learning, looking for
that, you know, special plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you currently experimenting
with?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know, I mean, just growing some
seeds, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, every time so far we're growing
stuff you haven't grown.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're growing.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's two other ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Charlie's Girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: Charlie's Girl.
[SPEAKER_03]: MacMillan.
[SPEAKER_03]: And MacMillan.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other four that we're growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we'll learn how they look and how they
feel.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even though they say, oh, it will.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's going to be different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be different at every farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to be, you know, the terpene
profiles are different from the same clone
[SPEAKER_02]: grown in a different place because the
weather is different, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like these numbers don't mean anything if
I don't know that on average we're right
[SPEAKER_03]: where we should be or right where we're
not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like it just, it just gives you a
percentage of what is in that particular
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you kind of weigh and measure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, what's it doing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Smells like pepper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's a big one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We don't think that's really where the
exciting future is with, with,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, cannabis grown as a monocrop,
you know, where like every result is
[SPEAKER_04]: exactly the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like a moral world cigarette or something
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it should be more like a long,
you know, vintages, you know, certain
[SPEAKER_04]: years are better than others for whatever
reason.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, the weather, you know, when it's that
time and that's going to make a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had some crazy weather this last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We had rainstorms when, you know,
I wanted to be harvesting this,
[SPEAKER_02]: this year coming up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, well, that would have been
fine for the last 18 years, but last year,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, no, that wouldn't have been okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you have the greenhouse last year?
[SPEAKER_02]: We were putting greenhouses up last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we had some temporary greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is all future happiness.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we, we, we've grown with the
greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were just a temporary and,
you know, getting that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we did get the permit ones up enough
to do a crop and a half last year,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was a little late.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you get them from a company?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we got some, you know,
essentially a steel, steel hoop structure.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, and then.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Explain to us what you're about to light.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, this is some, some of the stuff from
the, it's still red and blue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's so bright.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may already be stick, stick it up to
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It should work.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure there's some dosy dough in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe a little wedding cake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe some sourdine, some cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have the.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're airing on the Sativa side.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a frisbee.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you remember, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Only there's no seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't have to do this at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a frisbee?
[SPEAKER_03]: Actually, I love one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think of that as?
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't know we were in a parking lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's electric.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's electric.
[SPEAKER_02]: Electric.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's battery operated and it just heats up
the tip.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of sucking in butane.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I don't like sucking in butane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was thinking you could have a lower
temperature so people could dab with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please tell us a story about your farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we've been growing up in the Emerald
Triangle there for almost 20 years
[SPEAKER_02]: organically.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just take now in the, in this legal
market and we're doing a light depth and
[SPEAKER_02]: able to bring it in when the weather's
just perfect and be able to bring in
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor quality while growing it outdoor in
the full sun using the most
[SPEAKER_02]: environmentally conscious methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: To get the best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, exactly.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're kind of, it's an interesting
combination of almost the indoor and the
[SPEAKER_02]: outdoor in a way where we can do multiple
harvests.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people are going for three or
four harvests.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've chosen two as I can do that with the
least environmental impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not need much lights using mainly the
sun, you know, whereas some folks are
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to push a little further.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to use a little more light.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many different strains are you working
now?
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eight strains a year is our current
number.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're looking for trying one per
greenhouse and you know, is the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a combination of sativas,
indigas, hybrids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try and bring all to the table.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see, you know, check out some of the
new strains, see if any of them are worth
[SPEAKER_02]: keeping.
[SPEAKER_02]: We ran this pre-98 Bubba Kush this last
year and we're going to run that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was absolutely fire.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, I mean, it's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: 25, almost 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm getting a contact.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already feeling it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we saved that for the evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is some of our hybrid and some of our
sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like smoking those in the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So work and not get all distracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's coming next?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you working on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, we're running some Charlie's
girls, some mother's milk, blueberry
[SPEAKER_02]: muffin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I lost another one.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, run some nice new strains this
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're also going to be running the pre-98
Bubba.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to maybe run some of that sour
D if we can get some more of that again.
[SPEAKER_02]: The website is soulspiritfarm.com.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking forward to charting your course.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Years to come.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where were we?
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like picture in picture,
interview in interview.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just filmed his whole thing and I was
like, I'll just post that too.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for cutting right in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the conversation don't mind us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've got that pre-98 Bubba Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's that's a killer evening strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like sit down and finish.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I smoked that purple punch in the evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one won't knock my ass out.
[SPEAKER_02]: But start hitting that fucking pre-98
Bubba Kush a little too early.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was I sat down on the bed the other
night and just went bam.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was out in seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what about taking some of your tops for
like resin or rosin?
[SPEAKER_04]: You done any of that?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've made a little bit at home and we
have done a collaboration with some
[SPEAKER_02]: friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hela Dank.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're doing a little collaboration with
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one's empty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ha ha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oops, we smoked that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_02]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the turps on that, you got to give
that a smile.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they really did a beautiful job.
[SPEAKER_02]: I always thought Hash had that one note
hash and this is like fruit, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's so fruity and tasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I was like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even for you, you've been doing this a
long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the possibilities of this plant
are endless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Endless.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's it's so amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, look where we've come in just a
few years to where we expect them to be 20
[SPEAKER_02]: plus percent THC and like that.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was fucking that was the pinnacle,
you know, 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see, there's this new Washington state
law they're considering that'll cap the
[SPEAKER_04]: THC for all
[SPEAKER_04]: the patients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's ridiculous because some of us
have a higher tolerance than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would put myself in that bucket.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely I've been at the city hall
proceedings where patients have come in
[SPEAKER_04]: and started crying at the idea that they
won't have access to not just,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the medicine, but the type of
medicine that they know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We, you know, we're it's unfortunate like
this whole legalization thing is
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely almost almost broken us
financially.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, I want this to be an
organic, natural evolution.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not looking for outside money.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is all all in house.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, it's a little
shoestringy at times.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're making it and just trying to.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the county's been super helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, no, the county's been helpful.
[SPEAKER_03]: So sometimes definitions of words change,
which was interesting for me to find out.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have been super helpful, like right
in the spirit of things like what do we
[SPEAKER_03]: need to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're worth right with things that
they did and didn't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is humble and trinity,
actually.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guys we've been working with have been
great.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I would go out and hang out with
Walter and hear different people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Walter had to almost become absent for
much of what went on, like because he had
[SPEAKER_03]: to spend so much time educating himself
and becoming aware.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he's quite aware of how to grow a pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, like how to legalize.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and how to do the legal hoops.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got bigger a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could you could get away with anything
on a pharmaceutical level that we're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're being regulated so much harder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hate to say the word, but metric.
[SPEAKER_04]: How's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you know, we've actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we're using it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the the we have one person that that's
what she does is metric.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she's been doing a good job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not doing her job more than
everyone else at the company loves their
[SPEAKER_01]: job.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you guys draw straws.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: We know where the tag sheet distress that
I have.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll speak on her only on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a level of distress in the spirit
of how we go to marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: The waste of the tags like we have
accumulated this thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you want to do like so that is right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're just making all this plastic tags.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each plant's got its own tag.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we're growing a bed of this
plant, right, we can label this bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one label versus now there's
150 plants in that bed.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's 150 tags.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're regimented like, oh,
where does the tag go from a dead plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, the number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, they are digital.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all they got, you know,
barcode and all this.
[SPEAKER_02]: But but they they don't reissue.
[SPEAKER_02]: They won't reissue that same number.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because they want that number to now
is done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about the labs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like you guys are far from so the labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so we don't have any problems with
pesticides or anything because we are so
[SPEAKER_02]: far out and we keep our stuff clean.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we know that it's been another selling
point for the brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's it's super clean out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess there's a 20 percent like dirt in
whatever you have clean water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have nice clean water.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use rain catchment and we're all off
the natural.
[SPEAKER_03]: He would say pull it like that's not
going.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you do any like rainwater catchment?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what that's what our water source
is, is rainwater catchment in the pond.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's regenerative farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're we're we were up for the
regenerative farming award.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't that mean leaving it better?
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying we're we're improving the
property and trying to build what we've
[SPEAKER_02]: from what we had, which was abused by some
great farming and trying to regenerate it
[SPEAKER_02]: into the most productive land we can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the pigs, we ran pigs across the land
and ate the blackberries like mad,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is very beneficial to pigs
anti-oxidant wise.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so then it's a good pork.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now there's grasses coming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: How large is your property?
[SPEAKER_02]: We're on 20-cent makers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not too huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you live on it or you live somewhere
else?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, we live on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We built a straw bale house.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we live in actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're off the grid or you're?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so we have a little bit of grid
power up on one end of the property and
[SPEAKER_02]: then the other end of the property is off
grid.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to do a little grid intertie
to take the rest of the end off the last
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just quickly talk about your rainwater
set up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I mean, it's not too hard for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a few buildings that had nice
metal roofs already.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we just gutter them over into a
pond.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just happened to be that... Don't
they have some sort of bullfrog thing or
[SPEAKER_01]: like...
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's totally bullfrogs and we got
to do something about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they requiring you to?
[SPEAKER_01]: They haven't said anything yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, they're protected?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, they're anti-protected.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, they're anti-protected.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're an invasive species.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't they eat insects?
[SPEAKER_02]: They do eat insects, but they also eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're eating everyone else's food.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They eat the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, no, that's on the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't gotten there yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't realize that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's on the list.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how is this event?
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you just talk about this a little bit
coming down?
[SPEAKER_04]: We're having fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this the first time or have you done it
before?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done some of these events before.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's the best so far, I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we had a good number of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You look like a West Hollywood needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I did grow up down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not quite in West Hollywood, but Glendale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So not far at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not far at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's nice to come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because I've been hanging out in the hills
for 20 years, somewhat growing in the
[SPEAKER_02]: hills.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we're out, and it's out in the
open.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, we can claim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, now we can farm this piece of
property a little bit and turn it in to
[SPEAKER_02]: help support five, six small families on
our property and grow this really fine
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis and have some people come out
camping, glamping, we call it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have set up these bell tents.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have people come out to our farm,
float down the river.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a picture of our farm from up in
the sky.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that the farm?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me how amazing it would be if every
farmer could do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have people come onto the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: At this point, we're just hoping.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've done everything we can.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're all legal.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a combination of things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the food and the atmosphere and
the energy and the marijuana and the
[SPEAKER_03]: people who are there, as well as the
people coming to visit.
[SPEAKER_04]: What shops are carrying?
[SPEAKER_01]: What shops are you appreciating?
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been well received by shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hightide's been taking over our
distribution down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Big Trees has been taking up north.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about 99 Hightide?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just Hightide Distro.
[SPEAKER_02]: They also have Fiddler's Green.
[SPEAKER_02]: These guys right around the corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone looks at our product and assumes
it's indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to maintain that quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a ball game going on after this?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to be rude on the vet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a cannabis sports competition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Times have changed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a vet.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't have thought not to be like
this.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
