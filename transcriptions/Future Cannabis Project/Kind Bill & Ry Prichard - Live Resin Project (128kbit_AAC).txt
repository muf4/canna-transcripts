[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Ryan Pritchard.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of people know me from the TV show
Bong Appetit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a real live resin enthusiast and we're
trying to bring the product that we really
[SPEAKER_00]: believe in, that we think expresses
cannabis to the highest level,
[SPEAKER_00]: to as many people as we possibly can so
they can have that awesome experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Kyne Bill and I'm known for bringing
live resin to the market, being the
[SPEAKER_01]: integrator behind them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So where are you in your process and can
you give me an idea of the scale of this
[SPEAKER_02]: project?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just launched in California so we're
available in stores right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our distribution is increasing over time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of scale, we're trying to focus
on delivering the absolute highest
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while we think we can scale up quality
to a large degree, we're always going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be mindful of that and trying to keep it
as boutique as possible and working with
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators that really do high-level work
so that we can respect that work and
[SPEAKER_00]: deliver a great final product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that we chose California as the
place to launch this is the availability
[SPEAKER_01]: of quality start material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we thought we could come out here and
really highlight the work that these
[SPEAKER_01]: legacy farmers have been putting out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also what's important to me and always
has been is access.
[SPEAKER_01]: Both patient access and for me,
farmer access to regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you talk a little bit about your
manufacturing process and how you're
[SPEAKER_02]: utilizing the cultivators?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to work really closely with
cultivators because one of the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: we've noticed in our time since starting
this process and doing this for quite a
[SPEAKER_00]: long time since 2013, the handling process
of the material is super, super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things we're trying to
work on is to develop relationships with
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators so that we can really help
them the entire way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, honestly, from the growing and
everything else, even before that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from the point of harvest,
there's so many things that can go wrong
[SPEAKER_00]: with live resin, just like with live with
dried product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's been our focus largely is
finding a really good partners to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with and then be those that can be coached
into delivering exactly what we're looking
[SPEAKER_00]: for.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, are you also, are you doing it the
old fashioned way?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they cutting the tops while they're
cold and squeezing them right away?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you using your traditional processes?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you talk about those for us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that we won't do is waiver
from how we do this until we find a better
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're always measuring, measuring,
measuring and looking to improve,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we don't go, OK, now the scale is
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can take this step out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just not.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we won't really talk about
scale, because we'll back into demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we're able to fulfill it uncompromised,
but we're still very hyper focused on a
[SPEAKER_01]: fast harvest, meticulously handling
material, getting it cold very quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and having we have a process where we
bring the temperature down over time
[SPEAKER_01]: rather than get immediately frozen unless
a facility is equipped with the
[SPEAKER_01]: technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're there now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are now facilities that have
cryogenic tunnels that can freeze this
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff instantly and make it easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is that an expensive process?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So so like larger farms can afford to do
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we're seeing these in the large
light debt greenhouse operations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, a lot of the Central Valley places
that have you know, hundreds of thousands
[SPEAKER_00]: of square feet of greenhouse, they're
they're devoting, you know, quarters or
[SPEAKER_00]: half of that specifically to live resin
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to have cryo tunnels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's a lot of partners that
we're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we you know, some are smaller
indoor cultivators and some are,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, larger scale mixed, mixed like
greenhouse or pure outdoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're getting a diversity of genetics
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk about genetics a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's, you know, what gets me excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We we want to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The goal here is to have a few things that
you can count on from us all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to always bring an OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to always bring something in
the orange spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're going to have a jack
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we're also very excited to see things
that you might only see once or that maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: this guy's we find somebody that's been
growing a plant for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a special California thing,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the time, yes, we can find
somebody that has been dedicated their
[SPEAKER_01]: career to one cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put it in this format and open
it up to a new user experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think part of, you know,
to speak to Bill's point earlier about
[SPEAKER_00]: just why California, I mean, the the
diversity of what's out here and the
[SPEAKER_00]: legacy and the history and the terroir and
everything that you can speak about is at
[SPEAKER_00]: such a high level here that, you know,
that that's really what the live resin
[SPEAKER_00]: process is for is capturing the uniqueness
and expressing it and preserving it over
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, being able to like a Vintner or,
you know, have something that was really
[SPEAKER_00]: special that will never be seen again in
the history of the world and to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of save it over time and savor it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's a really special thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's that's what we're trying
to create is something that has that level
[SPEAKER_00]: of importance.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see products where they'll where
they'll go like, yeah, the twenty twenty
[SPEAKER_02]: two was like like an exceptional year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been talking about this for
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and yeah, we're going to see that
we're we're going to see that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the sour diesel deep chunk off
of that hill in in, you know, twenty
[SPEAKER_01]: nineteen was the best year that that we
had the right rain and we had the right
[SPEAKER_01]: everything for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, the California sunshine
does some special things to these plants
[SPEAKER_01]: when given the chance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: It sounds like this is a for people with a
heightened special appreciation and taste.
[SPEAKER_02]: But are you going for the massive like
what like this for everyone?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we found the coolest thing about
my resin is a it's like the champagne of
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis world in one way and that
it's like it takes this to its ultimate
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in a Japanese materialism.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything has its ultimate expression
and perfect form.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for me, my resin is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the cannabis plant and what's
different about it than champagne or a
[SPEAKER_01]: Bordeaux is it's super accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: This stuff tastes so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to be a connoisseur to be
like, wow, that made my mouth feel insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now there's like skittles things
floating around in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't, you know, it doesn't take a
weed snob to know that this is a good
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our favorite thing is the first time
user that has no cannabis context to see
[SPEAKER_01]: their face when they try live resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, it totally opens them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a great way to drop some of the
stigmas that come around our products and
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a lot more interesting and
diverse than than people are given on the
[SPEAKER_01]: surface for hash.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think like the focus on flavor and
that and aroma and that part of live resin
[SPEAKER_00]: is so important.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's, you know, to Bill's
credit, it's very forward thinking and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's something that, you know,
doing the show, Bon Appetit and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was something that I really tried to
emphasize because the ability,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, or the moment when a chef like
smells these things for the first time,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really mind blowing for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the same with beverage,
the same with perfume, same with any of
[SPEAKER_00]: these other industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's really, you know, the
diversity of the cannabis plant can not be
[SPEAKER_00]: overstated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to blow people's minds
throughout all these different industries
[SPEAKER_00]: to see how this thing can do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as an industry, we've taken such care
for this plant because of the high value,
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the illegality, because of all
these things that we simply do it at a
[SPEAKER_00]: higher level than beverage people,
than a lot of these other people,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they haven't been taking the risk
that somebody like Bill has for,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, being a cultivator since 1987.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that's some real stuff,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the field that you're in, there really
is a lot of innovation, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, and there's a lot of young people,
too, that are working in this area,
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't there, who are like creating new
sauces and new things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's an exciting, innovative
space, isn't it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, and I've been saying this now for
like five or six years, maybe even eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like still cannabis industry is
akin to like Silicon Valley, like 1979,
[SPEAKER_01]: early, early.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like there's some people really
on fire and there's a lot going on,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we don't even know how big it's going
to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one knows.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one knows how much this is really going
to affect society at large.
[SPEAKER_01]: Five years ago, already in the thick of
things in Colorado, if you asked me that I
[SPEAKER_01]: would be in the situation that I'm in and
have the answer to the board of directors
[SPEAKER_01]: that I answer to and things like that,
I would say you're dreaming in the most
[SPEAKER_01]: fantastic way, but dreaming.
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a, it's an incredible voyage that
now this conversation is leading us in
[SPEAKER_02]: naturally to the method of consumption of
these products, which is also an
[SPEAKER_02]: innovative area, which is the devices.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, because traditionally it was
kind of difficult, you know, it took
[SPEAKER_02]: effort and a little skill and knowledge to
consume it properly, but that's not a mass
[SPEAKER_02]: appeal, you know, activity.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what are we seeing in that area that's
going to really open So exciting that the
[SPEAKER_01]: device manufacturers are really coming
quickly with better and better things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then some of the larger producers are
leaning on them for device.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it's significant, a little backstory.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've been making hash since the late
eighties at a high quality level,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I didn't decide that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I loved hash in all its form,
but I didn't go, Oh, this is the format
[SPEAKER_01]: that I'm going forward with until the nail
came.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause there was now a good way to smoke
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That changed my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: First dab on a nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, okay, now there's a good way
to do this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to focus in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the next thing that happened was
the whipped texture came.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now the stuff wasn't so messy because
traditional hash oil in a little jar 15
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago was a, was a hot mess.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, when I was 18, I had my best
friend's mom hand me a jar of hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And she was like, I know you gave this to
him and he's destroying my house with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Take it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So device has always been the thing that
opened the next segment up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it happened with the nail and it
happened with the pan and it happened with
[SPEAKER_01]: the cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're going back to some cooler,
more portable, portable water filter
[SPEAKER_01]: devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's important from a
health standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I get the best experience on a piece of
glass filtered through water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and, and simply because I have
control of that whole experience,
[SPEAKER_01]: I have control of the amount of water,
I have control of the temperature of both
[SPEAKER_01]: the water and the glass and the it's easy
to clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's for me, I'm very comfortable
with all of those things, but I come from
[SPEAKER_01]: like a glass blowing background.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a torch isn't a foreign thing to
me.
[SPEAKER_01]: The torch is prohibitive though,
obviously for no people, for new people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some people may get their best
experience hitting a pen because they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have any baggage to go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to unpack anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, I mean, we, we, we have all the
textures, like, you know, butter shatter,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, uh, crystalline, all the things that
people make, but, um, my favorite is
[SPEAKER_00]: butter, but, um, we also have,
yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're, we're, we're leading with
butter and cause, and we're going to make
[SPEAKER_00]: more butter than any of those other
things, because that's what we really
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that it's the best user
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, for, for more of an intro
consumer, they're able to utilize that
[SPEAKER_00]: product easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's less mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't slide off your dab or you get
it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like, there's a lot of reason you
get a consistent experience every time
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not getting a big rock or just
terpene sauce or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think, you know, we're, we're leading
with that, but, um, our live resin pen is
[SPEAKER_00]: really special, we think, because we,
you know, we do a process that does zero
[SPEAKER_00]: separation, zero distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's a categorically different thing
than most of what's on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, my favorite thing in the
morning is to have a coffee and to sip on
[SPEAKER_00]: my Skywalker OG pen, because it's such a
wonderful pairing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it, and it hits that note because I'm
high all day, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I smoke all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all I'm looking for is flavor,
flavor, flavor, flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So having, you know, if I had five
different flavors, as Bill mentioned,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I can like, Oh, I want, I want some
haze with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want some OG with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's powerful to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're going to have some,
uh, some, you know, recurring kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: hitters that we want to keep in the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the Skywalker OG, I think we're going
to have that pretty regular.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are thinking about those things,
but I'm hyper focused on fresh and
[SPEAKER_01]: available, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's good right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: What can we get?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the best thing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a value piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: To like, what are we going to be able to
give at the best value for, for the
[SPEAKER_01]: quality?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're, we're, we're hypersensitive
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because we found great partners that
have large quantities of some,
[SPEAKER_01]: of some things that are exceptional that
we can get at a value price, we can afford
[SPEAKER_01]: to buy some crazy expensive things that
are rare and one price at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like people to only pay one
thing, but give them a very degree of
[SPEAKER_01]: rarity and complexity.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, in general,
the raw concentrates will be more leaning
[SPEAKER_00]: into the variability and the small batch
aspect of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas like, you know, the pen where
we're looking to hit, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe slightly larger distribution numbers
with that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, you know, as you mentioned,
like there, it's less form factor
[SPEAKER_00]: inhibitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So more people will access that product
than would ever buy a raw concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're, we're trying to give
people an authentic raw concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: experience in an easy format.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and I think, I think that it'll,
it'll do pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know,
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I mean, I feel like the market's
got a lot of room in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, there's no pie for everybody out
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: People love weed in California,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they love California weed everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that happens also.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I try not to get hemmed up on that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always go back to like, what's the best
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to make the best thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to tell people that we have
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my careers history shows that that's
the end of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make the best thing that you can,
you put out a product that you can truly
[SPEAKER_01]: be passionate and believe in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you see, I'm excited about this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never sold anything that I wouldn't
buy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that carries true right into the
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that all takes care of itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then if you stay true to what brought you
here and we've, we've gone on a long road,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We just keep giving the best thing that
we're able and make it accessible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you, you, you respect the plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: You respect the work of the people that
grow the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You, you honor those relationships.
[SPEAKER_00]: You honor what this plant does for the
world and how it can change things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you just think about that at every
step.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that sounds great and we know you guys
mean it and it's true, but you're also in
[SPEAKER_02]: a, you know, like there's retail reality
out there, you know, distributionality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's all of these people in
between you and, and you're consumed,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, handling your product and
marketing and selling your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and I talked to a lot of people,
some people are like really want to make
[SPEAKER_02]: sure the way they, you know, that they're,
that they're in control, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: as much as they can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those relationships are really
important because those people are,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, are touching your brand,
you know, your product.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously we're looking for the right
partners on the retail side, 100% and,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're looking for people that can get
excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, one up rise, very strong suits.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is actually like budtender education
and point of sale interaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, we provide all of that type of
support.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we get into a store,
we're not going to just drop product to
[SPEAKER_01]: the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to interact with their
budtenders on a high level and get them
[SPEAKER_01]: excited about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's who sells this product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Marketing doesn't like, it gets it out
there, but who sells weed are budtenders.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they like your product and you are
easy to deal with that part is,
[SPEAKER_01]: is, you know, and we hyper-focus on that,
on the people that have the customer
[SPEAKER_01]: facing 100% taking care of them and making
sure they are educated and well supported.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and, and people, I think,
I think customers and people working
[SPEAKER_00]: within the industry, largely because a lot
of them are new to the industry are
[SPEAKER_00]: starving for education.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's something that the
importance cannot be overstated of,
[SPEAKER_00]: of like getting people grounded in what
cannabis is, how it works, why things are
[SPEAKER_00]: good, why things are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and it's, it's a really, it's a,
you know, seeing this happen all across
[SPEAKER_00]: the country and all across the world now
and seeing, seeing the exponential growth
[SPEAKER_00]: of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also needs exponential growth of
education and support and, and real
[SPEAKER_00]: support and not wool pulling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause there's a lot of that too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, you both in your own way are
educated, you know, and have experience
[SPEAKER_02]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were, what were you going to be
doing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like talk a little bit about what your
roles are and what, where you,
[SPEAKER_02]: where you see your energy's going in the,
you know, in the near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, I, I think that I'm,
you know, I've been doing a lot of like
[SPEAKER_00]: product work recently, you know,
trying to like get these things out to
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think I'm going to be transitioning
more into like content creation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because again, I think the importance of
education is, is real and making education
[SPEAKER_00]: palatable so that people don't even
necessarily have to seek it out,
[SPEAKER_00]: where they get educated via entertainment,
via things like Bon Appetit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, I think, I think there's an importance
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what I want to do is, is focus on
that, bring, bring high, high functioning
[SPEAKER_00]: people in from other industries to
increase our understanding of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: to, you know, get to the point where we
can truly, truly collaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause what's happening now is people are
coming from those industries into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry, but then there's still
kind of a fence in between for no good
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought of a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Live resin products have actually been out
for quite a while now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are people like in general looking for the
next thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you talked about like product
development.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is your, so is live resin like the
foundational product?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is like our, you know, Jack Daniels,
you know, it's never going to change,
[SPEAKER_02]: but we're, but there's the next
generations of products that, that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: coming up with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that what we're talking about here?
[SPEAKER_01]: So within this brand of live resin
project, I'd like to think of this as like
[SPEAKER_01]: the beginning of the champagne industry or
cognac, cognac, like we found a very
[SPEAKER_01]: specific way to honor all of the special
traits of this plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like to really build on that
tradition and turn it into something
[SPEAKER_01]: that's an honored process that can carry
on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not closed at all to new different
ways of experiencing this plant,
[SPEAKER_01]: but in this format, we're going to hone
how we harvest and we're going to always
[SPEAKER_01]: be open to new technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some core things about it
that I'm unwilling to change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would like that to be kind of the
center of this brand is, is that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: putting a stake in the ground and saying
that, you know, this is the beginning of
[SPEAKER_01]: something that people are going to enjoy
for hopefully generations and eons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we want it to be honored in the way
that, that craft things are, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and, and, and like I said before,
I think that this is the pinnacle of
[SPEAKER_01]: expression for our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so, I mean, I think one of the things
that we're trying to be conscious of,
[SPEAKER_00]: and one of the reasons that it's called
live resin project actually is because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it's, it's an ongoing process of
figuring out, you know, how, how to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: thing that we know how to do incrementally
better every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also how to think about,
you know, new ways of, of, of modifying
[SPEAKER_00]: things to improve environmental
conditions, you know, things like
[SPEAKER_00]: oxidation, there there's a lot of small
tweaks that you can make and the storage
[SPEAKER_00]: of the product, the, you know,
air exposures throughout the entire
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's, there's a whole lot of,
of headway that can be made there that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we're just getting to the point
now where we can really start playing with
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff because we have a really sound
base after, you know, doing this since
[SPEAKER_00]: 2013, this particular process that I need
before that making hash and growing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, we're now getting to
the point where, you know, technology
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from other industries like micro
encapsulation and particle shearing and
[SPEAKER_00]: all this stuff is going to have
applications with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, to Bill's point,
like the purity of what the live resident
[SPEAKER_00]: experience offers, I don't think we'll
change all that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will, it will, it will improve and
we'll figure out better ways to deliver
[SPEAKER_00]: it, to store it, to harvest all those
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the core of it is so powerful because
what we're doing is very, very high level
[SPEAKER_00]: essential oil extraction, higher level
than the perfume industry is doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, and that's categorical.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've heard that from the highest levels
in the perfume industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're based in Oakland and you have a
lab there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a lab up and operating.
[SPEAKER_01]: Type seven.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Type seven.
[SPEAKER_01]: Getting a degree stuff to add a shift.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and, and as you know, you know,
we have all the pertinent toys and proper
[SPEAKER_01]: freezer storage and really good
relationships with manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as to your earlier question,
there's an education piece for me,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously, and I educate both market face,
but I actually spend more of my education
[SPEAKER_01]: internally, uh, investors, all the people
that just need to understand this on a
[SPEAKER_01]: higher level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, architects, engineers, inspectors,
state regulators, local fire chief,
[SPEAKER_01]: whoever it is that we're talking to,
to make the thing happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but then the, one of the reasons that
I chose to go this route was, was I really
[SPEAKER_01]: want to put a lean on, on, on the
equipment side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there isn't a machine for making this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Librarism.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's an adapted process on somebody's
equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's where there's some leaps to be
made, although they will seem small in a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of little places to build the device
that's designed to make this happen yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I know it was a super manual
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he made it less manual into Tony
Verzura at blue river is they're doing the
[SPEAKER_00]: exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so there, there's, there's a lot
of, I think, I think that's where you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: see the innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I completely agree with bill there is
that, you know, the actual process and the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual equipment at both for consumption
and for production, I think is where we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to see a lot of the biggest shifts
forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's going to be more time spent in
me, R and D equipment, both running other
[SPEAKER_01]: people's equipment and we're really going
to build a machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Honestly, that like with my fabrication
background and all of this, it only makes
[SPEAKER_01]: sense that we make the machine that'll do
this correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You will definitely see me out promoting
my resin project.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, I'll get, you're going to
see us on the East coast soon enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're here in California, but we're going
to, we'll pop up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, in Massachusetts, hopefully Q1.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, there's, there's,
uh, you know, there's some States where
[SPEAKER_00]: there's no solvent extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like, we're just not really going
to play there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other States where there's,
you know, legacy markets where people love
[SPEAKER_00]: hash, where they're very familiar with
libraries and, and they have $10,000 rigs
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything else, just like California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're, we're super excited about those
markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think that, you know, places like,
like Illinois and, you know, Florida,
[SPEAKER_00]: once they change some of the regulations,
I mean, it's crazy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: A hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to take it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it home.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just thank you, Tom.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a pleasure.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys are awesome.
Thank you so much.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
