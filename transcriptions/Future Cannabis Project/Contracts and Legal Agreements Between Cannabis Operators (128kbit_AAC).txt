[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to talk about why agreements
and contracts are so important and how
[SPEAKER_03]: they set you up for success for the long
term of your business.
[SPEAKER_03]: Collectively on the panel today,
you've got probably two to three decades
[SPEAKER_03]: worth of legal experience, which is a
really invaluable lesson as we charter
[SPEAKER_03]: these waters that are consistently
evolving and turbulent during the
[SPEAKER_03]: emergence of cannabis regulation here in
California and across the country,
[SPEAKER_03]: if not the globe.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, I'd like to outline what we're
going to talk about this evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to go through investment
agreements and then agreements throughout
[SPEAKER_03]: the cannabis supply chain, focusing on
what that supply chain looks like here in
[SPEAKER_03]: California.
[SPEAKER_03]: First and foremost, I don't know all of
you, but I say this consistently.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we talk about investment agreements
moving into 2019, the way that I look at
[SPEAKER_03]: it for my clients is that you've got three
options as you move throughout this
[SPEAKER_03]: process.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to be an acquisition target,
and whether or not you are the crown jewel
[SPEAKER_03]: in somebody's Canadian IPO, which is the
topic du jour of the moment, is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be how well you are set up with your
contracts and your internal structure,
[SPEAKER_03]: or you're going to be able to survive an
acquisition event.
[SPEAKER_03]: Otherwise, you will be extinct.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is no secret option number four,
and in order for you to survive in one of
[SPEAKER_03]: the first two buckets and be a desirable
acquisition target, you need to have good
[SPEAKER_03]: investment agreements.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, I'd like to open it up to
our panel to advise or give an overview of
[SPEAKER_03]: what are some of the fundamentals for good
investment agreements.
[SPEAKER_03]: Startups and what you look for on the back
end during a due diligence track as an
[SPEAKER_03]: acquisition target.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can start with Michelle.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've been in the industry longer than
the last two years, then you know that
[SPEAKER_02]: back in the day, pre-legalization,
papering up or making contracts between
[SPEAKER_02]: businesses and other businesses or their
investors was never really something
[SPEAKER_02]: people did.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole point was to not leave a paper
trail, to avoid getting arrested by the
[SPEAKER_02]: cops, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now that we're moving into
legalization, and now it's getting better,
[SPEAKER_02]: getting people to learn how to be
comfortable with us papering up
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So back five years ago, it would be a very
typical deal where someone's cousin's
[SPEAKER_02]: friend's lawyer brother or something gives
a hundred grand cash to a dispensary and
[SPEAKER_02]: then I promise I'll give you 10% of my
proceeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not going to fly anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, now we have to paper up all
those investor agreements, these private
[SPEAKER_02]: offerings, and it's a lot of paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of due diligence
involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: And again, back to the same problem of not
keeping a paper trail, due diligence is a
[SPEAKER_02]: challenge in a company that isn't
accustomed to keeping accurate books.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of these companies' books are cooked.
[SPEAKER_02]: They handwritten receipts.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard to get a true accurate feel
of what a company's financials are.
[SPEAKER_02]: So investors have a unique challenge in
this industry than they do in any others.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very hard to value a company for
those reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of obviously cannabis
related disclosures that you have to put
[SPEAKER_02]: in your investor docs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things like telling potential investors
that cannabis businesses are subject to
[SPEAKER_02]: 280E and don't have access to banking so
you can't really properly track your
[SPEAKER_02]: investment and where all your funds are
going.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not really for the fainthearted
investor.
[SPEAKER_02]: But these are all kinds of things
depending on the nature of the
[SPEAKER_02]: transaction, how much money is involved,
a credited investor, not a credited
[SPEAKER_02]: investor.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of different things that go
into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's kind of really specific to each
situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the overarching, the premise is that
you need to have, you need to be properly
[SPEAKER_02]: papered up for two primary reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, you face extinction after being
acquired.
[SPEAKER_02]: You face crazy securities, fraud-related
accusations, charges, fines, what have
[SPEAKER_02]: you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you also if you're going to try
to impress a legit investor and they see
[SPEAKER_02]: that you don't have things buttoned up on
paper, they're really going to think less
[SPEAKER_02]: of your company and whether or not you're
a viable investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all around, it's a challenging
transition.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's not an easy one to go through.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there are a lot of different things to
go through that are very specific to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm Michael Cherniss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been an attorney for more than I
care.
[SPEAKER_01]: More years than I care to tell you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And been practicing in the cannabis space
for 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the 10 years has seen a lot of changes
in terms of what our work is, because it
[SPEAKER_01]: used to be keeping you out of jail and
trying to keep you out of trouble.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's really about protecting you,
as Michelle said, through papering
[SPEAKER_01]: transactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that way, it's not unlike any other
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are nuances having to do with
federal issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's uniqueness about the
regulations that you have to deal with in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with respect to investing in startups,
what I've seen when I've been brought into
[SPEAKER_01]: private equity transactions for the
recently is there are challenges that are
[SPEAKER_01]: unique to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think one of the challenges is this
is a brand new industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're in day one.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you evaluate a company's financials
when there's no history to base it on?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no comps out there for any of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: In other industries, when you're making an
investment, you have some track record
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe to look at.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or at least you have a track record of an
industry or another comp in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here you don't have that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I can't tell you how many times,
I mean, it happens today, a client would
[SPEAKER_01]: want to invest $6 million to buy a piece
of property and these licenses and the
[SPEAKER_01]: financials project, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I don't even listen after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The financials are just, they're made up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's no history.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not to say that financials have no
basis in reality, but you really need to
[SPEAKER_01]: dig in and try to get underneath these
financials.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different ways of valuing
companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's different ways of doing financial
projections.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really incumbent upon you to look
beneath the paper and try to get some
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of where the numbers came
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's one huge issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another huge issue that we keep coming
across, especially if you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: on the debt side and you're going to do a
debt transaction that maybe involves a
[SPEAKER_01]: convertible note where if the borrower
doesn't meet its obligations, your debt
[SPEAKER_01]: turns to equity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, so now I'm an equity
holder in a licensed business.
[SPEAKER_01]: How am I going to actually effectuate that
ownership?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because every city has limitations on how
licenses can be transferred.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you may now be the owner, the equity
holder in a licensed entity in LA or some
[SPEAKER_01]: other city, but is LA going to honor your
rights as an equity holder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be able to execute upon
that interest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are huge questions that I don't know
that anyone really has a good answer to.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's other nuances that keep
popping up, like we're investing in a
[SPEAKER_01]: company that is a nonprofit mutual benefit
corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's supposed to convert to a for-profit
entity.
[SPEAKER_01]: It hasn't happened yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there going to be problems with that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are some sort of unique things
that we keep coming across.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well as potential liabilities that we
may be, if you're an investor,
[SPEAKER_01]: potential liabilities that may pre-exist
your investment, a lot of which are hard
[SPEAKER_01]: to calculate because not all these
businesses have great track records.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just to give you an example,
you may be investing in or acquiring an
[SPEAKER_01]: entity that's been operating under the
collective model for five or 10 years,
[SPEAKER_01]: but maybe they didn't pay any sales tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your responsibility?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your responsibility for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's going to carry that liability?
[SPEAKER_01]: So from my perspective as somebody who
used to do a lot of litigation,
[SPEAKER_01]: the due diligence focuses on those kinds
of issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Liabilities, what's going to happen if
things go sideways?
[SPEAKER_01]: Will I be able to execute on my interest?
[SPEAKER_03]: And Jay, I'd like to know from you,
since you're representing growth companies
[SPEAKER_03]: from idea to exit, which I like.
[SPEAKER_03]: As we see the great constriction or
consolidation of the market with M&A
[SPEAKER_03]: because some operators maybe got a license
but didn't have enough money to effectuate
[SPEAKER_03]: that license to get it through land use
entitlement to operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you advising clients and what
would you suggest for maneuvering through
[SPEAKER_03]: that M&A process?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I work at Clark Newbert.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a women-owned law firm in San
Francisco, Sacramento, Santa Barbara,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grew up to be a corporate lawyer,
which everybody dreams about becoming when
[SPEAKER_00]: they're little.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the neat thing that we get to do is
help little companies try and become
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being an entrepreneur is super difficult
in any industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is just that much harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of thoughts.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is, no one ever regretted
spending too much time with their
[SPEAKER_00]: attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: People regret not having flawed insurance.
[SPEAKER_00]: People regret not spending enough time
with their attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find an attorney you like and you're
willing to say, I screwed up, or even a
[SPEAKER_00]: curse word.
[SPEAKER_00]: Find an attorney you're really willing to
share what's going wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll never regret it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Corporate law is moving really quickly,
especially around cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lots of companies have been operating with
nonprofit mutual benefit corporations,
[SPEAKER_00]: with LLCs, with corporations, spreading
their operations between different
[SPEAKER_00]: companies for years, filing inconsistent
tax things.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of this can be fixed, but the sooner
you start, the better, which I've heard
[SPEAKER_00]: the other panelists talk about.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a planning process that you can
really go through to clean some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: things up before you become in this M&A
process.
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest challenges we see are
companies who don't realize until it's too
[SPEAKER_00]: late.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have companies come to us and somebody
wants to buy them for millions of dollars
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're so excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it turns out they never actually
purchased stock in their own company.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't rare because they thought they
had done it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because maybe a couple years ago,
their cousins, friends, husbands,
[SPEAKER_00]: neighbors, nephew got them set up with a
nonprofit mutual benefit and they started
[SPEAKER_00]: operating, but they never actually
purchased it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They never purchased any equity in a
company that could sell equity or they
[SPEAKER_00]: never issued themselves membership
interest in their nonprofit MBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's this universe of acronyms that
you've got to get a hold of and you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get a hold of.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also, I'm trying to find a nice
way to say this, but there's not always
[SPEAKER_00]: awesome advice, but there's a lot of
people giving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Accredited investors hasn't been a
requirement since November of 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of your investors will be concerned
about this, but many of your investors
[SPEAKER_00]: shouldn't be concerned about this at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of your companies can raise up to $5
million with zero accredited investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to disclose anything to
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has been in an SEC role since
November of 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not saying you should do that,
but it's an option that's available to
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important thing that I think
cannabis companies need to know is this
[SPEAKER_00]: corporate law stuff can destroy you,
but it can also empower you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you set this up right, you'll get great
tax rates.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you set this up right, you'll have
clear ownership.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll feel empowered to raise money
through convertible notes, to find a great
[SPEAKER_00]: M &A exit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is really one of those like you
have to get your vaccines.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to spend more time and money on
this than you want to early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you don't, you get that
horrible news that somebody wants to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: you for $10 million, but you don't own any
stock in your own company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that happens because people are
confused about what they actually
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased a couple of years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you find out too late, you don't own
stock, you think, okay, I'll just buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you buy it today and sell it
tomorrow, you get nailed on taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could lose like a third of the $10
million that you're hoping to get.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know much more about investment stuff
than I will about the supply chain stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to- Freestyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I'll finish up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the deal with corporate law is it's
scary at first, and then it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: empowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: The purpose of the corporation's code is
to let you start companies that grow and
[SPEAKER_00]: expand and become more valuable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis companies, like any other
companies, should use the corporation's
[SPEAKER_00]: code to build.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can do that, and you can do that
with a lawyer you love happily every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, find a lawyer to love.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love your lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's going to be a new thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what we've heard is this is what
makes you successful.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is also what will be the albatross that
takes you down if you don't invest in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very difficult and it hurts,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It hurts to have to spend that money.
[SPEAKER_03]: It hurts more later when either you can't
take $10 million or your valuation should
[SPEAKER_03]: be 8X, and all of a sudden you're getting
pennies on the dollar because when
[SPEAKER_03]: somebody does your due diligence,
when they look up your proverbial skirt as
[SPEAKER_03]: a business, and they see you haven't kept
minutes ever, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They ask for a corporate book,
which is very simple.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're doing a due diligence and you
don't have one, you can't show the train
[SPEAKER_03]: of events and transactions that you've
had, then all of a sudden this valuation,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have this great business that you've
put your time, energy, sweat, tears into,
[SPEAKER_03]: all of a sudden becomes greatly
diminished.
[SPEAKER_03]: And somebody can say that to you simply by
not having records and not loving your
[SPEAKER_03]: lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that building blocks or with that
framework in mind, really we want to turn
[SPEAKER_03]: to the devil in the details, and that
comes with how are you going to run your
[SPEAKER_03]: business prior to finding that exit
strategy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where we want to look at how
the supply chain acts and how agreements
[SPEAKER_03]: between supply chain actors occur.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we can start at the natural place,
which is cultivation, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We have no industry if we have no
cultivated flour to then turn into other
[SPEAKER_03]: manufactured products or sell at the
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with that comes sourcing
agreements.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how, if you're a manufacturer,
do you go about sourcing your product and
[SPEAKER_03]: what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you interface between a cultivator
and either a distributor or a cultivator
[SPEAKER_03]: and a manufacturer?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what has our panelists been exposed to
and how do they advise operators to
[SPEAKER_03]: maneuver if somebody comes to them and
says, I want to purchase from you X number
[SPEAKER_03]: of pounds a month or a supply of X?
[SPEAKER_02]: Anytime you're dealing with a cultivator,
you're going to have to deal, I guess any
[SPEAKER_02]: operator between any operator,
you're going to have to deal with your
[SPEAKER_02]: distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the distributor contracts and the
connection between the cultivator and the
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturer or the cultivator and the
retailer, you're all going through the
[SPEAKER_02]: distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're kind of the mandatory
middleman.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where all the details get a
little confusing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been seeing a lot of, a lot of our,
at least my workload lately has been
[SPEAKER_02]: dealing with these distribution contracts
in light of the new regulations,
[SPEAKER_02]: which as we all know, keep changing,
which we probably won't expect a final
[SPEAKER_02]: version that's adopted until what,
like early 2019, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these distribution contracts,
at least I've been seeing, they change,
[SPEAKER_02]: they look completely different when they
were first started up last November and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're evolving as the regs are evolving.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's a completely new template or
a new beast.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every single time we have to take a
look at it, but things like from the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivator to the manufacturer,
I guess they'll just use like a case
[SPEAKER_02]: study.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say we have a grower in Salinas
County, a greenhouse who wants,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we've got an LA manufacturer who wants
to source the sun grown from up there.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we get it down there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does the cultivator have a distribution
license?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can the cultivator who has the
distribution license transport that down
[SPEAKER_02]: to LA?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or does the manufacturer in LA have a
distribution license?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can the manufacturer use its distribution
license to go up north and go get the
[SPEAKER_02]: flower itself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do we just use a third party
distributor who has a transport only
[SPEAKER_02]: license to just take it from A to B?
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's a million ways to skin a cat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Each business has its own licenses,
has its own internal strategies,
[SPEAKER_02]: what have you.
[SPEAKER_02]: But depending on who's going to do that
part, the transportation, the testing,
[SPEAKER_02]: collection of the excise taxes,
that's all distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to really make sure whatever
distributor you use, whether you're self
[SPEAKER_02]: distributing or using another party,
you got to make sure you trust that
[SPEAKER_02]: distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: That distributor is buttoned up,
is a good operator, knows what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in those contracts, there's a lot of,
and then there's other things to think
[SPEAKER_02]: about, is that distributor not only
transporting and testing, but are they
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be packaging for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you doing all the packaging and
labeling compliance?
[SPEAKER_02]: So someone else could even do that part
for you.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can add another party, just a straight
packaging company.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you got to figure out where all
these players who are going to fit all
[SPEAKER_02]: these pieces, whether that's you by
yourself or up to four different
[SPEAKER_02]: companies, who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: And depending on how that business
structure is modeled, then you can kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: get into what this contract is going to
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what that contract is going to say,
it's going to delineate everyone's roles
[SPEAKER_02]: and responsibilities and obligations
clearly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's going to determine things like if the
packaging ends up being non-compliant or
[SPEAKER_02]: if the product gets recalled due to
contamination, who's footing the bill for
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Whose responsibility is it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you splitting the baby?
[SPEAKER_02]: How are you going to figure that out?
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a lot of people asking me,
well, what's the standard rate for
[SPEAKER_02]: distribution fees?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no such thing as a standard rate
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no such thing as standard anything
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those are all business questions,
how you get up those numbers, how many
[SPEAKER_02]: different operators you're involving in
this supply chain really will impact how
[SPEAKER_02]: you structure your contract.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, the most
important thing is a lot of people just go
[SPEAKER_02]: into the contract hoping, look,
they're going to make my product for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're just going to make it for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're going to sell it out and
they're going to give me royalty fees for
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not that simple.
[SPEAKER_02]: You guys got to throw in all this other
stuff about what happens in the worst case
[SPEAKER_02]: scenarios.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to be the Debbie Downer
attorneys who tell you about how easy it
[SPEAKER_02]: is to get married, but how difficult it is
to get divorced.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's very true.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you got to contemplate all these worst
case scenarios and figure out beforehand
[SPEAKER_02]: and agree beforehand what's going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I was tiling Pam earlier.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got I've encountered a brand who is
a brand that was co packing with another
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That manufacturer use a distributor
licensee transport only to transport
[SPEAKER_02]: product from A to B to the retailer.
[SPEAKER_02]: That distributor has all the cash taking
it back to the manufacturer and gets
[SPEAKER_02]: pulled over by ATF.
[SPEAKER_02]: $180,000 in cash seized, federal
forfeiture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now the parties are fighting about you
file a forfeiture action and you file a
[SPEAKER_02]: forfeiture action.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got the licensee who doesn't want to
raise any red flags.
[SPEAKER_02]: You obviously got the brand who wants
their money.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now you got this uncomfortable
situation where there's a lot of money
[SPEAKER_02]: that you need to get back, but no one can
agree on how to do so.
[SPEAKER_02]: So think about horror stories like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prepare in advance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know it's no fun, but you'll thank
yourself for it later.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen a lot of brands that were very
profitable and knowledgeable prior to
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation where you had to go and source
a license.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have a brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have something that they can
license in the market where somebody else
[SPEAKER_03]: was able to capitalize on securing a
property and getting through licensee to
[SPEAKER_03]: licensure.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you go about doing these licensing
agreements so that your brand can survive
[SPEAKER_03]: through another licensee?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they think that is something that
is of interest and is a very vexing,
[SPEAKER_03]: complicated area of putting those
contracts together.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually know the answer to that
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But before I get into that, I just want to
touch on the cultivation issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: What makes the cultivation and the
manufacturing a little bit different as
[SPEAKER_01]: far as I'm concerned is cultivation,
your product can go down two paths.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can go to the distributor retailer
path, which makes it similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as Michelle was alluding to,
you're dealing with issues of who's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to package it, are you going to package it
yourself, are you going to have the
[SPEAKER_01]: distributor do it, the testing,
all that risk of loss stuff, which is a
[SPEAKER_01]: big issue, risk of loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can agree that some or all of your
product is going to go to a manufacturer
[SPEAKER_01]: to be turned into brownies and oil and
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you go down that path, in some ways
I think your life is a little simpler
[SPEAKER_01]: because you don't have to deal with a
distributor for that piece of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can just have somebody transport it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no testing that's required by
state law before it goes to the
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should certainly test it on your own,
but these are two very different paths.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I have some clients that are doing
grows where all product just gets freeze,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's called freeze shipped
directly to a manufacturer to turn into
[SPEAKER_01]: oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then other people, obviously,
they want to get their product out there
[SPEAKER_01]: as flour and as a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are very different paths,
and they involve different contracts and
[SPEAKER_01]: considerations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there are these concepts,
and maybe Jay could talk more about it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but you could enter into a requirements
contract if you're a distributor or a
[SPEAKER_01]: retailer, where a cultivator has to meet
all of your requirements and give you as
[SPEAKER_01]: much flour as they can produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And on the other side, if you're a
cultivator, there are contracts where
[SPEAKER_01]: basically you may be obligated to give all
of your flour to a particular distributor
[SPEAKER_01]: or retailer as much as they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are different ways of engineering
those kinds of contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the question that Pam asked me,
which is really, I think, an interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: question, is we're a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some traction out there,
but we don't have the means to get a
[SPEAKER_01]: license.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to get a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't want to spend all that money on
real estate.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we stay out there?
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually, I think at least what I'm
seeing is there's a lot of brands out
[SPEAKER_01]: there that have just opted that it makes
more sense to not have to go through the
[SPEAKER_01]: hassle of hiring someone like me or Pam to
get a license.
[SPEAKER_01]: And instead, we can just hire someone like
Michelle to negotiate a contract between
[SPEAKER_01]: the brand and the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So white labeling is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a client, and Michelle and I have
been actually on opposite sides of a
[SPEAKER_01]: transaction, where she represents a brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: My client makes the stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: My client packages it.
[SPEAKER_01]: My client distributes it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Her client designs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that model, that white label model,
and for those of you that don't know the
[SPEAKER_01]: terminology, essentially, there's a
manufacturer out there that's got a
[SPEAKER_01]: license to manufacture.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have the machines.
[SPEAKER_01]: They make the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can put her client's label on it
or Jay's client's label on it or my
[SPEAKER_01]: client's label on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe there's going to be nuances and
differences in terms of the mixtures and
[SPEAKER_01]: the terpenes and the blends and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is a different and, in some ways,
much more affordable model for a brand to
[SPEAKER_01]: survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because really, all you need these days to
be a brand is social media.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have clients that are brands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you would think by their social media,
like their Apple.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, they're very small.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the social media and the PR makes them
seem much bigger than they really are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in those contracts, there are so many
complexities.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you have the brand on one side,
which hopefully owns intellectual
[SPEAKER_01]: property, which is like a whole separate
conversation, how to acquire it,
[SPEAKER_01]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you license the intellectual
property to the manufacturer so the
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturer can put it together and sell
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the manufacturer will either turn
it over to a distributor or they'll be the
[SPEAKER_01]: distributor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so all those different pieces have to
be worked out.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not super complicated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some details, again,
dealing with who's going to have
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance, what happens if a product is
contaminated, whose responsibility is
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you design the cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cartridges are defective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you put the cartridges together with
the packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's your fault.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those kinds of issues have to be worked
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And honestly, I don't think they're unique
to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're just unique for everyone in this
room because it used to be that you just
[SPEAKER_01]: grew it, put it in a bag, brought it to
the dispensary, and you just waited for
[SPEAKER_01]: your money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's a little bit more complicated
and it's a little bit more mainstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's helpful sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine somebody's behind a soundboard
with 16 different levers to twist,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a commercial contract.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the levers is who's responsible,
which percent you are me is responsible if
[SPEAKER_00]: it gets seized in process between the two
places.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you 100%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or am I 100%?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a knob.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many days late is the product before
there's a penalty?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another knob.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each one of you probably has one or two
transactions you're constantly doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a cultivator, you're constantly
selling to dispensaries or to distributors
[SPEAKER_00]: or to manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a manufacturer, you're
constantly buying from cultivators and
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe you're sending it out to
distributors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's one or two deals you're
constantly doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend a couple hours with one of these
people and figure out what are the 10
[SPEAKER_00]: things you're always negotiating in those
two transactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the 10 things you always have to
deal with?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll tell you the six ones
you're not thinking of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Spend the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get two good form agreements for the two
deals you do every day, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then get a little familiar with the 10
different knobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we'll write it in Greek,
but you guys can negotiate with your
[SPEAKER_00]: counterparties, you know what,
15 days is too many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so this part's gonna be 15 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who should bear the risk if it gets seized
on the road?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who should bear the risk if it gets moldy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like these 16 different knobs,
you know, when Google sells something,
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't do a new contract each time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes the form of selling stuff and
then goes and its sales people fill in the
[SPEAKER_00]: blanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more complicated than that,
but you wanna have a couple forms that you
[SPEAKER_00]: use all the time so that you're not
reinventing the wheel, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So think hard about what are the two or
three things you're doing several times a
[SPEAKER_00]: week or that constitute like the bulk of
your sales and your purchases and then
[SPEAKER_00]: invest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like make this tool, make this template.
[SPEAKER_00]: The goal for us is you get this really
polished like Mercedes Benz that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: drive because you know how to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got like a soundboard, we got a car,
we got all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the goal is for you to get this tool
that you can use all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of knobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: It does get really intricate, but you
probably do one or two transactions
[SPEAKER_00]: several times a week, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this will get commodified and the
sooner you can have some like confidence
[SPEAKER_00]: in what you're doing, I think the sooner
this will get demystified, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're buying and selling
agricultural products that become finished
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys know how to do the business side
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can show you how to do the legal side
of it and then it's perfect, everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: happy, we all retire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi, what Jay said was really empowering to
you to be able to ask those questions and
[SPEAKER_03]: the only way that it will become
normalized that agreements are the
[SPEAKER_03]: mainstay of this industry is by you as
operators requesting them of each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think it's important to note
that we can sit up here, tell you how
[SPEAKER_03]: important agreements are, but unless you
were willing to invest in them,
[SPEAKER_03]: invest in yourselves and ask that of each
other as operators, that's the only way
[SPEAKER_03]: we're gonna see this normalization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we've also talked about regulatory
changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing those potentially coming by
the end of the week.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've also seen some interesting
legislation, which as we've talked about
[SPEAKER_03]: distribution agreements, it's interesting,
some of you in the room may be
[SPEAKER_03]: distributors.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does SB 311 come into play?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was an urgency bill.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came into effect right away.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as it was signed, and it allows
for distribution to distribution
[SPEAKER_03]: transfers, distribution agreements down
the line.
[SPEAKER_03]: This storage only part of what
distribution movement throughout the state
[SPEAKER_03]: means.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have a product coming from up in
Humboldt and it needs to get down into LA
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're also under this California
driving restrictions, you can only have a
[SPEAKER_03]: driver in the car eight hours,
you can only stop in a secured area.
[SPEAKER_03]: When your stored product and these COAs
are moving along the supply chain,
[SPEAKER_03]: how has that affected distribution
agreements and how your advice and
[SPEAKER_03]: clients, Jay, see your head shaking
vigorously so you have some comment?
[SPEAKER_00]: I just moved here from Oakland,
so a lot of my clients are still in North
[SPEAKER_00]: Bay and they spend a lot of time looking
at maps to figure out how long does it
[SPEAKER_00]: take to drive from Mendocino, how far
could they get before the driver needed to
[SPEAKER_00]: stop, and where could they get licenses?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think at this point, they have a license
in Culver City, they have a license in
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendo, and that's as far as they can go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I unfortunately don't know about this new
legislation that it sounds like will
[SPEAKER_00]: change their business plan, so you should
talk to my clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like I should be the moderator and
you should be on the panel, but she knows
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: SB 311 has to do with plugging a gap or a
disconnect between Mercursa and the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mercursa had contemplated that the product
would go from manufacturer to distributor,
[SPEAKER_01]: from distributor to retailer, or from
cultivator to distributor, distributor to
[SPEAKER_01]: retailer, but you have these distributors
that are up here and you have the
[SPEAKER_01]: retailers down here and the logistics of
it made it really challenging,
[SPEAKER_01]: so the regulations contemplated that you
could have a storage-only or
[SPEAKER_01]: transport-only distributor where there
could basically be a handoff from the
[SPEAKER_01]: primary distributor, if you will,
to somebody else that would then take the
[SPEAKER_01]: product the rest of the way, or store it
so that it could then go from your spot to
[SPEAKER_01]: the retailer, so the way they divide up
the responsibility is that the product
[SPEAKER_01]: can't leave the cultivator if it's
finished product, it can't leave the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivator, and if it's finished product,
it can't leave the manufacturer until it's
[SPEAKER_01]: batch tested and it goes through a quality
control check, so the distributor is in
[SPEAKER_01]: charge of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The distributor can then take it from
their facility to the retailer or the
[SPEAKER_01]: facility or the distributor can take it to
another distributor who would then store
[SPEAKER_01]: it and then transport it to the retailer
without that second distributor having to
[SPEAKER_01]: go through the same batch testing and
quality control process, so what SB 311
[SPEAKER_01]: did again is it reconciled Mercursa with a
change in the regulations that had
[SPEAKER_01]: authorized that sort of secondary use of a
distributor, so if you're a distributor,
[SPEAKER_01]: would SB 311 now allow you to do is
essentially piggyback on another
[SPEAKER_01]: distributor that might be located a little
closer to the ultimate destination the
[SPEAKER_01]: products are going to,
[SPEAKER_01]: but here's the wrinkle, the money,
so the distributors are performing
[SPEAKER_01]: generally like five different functions,
they perform a quality control function to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure the product is labeled
correctly, they perform the batch testing
[SPEAKER_01]: process to make sure it gets batch tested
before it gets released, they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: collect cultivation taxes, they have to
collect excise taxes, they have to then
[SPEAKER_01]: remit those taxes to the California FTDA
or whatever it's now called, and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: have to transport it, but if you're now
using that transport only person to do
[SPEAKER_01]: part of the transport, how do you divvy up
the dough, who gets what, that's a nuance
[SPEAKER_01]: that again, there's no right answer for
that, there are sort of some standards and
[SPEAKER_01]: standard rates that are out there,
but it's just another thing to think about
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're a product manufacturer or if
you're a brand, I'm in LA, but I want my
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff to be in the Bay Area, how am I
going to get it there, who's going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: in charge of that, is it me, is it my
distributor, is it my manufacturer,
[SPEAKER_01]: these are all things to kind of be worked
out.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are nuances to nuances, exceptions
to exemptions, this is how contracting
[SPEAKER_03]: works, and talking about distribution,
one of my favorite agreements that comes
[SPEAKER_03]: off of a distribution agreement is testing
lab agreements, and it's one that I don't
[SPEAKER_03]: see done often enough, especially with
distributors to testing labs, and ripping
[SPEAKER_03]: off of that is recall procedures,
every distributor should have recall
[SPEAKER_03]: procedures if and when there is an issue
with a testing lab, I know we're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: hear from operators later, but one of the
critical components of why testing lab
[SPEAKER_03]: agreements are important is because
testing lab equipment is very sensitive,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it is very expensive, and any time you
have sensitive and expensive equipment,
[SPEAKER_03]: the subsidiary to that is that it will at
some times fail, or need to be
[SPEAKER_03]: recalibrated, and what happens from the
BCC's point of view is that any time the
[SPEAKER_03]: BCC sees discrepancies that are too wide,
and you as a testing lab can no longer
[SPEAKER_03]: issue a COA or certificate of analysis,
what happens in the following situation
[SPEAKER_03]: that I will present to our panelists,
it's called a legal workshop.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the situation where you would have a
testing lab who was taking in product,
[SPEAKER_03]: their discrepancies were being called into
question by the BCC, and in this interim
[SPEAKER_03]: where they're trying to work with the BCC,
they continue to do that, they continue to
[SPEAKER_03]: take in batch samples from a distributor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That distributor's product is then in
queue.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the current regulations pursuant to
the readopted regulations that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: working under, it says that if the BCC
were to pull that testing lab's ability to
[SPEAKER_03]: issue a COA, then all of the product is
stopped in the pipeline, because it cannot
[SPEAKER_03]: go to another testing lab, either a
testing lab that is owned by that testing
[SPEAKER_03]: lab licensee, if it has multiple labs,
it can't move it, and it can't contract
[SPEAKER_03]: with another licensed testing lab to test
that product, so that product is sitting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Either the batch samples are sitting at
the testing lab and have you made an
[SPEAKER_03]: arrangement between the testing lab and
the distributor if you have to take a
[SPEAKER_03]: secondary set of batch sample testing,
or if it's sitting not at your
[SPEAKER_03]: distributor's warehouse, it's sitting in a
transport-only storage distributor,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's taking up space there, and how long
can it take up space?
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is a distributor, and then
therefore a manufacturer or cultivator
[SPEAKER_03]: who's waiting for this product to be
released, do in that situation,
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's interesting to note, these are
why testing lab agreements are important,
[SPEAKER_03]: the only license type in the entire supply
chain that the BCC in their infinite
[SPEAKER_03]: wisdom has said does not need to carry
insurance is a testing lab.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is it that you would advise your
client to do, and I'm gonna section you
[SPEAKER_03]: off, if you were the testing, if you were
representing the testing licensee,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you were representing the distributor,
or if you were representing a manufacturer
[SPEAKER_03]: or cultivator who had given their product
to a distributor, so if anybody wants to
[SPEAKER_03]: jump out first and say who, yes,
we're gonna role play this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who is who?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want to represent one of these
clients, raise your hand or I will assign
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do it at random?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michelle, you are going to represent the
cultivator or the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael, you're going to represent the
testing lab, and Jay, you're going to
[SPEAKER_03]: represent the distributor.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you advise your client once the
BCC has pulled the testing lab's ability
[SPEAKER_03]: to issue any more COAs, and the product
has already been taken in?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you guys agree to switch roles,
you can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael, who said I could issue it?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's already been done, and we're gonna
highlight why you need to have a good
[SPEAKER_03]: contract.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what would you advise them if in the
situation that we have now, where they
[SPEAKER_03]: have not contracted, and what would you
have advise them originally?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can see why agreements are so
important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though as a testing lab, maybe you're
not obligated to carry insurance,
[SPEAKER_01]: it would be unimaginable not to have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't imagine that they wouldn't have
insurance, and honestly, I think the magic
[SPEAKER_01]: that would happen here is in having an
insurance policy that contemplates this
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of scenario.
[SPEAKER_01]: I give you amazing credit for having
thought this up, because I don't think a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of people are at this level where
they're thinking of this issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens when you're the manufacturer,
and you've entrusted your product to my
[SPEAKER_01]: client, and my client basically has a
freeze order?
[SPEAKER_01]: My client is unable to continue doing
operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, my client has insurance,
but really, our hands are tied,
[SPEAKER_01]: and the issue, I think, has to do with
hopefully contemplating in advance this
[SPEAKER_01]: scenario, and apportioning the risk of
loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would imagine, frankly, that
everybody has insurance that would address
[SPEAKER_01]: what amounts to a business interruption
situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my two cents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who wants to jump in?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not that I wouldn't love to take credit
for fully coming up with this
[SPEAKER_03]: hypothetical, but it is in part based in
an actual client issue, or issues that are
[SPEAKER_03]: occurring, I would say.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is interesting to note that sometimes,
testing labs can actually be the most
[SPEAKER_03]: difficult to ensure.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure that we will hear about that in
our next panel, where the operators are
[SPEAKER_03]: discussing it, but they are not always
able to provide the level of insurance of
[SPEAKER_03]: these types of situations in business
interruptions, because this is what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: contracted to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're shut down by the BCC,
and you've been potentially issued a prior
[SPEAKER_03]: warning about the situation, and you're
still intaking products, how does that
[SPEAKER_03]: affect your contract negotiations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the BCC, by the time they're
pulling your ability to issue a test,
[SPEAKER_03]: there have been multiple steps where
they've intervened, because they've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: an issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Usually, you're not having such a jarring
circumstance where the BCC is coming in
[SPEAKER_03]: unannounced.
[SPEAKER_03]: At what point, and have you previously
contracted for it, if you are the
[SPEAKER_03]: distributor, or the manufacturer or
cultivator, to say you shouldn't be taking
[SPEAKER_03]: in any additional tests with this
oversight, that you are not allowed to
[SPEAKER_03]: cure the issue on the back end once you
take in it in-house?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if we want to look at it from
a distributor's point of view.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the answer to this question.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a strong question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What occurred to me was to say to some of
my clients, this is a good exercise for
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the three things most likely to
go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here are the three things we know are
going to go wrong in the next two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do our form agreements provide for what to
do in that scenario?
[SPEAKER_00]: You talked about risk factors a couple
minutes ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The way companies often come up with risk
factors is they sit in a room and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: if we miss next quarter, what will have
happened to cause that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are our likely failure patterns,
basically?
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't think of this failure pattern for
testing companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like we should think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you ever do sit in a room with your
lawyers for three hours and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: we want to come up with a really good
form, say to them, at some point,
[SPEAKER_00]: here are the three things that are going
to go wrong in the next four years.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to happen at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want our agreements to provide for some
path out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has a defect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything has some failure rate,
and that's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your agreements can provide for a detour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to say self-destruct button,
but a happy route out of a jam.
[SPEAKER_00]: A parachute.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cultivators and manufacturers,
even nowadays, very rarely are not going
[SPEAKER_02]: to have a contract already in place.
[SPEAKER_02]: First things first, let's take a look at
the contract that's in place, which
[SPEAKER_02]: hopefully is a good one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, it passed the buck off to the
distributor as the distributor's problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully, there's indemnification clauses
in there protecting the cultivator.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's a really, really bad contract,
and it doesn't give you all those safety
[SPEAKER_02]: nets, then we're still going to analyze
the contract, which hopefully exists,
[SPEAKER_02]: for at least breach causes of action.
[SPEAKER_02]: It also kind of depends whether or not
there was a contract between just the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivator and the distributor,
or also was the cultivator having had a
[SPEAKER_02]: contract relationship with the testing
laboratory?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's called privity, by the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who did the cultivator have privity with?
[SPEAKER_02]: The distributor?
[SPEAKER_02]: The lab?
[SPEAKER_02]: Everyone up the chain?
[SPEAKER_02]: You kind of need to assess who's liable to
who, who has a duty to whom in this supply
[SPEAKER_02]: chain situation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once you analyze the contract and it kind
of smells like good old-fashioned
[SPEAKER_02]: litigation with the testing lab,
that's how you're probably going to end up
[SPEAKER_02]: getting your money.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll do it that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm suing your lab, Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, and whether you're doing it in
concert with the distributor or not,
[SPEAKER_03]: or whether you're suing your distributor,
because remember, when do you pay the
[SPEAKER_03]: money?
[SPEAKER_03]: When have you contracted for that release
of the money for the product?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because, Jane, I'm sure you're sitting in
this situation as the distributor.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to pay the cultivator or the
manufacturer until I get a clean COA,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I can't resell it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're taking it in, at what point,
to your point about the knobs and the
[SPEAKER_03]: levers, when is payment being released?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's a lot of different nuances
in this one fact pattern.
[SPEAKER_03]: We started in one place, and we're talking
about 17 other different issues that take
[SPEAKER_03]: you down a different path.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think what you've heard and what you've
experienced with this exercise is that
[SPEAKER_03]: there is no one right way to do a
contract, and there are multiple different
[SPEAKER_03]: parties that are going to experience
different levels of discomfort when things
[SPEAKER_03]: go wrong, and they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: So to rip off of this example,
which I also think is important,
[SPEAKER_03]: is talking about both recalls and defects,
because this is something that I'm sure if
[SPEAKER_03]: all of you are operating is a big
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been asked this question by some of
my operators.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, if I don't like a product and I take
it in, can I destroy it as defective?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not selling.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you cannot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Defective has a very specific reason and
it is already a term of art in,
[SPEAKER_03]: what is it, California Code of
Regulations?
[SPEAKER_03]: What is a product defect?
[SPEAKER_03]: It literally has to be defective.
[SPEAKER_03]: That does not mean it doesn't move off
your shelves.
[SPEAKER_03]: That does not mean that people don't like
it, but what happens when there's truly a
[SPEAKER_03]: recall?
[SPEAKER_03]: What happens in an instance, again,
with a testing lab, a COA comes back,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then all of a sudden there's a
discrepancy, and after 24 hours or 48
[SPEAKER_03]: hours, and let me tell you, once a COA
comes in, the product is moving.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going from the distributor to a
retailer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So within 48 hours, even 24 hours
sometimes, product is on a shelf.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what happens, and in how far can a
testing lab, if they have to start issuing
[SPEAKER_03]: a recall because there was an actual
discrepancy in the COA that was reported,
[SPEAKER_03]: how is that manifesting itself?
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are only specific required
recall procedures for the Department of
[SPEAKER_03]: Public Health, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Although, even though it doesn't say it
for the BCC or for DFA, they don't have
[SPEAKER_03]: specific outlined recall procedures,
if you're a distributor, your requirement
[SPEAKER_03]: for the BCC is to provide inventory
control and recall procedures.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't necessarily matter where
they are housed between the three agencies
[SPEAKER_03]: at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the distributor has to have this
in their inventory control plan as does a
[SPEAKER_03]: retailer.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you go about doing that,
and whose responsibility is that,
[SPEAKER_03]: and where is it in your plan?
[SPEAKER_03]: Bringing it all the way back to what
Michael originally said about either
[SPEAKER_03]: applications or licensing your product.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're going to advise clients as they
move forward with this, and you're doing a
[SPEAKER_03]: licensing agreement, and your licensing
agreement with your brand also has to
[SPEAKER_03]: contemplate brand reputation, what do you
do in a recall procedure there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that something that you would negotiate
between in a white labeling agreement if
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to do that to protect that brand
integrity?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where does that happen?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does it happen with the distributor?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that part of a distributor conversation
with the testing lab or a distributor with
[SPEAKER_03]: a manufacturer cultivator?
[SPEAKER_03]: I will let you guys opine on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, in the case Michael and I have,
my client, the brand, is responsible for
[SPEAKER_02]: designing the product, designing the
packaging, making it nice and pretty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Michael's distributor slash manufacturer
client is responsible for assembling it
[SPEAKER_02]: all, making sure what my client prepared
is compliant with packaging and labeling,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Making sure the product, the actual
extraction, the actual assembly is
[SPEAKER_02]: conducted by Michael's client.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's obviously two very distinct
roles here, kind of some overlapping,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, in the packaging and labeling
compliance area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in our situation, we put recalls,
who's responsible for recalls is depending
[SPEAKER_02]: on what the recall was for.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was packaging and labeling,
I think we split the baby on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of our shared roles in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was due completely to product
contamination or something that Michael's
[SPEAKER_02]: client did, he was responsible for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of the fair approach that
we took with that, at least.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anyone still want to be in this
business?
[SPEAKER_01]: So listening to us talk and imagining
myself over there, I would imagine that
[SPEAKER_01]: this is distressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reality is, the good news is that
there are lawyers out there that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and they don't even have to necessarily be
cannabis lawyers, but it's probably better
[SPEAKER_01]: that they are, but there are lawyers out
there that can help you with these
[SPEAKER_01]: problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you make the stuff, and it's like
what Jay said, we collaborate with one
[SPEAKER_01]: another.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get paid and we stay up late at
night to think about these issues so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't have to think about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reality is that you'll never
anticipate in a contract all of the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that can go sideways.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if you did, then there wouldn't be
a need for litigators because what
[SPEAKER_01]: litigators do is they litigate the gray
areas.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while as a former litigator,
you can reverse engineer where disputes
[SPEAKER_01]: have happened in the past and try to keep
them from happening in the future by
[SPEAKER_01]: addressing them in better prepared
contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could have a contract that's 100 pages
long and you'll never anticipate things
[SPEAKER_01]: that you haven't anticipated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just can't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can include in a contract,
hopefully you'll address, like as Jay
[SPEAKER_01]: said, you'll identify the 10 things that
really matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you'll scope it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens if somebody steals something?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens if it fails a test?
[SPEAKER_01]: What happens if the product doesn't taste
the way it's supposed to taste?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's responsible for that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's like a bunch of stuff
that no one's thought of.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can put in a contract some catch-all
provisions that protect you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think actually Michelle,
in the contract that we did, added some
[SPEAKER_01]: language that I thought was really great
for her client and didn't really rub me
[SPEAKER_01]: the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was broad enough to kind of protect
against an unanticipated situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was something like, hey, listen,
you're making my company's product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know our reputation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our goodwill is on the line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Carry yourself accordingly to protect us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's sort of like a provision that
maybe if there's no other provision in a
[SPEAKER_01]: contract, that specifically addresses the
situation, creates a duty on my client's
[SPEAKER_01]: part.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that if I fail to do something that's
maybe not specifically or expressly
[SPEAKER_01]: addressed, her client can rely on it to
say, hey, dude, look, you really knew
[SPEAKER_01]: better and you should have done that
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess what I'm saying is don't be
distressed and try to trust us to help
[SPEAKER_01]: you.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as the specific question that you
were asking, I honestly filibustered and I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't remember what it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I know I had a really good answer for
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael, I know that you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's saved for later so that everybody
stays.
[SPEAKER_03]: He'll figure it out and come back at the
end.
[SPEAKER_03]: I open it up to everybody else's questions
because you've listened.
[SPEAKER_03]: You, I'm sure, all understand that the
devil is in the details and you should
[SPEAKER_03]: what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Love your lawyer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like my new favorite saying.
[SPEAKER_03]: But does anybody have any questions as we
wrap up?
[SPEAKER_03]: One and two.
[SPEAKER_03]: The question was we've been focused on
C-Corps, but what is the benefit or how
[SPEAKER_03]: would you advise between a C-Corp and LLC
corporation?
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the point where you're selling your
company, you're probably either one or the
[SPEAKER_00]: other.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you wouldn't have the ability to
change.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go from a corporation to an LLC,
you'll get a big tax hurdle basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're selling your company,
you want to get long-term capital gains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could get that either as an LLC or as
a corporation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So from the seller's perspective,
it doesn't really matter because you want
[SPEAKER_00]: the same tax treatment either way.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the buyer's perspective, there's a
whole bunch of other factors that go into
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can convert from an LLC to a C-Corp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or from a C-Corp to an LLC.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of those paths is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you wouldn't do that right before the
acquisition because you would kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: eliminate the goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Long story short, it doesn't really matter
if you're an LLC or a corporation when you
[SPEAKER_00]: get sold for your personal tax
consequence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So don't worry about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing I would add is that that
whole issue of what do we want to be when
[SPEAKER_01]: it comes up at the startup phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I prefer using LLCs because I
find them easier to work with than
[SPEAKER_01]: corporations.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they have different tax consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are ways of turning LLC tax
consequences into the same as corporate
[SPEAKER_01]: tax consequences in terms of using an
S-Corp or just having an LLC that's taxed
[SPEAKER_01]: like a corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But corporations and LLCs are taxed very
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are different 280E consequences,
especially from the purview of state law,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a complicated issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sorry I brought it up, but I can talk
to you about it afterwards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's definitely not one size fits all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jay would know better than I, but I don't
think there's a straight answer for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really depends on your own
circumstances.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends if you're in retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you on the production side?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your 280E consequences?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's your exposure to risk?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you had a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: The question is, we're dealing with an
industry that's legal under state law,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's illegal under federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And is there an issue for enforceability
of contracts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that more or less it?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think historically, there was a
larger concern with contracts being
[SPEAKER_01]: invalidated both under state law or in
state courts and in federal courts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not aware of, since the legalization
effort, I'm not aware of any courts in
[SPEAKER_01]: California, California courts,
state courts, refusing to enforce a
[SPEAKER_01]: contract that selected California courts
as the forum.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people are fearful that
federal courts will not enforce contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they will put in a contract a forum
selection clause that requires you to
[SPEAKER_01]: litigate in federal court.
[SPEAKER_01]: The thing I don't know is I don't know if
you ended up in federal court,
[SPEAKER_01]: if a federal court sitting in California
would refuse to enforce that contract.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am not aware of that situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually aware of some situations
where federal courts have in fact enforced
[SPEAKER_01]: contracts.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not aware of situations where federal
courts, except for bankruptcy courts,
[SPEAKER_01]: have said, no, can't touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's illegal federally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because at the end of the day,
whether you're in federal court or state
[SPEAKER_01]: court, and even if you're in federal
court, the federal court is enforcing a
[SPEAKER_01]: contract that's governed by state law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And under state law, it's enforceable and
it's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anyone else wants to chime
in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also assuming that your contract is
legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's between a legal license operator and
another legal license operator.
[SPEAKER_02]: If one or both of you are in a legal
business, that probably will be held
[SPEAKER_02]: unenforceable if you try to enforce that
contract in state court.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a case called Gullickson,
G-U-L-L-I-C-K-S-O-N.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a northern district of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So federal court case, I think late 2016.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the northern district court basically
said, cannabis contract, that's okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's based in California law.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a new law, a year and a half,
cannabis contracts are a lawful object of
[SPEAKER_00]: commerce in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like selling water in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's right, you want to stay out of
federal court.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to correct the record,
when a corporation converts to an LLC,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when there's this asset sale type
tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: When an LLC converts to a corporation,
that's a smooth tax consequence.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would like to invite you to thank the
panelists with me, who did such a great
[SPEAKER_03]: job and imparted incredible wisdom.
Thank you.
