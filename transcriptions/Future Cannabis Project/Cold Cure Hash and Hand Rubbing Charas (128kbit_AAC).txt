All
[SPEAKER_03]: right, so what'd you guys do?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's so crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's just whip tech.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's just stirring.
[SPEAKER_06]: Kids call it cold curing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really more of like a room temp cure
than a cold cure.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you just wait for the fresh press
rosin to cure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Essentially, it goes through a marbling
period and then kind of all becomes the
[SPEAKER_06]: same.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it becomes the same opacity,
the same consistency.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you just bust it up and stir it
and homogenize all the terpenes in there
[SPEAKER_06]: that kind of break down the texture.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, unicorn chili, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Seriously, the two colors right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, I hear you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that took you like five minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, maybe less.
[SPEAKER_06]: If the product's really good, it almost
happens instantaneous.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd say a minute and a half, two minutes.
[SPEAKER_06]: If it's a real terpene rich product,
it'll get real wet like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of them just are drier resins.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not even saying it's a worser
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just some resins are drier than others.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some are wetter than others.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is a wetter resin, so it's cold
outside, but it's still puddling.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks like pudding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it happens really quick,
instantaneous.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen these little drill bit
attachments that kids literally do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like a little bread dough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: To me, it's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not even necessarily stirring.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's kind of like stab it up, stab it up,
stab it up, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: And it'll continue to get even more
viscous, for lack of a better word.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is that moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you smoke fresh press, it kind of goes
through all these different changes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And this almost rushes it to that moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: It keeps it at that state.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it'll stay stable like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It should stay like that for months.
[SPEAKER_06]: So again, a dry one will still do it for
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've seen some people reintroduce more
heat to make it so that it does this
[SPEAKER_06]: better.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not really necessarily what I'm
after.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like I said, it's just another texture.
[SPEAKER_06]: So some of them will be drier,
and some of them will be wetter like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it make it better or worse?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: It doesn't make or break the technique.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: With that fresh press, just as if you were
a brand and you're trying to serve fresh
[SPEAKER_06]: pressed rosin to a consumer, not only do
you have to keep it cold, but when you
[SPEAKER_06]: transport it, you have to keep it cold,
and then you have to expect your retailer
[SPEAKER_06]: to keep it cold for the consumer.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're supposed to be representing
your brand in such a way.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.
[SPEAKER_06]: 100%.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this is kind of one way to kind of be
like, oh, it'll look like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know it will look like this in three,
six months.
[SPEAKER_06]: Long enough, it'll look just like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: As long as you do it right and do it the
right way.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you can see, I was just stabbing
that a second ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already settling.
[SPEAKER_06]: So consumer got it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It would just be a flat puddle on the
bottom of your jar.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: So are we taking dabs of this,
or what?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, let's smoke it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's smoke it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, no.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I didn't even make this stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all Brandon's, to be honest.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's Brandon's?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I just saw it was at the right
moment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I was like, I'm going to go show Josh
this, because he'll appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just stirred it in front of him just
to show it.
[SPEAKER_06]: My stuff's too fresh to even be at this
state yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: But Brandon made it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You've been talking to Brandon for three
days, and he hasn't put that out yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want some.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll smoke some.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should.
[SPEAKER_06]: We should?
[SPEAKER_06]: We should just wander over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we should just go smoke over there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_06]: Steve's all impressed.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, I just stirred it for him.
[SPEAKER_06]: See, I bet.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: If he wants me to, I could probably do it
with this jar, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is what it started looking like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it started with, show it to me again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what it started at.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what we just saw was something that
started like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Started like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, you just bust it all up,
homogenize it all, and it'll get all wet.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll see if we can bust up this one as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we should smoke some.
[SPEAKER_04]: See, I just stirred that shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just need like, because I'm just doing
like a super like high-end cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: lifestyle like farm stand store.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the top shelf stuff needs to be
present.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_05]: That is so crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: You just were like, errrr.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just not even that hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: If Brandon lets me, I'll do it to this one
right in front of you, too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you'll see, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: I could tell he was like, I don't know if
it's going to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, dude, it's going to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, watch.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sure it would do it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just figured it would.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like, doesn't it just like break the turps
up and like release some pretty much?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it just homogenized it all into
one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the terpenes are solvent into itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's literally dissolving it and making
it just homogenized, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it will stay like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know how this will just kind of
get drier and drier and drier?
[SPEAKER_06]: It'll stay like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Stay like that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I'm not saying it's better.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm just saying, like, I think I like the
wetter stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's easier to grab.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's louder.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, yeah, that's all.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying like, it's just,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: The new rage.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who wants one?
[SPEAKER_06]: I know Steve wants one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: No, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know how this tech work goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get high.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get high.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's everything you hope for and more.
[SPEAKER_06]: That stuff's firebrand.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really good, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweat, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweat.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is the seeds you gave me,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm stoked.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm definitely going to grow that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely going to grow that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like chapstick-like chapstick turps.
[SPEAKER_03]: Covers your mouth.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who wants one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfect, good.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's super emotional right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're having a moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Expansion on it, though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your body can kind of take it,
though.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not like, it's just so clean,
man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Your body just accepts it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it does.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just absorbs it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It wants it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's next?
[SPEAKER_06]: Somebody?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want one, don't you?
[SPEAKER_06]: You want one, don't you?
[SPEAKER_06]: I see you back there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, look at him.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's so ready.
[SPEAKER_04]: He was just like, I am so high right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, good job, bro.
[SPEAKER_04]: Say again?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, for sure, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dude, they agree with you, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: They just agree with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your body likes it, man.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm telling you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've smoked a lot of different shit in my
day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, dude, that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the way it should be.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the closest representation of the
flower, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: In my opinion, as weird as it sounds,
smoking flower, cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: That is smoking the flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I feel like when you smoke the flower,
it's never like when you harvested that
[SPEAKER_06]: flower, in my opinion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Or that's what I'm trying to achieve when
you dry and cure flower.
[SPEAKER_06]: I feel like you're trying to be like,
I want it.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like perfume extraction.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: But I don't know.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a drying process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Obviously, terpenes dissipate.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a conversion that happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm not saying it just changes.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying it's better.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not saying it's worse.
[SPEAKER_06]: But to me, this is the closest.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's the live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: That stuff energizes me, dude.
[SPEAKER_06]: Totally, totally.
[SPEAKER_06]: You should have Piranha that life works,
you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: I will say something on live resin of
hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's charros, hand hash, rubbing these
hash plants that we make with our hands,
[SPEAKER_01]: like they used to do traditionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did that a couple months ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: At the plant itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I harvested three quarters of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just got the last little sea buds
and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll go and rub them all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I did about an hour and a half or two
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I got two and a half grams after I
collected it all up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was cream, the creamiest cream.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was darker than all this stuff on the
table.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it tasted just like all this stuff on
the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a trip.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I feel like it was still live.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a live process.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was a different form of mechanical
extraction.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we didn't lose, though, the terpenes
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the most quickest way to get a
fresh plant from harvest time into your
[SPEAKER_01]: lungs and it be the right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no moisture in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, like with us making water hash
and pressing it or doing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, terpenes are lost and time in
between.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this hand hash and then collecting it
and fucking dabbing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a fucking trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to come around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do that shit next year.
[SPEAKER_06]: You need to get yourself a leather suit
and you just run through the field,
[SPEAKER_06]: bro.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you collect it at the end,
bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rub against the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's to get that quality super
fucking high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you see where this is done is on the
other side of the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, I DM some of these people
just for the hell of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was like, yo, tell me how to,
you know, what's your tech on just hand
[SPEAKER_01]: hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were like the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the professionals only rub the
Nug three to five times and then drop it
[SPEAKER_01]: and go to the next one.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's like they just want the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just want the easiest, the lightest,
the quickest heads to fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then no particulates.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really about no particulates,
too, because the longer you rub one Nug,
[SPEAKER_01]: the little bit of the pistols,
the hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they'll come off and get stuck into
your hand hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you got to in between Nugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this like you see tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just rub it off and you just like
rub, rub, rub, flick it off the hairs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, although dust will be
a part of that from the, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: dirt in the air and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lightly rubbing Nugs going to the next
one to the next one is this like highest
[SPEAKER_01]: grade of like hand hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they say like the, you know,
the rookies of hand hash, I guess,
[SPEAKER_01]: or they call it whatever in the hills,
like they'll rub, you know, the second
[SPEAKER_01]: harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll rub the second run a lot harder.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll be learning at the same time
because they'll be, you know, younger in
[SPEAKER_01]: the village or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they'll learn, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And their hand hash is a lot darker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's a trip to see qualities on
just people's hands like we have in jars
[SPEAKER_01]: and on the table and bags, you know,
in the workplace of Washington.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a trip.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm going to start doing that next
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I'm going to just like dedicate
like a plant or like a chunk of the hoop
[SPEAKER_01]: just like all hand hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like, of course, it'll be like
headstash shit, but everyone will see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll post all about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it'll be fucking tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dude, it's not on a market level yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost so hard, you know,
to have like hand like hash like they're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to want gloves involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to want all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to do it with my hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll smoke all what's on my hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure Amanda will do some of hers.
[SPEAKER_01]: She'll smoke what's all for her hands.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll like, you know, it'll be like a
community thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll invite a bunch of my Brazilian
friends over.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, they just like tell me all the
time like they just love this dry trim and
[SPEAKER_01]: get finger hash like that and like smoke
those flips.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're going to lose their mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, it's going to be, I think,
a traditional party.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll probably start creating.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd be fucking fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Larry, is that what your two trimmers are
doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, in the bins and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, yeah, it's devastating.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes you see how much, how aggressive
they can be.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to tell them.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to pull it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm really strict.
[SPEAKER_04]: Slow, slow snips, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like when they go, as fast as they can
clip the scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I always get my trimmers to work on
certain plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I, you know, from all the different,
like, phenos or certain things in the
[SPEAKER_01]: garden, like we harvest them, we label
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like I'll trim the ones that I know
need to be trimmed by me because it's that
[SPEAKER_01]: like severe of a quality, you know,
loss if someone else is doing it without
[SPEAKER_01]: the education and the knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I tell them all the time, yeah,
there's no scissors involved with some of
[SPEAKER_01]: our, with our headstache stuff that we'll
do pounds and pounds of.
[SPEAKER_01]: No scissors.
[SPEAKER_01]: The buds are dense enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: The, you know, the herb is dense enough to
have a.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, like if I sit there all day,
two pounds easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and we're not doing like any of
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: These will all be tops.
[SPEAKER_04]: A pound is like so easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a chunk of the tops.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is ice cream cake.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but we're, you know, I'm going to
make charros out of that freaking plant in
[SPEAKER_01]: the future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the, the amount of, you know,
I talked to those people, like I said,
[SPEAKER_01]: I DMed some of the, you know, Eastern
people in the past and they said like they
[SPEAKER_01]: get four to six grams average,
maybe 10 grams max a day doing it all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I was getting two grams in an
hour and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like, I thought like, we're going to
see like a half ounce come around pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: easily, I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: So don't mark my words, but I'm going to
shoot for a half ounce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you going to be out there with
them?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like Newman and Kramer making the
sausage.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you'd be surprised, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have some pictures on my phone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll show you that are just like the cream
looked just like beyond, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: again, just from harvesting fresh rosin.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see at the tip of your scissors.
[SPEAKER_06]: The tip of your scissors are the freaking
like cream.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, they look, yeah, totally oily.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just tell doing little things like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of quality of rosin is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just an experimentalist.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a little bit more, you know,
and I, yeah, like it's not, it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's going to be like freaking
profitable and like anything that anyone
[SPEAKER_01]: should be doing for the fucking market.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like strictly, headstache
connoisseur, you know, the finest wine
[SPEAKER_01]: type shit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically to bring to something like
this, if you're going to want to find it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like you got to fucking come to do
it yourself or, you know, you got to come
[SPEAKER_01]: sit at the round table here, you know,
and like smoke with the nights type of
[SPEAKER_01]: shit, you know, because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: a very, very reason because the stash of
the local is not for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want that quality or you make it
yourself or you will, you will smoke it
[SPEAKER_00]: with the local.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you go as far as going there,
but it's not for sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know how far we all traveled to be
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no money, no money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now with the tool, we can make much more
quantity of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like to make my stash, I needed three to
four months minimum for my one year of
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to make like just one stash of one
person when it's all by hand or even
[SPEAKER_00]: sieving to get a kilo, two kilo of first
grade.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make a hundred kilo of ash that you're
going to leave to the local.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, if you want just that little
window.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like the deal is you're going to
stay with the local three, four months on
[SPEAKER_00]: top of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You live with them and you need to define
the price where how much you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: make me pay for all those bundle of plants
that I going to sieve by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want only this little stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I give you everything else for the,
for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are, you're a squatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take the best, but you leave a lot to
them so that everybody is happy kind of.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the rasta way is you give,
you know, you, uh, producing country it
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I came here, it was the same deal
with Leo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do 50 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: Always some trade off for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you want that quality, you need to
go to where they grow the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise you go two hours down the road.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't see the quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody has taken it and he's going to
resell it or keep it for himself.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere in every producing country and
you are a producing country.
[SPEAKER_00]: It works like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want it, you come to see me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
