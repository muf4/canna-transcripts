[SPEAKER_01]: Next topic we're going to dive into is
industrial hemp, particularly what is the
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity for hemp in California right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: As most of you know, farming regulations
are not quite complete and the forms
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't out yet, but there are several
startups and established companies that
[SPEAKER_01]: are moving back or moving into the state
or welling up from the ground springs to
[SPEAKER_01]: make their presence known in the hemp
industry here in the Golden State.
[SPEAKER_01]: Industrial hemp has been legalized
federally, so now it's up to each state to
[SPEAKER_01]: come up with their state plan along with
federally recognized Indian tribes,
[SPEAKER_01]: submit that to the USDA, get that
approved, and then bring their project
[SPEAKER_01]: online for federal compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: That leads into kind of our first topic,
which is going to be a double-edged sword.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's on the regulatory aspects,
which are kind of different in every
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pretty retail-focused on this panel.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people are transitioning from the
cannabis space into the industrial hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we could just start out kind of talking
about some of the challenges, what we've
[SPEAKER_01]: encountered today, trying to work with
farmers, retail, whether it's getting CBD
[SPEAKER_01]: products or packaging products into the
retail space or adding to your product
[SPEAKER_01]: line that's already going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody wants to jump off there,
James?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I guess I can, you know,
start off just by touching on some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: challenges we've faced using hemp
bioplastic as a packaging material as it
[SPEAKER_02]: relates to regulatory stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we started working on this project,
we were under the 2014 Farm Bill,
[SPEAKER_02]: so, you know, that made it really
difficult for us to put together a supply
[SPEAKER_02]: chain because we had to find a source of
hemp that was being cultivated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we believed very strongly in
just using domestically grown hemp and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, finding and putting all those
pieces together from it being grown under
[SPEAKER_02]: the pilot program to finding someone who's
actually processing it to specs that we
[SPEAKER_02]: could use as useful materials was an
incredibly difficult process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the things that excites me
about the 2018 Farm Bill is that not just
[SPEAKER_02]: as more hemp comes online, there will also
be more infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's one of the biggest
things lacking currently in the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: is, you know, every farmer in the country
could go grow hemp tomorrow and that would
[SPEAKER_02]: be great, but if we're unable to process
it into useful materials, it doesn't do us
[SPEAKER_02]: any good.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what I'm looking forward to the
most with legalization is not just more
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp, but more infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can say one of the difficulties that I'm
going to face in the Santa Barbara County
[SPEAKER_00]: is the cannabis growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are opposing not strongly,
but they're very concerned about their
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis crops regarding growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for right now, my county
cross-pollination, yeah, isn't allowing
[SPEAKER_00]: any growth or any thought of growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't file for a permit or anything or
even register for one until 2020 because
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to have all the regulations in
place prior to opening up farmers to start
[SPEAKER_00]: farming.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in media, it's, you know, obviously we
can only work with people who are in
[SPEAKER_03]: compliance with legal grows and whatnot
and it's keeping up with the constant
[SPEAKER_03]: list.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems like every day something is
changing and not just in California,
[SPEAKER_03]: but, you know, obviously that's our market
here, but it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a huge challenge and, you know,
there's no easy way to really get around
[SPEAKER_03]: that other than, you know, to be in the
same industry, you just have to have a
[SPEAKER_03]: heck of a lot of patience and a lot of
tenacity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes a couple of lawyers too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, in, as far as the,
the native in the native American circle,
[SPEAKER_03]: this is a, an issue that's close to my
heart.
[SPEAKER_03]: My sons are half native and I actually did
get to visit, you know, Alex white plume
[SPEAKER_03]: three years ago for a planting,
which, which went awry because of seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: that came from anyway.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, but, uh, it's a challenge in,
um, in, in many ways within that,
[SPEAKER_03]: within that culture as well, because one,
there's a very high level of distrust,
[SPEAKER_03]: understandably so.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, with the, um, the,
with the regulations changing all the time
[SPEAKER_03]: as well, that, that doesn't help that,
you know, so to, to the, and we'll get
[SPEAKER_03]: into this a little bit later, but,
um, you know, that there are groups
[SPEAKER_03]: forming to, to help with legislation,
uh, specifically for natives.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, you know, I think that that's,
that's a huge step in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one of those is the, the native
American, uh, cannabis coalition.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're at the federal level and
then focused on California as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ron, uh, have you encountered anything at
the retail aspect in?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you tried to expand your product line
into CBD in Santa Monica?
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we're focused on making, uh,
clothing and accessories, uh, what the
[SPEAKER_04]: change in the legal landscape has meant to
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on the CB front of several years ago,
when I started using CBD products,
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, oh, um, I, and I knew some
people in Colorado, making them,
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought, oh, I can just private label
from these guys as I seem to be doing it
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And had I done that, I would be one of the
people, you know, more firmly established
[SPEAKER_04]: in the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, but what I, what, what I realized
would happen, which is what kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: happening is that there's this just
proliferation of brands and, um,
[SPEAKER_04]: there's not necessarily the mature retail
shelf space market to, uh, handle and
[SPEAKER_04]: display them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the smoke shops are kind of coming
aboard, but they're probably going with
[SPEAKER_04]: not necessarily artisanal brands or brands
that care that much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's, you know, your Arawans,
which are just throwing everything in the
[SPEAKER_04]: shelf and making tons of money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then, and then there's, uh,
you know, little places like, like vital
[SPEAKER_04]: hemp, where I've selected a few brands of
where I know the owners, where I know how
[SPEAKER_04]: they made it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what's going to happen now and
what's happening more and more is not only
[SPEAKER_04]: do you have like the old, um, you know,
Charlotte's web guys who were in early
[SPEAKER_04]: and, and have dominated and made lots of
money in blueberries and so forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now you're getting people who,
uh, well, you're getting both of the
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical side that's coming in from
a bad angle, but also people like John
[SPEAKER_04]: Rulak and Reed Botanicals who were coming
at it from, I would say a more
[SPEAKER_04]: ecologically minded ethical perspective
and growing, you know, supporting
[SPEAKER_04]: regenerative farming, making sure that the
entire supply chain is organic and so
[SPEAKER_04]: forth.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so what, what we're doing in my shop,
is we're still just, I did, I decided not
[SPEAKER_04]: to go into CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just didn't have the resources to manage
production and, you know, grow a CBD line.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe it was foolish.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know, but, uh, uh, I'm happy just
focusing on the things that I like to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because there are so many companies
now, they all need hemp t-shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're there to, you know, there was a
statement released by the California
[SPEAKER_01]: department of public health that,
um, it was more of a notice than an actual
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement on, uh, CBD and food and
beverage, uh, products in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's, there's been a questionable or
gray area there where you see it on like
[SPEAKER_01]: shelves at Lassen's or Arowan.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's definitely some small
artisanal brands and retail outlets
[SPEAKER_01]: carrying it as well in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think right now it's kind of a
matter of, um, enforcement, like no one's
[SPEAKER_01]: going in and pulling CBD off shelves,
uh, similar to they did.
[SPEAKER_01]: In, in Indiana.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but, um, and there's definitely a lot
of regulations in terms of the advertising
[SPEAKER_01]: and marketing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've seen some, you know, Koi CBD and
other brands that have billboards in the
[SPEAKER_01]: area and then supply chain sounds like
it's a real dilemma.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you guys want to follow up on anything
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I was just going to say, you know,
mostly what you see now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I, cause the people have asked me
like, well, I thought you said I could buy
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD at this, at this place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, um, you know, but the labels now say
hemp oil.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're so that's, that's part of the way
that I think people are, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: safeguarding, safeguarding themselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, um, yeah, it's a, it's interesting to
see where, where that will go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's several different,
um, kind of markers on that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can advertise it as a hemp extract
or it could be a hemp derived CBD versus,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a can high THC cannabis derived
CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's where the crossover and
like Clona's model come in or,
[SPEAKER_01]: or even in sauna packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause you guys are having to integrate
with the dispensaries, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: with the hemp product initially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, one of the things, uh, too,
I think that's, you know, interesting,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, with hemp right now in the United
States is there, there is such a huge
[SPEAKER_02]: focus on growing specifically high CBD,
uh, hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it makes sense for right now
because we have, we're, we're able to
[SPEAKER_02]: process that and there's, there's tons of
equipment available for that in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's an easy business model.
[SPEAKER_02]: To set up, but in the long term,
we're going to have to start growing other
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties of hemp as well that are,
you know, more adept to your fiber
[SPEAKER_02]: production or seed production and what
have you, you know, all the different
[SPEAKER_02]: uses.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and also, you know, taking into
account the fact that industrial
[SPEAKER_02]: applications is, you know, by far in a way
going to be the largest use for hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, it'll, it'll be interesting
to see how that plays out, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: how the, how the us, uh, CBD market
stabilizes within the greater us hemp
[SPEAKER_02]: economy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I don't have any answers here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just really curious to see what
happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I, I just, I hope, uh, we execute it
well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I jump in just for a second?
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, so about 10 years ago, I was at the
natural products expo because I was doing
[SPEAKER_04]: my best to hemp out the natural products
expo and, uh, they've been a little more
[SPEAKER_04]: resistant than the hemp community.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I connected with this guy named Don
Werschafter who I'd sort of known through
[SPEAKER_04]: the hemp community and, uh, he was
instrumental in, um, bringing hemp in hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: oil and to the states with products like,
uh, you know, helping Nutiva and others.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I asked him, I said, so what,
what do you think is the prognosis for,
[SPEAKER_04]: for hemp?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going to happen, Donnie?
[SPEAKER_04]: And he said, uh, well, he says it's
already all basically decided,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, he says, uh, but he said,
but I'll tell you one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hemp bioplastics alone will dwarf the
entire marijuana market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, Whoa, that's, that's kind
of a statement.
[SPEAKER_04]: I hadn't, I hadn't quite thought of it in
those terms, but then later I learned that
[SPEAKER_04]: Audi and BMW and Mercedes Benz are y'all
using, you know, hemp bioplastics for the
[SPEAKER_04]: interior body panels of their,
of their cars.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so when you think about those
companies with such an institutional
[SPEAKER_04]: legacy and such incredible engineering,
uh, you know, finesse choosing hemp,
[SPEAKER_04]: then you just got to realize like,
well, then there must be a thousand other
[SPEAKER_04]: industries that are going to also switch
to this more sustainable, better
[SPEAKER_04]: performing solutions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And how about if we start with straws?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because there's a huge, you know,
yeah, there's a huge movement to,
[SPEAKER_03]: to, you know, people are banning straws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, well, okay, if we want straws,
let's, how about some that we'll decompose
[SPEAKER_03]: and put in less than four months?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you do this design challenge?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So speaking from like the material science
perspective, the, uh, all the hemp plastic
[SPEAKER_02]: that you're seeing on the market right now
is fiber reinforced biocomposites,
[SPEAKER_02]: meaning that you're using a base resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, you know, typically a PLA,
that's what we use, which is, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: typically made from corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're infusing that with a micro
nized hemp herd.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the formulation that we're using,
the most hemp we were able to get into it
[SPEAKER_02]: is 30% hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's 30% hemp, 70% corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, but because it is a fiber reinforced
biocomposite, um, we can't do transparent
[SPEAKER_02]: or translucent plastics or flexible
plastics yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So things like straws, um, which can be
all of those things, um, are difficult
[SPEAKER_02]: right now, uh, in order to get to a point
where, you know, we can have wall
[SPEAKER_02]: thicknesses that thin, um, and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to be making plastic out of hemp
the same way that we make PLA,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is, you know, done by, you know,
extracting cellulose and the sugar and
[SPEAKER_02]: making plastic that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not a question of reinventing the
wheel.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what we do with corn, but it is a
question of, of readapting this technology
[SPEAKER_02]: to a new biomass feedstock.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, you know, not just doing that
cause we could go out and do it,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's a question of being able to do it
on scale and being able to produce the
[SPEAKER_02]: material at a price point where people
would actually buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, cause with things like packaging too,
which are typically really low cost items,
[SPEAKER_02]: you really have to factor in, you know,
what will people actually pay for this?
[SPEAKER_03]: And who, um, this might be a silly
question, but it is, do you know someone
[SPEAKER_03]: who's actually working on, are we going to
have, we started the road to get there
[SPEAKER_03]: with the like everyday plastics?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were definitely on the road.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's, there's a ways to go
until we're fully there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you're, you're not going to see
much besides fiber reinforced
[SPEAKER_02]: biocomposites for the next, I'd say at
least like, you know, kind of three to
[SPEAKER_02]: five years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and you know, and going back to what
you were saying about, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: hemp bioplastic, possibly dwarfing these
other, uh, parts of the industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: there is a ton that needs to happen on the
supply chain and infrastructure side of
[SPEAKER_02]: things for that to become a reality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there, I think realistically you're
looking, you know, 10, 15 years out,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, to where, uh, cause we also have to
keep in mind with, um, plastics and just
[SPEAKER_02]: biomass in general is you're competing
with crude oil, which is the single most
[SPEAKER_02]: sophisticated supply chain that we have
ever created for anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and you know, the ships and the
pipelines that we use to move crude oil
[SPEAKER_02]: around the world are some of the most high
tech machinery ever designed, uh,
[SPEAKER_02]: besides like a spacecraft.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in, in biomass has moved on trains and
trucks.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what we're competing with.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think this is a good segue into the
next topic, which would be the
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental component of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you know, we, we hear a lot towards
the 25,000 different uses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, uh, however many it is that
one of the things that stands out is that
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp seems to perform nearly better than
any other option.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so that's, that's where some of
its usefulness and utility I think really
[SPEAKER_01]: comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so in terms of the, the environmental
aspect, we know that it has, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: great benefits to soil and, and air
quality and putting carbon back in the
[SPEAKER_01]: earth that the farming, uh, component,
but also, um, let's talk a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: about, um, you know, limiting waste and,
um, reusable products that can come from
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most importantly, I think the
environmental aspect that inspired you to
[SPEAKER_01]: do your certain, uh, businesses today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
