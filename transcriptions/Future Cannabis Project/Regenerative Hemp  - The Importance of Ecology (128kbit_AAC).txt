[SPEAKER_04]: Aloha.
[SPEAKER_04]: Aloha.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mahalo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Good evening, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope you've had a wonderful evening.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of a capper to the weekend right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been so many amazing phases,
so many beautiful experiences.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's nice to link up in person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're really excited to bring to you
regenerative hemp tonight and talk to you
[SPEAKER_03]: about how hemp can save the world,
not only through medicine, but through
[SPEAKER_03]: intentional cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have three wonderful people up here
that are gonna share their experience and
[SPEAKER_03]: their intentions on their farm and beyond.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dave Sullivan.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thanks for sticking around,
guys, and listening to us talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thanks, Josh and Kelly, for inviting
us to be on this panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Dave Sullivan.
[SPEAKER_05]: And thank you, guys, for sticking around.
[SPEAKER_05]: My name is Dave Sullivan.
[SPEAKER_05]: I own Sweet Leaf Organic Farm,
which is a certified organic farm,
[SPEAKER_05]: along with The Plant, which is a
recreational marijuana farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're located outside of Eugene,
Oregon, in the farming community of
[SPEAKER_05]: Junction City.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we manage about 100 acres of ground
that includes forests, woodlands,
[SPEAKER_05]: riparian zones, wetlands, and a heck of a
lot of class one farm soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: We generally have about 20 to 30 acres in
production annually.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we employ 18 people year round,
including five families.
[SPEAKER_05]: And over the years, we've developed a
style of farming that incorporates
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis into its long-term fertility
program, soil building program,
[SPEAKER_05]: and crop rotation program.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've had a lot of success having that
be one of our key crops intermingled
[SPEAKER_05]: amongst our other fruit and vegetable
crops.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Dave.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to echo my thanks for everyone
who stuck around.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been a long weekend.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's nice to see everybody here.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Matt Davenport.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm the founder and CEO of Arlo Systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also own a company called Cliffside Hemp
Supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're a supply chain management and
logistics company that supports domestic
[SPEAKER_04]: and international markets at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a permaculture designer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've spent my time and career applying
permaculture design to cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: My passions really just evolved into
working how I can to scale indoor and full
[SPEAKER_04]: sun operations, really.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my work in hemp, I was a certified hemp
farmer in 2016, 2017 out of Colorado and
[SPEAKER_04]: ran that farm for a year, went to scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had to pull out of the drought back,
I think it was 2017, 2018.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had a really bad drought in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was, yeah, it just caused a lot
of farmers to pull out, some not to be
[SPEAKER_04]: very successful as a result of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So finding a problem out of that solution,
I built that supply chain management
[SPEAKER_04]: company I referred to.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've been just working with farmers
to help them solve problems in the
[SPEAKER_04]: movement of their hemp one way or another
from biomass, flour, posterfying goods,
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And really helping educate farmers who are
both conventional farmers shifting crops,
[SPEAKER_04]: conventional farmers just looking to shift
to organic, and then working with organic
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers looking to shift beyond to
regenerative agricultural practices.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks again for being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Daniel Richardson, co-owner and CEO of
Lane Creek Hemp Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Jackson County, Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we got a 40 acre spread down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're growing an acre of hemp in like
a two acre cultivation zone, growing it in
[SPEAKER_00]: hugel berms and very intensive
perennialized system, no store bought
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're managing like nine cows,
bunch of sheep, a bunch of livestock and
[SPEAKER_00]: rotating them around and just trying to
work with the land and create nutrient
[SPEAKER_00]: bases in that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it's been a really, really
exciting project and just getting into the
[SPEAKER_00]: roots of the land and what a land steward
can really do on a piece of property with
[SPEAKER_00]: the right ingredients with great sun,
great water, great soil and animals and
[SPEAKER_00]: humans, like how that symbiotic
relationship happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, just trying to do our best in
this tumultuous hemp scape, which has been
[SPEAKER_00]: a really, really interesting project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're super excited to see where it
goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, just trying to lead by example
and just ensure that we're building top
[SPEAKER_00]: soil and that we're keeping fish happy and
we're keeping wildlife happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're just trying not to grow fence to
fence and understanding that the network
[SPEAKER_00]: of fertility is so, it kind of circles
around us as the land steward,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the human.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this whole regenerative model,
it's different for everybody and it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: like, it's this mindset of you have to
compromise some profit and you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: compromise some of your needs to allow
your land to thrive and just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: create nucleuses of fertility and linking
them up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where systemic fertility really
comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just trying to, like I didn't grow up
doing this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a heavy civil construction
background and got into the farming world
[SPEAKER_00]: and so now I'm going down this path and
it's just, it's a great canvas to work
[SPEAKER_00]: with.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the first time, probably in over 200
years, North America is seeing a huge
[SPEAKER_01]: increase of young farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Young farmers are very interested in
buying land.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanna know how to farm it in a way
that's responsible because hemp and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis has got their attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is really exciting and I believe
that we have this wonderful opportunity to
[SPEAKER_01]: give, to hire and give alternatives and be
more creative to Big Ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And while this plant is an incredible
regenerator, it is a remediator,
[SPEAKER_01]: it can feed the world, it can give fiber
to us and can give us medicine,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's still, as this hemp industry ramps
up, there is a lot of people doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: still Big Ag style and there's some real
problems and I wanted to talk a bit about
[SPEAKER_01]: those and go through and you all tell me
about the solutions that you have for
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one that we're seeing is thousands of
acres underneath plastic mulching,
[SPEAKER_01]: is what they call it, which is basically
planting the plants and putting layers of
[SPEAKER_01]: plastic over thousands of acres.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not going to regenerate the
land or the waterways at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a horrible environmental disaster.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's our responsibility as regenerative
hemp farmers to change that reality and
[SPEAKER_01]: get the education out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd love to hear from you all about
some really good solutions to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that being said, for us,
I feel like a lot of people in this room
[SPEAKER_05]: that probably have experience or have
dedicated their lives to ganja,
[SPEAKER_05]: what it was like for me as a teenager and
learning how to grow crops and learning
[SPEAKER_05]: how to grow weed, looking to like people
that were older for us that had success,
[SPEAKER_05]: we were told you couldn't get chunky
killer yields of sticky buds without using
[SPEAKER_05]: bottled synthetic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or once you have spider mites,
the only way you're going to get rid of
[SPEAKER_05]: them was avid or fluoromite or whatever
other toxic bullshit was being pushed on
[SPEAKER_05]: people.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that being said, not wanting to go down
that road, we would have our pen and paper
[SPEAKER_05]: and listen to our elders who were able to
pull off killer ganja without using any of
[SPEAKER_05]: those inputs.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm seeing the same thing happen with
plastic right now where people are being
[SPEAKER_05]: told that the plants won't size up in time
or you won't be able to manage weeds or
[SPEAKER_05]: water retention, whatever the reason is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I can tell you from experience with
lots of crops over the years that the
[SPEAKER_05]: Willamette Valley is not an ideal climate
to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to be on it and there's a lot of
nuance that are the difference between
[SPEAKER_05]: make and break and you do not need plastic
mulch to go killer high quality cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp, CBD, any of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we have found a really good
alternative.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll just kind of nuts and bolts our
style.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that to start off in any industry,
especially farming, especially cannabis,
[SPEAKER_05]: starting small is key.
[SPEAKER_05]: Learn your plants, learn your crew,
learn your land, get it all worked
[SPEAKER_05]: together.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's no rush.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anytime I jump ahead and try to grow two
acres of onions versus one, I get tennis
[SPEAKER_05]: ball onions instead of softball size
onions.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's the same exact thing for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said, I think one person with a
strong back and a strong will with a green
[SPEAKER_05]: thumb can manage about an acre is the
threshold hands on, especially when it
[SPEAKER_05]: comes to weeds, which while on the topic
of plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a bit bigger than that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We did about 12 and a half acres of high
CBD this year in one to quarter acre to
[SPEAKER_05]: half acre, two acre plots, all kind of
scattered around our chest board over all
[SPEAKER_05]: of our properties and just nuts and bolts
how we got it done.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of it was direct seeded.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of it was transplanted.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then after the first round of weeds come
up, when the plants are established,
[SPEAKER_05]: we come through with hoes, wheel hoes,
hand weeds, secondary.
[SPEAKER_05]: First of us, we're slightly mechanized.
[SPEAKER_05]: The old school tractors like the Alice
Chommer G's and the Farmall Cubs,
[SPEAKER_05]: these things were built to last forever
and had multiple functions.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll come down and literally drive on our
tractor and knock down the weeds in row
[SPEAKER_05]: with basket weeders.
[SPEAKER_05]: We come by a second time with the finger
weeders, which will smother the in row
[SPEAKER_05]: weeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then our crew just comes through hands and
hoes like the ground troops knocking back
[SPEAKER_05]: with the tractors, couldn't knock down.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then if we can time it right and timely
cultivation is key in any farming
[SPEAKER_05]: operation, the second round we can get
away with no hand weeding and just have
[SPEAKER_05]: our finger weeders just smother the in row
weeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we follow that up with a combination
of cover crops, ideally grass,
[SPEAKER_05]: rye grass or an annual grass.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're really digging a New Zealand white
clover for ganja in particular.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason I like the white clover is that
it grows really short so it doesn't kind
[SPEAKER_05]: of choke your understory canopy and also
it is more drought tolerant.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we water it in overhead and once it's
established, it can take foot traffic.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in our aisles, we can walk all over it
and we won't smother it and it can take
[SPEAKER_05]: less irrigation and it'll still thrive.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then we find if you can get that clover
not turned into the following like late
[SPEAKER_05]: spring, early summer, when after it's
flowered, the amount of nitrogen boost you
[SPEAKER_05]: get from flowered New Zealand clover is
choked.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can't even believe how much it builds
up your soil.
[SPEAKER_05]: So those are all alternatives.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not only are we creating an environment
for beneficial insects and habitat and
[SPEAKER_05]: choking out all the competing weed
species, but we're also creating a natural
[SPEAKER_05]: living mulch that's an alternative to
plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_05]: In my experience, I think gives you a much
superior end product and we're building
[SPEAKER_05]: soil.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one more thought, the grass combined
with the clover, the reason for that
[SPEAKER_05]: clover is a lot slower to germinate and a
lot of times your next round of weeds will
[SPEAKER_05]: just choke it out where your grasses can
kind of come up immediately and choke out
[SPEAKER_05]: all the invasive weed species that were
already there and all your broadleaf
[SPEAKER_05]: grasses, grasses and weeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then after that's established,
you mow that back and your clover comes
[SPEAKER_05]: through and then by this time of year,
all you see is fields of clover.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Matt?
[SPEAKER_04]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think to address the plastic mulch
thing, we really just have to ask
[SPEAKER_04]: ourselves what problems are farmers having
with the approach to setting up farms and
[SPEAKER_04]: most of the time what I found,
I work directly with and oversee probably
[SPEAKER_04]: about 13, 14 farms all over the country
and a lot of them are, and this is by
[SPEAKER_04]: nature of just the demand for the market
hopping into the season in the spring.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're seeing the dollars, they're seeing
the green rush, they're seeing the need to
[SPEAKER_04]: just get to market, get to market,
get plants in the ground and they're
[SPEAKER_04]: ultimately missing the boat on the reality
that to go towards, for example,
[SPEAKER_04]: in Oregon, the organic no-till
methodology, which is a great solution for
[SPEAKER_04]: broad-scale hemp cultivation that's on
relatively flat land, they're missing the
[SPEAKER_04]: boat on planting those cover crops in the
fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: So really one of the best advices that I
have to people that are looking to get
[SPEAKER_04]: into farming or looking to really get into
this large-scale organic no-till thing
[SPEAKER_04]: with regeneration as sort of the long-term
end goal, it's really to start your design
[SPEAKER_04]: work June, August, September of the year
before, work with land where you're able
[SPEAKER_04]: to have fallow fields, where you're able
to leave places for plants to continuously
[SPEAKER_04]: occupy the ground because at the end of
the day, the big takeaway with cover crops
[SPEAKER_04]: is that you really want to treat them with
as much love as you do the crops that
[SPEAKER_04]: generate your sort of primary source of
income.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, if we look through the lens of
permaculture and different sustainable and
[SPEAKER_04]: regenerative methodologies, simply
sourcing your livelihood off of one plant,
[SPEAKER_04]: one stream of revenue, and on a sort of
financial monoculture begs the question of
[SPEAKER_04]: whether that's holistic in and of itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: So assuming we have the ability to do the
right kind of design work, the foresight
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to start designing the year
before, the concept, and it's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: vary from region to region, but the
general concept is you're planting a hairy
[SPEAKER_04]: vetch or rye somewhere depending on your
zone from as early as end of August to
[SPEAKER_04]: generally no later than October 15th.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're planting a type of cover crops that
are really going to grow up over winter
[SPEAKER_04]: and then in the fall or in the spring,
you're going to use certain implements
[SPEAKER_04]: that have been designed by the Rodale
Institute, and if anybody really wants to
[SPEAKER_04]: go deep into organic no-till, it suggests
really studying the work that the Rodale
[SPEAKER_04]: Institute has put out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have free designs for what are called
roller crimpers, which are the basis for
[SPEAKER_04]: how to actually create long-term mulch for
these organic no-till systems,
[SPEAKER_04]: which again, technically speaking,
they're not no-till.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So most no-till farmers are doing single
passes at the beginning of the year,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, and then they're doing another
pass to harvest at the end of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as you sort of look at the season on a
cycle, you're planting your cover crops in
[SPEAKER_04]: the fall, you're buying or you're making
what's called a roller crimper,
[SPEAKER_04]: which, you know, is the idea of taking,
you know, rye grasses and with this really
[SPEAKER_04]: a big metal cylindrical tool, excuse me,
a cylindrical tool with what they call a
[SPEAKER_04]: chevron pattern, you're able to actually
roll this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Typically, you put it on the front of the
tractor, and this is in the spring,
[SPEAKER_04]: so again, I'm trying to keep the cycle
going, but you plant it in the fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the spring, you plan on rolling and
crimping your crop, so you put this roller
[SPEAKER_04]: crimper on the front of the tractor,
and then on the, usually you have to do
[SPEAKER_04]: two passes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually, you'll plant for, generally
speaking, a winter rye and then a hairy
[SPEAKER_04]: vetch.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first pass, the rye will go down,
and then, generally speaking, sometimes
[SPEAKER_04]: the hairy vetch will pop back up,
so you have to do another pass with the
[SPEAKER_04]: roller crimper, and on the back of the
tractor is where your planting implements
[SPEAKER_04]: are planted, so the idea is that the
roller crimper rolls what's called residue
[SPEAKER_04]: to the ground, and then on the back of the
tractor there, basically disc cutters that
[SPEAKER_04]: split the residue, spread it apart just
enough for you to be able to get a cutting
[SPEAKER_04]: or seed start in there, and then behind
the tractor on that same implement,
[SPEAKER_04]: you're running behind and planting
accordingly, so I think that's one
[SPEAKER_04]: solution for broad scale agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're able to certainly reduce your
passes, and when it comes down to it,
[SPEAKER_04]: if you have the ability to do the
foresight and design, should eliminate,
[SPEAKER_04]: at scale, plastic mulch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, the big takeaway from organic
no-till is most of it isn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_04]: organic, so you've got to make sure that
you're following a biological pathway to
[SPEAKER_04]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of organic no-till farmers are still
spraying, organic or no-till farmers are
[SPEAKER_04]: spraying glyphosates, D4, and all sorts of
chemicals, herbicides on their crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, that's awesome, and Daniel,
can you maybe add maybe what kind of foods
[SPEAKER_03]: you might be able to plant within your
part of your system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: In any fertile environment, there's going
to be a lot of growth, and in our firm
[SPEAKER_00]: no-till environment, come grass season,
it's just unbelievable what happens in
[SPEAKER_00]: those hugelburms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got chest deep grass by 420,
and trying to deal with all that,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're looking at this gardenscape
that you're approaching to plant your
[SPEAKER_00]: annual into, and it is just fully thick
with annual grasses and perennials,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's a great thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to manage those properly,
and so we do a lot of just stepping on the
[SPEAKER_00]: grass and just getting, what was that word
you used?
[SPEAKER_00]: Residue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The residue, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't know that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, making the residue, and so you're
prioritizing, you're pulling up annuals,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're chopping and dropping all of
your perennials to just create space for
[SPEAKER_00]: your annual, but we have a ton of potatoes
and onions and garlic in our system
[SPEAKER_00]: because everything's got to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a lot of rodents, we have a lot of
moles and voles and all of these things,
[SPEAKER_00]: and everything needs to eat, so we found
that potatoes in with the hemp has been a
[SPEAKER_00]: lifesaver.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come up and they create this great
canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The loving potato.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We love potatoes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, they're just delicious too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like they're everywhere, and it's
like, ooh, I'll take some of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Onions everywhere, so it's a fabulous way
to just think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mulch for us is grass and is material
that's grown ideally right in place.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do import a lot of rye straw and wood
chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: We run a lot of wood chips, and just to
squelch those springtime grasses to create
[SPEAKER_00]: space to plug your annuals in,
and as the summer extends, then those
[SPEAKER_00]: grasses become less prevalent,
and in the spring, you've got to do your
[SPEAKER_00]: due diligence to get those grasses down.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love it, and you're able to use fungi
and garden giants to eat those grasses,
[SPEAKER_03]: and that creates a filter, so all the
water that's coming over the ground is
[SPEAKER_03]: filtered through that system, and so
you're a positive impact on the
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dave, did you have something you wanted to
add to that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, our approach on a production foods
farm is we initially, in cannabis days or
[SPEAKER_05]: medical days, our first year, we would do
cannabis in a greenhouse and follow up the
[SPEAKER_05]: second year, and one thing about cannabis
versus a lot of other crops, it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: heavier feeding crop, so it's kind of once
it gets rolling, as most of you guys know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it kind of gets that feed me Seymour vibe,
and you can throw everything at it,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it's going to love it up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That being said, whatever your agriculture
practices are, if you're building your own
[SPEAKER_05]: fertility and having your own animals for
manure and doing green manures and
[SPEAKER_05]: composting, or you're bringing in
amendments and inputs, ideally regionally,
[SPEAKER_05]: if not locally, for ganja and cannabis and
hemp, it's all the same plant,
[SPEAKER_05]: obviously, we're really throwing
everything we have at it, so then year
[SPEAKER_05]: three and year four, where we initially
had those things, planting other food
[SPEAKER_05]: crops, we find we get really high yields,
really bountiful crops that are super
[SPEAKER_05]: healthy with zero additional inputs,
so Kelly talking about a lot of young
[SPEAKER_05]: folks just getting in the farming for the
first time, and cannabis bringing them in
[SPEAKER_05]: the farm, it's a really good first year
crop, and as most people know here,
[SPEAKER_05]: the whole philosophy behind crop rotation
is that different families of crops have
[SPEAKER_05]: different disease pressures, different
pest pressures, and uptake different
[SPEAKER_05]: nutrients from the soil, so the
monocropping system, where as far as you
[SPEAKER_05]: can see, having a crop growing year after
year, the same crop, eventually those
[SPEAKER_05]: depletions are going to lead to
imbalances, and that's where the heavy
[SPEAKER_05]: artillery of fungicides and fumigants and
insecticides come into play, but smaller
[SPEAKER_05]: scale, throw as much diversity as you can,
and just having this giant chessboard
[SPEAKER_05]: where you're playing a shell game with the
pests and diseases, cannabis is a really
[SPEAKER_05]: good first year crop to segue into other
food production, and we've had a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: success with it, that was kind of my lure
to get into hemp to begin with,
[SPEAKER_05]: and seeing that we could have kind of
bigger tracks for bigger other tracks down
[SPEAKER_05]: the road, and kind of have bigger squares
on our chessboard, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, one thing I wanted to add is
that with plastic mulching, we're really
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at monoculturing, like you all
were talking about, and polyculture is
[SPEAKER_01]: incredibly important right now as we're
looking at the hemp aphid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody who's growing hemp or anybody
who's growing cannabis is starting.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you haven't had this pest in your
garden, you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's coming for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's here to stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredibly healthy, and our cannabis
populations are feeding them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to be very vigilant in taking care
of them, and one way that we can do that,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it really is the only way to do that,
is through polyculture, is inviting in
[SPEAKER_01]: massive amounts of predators to take care
of those aphids.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're really delicious.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're soft.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're sweet.
[SPEAKER_01]: They taste like cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they're sucking our cannabis plants,
they're super nutritive, and there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: massive amount of predator bugs that live
on all of our pollinator plants that love
[SPEAKER_01]: to eat them up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wanted to move right into a big
question about hemp right now,
[SPEAKER_01]: and regenerative hemp, which seems to be
the really hot topic, is scaling.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's this conversation, and oh,
you can only scale this many acres and be
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative, or you can only scale this
many acres, or what do you all feel about
[SPEAKER_01]: what's scalable in your eyes for
regenerative hemp?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say, ultimately, if you can have
everything coming off your farm,
[SPEAKER_03]: that would be the ideal situation where a
portion of your farm was wild,
[SPEAKER_03]: a portion of your farm made hay,
a portion of your farm had weeds and grew
[SPEAKER_03]: nutrients for any teas you might need,
or different mulches, or maybe it's
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers for the pollinators.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my perfect scaled world, the farm is
part of an intact environment where
[SPEAKER_03]: there's trees around, there's birds flying
through, there's flowers happening,
[SPEAKER_03]: and in that, the hemp is thriving and it's
filtering the soil, and I think that can
[SPEAKER_03]: be done to put a number on it,
who knows, 10 to 20 acres or anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are some really good examples out
there of 700,000 acre plots where they're
[SPEAKER_03]: doing roller crimping stuff, and I think
that can be really beneficial.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think anyone who's trying to who's
enabling the environment to thrive while
[SPEAKER_03]: they're creating medicine, that's gonna be
beneficial, but I think in large scale
[SPEAKER_03]: production, we should probably do rows of
flowers through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We should figure out ways to do one row of
hemp and maybe berries through,
[SPEAKER_03]: or just alternate your crops throughout
the thing, because that diversity really
[SPEAKER_03]: is gonna help you with the hemp aphids,
and so that's what I'm thinking at the
[SPEAKER_03]: moment.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, for me, I feel like it has a lot to
do with your location.
[SPEAKER_05]: For example, the amount of tomatoes you
can grow in Quebec is not gonna be the
[SPEAKER_05]: same amount that you can grow in Southern
California.
[SPEAKER_05]: The eastern shelf of Colorado that's dry
is a lot more appropriate for scale,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I also think that the economy of scale
has everything to do with your experience
[SPEAKER_05]: and the crew that you're working with.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if you have a dream team crew of
experienced people that are working
[SPEAKER_05]: together for a long time, and you're
appropriately small scale mechanized,
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the sky can kind of be the limit,
as long as your same principles don't get
[SPEAKER_05]: compromised, the larger you get in size.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think one really good thing that
kind of tying the what is regenerative
[SPEAKER_05]: when it comes to scale, and what you were
saying about the planning ahead and the
[SPEAKER_05]: season ahead, I think a good mantra for
any business, and especially in farming,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially in cannabis farming,
one thing that I like to think of is the
[SPEAKER_05]: seven P's, if you haven't heard of this.
[SPEAKER_05]: The seven P's is proper planning and
preparation prevent piss poor performance.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, if you can have your seven P's in line
with your principles, I'm of the opinion
[SPEAKER_05]: that the sky is the limit, because really,
in shifting the paradigm for a utopia with
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of little micro farms over there,
and then the people that have the biggest
[SPEAKER_05]: impact, that are taking the most acreage
up, even if it's a watered down USDA
[SPEAKER_05]: version of organic versus what we think is
organic, these big players, that's that
[SPEAKER_05]: many less millions of barrels of shit that
they're putting in our environment and
[SPEAKER_05]: waterways every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, the balance of us finding new
solutions without alienating the bigger
[SPEAKER_05]: growers is part of the work we have to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: It might be.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just speaking to a colleague and
just our ability to convert farmers from
[SPEAKER_04]: heavily chemical glyphosate ridden parcels
to more conscious cultivation simply by
[SPEAKER_04]: shifting one crop in their lives.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'd be surprised at how quickly a corn
farmer will grow, will shift their crops,
[SPEAKER_04]: grow organically and without pesticides
simply because they're seeing the market
[SPEAKER_04]: value of this crop.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I think the conversion rate is super
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we're talking 285,000 acres that
were licensed this year, up from 78,000
[SPEAKER_04]: last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, when we start talking about
regeneration, we need to start really
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about carbon sequestration and the
lack thereof in the way that we're farming
[SPEAKER_04]: this reductionist style cannabinoid
paradigm which is not the way our
[SPEAKER_04]: forefathers and our ancestors thought
about hemp.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, when we're talking about asexual
propagation, feminization, however it's
[SPEAKER_04]: done, I think no matter what we're playing
God in a certain way and when we start to
[SPEAKER_04]: create these single lines of revenue,
that alone I think begs the question of
[SPEAKER_04]: really how can we get to the end points
that are on both sides of me here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think regeneration is a process.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have so many lifetimes of work
to do that if we ever get satisfied or
[SPEAKER_04]: comfortable with how regenerative we are,
I think we're fucked.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the reality is that we need to
keep pushing the edge, keep pushing
[SPEAKER_04]: ourselves forward and modeling people like
this to look to examples and solutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Scale is the name of the game.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, we can't keep up with the good
intentions and the conscious farming.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't keep up with the scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm talking 13 passes a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine 13 plus, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, on conventional farms,
it's to a point where to keep it simple,
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we just have to ask ourselves how
much carbon are we really sequestering,
[SPEAKER_04]: period, and then go from there,
start reverse engineering it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But perennialized systems, true industrial
hemp for fiber food, fuel, oil,
[SPEAKER_04]: that's I think what's going to really push
everyone to a more regenerative 25,000
[SPEAKER_04]: uses for this plant, which is not what
we're doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well said, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scale's a really tricky one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on your end goal and like Dave
said, your location, super important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I watched a balloon absolutely deflate
around us in southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was hard to watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Scale is a super tricky one.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the sky's the limit, that's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to really step back and
understand what our needs are from this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant and utilize its potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has so much great potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp has this unbelievable ability to,
and if we're going to grow it in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Emerald Triangle, and we're going to
service a huge portion of the world,
[SPEAKER_00]: then it could be really intensive on our
watersheds and our topsoil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we're growing an annual on plastic
mulch and we're not remineralizing the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil in a proper manner, it's going to be
bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have to really think about what
we're doing here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beautiful thing about Kelly said,
all these young people are not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: young, but just we have a new seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a new ability to take a great,
we have a great opportunity in front of
[SPEAKER_00]: us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, where are we going to go
with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally, where are we going with
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a chance to be very cognizant of
our impacts, or we could just be profit
[SPEAKER_00]: mongers and just keep planting way more
than we have any idea what we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not necessarily that's what happened,
but there was portions of that that
[SPEAKER_00]: happened, and people really got humbled
this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that we all just can be
transparent with each other and
[SPEAKER_00]: communicate and be honest with what our
scale really needs to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have anywhere to put it,
you probably shouldn't grow it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, it's kind of common sense
stuff, but it's very exciting to get into
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very exciting to get into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great opportunity, but like,
and just because your neighbors run in
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch doesn't mean you have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's communicate and let's just be
honest with what we need from this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's definitely a balance and we're
teetering, so we need to be careful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I think it's really interesting
that, you know, we don't have an idea of
[SPEAKER_01]: what successful scaling is because
anything in our recent history has not
[SPEAKER_01]: shown successful scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, big agriculture, the way that it
is right now is not successfully scaling
[SPEAKER_01]: anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: The food is becoming depleted,
our waterways, you know, all the things
[SPEAKER_01]: that we know about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing that I was thinking is
that as far as scaling goes, I really like
[SPEAKER_01]: the idea of many farmers, big land,
you know, one farmer, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: 15, 25 acres and a whole lot of collective
people working together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a model that I think could
really keep intact integrative systems
[SPEAKER_01]: that are, you know, more diverse with
nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next question that I wanted to ask you
all, and we really don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: time, and this is such a hot topic that I
feel like it actually could be another
[SPEAKER_01]: hour to two hours, which is seed
feminization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now hemp has forced us to look at,
you know, when we talk about scale,
[SPEAKER_01]: feminizing seeds, and there's people feel
a lot of different ways about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought I wanted to bring it up to
you all.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have much time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe we could give some food for
thought or even ask a question if we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: have answers to this.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I know about it is that silver
theosulfate is one of the common compounds
[SPEAKER_03]: used to make feminized seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is a toxic compound.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if overused, can get into the
waterways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that in our farming,
what we do with the peer certification and
[SPEAKER_03]: all the farms that we work with is we just
don't want to support through our actions
[SPEAKER_03]: any use of any harm.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't want to use harmful compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if that's going to be a harmful
compound, we don't want to use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feminization really isn't a regenerative
practice because it's feminized.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's not something you can breed
with to move forward.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that part right there, you know,
genetically may not be the best thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But efficiency wise, in a field setting,
I think feminization can make a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is a way of stabilizing genetics for
medicine, which is ultimately going out to
[SPEAKER_03]: the betterment of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really important to us.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the Dragonfly Earth Medicine peer
certification, we had an amazing gathering
[SPEAKER_03]: at the Heartwood Sanctuary this last
weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are working on putting together
some guidelines on what we think is
[SPEAKER_03]: regenerative for hemp and feminized seed
as part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the things we talked about was
if we did use feminized seed on our land,
[SPEAKER_03]: that maybe we still kept a portion of our
land for regular seed breeding.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that regular seed breeding and having,
you know, the ability to breed is really,
[SPEAKER_03]: really important for our future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with the laws changing, which is a
whole other hour and another subject with,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, how do we even plan for hemp in
the future when we don't know what the
[SPEAKER_03]: government's going to do in another six
months?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also there's a ratio of CBD and THC
that with these new laws changes
[SPEAKER_03]: everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But seeds is really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Important to consider.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just we've come up, you know,
with the concept of the seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't come up with the concept,
but we resonate with the concept of seven
[SPEAKER_03]: generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, if you're going to use
feminized seeds, you should maybe offset
[SPEAKER_03]: it some other way.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I think seed breeding in general is
a hot topic because on the ganja scene,
[SPEAKER_05]: if it doesn't fill up the whole room when
you crack the jar and test over 25
[SPEAKER_05]: percent, you toss it.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're quickly becoming like the Amish
with our whole gene pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's going to be a slippery slope in
the hemp game as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same time, hemp's in its infant
stage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And any farmer or any business,
you know, getting on the board and just
[SPEAKER_05]: even the very basics of making ends meet
and being able to continue to do what
[SPEAKER_05]: you're doing, as your systems improve,
then it's every farmer's or every person's
[SPEAKER_05]: responsibility to keep paring it down and
keep getting better at it with less input.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think it's too early and the jury's
still out on the feminized hemp seed game.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that as the as the industry
evolves and breeding evolves because
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis and all ganja, cannabis hemp,
it's all in its infant stage as far as
[SPEAKER_05]: stable F1s across the board.
[SPEAKER_05]: So as it unfolds, we'll learn.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think it's too early to say you can
do this and you can't do that because it's
[SPEAKER_05]: hard enough to just get out on the field
as it is right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Quick flashback.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, feminized seeds in general in the
hemp industry are a relatively new thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the reality is we've seen it
as one of the unique tools to scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think if we start looking at the way
for personal heroes of mine, such as Mark
[SPEAKER_04]: Shepard, Eric Tones, Myer, Darren Doherty,
I think if we ask them if feminized seeds
[SPEAKER_04]: could fit into regenerative agriculture,
I mean, I'd venture to say they probably
[SPEAKER_04]: would just start laughing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I think in general, is feminization
something that we find in nature?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't exactly point to a place.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in terms of the ethylene
blockers that are used to achieve
[SPEAKER_04]: feminization, they're about a 11 known
ethylene blockers.
[SPEAKER_04]: The one that Josh was talking about,
the MSDS is 24,000 milliliters per liter
[SPEAKER_04]: for it to be, quote unquote, toxic to the
environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the levels to which people are
applying these compounds to me is second
[SPEAKER_04]: to whether they're using them or not,
using feminization as sort of a leverage
[SPEAKER_04]: point to regeneration or, you know,
if they're able to do things without
[SPEAKER_04]: feminization.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, if I can grow crops without
that kind of technology, that's my
[SPEAKER_04]: preference.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for farmers that, you know,
have a desire, a need, an ability to
[SPEAKER_04]: scale, it's been really the solution for
acreage 10, 20, 40 acres and above.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I hope to see feminization become a
safer process, but I think anything,
[SPEAKER_04]: anything to keep CRISPR-TEC, SIRTEC,
any of these genetic editing and genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: modifying technologies out of these gene
pools is, to me, first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's something systemically
uncomfortable for me about the fact that I
[SPEAKER_00]: save seed from every other thing on my
farm, but every year we have to buy new
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp seed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just the climate that we're in
and, you know, it's brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all moving forward and we have great
momentum in an awesome direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at this point, there's something
uncomfortable about that portion of it for
[SPEAKER_00]: me.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that we have so many good minds
and so many good hearts putting energy in
[SPEAKER_00]: really good directions that I'm confident
that there is a future for us growing
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to make it like one sixth of
what I think about and I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: diversify my farm and diversify my
financial landscape because it could just
[SPEAKER_00]: go like that and then all of a sudden it's
no longer not necessarily viable,
[SPEAKER_00]: but just hard to prioritize.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm excited that we're all pooling
together and we just we need to continue
[SPEAKER_00]: to unify and use our resources and just
keep moving in the right direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would add, ultimately, you know,
using male and female regular seeds is the
[SPEAKER_03]: ultimate goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are field test kits that farmers
can get and it does make sense to start,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, all your male and female,
you know, regular seeds and then sex test
[SPEAKER_03]: all of them and do and then in that you
can do a mega pheno hunt.
[SPEAKER_03]: And really in hemp has shown us CBD is the
talk right now, but CBG has been grown
[SPEAKER_03]: this year and maybe it's CBDV next year
and THCV that the hemp has the ability to
[SPEAKER_03]: harbor cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then that, you know, brings on the
subject of hemp as industrial hemp or hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: as cannabinoid hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a further discussion,
another hour discussion.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, you know, cannabinoid hemp is what
we're really interested in because of the
[SPEAKER_03]: medicinal qualities on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we really also need to really promote
and embrace fiber hemp and seed hemp and
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp seed as a food is a phenomenal thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And being able to create hempcrete and
plastics and even biofuels from hemp is
[SPEAKER_03]: something that is extremely important to
us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really have an issue with clear
cutting and logging and the mindless
[SPEAKER_03]: devastation of the forest.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we can grow hemp for fiber to replace
cellulose on the market, I want to go
[SPEAKER_03]: crazy over certain things, you know,
and that's one of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, let's figure out ways to
have hemp farming work together.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't think that fiber and an
industrial hemp needs to be grown maybe in
[SPEAKER_03]: the same places that medicinal hemp is
grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a community, maybe we can create
maps for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, is there any questions in the audience
that we had?
[SPEAKER_03]: I know we don't have time, but is there
any other quick questions anyone had
[SPEAKER_03]: really quickly here?
[SPEAKER_02]: And the necessary cultivation resulting
without its use, subsurface drip,
[SPEAKER_02]: what do you guys know of that use for
hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you catch that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you repeat the question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Subsurface drip systems for hemp,
which would help alleviate... Yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm relatively familiar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it doesn't work, I mean, doesn't
function as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I got a friend in Greeley, Colorado that
did 68 acres.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there were seven zones,
all sub-irrigation using Netafim.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a company that, you know,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, the logic, the technology,
if you can afford the 3,500 bucks an acre,
[SPEAKER_04]: whatever it is to set it up, I mean,
he's seen incredible success with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It allows for the plant to achieve really
the same successes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, the idea is that they bury large
pipes of sub-irrigation with irrigated
[SPEAKER_04]: piping under the ground, and then the
plants can go down, fetch the water
[SPEAKER_04]: through capillary action, it will rise.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it mitigates the weed pressure in a
way because there isn't top down watering.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, for example, one of the big problems
with pivots is that you're watering your
[SPEAKER_04]: weeds just as much as you're watering your
hemp, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So, if you're working with sub-irrigation,
you're not giving the competitive
[SPEAKER_04]: advantage that weeds might have if they
were, you know, if they had access to the
[SPEAKER_04]: abundant amount of water.
[SPEAKER_04]: That said, it's a very mechanized farm,
certified organic, three people harvest 68
[SPEAKER_04]: acres.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, it's not exactly your model for
regeneration or necessarily that paradigm,
[SPEAKER_04]: but yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one other thing, as far as on no
plastic film, to understand that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: still a lot of fossil fuel input for
cultivation of an acre and the continued
[SPEAKER_02]: tractor work that's needed and additional
people.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, the energy embedded needs to be looked
at as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hallelujah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just, you know, we can do away with a lot
of sub-irrigation if we are properly doing
[SPEAKER_01]: mulching and we're properly doing cover
crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can really, and even tractor work,
all of that can be really mitigated by,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, using more natural systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, we're going to have to wrap
it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really thank you all for coming out
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an incredibly important topic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've barely even scratched the surface on
a multitude of issues that need to be
[SPEAKER_01]: discussed in hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like Josh was saying earlier,
this is cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, you know, an important plant
that's here to save the planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's here to save communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the more that we have
these community discussions and the more
[SPEAKER_01]: that we work together, as communities,
is the more that we can bring up the
[SPEAKER_01]: evolution of this plant and the evolution
of our own species as humans on the
[SPEAKER_01]: planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you all so much for being here
today.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
