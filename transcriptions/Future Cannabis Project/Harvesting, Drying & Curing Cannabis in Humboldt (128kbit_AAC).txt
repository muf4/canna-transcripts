[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into, you know, traditional
methods, especially for us that are more
[SPEAKER_00]: fans of outdoor grow in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing against the perpetual crops coming
out of indoor grows in Canada and Colorado
[SPEAKER_00]: and everywhere else, but this is croptober
as we grew up knowing it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is when everything starts popping
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where are you at and where are the
folks you work with as far as you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to cure from bringing down the
crops?
[SPEAKER_02]: Biggest challenge of the year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, especially when you're having a
really good year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And actually, we're having really good
weather.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the rains haven't really hit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've had like one, maybe two rains.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to probably have good weather
to October, which means more plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: more yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the hardest issues,
especially when people are plotting new
[SPEAKER_02]: grows and I'm going to grow 24,000 square
foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you got to really make sure you know
where you're going to hang and dry and
[SPEAKER_02]: cure all that properly or you're going to
be devastated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I've been doing this a long time and
I'm almost on semi devastation mode
[SPEAKER_02]: because we've expanded and the way
Humboldt County has done it is we can't
[SPEAKER_02]: get any building permits until my final
cannabis permit is issued.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just got one last month, so it's almost
like I can't get a building up right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have one that's going to get
approved November 1st.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm having to make do with the space I
have.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're trying to put 1500 pounds of
weed into a 1600 square foot building,
[SPEAKER_02]: it is an extreme challenge of balancing
the quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to rush cure anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're having more humid days,
foggy mornings, what I'm trying to get at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's more humidity in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're middle of the year, we can even
dry outside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Light depths, you can hang those in a
shaded forest and it's going to be great
[SPEAKER_02]: quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you come into October, you got too
much humidity, too much moisture,
[SPEAKER_02]: the temperatures are dropped, you're
hitting mid 40s at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to have a controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about the marine layer and
it's the outdoor grower's biggest friend,
[SPEAKER_00]: yet the biggest enemy, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's one thing that people don't
understand is I travel internationally for
[SPEAKER_00]: work and most are familiar with the
Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mendocino has built a great brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt is now building a great brand as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trinity will probably come around.
[SPEAKER_00]: But people don't understand it's not just
the location, the locale and the altitude,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it is that marine layer that makes
this perfect deco, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It really factors into the phenotype,
beyond the genotype of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to your point, yeah, it's tough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was sharing earlier, we were talking to
a guy who's got 325 acres, but he's
[SPEAKER_00]: growing 11 acres right now and he's like,
I don't have a place to put 11 acres for
[SPEAKER_00]: drying.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I'm trying to find land sea
containers, but even then only one side
[SPEAKER_00]: has doors, so I'm not getting the proper
ventilation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people don't recognize that you guys
have this epidemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more successful you are, the more
yield, the more places you need to hang.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're hanging on anything that sits
still, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I try to avoid the cargo containers
because unless you customize them,
[SPEAKER_02]: they just sweat.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have problems.
[SPEAKER_02]: But getting refrigerated cargo containers
to fresh frozen and just lining up them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to get in that mode of
containers showing up this week and next
[SPEAKER_02]: week and getting as a refrigeration of
product, fresh frozen, finding outlets for
[SPEAKER_02]: that material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And basically just trying to cycle
through.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big part of early, when you have
limitations on harvesting and curing,
[SPEAKER_02]: strain allotment is a huge thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if I know I have a seven week strain,
an eight week strain, a nine week strain,
[SPEAKER_02]: I know I can have some balance.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can cycle through the earlier stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you grow all the same thing that's
going to be harvested at the same time,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to screw yourself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So working with all the parameters,
I guess you just get used to it over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so focus on, all right, I got a seven
week, an eight week, a nine week,
[SPEAKER_02]: a 10 week.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll be able to funnel in and
transition out and keep the trimmers busy
[SPEAKER_02]: and keep the whole processing flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it moving, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep it moving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can't rush some of that stuff,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can't rush the flush on the
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to pace it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't rush the dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously you want to spend time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a little more room to work with
on the cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to your point, you're getting into the
space and the human capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we have enough people that are ready to
trim as soon as I'm done with the cure?
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of logistical issues that can come
about, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in general for a longer cure
on a larger scale production is keeping
[SPEAKER_02]: the plant intact as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even when it's dried, there's something
about being on the stalk and the stem that
[SPEAKER_02]: just really preserves the quality of the
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you de-stem it, that's when you
start to lose your oxidation, degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were over at, I won't say which LP,
but at an LP in Israel in Tel Aviv.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was looking at how they were
modeling their dry and cure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they weren't bucking.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were literally pulling every single
bud off and putting them on these racks
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you could replace those buds
with little bite size of cookies,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, have you guys read any books on
how to do this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know it sounds old school and
retro about snapping stems to let people
[SPEAKER_00]: know when it's ready to go to cure from
dry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these people have been doing it for
decades and they've mastered this craft.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to kind of take a page from
what's happening in Northern California,
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're describing, because again,
it might seem efficient to get it down to
[SPEAKER_00]: bud as quick as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with wet trimming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your product's just going to degrade that
much faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, no matter, even if you use a
Boveda pack, I mean, if you get it off
[SPEAKER_02]: that stalk and stem, sooner than it needs
to be, then you're shortening the lifespan
[SPEAKER_02]: of that product.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we try to tell people.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same thing I tell people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about some of these big shows,
MJ Biz.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I kind of came up with the
term from cure to consumption.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trying to explain to people,
we can come in and help you fine tune the
[SPEAKER_00]: cure and store for long term all the way
up to retail, maintain the quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: maintain the weight, which is important
for growers so you aren't overfilling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Especially now that you have the variance
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole other topic, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easy to lose weight just in moving
around from NorCal to SoCal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can lose grams of weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to explain to people too.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, well, for us, we have 58,
62.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, well, I'm like, well,
it's a bit of personal preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're a traditionalist like me,
you roll up, 58% is perfect on the grind.
[SPEAKER_00]: 62 is better for your G pen, your dryer
vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I said also, if you're south of Santa
Barbara, the desert, LA is a desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just pointed out, it's so arid,
it's so dry, even though we're next to the
[SPEAKER_00]: ocean compared to Northern California.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Northern California, you have this
great humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have this perfect balance of sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it changes from up there to down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh no, it's still California.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, that's just the name of the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be two different states,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even if it's sealed, it's still not
foolproof.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some control factor in there is definitely
helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's right.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
