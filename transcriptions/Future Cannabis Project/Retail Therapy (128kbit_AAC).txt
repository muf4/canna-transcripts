[SPEAKER_04]: We're in a time where brands are talking
about like we're positioning ourselves for
[SPEAKER_04]: the future and to me what that means is
brands have raised a ton of money and are
[SPEAKER_04]: going after market share and kind of
thinking of the long term but the short
[SPEAKER_04]: term that's not a very profitable strategy
and it has consequences to you know
[SPEAKER_04]: smaller brands that haven't raised a ton
of money and so I kind of wanted to take a
[SPEAKER_04]: snapshot in time you know September 2019
kind of what are the dynamics between
[SPEAKER_04]: brands and retailers and what are you
seeing from your specific vantage point in
[SPEAKER_04]: the industry so we have a retailer we have
a SoCal dominant brand but NorCal not so
[SPEAKER_04]: dominant we have a small scrappy NorCal
Kraft sun-grown cannabis brand we have a
[SPEAKER_04]: small scrappy SoCal distributor so kind of
I wanted to just start by each of you kind
[SPEAKER_04]: of talking about what you're seeing in
that relationship between the limited
[SPEAKER_04]: retail shelf space and the thousands of
brands fighting for that shelf space so
[SPEAKER_04]: Mike Voss from VCC brands why don't you
kick it off?
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Mike I'm with the Venice Cookie
Company we are a legacy brand we are based
[SPEAKER_02]: out of Southern California been in
business for about the past 11 years and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're facing tough times just like
everybody else since regulation and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's many different facets of what's
going on right now and I think a few of
[SPEAKER_02]: them could point fingers towards hey
retailers are making it tough on us
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations making it tough on us
everything that's happening with the
[SPEAKER_02]: industry is a rocky motion right now and I
think the people who are going to
[SPEAKER_02]: persevere through this are the people who
are really here and passionate about what
[SPEAKER_02]: they're doing right new folks coming into
the industry who might not necessarily
[SPEAKER_02]: have a story but might see the green of
money might not last right and I think it
[SPEAKER_04]: really comes down to passion and Eric
Pearson retail operator Bay Area and
[SPEAKER_03]: Sonoma with I couldn't agree more and I
think it equates to patience right now
[SPEAKER_03]: there's a mad dash with a lot of capital
to make a lot of money and to build a
[SPEAKER_03]: brand that's going to be sticky with
consumers and to do that when everybody's
[SPEAKER_03]: doing that you have to burn a lot of cash
and that's only sustainable for a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: amount of time I think there's too much
uncertainty in the industry as it relates
[SPEAKER_03]: to regulation expansion is not as easy as
it is with technology I think I use this
[SPEAKER_03]: analogy a lot of the times the investors
in Canada and the early investors in
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis sort of equated this new industry
with the dot-com or technology that came
[SPEAKER_03]: along and they kind of thought well this
is something that's explosive and
[SPEAKER_03]: therefore we should invest because the
returns are going to be huge and then they
[SPEAKER_03]: realized that okay you have to get a
permit to build the greenhouse and you
[SPEAKER_03]: have to grow the cannabis and the cannabis
first crop doesn't do so well and then oh
[SPEAKER_03]: shoot the jars aren't here from China and
we have to get a truck the retailers don't
[SPEAKER_03]: have a license and so it takes a whole lot
longer than investors wanted it to and so
[SPEAKER_03]: you have this massive amount of cash
coming into this economy and here in
[SPEAKER_03]: California that's the state to take and
everybody's competing for that shelf space
[SPEAKER_03]: so you're selling your company if you're
if you're running that race and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to be the biggest and the best
right now you're giving up a major part of
[SPEAKER_03]: your company and the more you give away
the less interested you are and continuing
[SPEAKER_03]: to run that company so having a love and a
passion for what you're doing and spending
[SPEAKER_03]: the amount of time that it's taken to get
this far 11 years I've been his cookie
[SPEAKER_03]: company's been here and just chatting
about it and I've been up you know in here
[SPEAKER_03]: since 98 so taking a step back you know
looking and realizing that this is just a
[SPEAKER_03]: moment in time and things will money will
be lost and investors will go away and
[SPEAKER_03]: things will settle down and those who have
brands that are authentic and teams that
[SPEAKER_03]: are in it for the long run they'll they'll
come out winners patience
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been cultivating for about 10 years
in Sonoma County we launched our tincture
[SPEAKER_00]: brand fiddlers greens about four years ago
we've taken a little bit different
[SPEAKER_00]: approach from a lot of the brands who had
an idea and one raised a ton of money and
[SPEAKER_00]: expected to just have tons of funds coming
in we actually have been focused on
[SPEAKER_00]: building infrastructure and relationships
and had got the first cultivation permit
[SPEAKER_00]: in Sonoma County and have manufacturing
and distro and have just finished with our
[SPEAKER_00]: upgrades to our facility and so now we're
really looking to launch as the industry's
[SPEAKER_00]: going I think we've been fortunate because
we started small as prop 64 went into play
[SPEAKER_00]: and so we're actually growing as the
licensed stores are growing so we're just
[SPEAKER_00]: we're ready to take off as soon as they
start issuing some damn retail licenses
[SPEAKER_04]: and Omar is so Cal distribution wrapping a
bunch of brands real quick I'm just out of
[SPEAKER_01]: curiosity so I know like who's in the
house how many people here are cultivators
[SPEAKER_01]: and manufacturers distributors retailers
how many people yeah how many laughs thank
[SPEAKER_01]: you labs um I'm just kind of curious I
guess we have a little bit of everyone
[SPEAKER_01]: here and for those of us that have been
around for more than a year um I mean we
[SPEAKER_01]: all have different perspectives but you go
through a lot you know we have the joke of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis years like dog years and we all
know what that means um yeah I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like a really interesting time it's nuts
it's chaotic it changes constantly I have
[SPEAKER_01]: learned that I don't know what's gonna
happen next I mean I've seen the tables
[SPEAKER_01]: turn time and time again I've seen the
people on top fall to the bottom I've seen
[SPEAKER_01]: like you know the the crowning of you know
who's on top of the hill change and I
[SPEAKER_04]: think that it's all up for grabs it's give
us an example of someone who is on top
[SPEAKER_01]: like three or four years um wow there's
there's actually a lot and I try to
[SPEAKER_01]: refrain from like really talking about
other brands too much especially when it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like who was on top and now they're not
that's not you know I'd rather big someone
[SPEAKER_01]: up but I would say that it's extremely
competitive and I think that there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: number of ways to compete and I like this
panel it's cool because I think we're all
[SPEAKER_01]: like kind of the scrappers as you almost
introduced us as and I think that those
[SPEAKER_01]: people have an advantage like I you know
there's an advantage to everything if you
[SPEAKER_01]: if you have huge capital there's great
advantages to that right like you have a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem throw money at it you can know it
potentially overcome it and there's a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of people that can't compete with that but
what those brands can't compete with is
[SPEAKER_01]: the ground-up approach which I've always
been a fan of and I think the people that
[SPEAKER_01]: are kind of grassroots that have a true
passion for this that have paid some dues
[SPEAKER_01]: that have kind of worked and paved their
own way forward we have a great advantage
[SPEAKER_01]: because we went through it we know things
firsthand and we actually know things
[SPEAKER_01]: we're not just speculating from you know
Instagram blog posts that we've read and
[SPEAKER_01]: whatnot and I think that those people that
have a lot of money but are coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: outside are often and we see this again
left and right but we see these people
[SPEAKER_01]: like leaking money like crazy and if
they're backed enough then then maybe they
[SPEAKER_01]: can sustain and pull through but um yeah I
mean it's there's a number of ways to
[SPEAKER_01]: compete I think you need to have the full
package to be honest I think you need
[SPEAKER_01]: first and foremost we look at people who's
running the company who's behind it you
[SPEAKER_01]: know you have to have good products need a
story I think and I think one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: hardest parts and I'm in distribution so
I'm biased but I think that the sales and
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution may be the hardest piece of
it all for the people out there on the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground level like pounding the pavement
knocking on doors and and the thing is is
[SPEAKER_01]: getting into the shops is relatively easy
I mean it's it no it's relative to the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of the journey right it's extremely
difficult everyone's laughing because if
[SPEAKER_01]: you've ever tried to get into a cannabis
store it's extremely fucking difficult but
[SPEAKER_01]: that's the easy part the more difficult
part is building that brand and and sell
[SPEAKER_01]: through and seeing those reorders and then
if you're a distributor like we are I
[SPEAKER_01]: talked from that perspective we kind of
are extremely selective with the brands
[SPEAKER_01]: that we align ourselves with and we
represent them like there are own and I
[SPEAKER_01]: think that's a mostly that's mostly a
weakness for most distributors from the
[SPEAKER_01]: feedback that I hear I think that most
distributors are not out there repping
[SPEAKER_01]: your brands if you're a brand owner the
way you would right and and I think so
[SPEAKER_01]: that's a that's our strategy our strategy
is to kind of keep a relatively small menu
[SPEAKER_01]: of brands that we're passionate about so
going back to what was said before and
[SPEAKER_01]: just really repping it like it's our own
and we pour our heart into it we try to
[SPEAKER_01]: make good decisions and we work with good
people and that you know that has helped
[SPEAKER_01]: us survive this long and we'll see what
happens next well so getting back to the
[SPEAKER_04]: fact that you're all kind of small and
bootstrapping for me a concrete example
[SPEAKER_04]: like in LA I went to visit a bunch of
dispensaries a couple weekends ago and I
[SPEAKER_04]: went into erba down on pico and basically
they have a lot of shopping shop where
[SPEAKER_04]: it's almost like you know going into the
bloomingdale's perfume and beauty section
[SPEAKER_04]: where each brand has you know they're
renting space they're paying their own
[SPEAKER_04]: employees to show up so when I went in
there you know then I left and I looked at
[SPEAKER_04]: their Yelp reviews and kind of the common
commentary was I this is from consumers I
[SPEAKER_04]: went into this dispensary and I wanted a
pre-roll and I walked down and everybody's
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to sell me something that's not
because it's basically all these brands so
[SPEAKER_04]: if I'm a vape pen brand I don't care about
pre-rolls I care about vape pens and I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna try to sell you my products and when
I find out that you don't have an interest
[SPEAKER_04]: in the vape pen you want a pre-roll I lose
complete the consumer like the people
[SPEAKER_04]: writing the Yelp reviews are like they
just lost total interest in me or they
[SPEAKER_04]: were still trying to push the thing I told
them I'm not interested in like because
[SPEAKER_04]: that's what they're trying to sell so from
an end consumer standpoint kind of some of
[SPEAKER_04]: the models that are emerging are like
they're turning people off and then how do
[SPEAKER_04]: you compete against that those brands that
can afford to hire a full-time employee to
[SPEAKER_04]: go into multiple LA shops multiple Bay
Area shops wherever you can't do that yeah
[SPEAKER_00]: we definitely can't do that I mean our our
core product is tinctures and topicals
[SPEAKER_00]: which is I think like one or two percent
of the total sales we've only we've
[SPEAKER_00]: actually because most of our patients are
customers are medical patients we haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: had a lot of pressure from retailers about
buying shelf space but the handful of
[SPEAKER_00]: people that have reached out to us they've
wanted more in shelves for shelf space
[SPEAKER_00]: than they do in revenue for us each month
and obviously that's not a sustainable
[SPEAKER_04]: business model but companies that are
well-financed are actually doing that oh
[SPEAKER_04]: absolutely you know we've none of you will
name names you're at least acknowledging
[SPEAKER_02]: that this is happening oh yeah absolutely
this is definitely happening and I mean we
[SPEAKER_02]: are seeing the exact same thing as you
guys it's it's not a sustainable option
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not a sustainable way of doing
business you know Venice cookie company
[SPEAKER_02]: has been in business for the past 11 years
off of our own dime just recently we've
[SPEAKER_02]: gained some investors which is fabulous
but the shelving space right we're being
[SPEAKER_02]: asked for $2,000 a month and when it comes
to edibles the average ticket is $2,000 a
[SPEAKER_02]: month right so why am I gonna give a
retailer $2,000 a month when I'm not gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: be able to sell them that much it just
doesn't make good business sense for us
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah no we're in this same boat and we're
pushing back on those folks and we're like
[SPEAKER_00]: we'll go across the street and we'll deal
with the dispensary that wants to support
[SPEAKER_00]: local brands it wants to support legacy
operators and we're gonna send all of our
[SPEAKER_04]: customers to that shop but so between the
three of you what percentage of shops that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're trying to get into or like if you
pay us a little bit of money it's a pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say it's trending up and it
depends on the territory different
[SPEAKER_01]: territories are some are more likely to do
that it's it's almost like cultural so
[SPEAKER_01]: depending on the territory I think you see
a little bit more of that in the valley
[SPEAKER_01]: interestingly enough and I would say it's
it's still I don't know I would say it's
[SPEAKER_01]: 20% under 20% of shops maybe but it's it's
not very few I mean there's a lot of them
[SPEAKER_01]: charging for sell shelf space and some of
them like erba you know just to get back
[SPEAKER_01]: to that um no no I mean yeah I look I'm
not we said we do business with erba right
[SPEAKER_01]: and we've done business with erba for a
long time we've never paid for shelf space
[SPEAKER_01]: um now we're not gonna have the same
presence there as other brands um so but
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's a store that will allow if they
believe in your product they'll carry you
[SPEAKER_01]: um so you're gonna have to out hustle
everyone and that's kind of the theme that
[SPEAKER_01]: we kind of live by is just out hustle
everyone to make things happen so to give
[SPEAKER_01]: like a current example our our main brand
right now is Tikkun Olam which is a very
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal brand it's an Israeli brand so a
pretty technical brand as far as like
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis brands go it's probably the most
technical and so we dedicate a lot of time
[SPEAKER_01]: to train the staff and and stoke them and
that's part of what we do for all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: brands is like make personal connections
with everyone um get them to understand
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever it is the brand's story is in
this case there's a lot of information
[SPEAKER_01]: that we can educate them with but
sometimes it's just a lifestyle and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like a vibe and but if you can translate
that vibe and you can really touch you
[SPEAKER_01]: know those those staff the bud tenders and
whatnot um and stoke them out you know it
[SPEAKER_01]: helps when you have some swag or whatever
but those are all ways to play the game
[SPEAKER_01]: without playing paying for shelving
shelving space in certain stores um other
[SPEAKER_01]: stores yeah some of them charge of a
serious ticket two three grand sometimes
[SPEAKER_01]: more um just to play just to get in the
store and sometimes it doesn't make sense
[SPEAKER_01]: and for us the strategy 95 percent of the
time is we don't pay for shelf space um
[SPEAKER_01]: some of it has to do with us or our brands
more often than us um but yeah we try to
[SPEAKER_01]: add value and try to you know just present
the value of the brand and why it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: value to them and their customers and if
they don't see that then we don't have a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem keeping it moving and like you
said work with whoever's next door and and
[SPEAKER_04]: pump it through there and um yeah how
about things like trade samples and you
[SPEAKER_04]: know introducing your brands all the but i
mean things you could do a couple years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago where you're introducing the brand to
all the bud tenders and giving them
[SPEAKER_04]: samples and letting them appreciate what
you do which is a little more costly now
[SPEAKER_00]: we're still trying to do that i think it's
very important for folks that are
[SPEAKER_00]: representing our brand to have used it to
understand it our distribution model is
[SPEAKER_00]: also very education based and so before a
dispensary gets our gets the first
[SPEAKER_00]: delivery from us we have one of our
account managers come in and do a bud
[SPEAKER_00]: tender training they talk to them about
acidic cannabinoids they talk to them
[SPEAKER_00]: about what cvd is good for what thc is
good for so that it's not just a
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation of oh yeah i've got this you
know dab that's 99 percent thc because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not our customer our customer is
sick you know sick children you know
[SPEAKER_00]: parents who have kids with epilepsy it's
grandparents who have arthritis and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that and so the education side of
it's super important to us being on shelf
[SPEAKER_00]: space and having educated bud tenders who
represent us in a way that communicates
[SPEAKER_00]: our message and what we're trying to do i
think getting samples out into buyers
[SPEAKER_02]: hands is extremely important and we've
transitioned from outside crews bringing
[SPEAKER_02]: in samples to manifesting and drivers
delivering those samples and i think it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to evolve even more into here is our
non-activated product give this
[SPEAKER_02]: non-activated product a try it tastes just
like our activated product right
[SPEAKER_02]: especially when it comes to edibles is not
for joints right it doesn't it doesn't
[SPEAKER_02]: work for everyone for flowers and extract
that doesn't work for edibles that were it
[SPEAKER_01]: works perfectly if you're pushing a brand
getting that brand to engage with the
[SPEAKER_01]: staff whether it's the buyer or the bud
tenders anyone you can get with that's
[SPEAKER_01]: critical it's critical it's critical that
you engage with them that they can try the
[SPEAKER_01]: product because they're so much more
likely to sell it if they've tried it it's
[SPEAKER_01]: worth every penny i personally am a huge
fan of investing in the store i you know
[SPEAKER_01]: shelf space i don't think has the best
return on investment but i think investing
[SPEAKER_01]: in the store in terms of samples of
hooking them up with swag of your time and
[SPEAKER_01]: effort the training the demos and just
stopping by being there in person i again
[SPEAKER_01]: coming from a district i think the brands
are better at representing themselves and
[SPEAKER_01]: doing the the work that i think like it
takes to get through to stores and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually promote their brand than most
distributors and that's just going by most
[SPEAKER_01]: of what i hear you guys maybe have had
other experiences but spending time in
[SPEAKER_01]: person in those stores whether it's with a
sample or a piece of swag or it's just
[SPEAKER_01]: your time you just i mean people
appreciate people also connect with people
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you take the time to hear someone
out and and you're not just there to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of like some kind of quickie in and out
thing then you're going to build a
[SPEAKER_01]: relationship they're going to like you
they're going to get to know the brand and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to be more likely to support
the brand so i can't agree with you more i
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's it's all about a partnership
and that's what i preach to everyone at
[SPEAKER_02]: the venice cookie company it's a
partnership we need to start a partnership
[SPEAKER_02]: right and what is selling to somebody
without being partners to them when you
[SPEAKER_02]: walk into a store and they say the only
way that you can get on our shelves is by
[SPEAKER_02]: you paying us two thousand dollars this
month and every month after this that's
[SPEAKER_02]: not a partnership that is a shakedown you
know that's my opinion yes i agree eric
[SPEAKER_03]: retailer as a retailer you know as a
retailer the bond between the retailer and
[SPEAKER_03]: the consumer is very important and to what
all you said is when you walk in and what
[SPEAKER_03]: you initially initially started with peter
is when you walk in and you've given up
[SPEAKER_03]: your retailer to brands just representing
themselves where shelf space is sold so
[SPEAKER_03]: we're walking in looking for a joint and
you're going past a vape you know
[SPEAKER_03]: cartridge and you're and you're losing
that connection with the customer i don't
[SPEAKER_03]: think that's a long-term strategy for a
retailer i think you're going to see
[SPEAKER_03]: brands come and go through there so having
that as a retailer you know it this
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries are very interesting because
this is not normal retail right you know
[SPEAKER_03]: we we go to pharmacies like this but we
also just go to pharmacies which are
[SPEAKER_03]: closest to our homes you know and we
everything else we buy is through online
[SPEAKER_03]: or a very sort of what i call i guess a
horizontal approach to retail to where you
[SPEAKER_03]: just you go to the closest place that you
can shop and you buy things but with
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensaries it's similar you you go to
the closest dispenser you can get to but
[SPEAKER_03]: you develop a relationship with with that
organization and it's i lost my train of
[SPEAKER_03]: thought a little bit but i think the
important the important thing is when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're selling your store to someone else
in order to to make those sales then
[SPEAKER_03]: you're losing that connection with with
the customer so yeah i think this is i
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know if i am around enough in the
bay area but we don't sell shelf space i
[SPEAKER_03]: don't think we sell at any of our five
stores and i hear about it up to twenty
[SPEAKER_03]: thousand dollars per month for for some of
these brands in southern california and
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't you don't connect and the
customers that we have we're vertical so
[SPEAKER_03]: we're a little bit different than the
average retailer that says i've got a
[SPEAKER_03]: prime location you know i know i'm going
to have these customers coming in so what
[SPEAKER_03]: we do is we sell our own products right
and we have that relationship with the
[SPEAKER_03]: customer and honestly we'll have the big
brands because people will come in and say
[SPEAKER_03]: i want bang chocolate or i want kiva or
whatever it is and we'll take them over to
[SPEAKER_03]: our brands we'll say yeah we have those
but we also grow our flowers over here we
[SPEAKER_03]: make these products ourselves and we want
you to buy these that's our approach
[SPEAKER_04]: traditional retail markup is i sell you
something for 10 and you sell it out the
[SPEAKER_04]: door for 20 and it seems like in the
cannabis industry sometimes you're it's
[SPEAKER_04]: being sold out the door for 30 so what are
you all seeing like as brands when you
[SPEAKER_04]: sell something into a retailer what do you
see in the market up by where i'm coming
[SPEAKER_04]: from is consumers and patients who are the
like unrepresented group here from a price
[SPEAKER_04]: point they're not happy and obviously some
of its taxes but some of it is like i'm
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to understand why sometimes stuff's
marked up more than traditional retail so
[SPEAKER_02]: i'm not sure what you guys do and i would
say that 65 70 percent of uh our customers
[SPEAKER_02]: do a 3x markup on edibles and a 3x markup
on edibles is really tough to the end
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers and not only is it tough to the
end consumers but in my opinion the
[SPEAKER_02]: retailers aren't going to see that volume
of sales from those and from those end
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers because of that 3x markup and i
would agree with you that the end
[SPEAKER_02]: consumers are looking for less expensive
products that's why we can see them going
[SPEAKER_02]: to the illicit market right now
[SPEAKER_02]: and if maybe you can help in laying us i'm
not sure what you guys do but generally
[SPEAKER_02]: speaking over the retail market why is it
that we are finding that there is a 3x
[SPEAKER_03]: markup right now i think it's location you
know back to whatever is the most
[SPEAKER_03]: convenient store to go to a lot of folks
will just go to the most convenient store
[SPEAKER_03]: i think on average most of our stuff is 2x
we're in a market that's fairly
[SPEAKER_03]: competitive in san francisco probably very
competitive we have a lot of delivery
[SPEAKER_03]: companies um ease and their partners um
you know have a lot of larger companies
[SPEAKER_03]: have a lot more capital to burn to to gain
market share um it in theory i think if
[SPEAKER_03]: folks are charging 3x is because they can
get it you know they're in a limited
[SPEAKER_03]: market they've got the foot traffic but if
you're in a competitive market you know
[SPEAKER_00]: you can't do that well and i'll help eric
out here a little bit here i think part of
[SPEAKER_00]: it too has also been with the segmentation
of the industry a few during prop 215 days
[SPEAKER_00]: retailers were able to package they were
able to do some things and take some cogs
[SPEAKER_00]: write-offs on their taxes and with the way
the industry set up now retailers are
[SPEAKER_00]: almost paying like taxes on their gross
sales they don't get to take those cogs
[SPEAKER_00]: write-offs anymore and i i think that has
a lot to do with it and also the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: just trying to justify competing with the
black market so we've created this
[SPEAKER_00]: situation where we've priced ourselves out
of being competitive so now we have to
[SPEAKER_00]: charge more to justify being here and it
just it's created a vicious cycle the only
[SPEAKER_00]: business partner any of us have making
money right now is the state of california
[SPEAKER_04]: i think they're losing too eric when
you're dealing with brands what i mean
[SPEAKER_04]: what are some of your frustrations i guess
well i don't deal with them directly when
[SPEAKER_04]: you're dealing with them right so when
that guy bitches to you what is what is he
[SPEAKER_03]: bitching about um i can't say i get not a
lot really um does he does he complain
[SPEAKER_01]: about brands um i'll tell you what he's
complaining about i bet you i know i think
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's consistent everywhere it's
constant unreliability right it's people
[SPEAKER_01]: saying they're going to do things they
don't do them they're unavailable you hit
[SPEAKER_01]: them up you don't get hit back right away
you get orders for stuff you didn't pay
[SPEAKER_00]: for you didn't order um what else there's
1300 manufacturers and 700 retailers that
[SPEAKER_01]: might be part of the problem right they're
wearing 10 hats instead of two or three uh
[SPEAKER_01]: half most of them are maybe underpaid um
yeah they're overwhelmed with so many
[SPEAKER_01]: people like just trying to get their
attention and um man there's so many
[SPEAKER_01]: things um how right am i how many buyers
do we have in the house all right are they
[SPEAKER_04]: are they metric savvy are they what metric
savvy yeah metric i think they're all
[SPEAKER_01]: being forced to be i think if i'm not
mistaken like most retailers either just
[SPEAKER_01]: did or in the middle of or or are
imminently having to you know apply like
[SPEAKER_01]: get in onto metric so um i think right so
all right so down the line what kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: metric nightmares are you having at night
well we've strategically stayed away from
[SPEAKER_01]: metric we don't we we have our provisional
for for a while we don't legally need to
[SPEAKER_01]: be on metric we're grateful to just let
get like buy some we have some time and
[SPEAKER_01]: and we're gonna hopefully let metric and
the rest of the fucking industry get their
[SPEAKER_01]: shit together um because it's a shit show
like trying to deal with metric we hear
[SPEAKER_01]: the nightmares left and right and they
call in and and metric doesn't even know
[SPEAKER_01]: what's going on they don't know how to do
things you're bringing up uh i mean this
[SPEAKER_01]: is what we're hearing from retailers and
and other brands and stuff so for now
[SPEAKER_01]: we're our strategy is to stay away from
metric so as a distributor you have that
[SPEAKER_04]: luxury for now because i don't think for
now for the short and i'm not gonna lie
[SPEAKER_00]: i'm i'm
[SPEAKER_02]: i think uh buyers are having two
challenges one now right now well first is
[SPEAKER_02]: 1300 manufacturers knocking at their door
right that that's that's one of the major
[SPEAKER_02]: problems is that they're overwhelmed with
the amount of brands that are coming
[SPEAKER_02]: knocking at the door and um and who do
they buy from right and who's going to
[SPEAKER_02]: perform the best and i think the second
most major challenge that's happening
[SPEAKER_02]: currently with buyers are metric and
metric is being put on to uh these buyers
[SPEAKER_02]: to be able to operate on and so this is a
learning curve for the buyers that they
[SPEAKER_02]: now have metric that they have to deal
with and i think that there is going to
[SPEAKER_02]: come a time and i really hope not but i
think there's going to come a time where
[SPEAKER_02]: buyers are going to say are you on they
already have asked me are you on metric
[SPEAKER_02]: and the answer is yes right and if the
answer is no they're gonna say i don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know if i really want to work with you
right now right it's here it's here it's
[SPEAKER_00]: happening i'm just trying to be nice yeah
i'm not gonna lie i come from the software
[SPEAKER_00]: industry i'm actually pretty excited about
metric it's been pretty painless for us to
[SPEAKER_04]: implement your metric and how does your
husband does your husband thank you enough
[SPEAKER_00]: my husband can't spell metric
[SPEAKER_04]: no all right so eric you you you have a
bay area shop and you have a we're in
[SPEAKER_04]: santa rosa you have a shop how far away
from here yeah we do all kinds of stuff
[SPEAKER_03]: that's why i don't have the answers to
these things so we're yeah we're vertical
[SPEAKER_03]: so we have we have we farm in glen allen
and we manufacture in santa rosa and we
[SPEAKER_03]: have stores three stores in san francisco
one in santa rosa one in one in sebastopol
[SPEAKER_04]: okay so sebastopol so so talk about the
economic decision making there are a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: of local brands and so i guess my question
is in your local retail operation are you
[SPEAKER_04]: proactively featuring local brands and if
not what are kind of the business
[SPEAKER_04]: decisions you're going through to decide
that it's just not feasible yeah most
[SPEAKER_03]: brands we feature from northern california
so i'd say local unfortunately sonoma
[SPEAKER_03]: there's just not a whole lot of brands
because of the regulatory difficulties
[SPEAKER_03]: within the county um you have one sitting
next to a few champions um uh but do you
[SPEAKER_03]: carry her brand i don't know sean do we
carry pillars not yet and why not right
[SPEAKER_03]: there what why not have you been pitched
by them well i don't know i i mean i i do
[SPEAKER_03]: like i'm i do a lot of stuff but but
retail is not my focus um i probably
[SPEAKER_03]: should have had sean up here talking about
retail um but you had multiple parts to
[SPEAKER_04]: your question what was the first part well
it's basically like what are the i can i
[SPEAKER_04]: mean in an ideal world you want to carry
the amazing craft sungrown regenerative
[SPEAKER_03]: hugo culture local well yeah okay so well
first honestly we will we will sell
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that we produce and manufacture
first that that is ultimately our our
[SPEAKER_03]: objective that's as a retail as a vertical
retailer i think i think the further south
[SPEAKER_03]: you go the more uh larger brands that are
coming and going i don't see that the
[SPEAKER_03]: revolving door up north and we've been
around for a long time um and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_03]: brands that we have on the shelf continue
and have been around for a while and i i'm
[SPEAKER_03]: not experiencing the disruption i think
that a lot of retailers in southern
[SPEAKER_03]: california are i think we have a lot of
consistency with our brands from from
[SPEAKER_03]: northern california um answer the question
do you have something to say back to that
[SPEAKER_03]: do you want should i where's our buyer so
i'm honestly i'm going to give erica pass
[SPEAKER_00]: on this one to you because um northern
california market's tough because san
[SPEAKER_00]: francisco sonoma county are a short drive
from the triangle and this is the belly of
[SPEAKER_00]: the beast us being in the industry 10
years we're a new brand in northern
[SPEAKER_00]: california and we spend a little time
banging our heads trying to get into some
[SPEAKER_00]: local shops and we were competing with
people that had been there for five or 10
[SPEAKER_00]: years before us and been consistent so our
strategy after banging our head for a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of months was we're going south and
we're taking northern california to
[SPEAKER_00]: southern california and we've been
crushing la we've been crushing the desert
[SPEAKER_00]: we've been crushing san diego and you know
i i hope that that the tables turn because
[SPEAKER_00]: i think we're one of the few survivors i
think you know there's a handful of legacy
[SPEAKER_00]: brands that are still standing and i'm
proud to say we're one of them and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of badass people that are in this
room right now that bleed for this company
[SPEAKER_00]: every day and you know i hope that we
start getting that recognition in our
[SPEAKER_00]: local market but i understand how we got
where we are i just i would love to see it
[SPEAKER_04]: change so eric what's your what's his name
are you gonna take a meeting with these
[SPEAKER_00]: guys sean you better run my sharks are
here all right so just quickly wrapping it
[SPEAKER_04]: up uh if each of just down the line of
each of you can talk about a a regulation
[SPEAKER_04]: that is a pain point for you and companies
like you and which regulatory agency is
[SPEAKER_04]: responsible for that and what your better
regulatory policy is towards that specific
[SPEAKER_02]: piece of regulation i think the biggest
thing that's holding back this entire
[SPEAKER_02]: industry right now is two things i can't
answer with one i think it's two things i
[SPEAKER_02]: think it's the over taxation of excise tax
and i think it is local ordinances who are
[SPEAKER_02]: not allowing more dispensaries to be put
into their areas right there's 700
[SPEAKER_02]: licensed retailers some odd licensed
retailers in the state of california
[SPEAKER_02]: that's just plain and simple not enough
and there needs to be it can't be one
[SPEAKER_02]: approach of oh well let's just bring the
tax down or oh let's just add more
[SPEAKER_02]: retailers it needs to be multifaceted and
i think it is reduce that tax add more
[SPEAKER_03]: retailers free the cookie i would agree
but i'll just add some other challenges i
[SPEAKER_03]: know northern california faces and in here
in sonoma county as a result relates to
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivators i think what's the real
problem it's really going to destroy what
[SPEAKER_03]: our industry is if hasn't destroyed a lot
of it and that is the environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations around cannabis and the way
cannabis has been treated differently than
[SPEAKER_03]: agriculture i think you know four years
ago we thought humboldt was going to and
[SPEAKER_03]: mendicino was going to own the cultivation
for the state and and it's not you know i
[SPEAKER_03]: don't see it heading that way i see the
cultivation heading down to the valley to
[SPEAKER_03]: large large industrial greenhouse
facilities that's where most of it's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to end up and i think that's an
unfortunate thing an unfortunate situation
[SPEAKER_03]: or result of the way we've regulated we've
we've approached cannabis as a nuclear
[SPEAKER_03]: factory instead of a plant that it is and
we're seeing a lot of you know every
[SPEAKER_03]: grower i know is north of california north
of san francisco is back to the black
[SPEAKER_03]: market it's fascinating how it affects you
know the prices on the black market versus
[SPEAKER_03]: the the legal market but i think that's
the that's one of the regulations that's
[SPEAKER_03]: caused the most amount of death and
destruction to the industry that we that
[SPEAKER_00]: we had in the people that created it i
would agree with everything both of these
[SPEAKER_00]: gentlemen said one of the other things
it's really crippling us right now is that
[SPEAKER_00]: my sales people cannot carry samples and
drop them off after they have a great
[SPEAKER_00]: appointment with a buyer it takes two
three four days to place an order manifest
[SPEAKER_00]: a product package it up ship it and get it
to a purchaser and by then they've seen 30
[SPEAKER_00]: 40 50 100 other purchasers and they don't
remember why the hell they got this box
[SPEAKER_00]: product i think that's one of the biggest
things we need to be able to solve is
[SPEAKER_00]: having sales people account managers hand
a product to a buyer say here try this
[SPEAKER_00]: hand it to your staff i'll talk to you
next week yeah i i agree with everything i
[SPEAKER_01]: was said if there's something to add i
think the writing off of cost of goods
[SPEAKER_01]: sold is probably going to help with some
of us operate and and the regulation the
[SPEAKER_01]: actual enforcement of regulations is one
thing that i don't think i heard directly
[SPEAKER_01]: address but yeah more license store fronts
lower the taxes actually enforce the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations on the people who are not
abiding and um well and give those people
[SPEAKER_00]: a path people that have been doing this
for 10 20 30 years give them a fucking
[SPEAKER_02]: permit do you bring up a really good point
there's there's what i believe the an
[SPEAKER_02]: article came out saying there's 2100
illicit stores in the state of california
[SPEAKER_00]: so that was just l.a.
[SPEAKER_02]: you are correct mostly southern california
but the problem is some of these guys are
[SPEAKER_02]: bad players and they shouldn't be in our
industry but i think the majority of them
[SPEAKER_02]: need help and need a path and don't have
the money or the cash flow necessary to be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to become legal and i think it's very
important to to help them out absolutely
[SPEAKER_04]: any peanut gallery comments the woman in
the back row
[SPEAKER_01]: no well i mean we're heading towards
metrics inevitable right we're just
[SPEAKER_01]: holding on until we absolutely have to and
we see it in our very near future it's
[SPEAKER_01]: just i mean we're going to be bringing on
metrics sooner than later it's just a
[SPEAKER_01]: luxury that we have at this moment um and
yeah we we haven't had a single retailer
[SPEAKER_01]: turn us down but hundred percent that
conversation is coming up and we see it
[SPEAKER_01]: right there it's not like we're going to
try to avoid metric it's inevitable right
[SPEAKER_01]: um and we're not maybe we don't even know
all that when you have to be scared of i
[SPEAKER_01]: mean it's just for us it's like it's an
inconvenience that we could potentially
[SPEAKER_01]: postpone just a little bit longer and and
hopefully in that time a few things i mean
[SPEAKER_01]: one thing that i think we've all learned
is like the people that are kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: innovators and or or doing things first
are paying a huge cost to do it you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what i mean and that's not just
financially um and then you occasionally i
[SPEAKER_01]: mean and and really the pioneers or or the
people who built this industry who are not
[SPEAKER_01]: me these are people that have been here
you know for a decade or three or more um
[SPEAKER_01]: the work that those people did that that
paved the road that we get to travel down
[SPEAKER_01]: i mean what a luxury we have right and um
so you know and i am grateful to those
[SPEAKER_01]: people and i want to express my gratuity
to those people but those people don't get
[SPEAKER_01]: you know they don't really get like the
any benefit from what they did they did
[SPEAKER_01]: the hard work and so i'm just not quick to
to be like oh yeah let's be the first ones
[SPEAKER_01]: there i mean it would be cool and i think
there's advantages to it um but there's
[SPEAKER_01]: also disadvantages and and my experience
in this industry is is like play like on
[SPEAKER_01]: the fringe of what you can get away with
without crossing the line like and you
[SPEAKER_01]: know don't you don't risk your whole
business or license up but like the people
[SPEAKER_01]: who win are playing some sort of gray area
and most of them are playing a much grayer
[SPEAKER_01]: than what we're doing um but that's that's
the reality of of you know does anybody
[SPEAKER_02]: disagree with that statement i do i
absolutely do there for us uh there's no
[SPEAKER_02]: gray area anymore and it's completely
black and white to us because but do you
[SPEAKER_04]: disagree that a lot of companies are
playing in gray areas oh no i think a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of companies are playing i think those of
us that are following the letter of the
[SPEAKER_04]: law are being penalized for sure so just
last question as to you fiddlers high tide
[SPEAKER_04]: and you socal entering norcal are do you
see any nuanced differences between
[SPEAKER_04]: dealing with socal retailers and norcal
retailers or like obviously there are more
[SPEAKER_02]: than two markets it's two it's two
different animals the norcal market is
[SPEAKER_02]: completely different than the southern
california market you brought up the fact
[SPEAKER_02]: that like the bay area is the beast of the
belly and in fact really is uh it's
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely been one of the hardest markets
for us to penetrate and we have been
[SPEAKER_02]: around for a long time right and we have a
large southern california following and
[SPEAKER_02]: perhaps maybe that large southern
california following and perhaps that uh
[SPEAKER_02]: southern california home base puts us at a
disadvantage when we're talking to
[SPEAKER_02]: northern california buyers um and that
that's what i see all right well thank you
[SPEAKER_04]: all very much and uh thank you to the
whiskey tip for having us and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: have some music outside and then there's
karaoke inside so thank you thank you guys
[SPEAKER_05]: thank you thank you you you you you you
you you you you you you
