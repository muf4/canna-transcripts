[SPEAKER_00]: if it's a high quality variety i think
you're going to see profuse trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: production um and the heads where the
psychoactive substances are will be
[SPEAKER_00]: swollen i want to see a large calyx that's
proportionate to the size of those are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have two pistols the hairs are
going to come out of each calyx moving
[SPEAKER_00]: away from that into a structure that has a
lot of valleys and points to it it's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a lot more surface area particularly
if those points and valleys are comprised
[SPEAKER_00]: of fewer but much larger of these floral
bracts that we call calyxes they stack
[SPEAKER_00]: together to shape up your bud that a bud
with fewer and larger calyxes but a
[SPEAKER_00]: similar size and or weight to another
flower with much larger amount of calyxes
[SPEAKER_00]: the one with the fewer larger is going to
have a lot more surface area and therefore
[SPEAKER_00]: a greater potential to have higher
trichome production you you
