[SPEAKER_00]: We're based out of Northern Humboldt and
with Talking Trees Farms we do cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of indoor, outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the East North County and South
County so we're in a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: different Appalachia and run five
different farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smallest is probably just only a
little over 1,500 square feet and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: go up to about 34,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And is the smallest one an outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: All outdoor and then hoop houses for light
depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: The smallest ones are obviously our older
farms when we were first starting so
[SPEAKER_00]: they're a little bit more in the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been interesting to find what strains
would work and talking about climate and
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of sun that you get.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's always tricky to find out what to
grow where.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always a learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because these places are spread out enough
where they're climatically different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So map strains to geographies within what
you're growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What grows well in each?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well you won't be surprised that Blue
Dream and Green Crack pretty much grow
[SPEAKER_00]: good anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: They thrive in the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just all around.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean they get a bad rap but all around
there are great strains for what they can
[SPEAKER_00]: do and where you can grow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once you get into the full sun I
mean you could pretty much grow anything
[SPEAKER_00]: in full sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although I will say you can, some strains
like a little bit more shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Girl Scout Cookies for one is one
strain that likes a little bit more shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too much but for the most part things
like a lot of sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't say that I have a favorite strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Variety is the spice of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do a little bit of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've transitioned mostly into raised
beds, light depths and are getting away
[SPEAKER_00]: from full season plants just to do the two
harvests.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally enjoy growing more small
plants than trying to grow the 12 foot
[SPEAKER_00]: tall plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know it's not where I'm interested in
dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to deal with 12 foot tall plants
and if you lose that plant you lose a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think we go with raised beds mostly
and do global amending.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try not to use any liquids.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pretty much use three liquids throughout
the whole season which would be Earth
[SPEAKER_00]: Juice Catalyst, Molasses and a finishing
Llama manure plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a product called Crescendo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other than that we just all dry amendment
in global amending our soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is great because you know I don't
want to be throwing away bottles and
[SPEAKER_00]: bottles and we would be throwing away lots
of bottles if we were using synthetics or
[SPEAKER_00]: any brand of nutrient that's in a bottle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Catalyst is the product I guess they
actually just got pulled from the shelves
[SPEAKER_00]: last month.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it's from Earth Juice which is a
brand that's been around for over 20
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've been in the agricultural
nutrient business for a long time and
[SPEAKER_00]: Catalyst has been one of their flagship
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of their only to this point one
of their only organic products but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just an enzyme macronutrient just a plant
booster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah they had to change the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: They couldn't use the name Cat.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like really curious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like oh was it not organic and they
were mislabeling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the local store told me it was because
California ag rules are just kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can't they can't call it Catalyst
because that's what it does so they have
[SPEAKER_00]: to change the name with an X and Attalist
or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: We definitely brew teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our tea brews are massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We brew like a minimum 500 gallons at a
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use from four to eight massive tea
bags at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably have a unique way of doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't like make small batch and then add
that tea into a reservoir.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just brew a massive batch that'll act
that'll handle that 1500 gallons that we
[SPEAKER_00]: feed at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we brew it overnight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah maybe not even 24 hours sometimes you
know it's hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean some of my water tanks stay around
80 degrees the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think they're brewing fast and if we
left it out 24 hours we'd probably be
[SPEAKER_00]: killing microbiology because we're in full
sun and where the tanks are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do shorter brews and sometimes we'll
add in some back guano and accentuate the
[SPEAKER_00]: actual compost tea and make it a feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sometimes we'll just top dress and just
do straight compost teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a goal to make our own worm
castings in our own compost but all things
[SPEAKER_00]: in time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it one step at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I said earlier varieties of spice of
life so I don't stick to one compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I'm brewing a compost I'll buy three
different types of compost because I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: sure everyone's got something good whether
it's Malibu, Baseline, Dr. Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to just focus on one because
if they had a product issue then I'm you
[SPEAKER_00]: know dealing with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I use I spread things out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know I give everybody a little bit of
chance with their different composts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's got different style of compost
whether it's manures and or plant-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use a variety of compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We switch that out over the season and
then besides the compost and the castings
[SPEAKER_00]: and the calcium the biggest thing I've
been adding is Epsom salts lately because
[SPEAKER_00]: we're all in off-grid well water and once
we get the water tested we notice it's
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard super high in calcium and so
that tends to lock out the phosphorus with
[SPEAKER_00]: the calcium the magnesium is not in
balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been adding Epsom salts in which
has been really noticeable difference in
[SPEAKER_00]: terms of the growth of the buds growing
out and phosphorus not locking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But otherwise the only difference in the
step stages of the tea brews is when we
[SPEAKER_00]: add guanos.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we're in veg we'll add like a 9-3-1
guano to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we go to transition I'll go with like
a 4-4-4 and then the second transition
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll split it with a 4-4-4 and a 2-14-2 so
kind of like start slowly introduced to
[SPEAKER_00]: high phos and then then I'll go to all
2-14-2.
[SPEAKER_00]: Particularly I like the rainbow grow pro
bloom and grow rainbow pro bloom and grow
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient mixes that we add into our teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our biggest success with and is with the
global amending like we do we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: actually feed at all while our plants are
vegging it's all in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we mix in a pretty hot mix we have to
let it sit for 10 days and thankfully I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: not putting those together there's a
company up there called Soil Escape
[SPEAKER_00]: Solutions that really makes my life a lot
easier because they're the soil scientists
[SPEAKER_00]: they know that that aspect of it more than
I do and so that has helped us a lot so we
[SPEAKER_00]: get their global amendment which is you
know what I've done for years just
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing a little bit of that throwing a
little bit of that but now it's like the
[SPEAKER_00]: equations are there the proportions are
right and so that just sets us off on like
[SPEAKER_00]: an awesome veg stage and so actually we
don't even feed until we get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: second week of bloom we lay top dresses
and start doing teas.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pretty much that's all I do is drive
around and check in and bring supplies and
[SPEAKER_00]: oversee and and I don't do as much of the
touching of the plants and the watering as
[SPEAKER_00]: I might have done 15 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man I finally got hit with the russet
mites this June so I'm dealing with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prevention is always the best is key yeah
and some we were on a preventative program
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we do a lot of sulfur in veg we
don't want to use sulfur after the first
[SPEAKER_00]: week of flower but right now I'm actually
dealing with and learning a lot about
[SPEAKER_00]: these russet mites they don't like into
like plants that are into flowering past
[SPEAKER_00]: like four to five weeks the buds are too
developed they don't seem to attack that
[SPEAKER_00]: they like fresh growth fresh bud
development so if you if you can handle it
[SPEAKER_00]: early in veg prevention is key sulfur is
probably the most organic effective
[SPEAKER_00]: product against those kinds of pests and
then there's bio fungicides like venerate
[SPEAKER_00]: grandivo grand and those are all made by
one company I can't think of the name and
[SPEAKER_00]: they also make a product called regalia
which is more PM oriented.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing with PM is once you have it you
can't get rid of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So again prevention is the key and regalia
is that product so we'll mix regalia and
[SPEAKER_00]: grandivo are compatible and we spray we
foliar I'm not a big foliar spray I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't foliar feed my plants it's not
really my technique at all but for IPM
[SPEAKER_00]: pest prevention we run them through like
we run them through my pump system so
[SPEAKER_00]: we're pumping a hundred gallons of spray
at a greenhouse at a time through fogget
[SPEAKER_00]: nozzles so we're able to just do
high-volume spraying and at this point
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing it like every other day to get
these little fuckers in check.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got a hand spray but every aisle of the
greenhouse has its own hose and so we use
[SPEAKER_00]: those for feeding and then we also have a
separate water system set up for dripping
[SPEAKER_00]: because we mostly do drip we only hand
feed once a week and then other than that
[SPEAKER_00]: just drip drip water drip but we don't I
don't combine those systems because I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want the feed system clogging my
drip lines so they're separated and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we feed we run the foliars through our
feed system and so there's a hose down
[SPEAKER_00]: every aisle in every greenhouse and so
they just turn on the pump the tanks there
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not carrying around a pump spray
or got a backpack pump and it's pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really efficient it's like a little
nozzle they make I think DRAM might even
[SPEAKER_00]: make them yeah they're really great you
can get half gallon one gallon two gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: and four gallon a minute and it just
disperses kind of like a pump sprayer
[SPEAKER_00]: would and so we don't we use the two
gallon a minute I've tried them all two
[SPEAKER_00]: gallon a minute is what we like to use
four gallon a minute kind of hammers the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants but the two gallon a minute having
any issues with PM at all this year spider
[SPEAKER_00]: mites are easy you just got to deal with
them right but these new mites you fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: can't see until you know they're a problem
is like a lot of people having issues with
[SPEAKER_00]: them and I've been lucky to not have to
deal with them till June but cost it's
[SPEAKER_00]: just a very added expense and throw in
organic prevention at them and then the
[SPEAKER_00]: time that my workers have to spend after
nine o'clock spraying plants never gets
[SPEAKER_00]: dope never gets boring on the farm you
