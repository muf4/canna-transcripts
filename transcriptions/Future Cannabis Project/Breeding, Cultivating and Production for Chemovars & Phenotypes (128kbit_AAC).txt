[SPEAKER_03]: 50 years ago, the situation with cannabis
was there was a lot of low-potency
[SPEAKER_03]: material around, but don't let anyone tell
you that there wasn't good potent
[SPEAKER_03]: material.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was just a little bit rarer,
harder to find, more expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also at that time, there were a lot of
what we call land races.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these were cannabis types that had been
grown in a particular area for many
[SPEAKER_03]: generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were ecologically adapted to the
local environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: They could deal with the pests.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were vigorous.
[SPEAKER_03]: But beyond that, they had very interesting
psychological characteristics,
[SPEAKER_03]: psychopharmacological effects that we just
don't see today.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the big problems in cannabis
breeding, from my standpoint, is something
[SPEAKER_03]: we heard about earlier, that we've had
this homogenization.
[SPEAKER_03]: Part of this is a byproduct of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And basically, in a situation where a drug
is illegal, it makes sense to have it as
[SPEAKER_03]: potent as possible, so it's the lowest
volume possible, which helps prevent
[SPEAKER_03]: discovery by lots of people.
[SPEAKER_03]: Law enforcement, in particular.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what we've had is selective breeding
for the last 40 years for high THC to the
[SPEAKER_03]: exclusion of everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we've ended up with in the market is
a situation in which we've got almost
[SPEAKER_03]: everything is high THC and high mercy.
[SPEAKER_03]: That combination is notorious for
producing couch lock.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I know that some people like this
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: But most consumers of cannabis aren't
really looking to be immobilized.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're looking to have either a good
experience or a therapeutic experience.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if you have pain and have to sleep,
that's a good combination.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if you have to work or study,
it's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically, cannabis has a great deal more
to offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And part of what we'd like to discuss this
evening is that and why.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some breeding targets and goals I'd
like to share with you because I think
[SPEAKER_03]: that this represents an avenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going forward, we're what I like to call
barefoot breeders.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope nobody thinks that that's
derogatory in any way.
[SPEAKER_03]: But these would be the people,
like many of you, that have been dedicated
[SPEAKER_03]: to the plant, maybe living off the grid
for a long period of time, who've never
[SPEAKER_03]: had the rewards from your effort,
maybe on a personal level, but certainly
[SPEAKER_03]: not on a commercial level, where you could
make this a living, a viable living,
[SPEAKER_03]: doing this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is, I think, a worthy goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not about making millions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's about being able to do what you love,
and at the same time, helping a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't mean to exclude what some
people call recreational use of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if the question is, can we make
recreational cannabis a lot better,
[SPEAKER_03]: you bet.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think we could help with describing
those characteristics.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to primarily talk about
medical applications.
[SPEAKER_03]: So beyond the high THC, high mercine,
this is spilt over now.
[SPEAKER_03]: There, in the last several years,
there's been great interest in cannabidiol
[SPEAKER_03]: for all its medical attributes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've ended up with an analogous
situation, in that now we have a bunch of
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD chemovars that are also rich in
mercine, which has created the
[SPEAKER_03]: misconception that cannabidiol is
sedating.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_03]: When you've got CBD without mercine,
it's actually innervating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of people are using CBD
preparations instead of caffeine in the
[SPEAKER_03]: morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what we'd like to have people aim for
is CBD predominant chemovars with little
[SPEAKER_03]: or no THC that could qualify as hemp,
although I have difficulties as a
[SPEAKER_03]: scientist in the current definition in
this country of just 0.3 or less percent
[SPEAKER_03]: THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're also interested in CBD chemovars
with little or no mercine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rather, to emphasize some of the other
terpenoids, the aromatic components that
[SPEAKER_03]: modulate the effects of cannabis,
specifically CBD with high limonene.
[SPEAKER_03]: Limonene is a great antidepressant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You combine that with the anti-anxiety
effects of CBD, and you've got a great
[SPEAKER_03]: agent for a variety of psychiatric
conditions, or just garden variety,
[SPEAKER_03]: bad day, anxious, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Similarly, cannabidiol with high linalool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Linalool, like CBD, is an anti-anxiety
agent, famous for coming from lavender.
[SPEAKER_03]: But beyond that, both of them are
anticonvulsant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And from colleagues who have used these
types of combinations in patients with
[SPEAKER_03]: severe epilepsies, they're seeing success
where there wasn't any before with just
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are the kinds of potentials that
we can see.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another really interesting target is CBD
with high karyophylline.
[SPEAKER_03]: Karyophylline tends to be the predominant
terpenoid in a lot of extracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it'll be preserved, say, in a CO2
extract, whereas you'd lose some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: lower molecular weight monoterpenoids,
the limonene, the mercine, and the pining.
[SPEAKER_03]: But CBD with high karyophylline presents a
very broad spectrum of medical activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both are anti-inflammatory.
[SPEAKER_03]: Together, they can be analgesic,
pain relieving.
[SPEAKER_03]: Both have anti-addictive properties and
could help people get off of opioids and
[SPEAKER_03]: any other addictive drug.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they would have application in
autoimmune conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really limited only by the
imagination.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing we'd like to see in breeding
is more type two preparation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a balance of two.
[SPEAKER_03]: THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, selective breeding where
you're going to have that kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: combination, but with high selective
terpenoids as well, especially pining.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pining is an acetylcholinesterase
inhibitor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Acetylcholine is the memory molecule on
the brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you have more of it, you don't
have the, oh, what was I saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: The short-term memory impairment.
[SPEAKER_03]: For which THC is infamous.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's funny in a social setting.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, if you're a chronic pain
patient and you have to work, you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: want to be forgetting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for alertness and clarity of a high,
pining is what you want to look for.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then a big one.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of you are familiar on an
experiential basis with cannabigerols?
[SPEAKER_03]: CBG.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I see a few hands go up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabigerol is the parent of the other
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the plant, of course, it's in the acid
form.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cannabigerolic acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Easy for me to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know almost nothing about what CBGA
does.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we do know quite a bit about CBG.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my way of thinking, this is the next
big thing in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And heretofore, it's really been pretty
much ignored.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is a very unusual molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, it has very pronounced
antibiotic activity, including against
[SPEAKER_03]: some really bad bugs like
methicillin-resistant staph aureus that
[SPEAKER_03]: has caused some hospital epidemics.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is why they scrub you before surgery
so that you don't get horrible wound
[SPEAKER_03]: infections.
[SPEAKER_03]: Beyond that, it has a very interesting
profile in that it's a very powerful
[SPEAKER_03]: anti-anxiety agent without being sedating.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anybody who's taken medicines like the
benzodiazepines, Valium at all,
[SPEAKER_03]: almost all the drugs that have been used
pharmaceutically to treat anxiety have
[SPEAKER_03]: been sedating and often addictive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this presents a profile that's really
benign in comparison to those drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, CBG is very active against a
number of types of cancer, particularly
[SPEAKER_03]: prostate cancer, which is number one or
number two most common type of cancer in
[SPEAKER_03]: men.
[SPEAKER_03]: So great potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, it seems like we have
evidence of a variety of chemovars that
[SPEAKER_03]: are very rich in CBG that will have little
or no THC and could qualify as hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And eventually, if we get the laws right,
could go across state and international
[SPEAKER_03]: borders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm hoping that Dale will talk more
about strategies there.
[SPEAKER_03]: We think with the right legislation or
even without it, there may be some work
[SPEAKER_03]: around so that your work in one state
could reach other jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm also interested in something that
almost nobody is working on, and that
[SPEAKER_03]: would be zero cannabinoid plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, why would you want that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there are two reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is very interesting for research work,
where you want to compare the entourage of
[SPEAKER_03]: the terpenoids against a similar entourage
of terpenoids with cannabinoids,
[SPEAKER_03]: but that's a little bit nerdy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another reason is that you can make
essential oil of cannabis without the
[SPEAKER_03]: liability, we'll call it, of THC content.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people are going to want to use
this as a flavoring or as a perfume or
[SPEAKER_03]: aromatherapy agent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they may want to use this to make
preparations to help if you have a
[SPEAKER_03]: chemovar that has one profile that you
like, but you want to add more limonene to
[SPEAKER_03]: it, you can selectively breed for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, ideally, we would prefer to have
chemovars that have the exact profile we
[SPEAKER_03]: want, but that's hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: That takes multiple generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are some shortcuts where you're
still working just with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it may be that pharmaceutical agents
are made this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sativex, which is approved in 30
countries, is actually a combination of
[SPEAKER_03]: two chemovars, one high in THC,
one high in CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Next, THCV, tetrahydrocannabinol.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is THC with a three carbon side
chain instead of five.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a really interesting agent as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's found in low amounts in cannabis from
southern Africa.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is different to THC, however,
in that it's what's called a neutral
[SPEAKER_03]: antagonist.
[SPEAKER_03]: At low doses, it opposes the activity at
the CB1 receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it actually allays hunger.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very good for diabetes, metabolic
syndrome.
[SPEAKER_03]: But beyond that, it is anticonvulsant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is good for neuropathic pain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Experientially, when there's a good amount
of it with THC, it makes for a clearer
[SPEAKER_03]: high.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rapid onset, a more rapid offset as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we think that this has great potential.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you can get into things where
you're really seeing a combination of
[SPEAKER_03]: ingredients that can be therapeutic.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are chemovars that combine CBD,
CBDV, linalool, and karyophylline,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe with a touch of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of those can have beneficial effects
on epilepsy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So together, there's every reason to
expect they'll be synergistic and provide
[SPEAKER_03]: a much better medicine than, say,
CBD alone, which now is an FDA approved
[SPEAKER_03]: drug in this country.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a few words about others I haven't
mentioned.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cannabichromine.
[SPEAKER_03]: So CBC is considered one of the major
cannabinoids, but we actually see very
[SPEAKER_03]: little of it in most types of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason for that is, unlike THC and
CBD, which are products of dominant genes,
[SPEAKER_03]: CBC, cannabichromine, is produced by a
recessive gene.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not going to tend to be expressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, it's going to appear in
higher concentrations in immature plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's actually possible if you've got a
plant that has a good amount of
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabichromine, you can make hash out of
it at a younger age to produce what my
[SPEAKER_03]: former colleague David Potter called ETP,
an enriched trichome product, otherwise
[SPEAKER_03]: known as Keef.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is, again, a very versatile
agent.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's shown some antidepressant effects in
the animals.
[SPEAKER_03]: It, again, has anti-inflammatory activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's good for a wide range of cancer cell
types.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we really haven't had it available in
sufficient amounts to do the kind of work
[SPEAKER_03]: that would make it a good commercial
target.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then the acid cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: Many of you live in this area and may be
familiar with juicing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's like headed for the right
target but using the wrong technique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Juicing is generally done with fan leaves,
massive amounts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Often people are juicing 30 big fan leaves
a day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just an impossible thing for most
people to sustain unless they've got acres
[SPEAKER_03]: of material.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rather, if we're going for the
cannabinoids, their concentration,
[SPEAKER_03]: of course, is greatest in the flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be the source of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why are we interested in THCA,
tetrahydrocannabinolic acid, which has
[SPEAKER_03]: been billed as being non-psychoactive and
has been actually in the past called
[SPEAKER_03]: inactive, which is absolutely wrong?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, as many of you may be aware,
this also has therapeutic activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's quite distinct from THC itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: About in the prior decade, it was
established that this works on something
[SPEAKER_03]: called tumor necrosis factor alpha,
which is very important in certain
[SPEAKER_03]: autoimmune conditions, including the
inflammatory bowel conditions,
[SPEAKER_03]: Crohn's and ulcerative colitis,
but also in MS, rheumatoid arthritis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we've seen a lot of people that will
juice or get THCA from flowers that have
[SPEAKER_03]: had very positive influences on their
autoimmune conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then two years ago in Spain,
it was noted that there was another
[SPEAKER_03]: important activity.
[SPEAKER_03]: Various of the cannabinoids work on
something called PPAR gamma.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a nuclear receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It affects gene transcription,
which sounds really scary.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you can have good effects or bad
effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: The good effects of PPAR gamma are that it
can contribute to weight loss and people
[SPEAKER_03]: who are obese.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can positively affect cancer and a
variety of other disease conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as it turns out, THCA is much more
potent on the PPAR gamma receptor than any
[SPEAKER_03]: of the other cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So part of the problem with THCA is it's
unstable.
[SPEAKER_03]: It breaks down into the stuff called THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: It gets people intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_03]: Which, again, can be a good or bad thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there may be ways to stabilize THCA.
[SPEAKER_03]: And certainly when people are making fresh
material, it's freely available and,
[SPEAKER_03]: again, makes a good target.
[SPEAKER_03]: Its analogous product is CBDA,
cannabidiol-like acid.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we know a little bit less here,
but what we do know is tantalizing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some of you may be aware that cannabidiol
also works on serotonin receptors.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the basis for its anti-anxiety
effect, as well as a number of
[SPEAKER_03]: neuroprotective benefits in the brain,
and possibly its anticonvulsant effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: But cannabidiol-like acid is 100 times
more potent on the 5-HT serotonin 1A
[SPEAKER_03]: receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Additionally, based on the accounts from
the Renaissance herbalists, they used raw
[SPEAKER_03]: hemp, which would have been relatively
rich in CBDA in treating a variety of
[SPEAKER_03]: tumors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we really haven't looked at that yet,
but this is a product that deserves a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: more attention.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to finish this section with
cannabinol, CBN.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, I'm sort of amused by this.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBN is an oxidative breakdown product of
THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have cannabis that's been sitting
out for a couple of years, THC is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: turn into CBN.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've got a lot of companies touting this
as having some real advantages.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that a lot of this is wishful
thinking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is true that there's a misconception
that CBN is very sedating and therefore
[SPEAKER_03]: good for sleep.
[SPEAKER_03]: Rather, it's a case of CBN because it's
basically 25% of the potency of THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: The reason that old cannabis makes you
sleep isn't because of CBN.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's because you've lost the more alerting
monoterpenoids in favor of sedating
[SPEAKER_03]: sesquiterpenoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And beyond that, I think that this quest
for CBN is a way of trying to use up old
[SPEAKER_03]: dope that wasn't good for anything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, some people may disagree with me,
but I guarantee that most of the people
[SPEAKER_03]: that are heavily marketing CBN have this
in mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a very little bit about the
terpenoids beyond what we've said already.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've mentioned limonene, pinene,
and mercene, and linalool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turpinoline.
[SPEAKER_03]: Turpinoline is an interesting terpenoid.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see more in California than other
places.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's beginning to get popular in
Washington, where I live.
[SPEAKER_03]: Odd one in that we've got discrepancies in
how it affects different species.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sedating in animals, but when people
use it, it has more of a buzz.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, like pinene, it may have some
effect to boost acetylcholine levels.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of people like it if they have to
use cannabis and do work, like cleaning
[SPEAKER_03]: the garage might increase their focus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mentioned karyophylline as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, very impressive agent.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is working, it has the distinction of
not just being a terpenoid, but a
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabinoid as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: It is directly affecting the CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the non-psychoactive receptor,
which nonetheless has important
[SPEAKER_03]: pain-reducing and anti-inflammatory
activity, as well as being anti-addictive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Having karyophylline in a good amount in a
cannabis-based preparation is going to
[SPEAKER_03]: cover a lot of bases therapeutically.
[SPEAKER_03]: And quickly mentioning karyophylline
oxide.
[SPEAKER_03]: This may be what is responsible for,
is the scent that sniffer dogs key in on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But beyond that, it seems to be an
extremely strong anti-fungal, even working
[SPEAKER_03]: on nail fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's one of the prescription drugs
that's advertised on TV.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can spend five dollars over six months
and have a 50% chance of curing your nail
[SPEAKER_03]: fungus.
[SPEAKER_03]: But apparently an 8% solution to this
reportedly can cure nail fungus in two
[SPEAKER_03]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what's wrong with this picture?
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's great potential out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that's all I wanted to say now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to start by just saying that one of
the things I like doing is talking to
[SPEAKER_00]: audiences that are kind of new to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I spoke at the Association of University
Technology Managers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the tech transfer offices in
universities that try to get patents on
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is their professors have
discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once they get the patents or the
patent applications filed, then they find
[SPEAKER_00]: a licensee that wants access to that and
they'll pay a fee and the university can
[SPEAKER_00]: replenish its research funding and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: But universities have completely stayed
away from cannabis because they don't want
[SPEAKER_00]: to lose their federal research funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, you touch the plant and you
might lose all your research funding and a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of universities would just dry up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a chance to talk to them about
the cannabis industry in I think about
[SPEAKER_00]: February.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized, all right, these people
might be where I was a couple years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: well a few years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I first got into the cannabis
industry from just my more conventional
[SPEAKER_00]: law practice, I didn't know what CBD was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went to MJBizCon one year and they were
talking about CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to look it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized, now you all, I mean,
some of you have been in this for
[SPEAKER_00]: generations, as many of you your whole
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I was talking to an audience that had
begun to hear about CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, well, what I said is a few years
ago, none of us in this room had heard of
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now your grandma and your dog are both
taking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they knew that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the news flash was cannabis has
way more than just THC and CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, depending on which number
you believe it might make 150 different
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids, plus all the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Ethan talked about many of them,
but it makes way more than the ones he
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plus the flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's really interesting is,
at the receptor level, and I learned a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: about receptors, some in grad school,
but also some working with a company that
[SPEAKER_00]: found natural insecticides that were based
on the way essential oils, completely safe
[SPEAKER_00]: essential oils, acted on the receptors,
the olfactory receptors in the insect
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, now let's stop there for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because plants evolved their essential
oils as defenses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so somebody thought, well,
okay, let's look at, instead of looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: these one at a time, let's try making
pairwise combinations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of them were more potent than the
most potent chemical pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others were extremely potent repellents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was completely natural stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could spray it on your kitchen
counter.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the flies would die, but you could
wipe a piece of bread on it and eat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't taste very good, but you could
do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the point of all this is that as soon
as we start to look at the plant as not
[SPEAKER_00]: just THC or CBD, it's way more than just
how high is the THC, how high is the CBD,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many different active
molecules that could act at different
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors in combination and create
amazing synergies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I don't think that even
shows up in a COA, because some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules will be active at levels that
are either just at detection or even below
[SPEAKER_00]: detection, but their activity at the
receptor could be really powerful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in combination.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the reason I'm going into all this is
that I honestly believe that the future of
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, the next century of medicine,
is going to come from this plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to come from, you know,
manufactured molecules in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll just stop there for a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you heard of combinatorial chemistry?
[SPEAKER_00]: The way pharma discovers many of its drugs
is it starts with some core, and then it
[SPEAKER_00]: makes a million variations on this core
molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it has something called high
throughput screening, where it tests those
[SPEAKER_00]: on cell cultures to see if anything
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just completely random.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, random works if you have enough
of a sample size, and you can afford it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But instead, how about if we look at
molecules that we already know operate on
[SPEAKER_00]: human receptors, in many cases for an
amazing array of benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does this have to do with this,
what Ethan called barefoot breeders?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with plant breeders my whole
career.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was a plant scientist before I went to
law school, and so I kind of got channeled
[SPEAKER_00]: to that in the first law firm I was in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I worked with some companies that were
developing special fruits and flowers that
[SPEAKER_00]: had great commercial potential,
and we helped them launch their licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: programs all over the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I get into this industry,
and I start seeing what the struggles that
[SPEAKER_00]: plant breeders who are passionate about
the plant, the struggles they face with
[SPEAKER_00]: taxation, regulation, licensing,
just funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized, okay, I've talked already
about standing up to Big Ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to be different from Big Ag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Ag is going to have the firepower to
do marker-assisted breeding and genetic
[SPEAKER_00]: engineering, all of that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: My sense is that we have in this
community, and yeah, I would say community
[SPEAKER_00]: is a better word than industry,
especially in this context.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have people who have decades,
individuals who have decades of experience
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding the plant, and we have at least
hundreds of them, maybe thousands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you think about how we can be
different from Big Ag and actually be way
[SPEAKER_00]: damn better than Big Ag, we've got the
biggest R&D team in the history of
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceuticals or medicines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we just took a snapshot of what
people have in their greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: in their seed collections, we've already
got way more person years of R&D on plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that are promising to be way more powerful
than combinatorial chemistry or even
[SPEAKER_00]: marker-assisted breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so my sense is we don't know all the
things that cannabinoids, Ethan's been
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know cannabinoids 1 and 2 is THC and
CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been talking about maybe cannabinoids
3 through 10, and they've got all these
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing potentialities.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then let's talk about cannabinoids 11
through 150.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to be able to find them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to be able to at least detect
them in high enough levels that we know
[SPEAKER_00]: which plants they're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to be able to find the plants to
breed, to elevate those levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then elevate the levels enough that we
can start to figure out what the hell they
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there any doubt that, you know,
if 1 through 10 have these incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful effects, any of which can be used
in the right way to have a beneficial
[SPEAKER_00]: effect, do you think that 11 through 150
are going to have some value?
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we don't know what it'll be yet,
but it's super exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our barefoot breeder program is that I
have, what I've found is I've worked with
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of plant breeders is some of them
are really good at business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the ones that are good at business,
you've heard of them, or some of you are
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's like, okay, the gene that makes
you a good plant breeder, whatever that
[SPEAKER_00]: gene, and it's not genetic, but if it
were, the gene that makes you a good plant
[SPEAKER_00]: breeder and the gene that makes you a good
business person, those are not linked,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a happy coincidence when that
happens, but it's a coincidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people who are
passionate about plant breeding and really
[SPEAKER_00]: good at it who don't even want to be
entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to start their own
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to go find funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to hire lawyers,
and on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And after talking with several breeders
that were like, they exactly fit that
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had amazing, work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd done amazing work.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had amazing cultivars, but zero
interest and maybe zero opportunity to
[SPEAKER_00]: become great entrepreneurs and take the
cultivars they had developed and really
[SPEAKER_00]: get them out there to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: After several of these kinds of
conversations, I realized that somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: ought to have something like a record
company where the breeders are the
[SPEAKER_00]: songwriters and the singers, and they
don't have to be good at anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: All they have to do is do what they're
passionate about and be good at it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then somebody else steps in and says,
okay, we got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll take it from here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the way, like a good record company
instead of a bad one, we will take care of
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be proud to work with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get paid fairly, and we'll get your
work out to the whole world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you can even have groupies.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, we all wish we had the groupies
that Ethan has, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But we were talking about that a while
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, the beauty of this is that they
can be good at what they're good at,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then they can let somebody else take
care of the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I talked to a few people about this in
the industry, and they were pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: receptive, very receptive to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I went to a friend of mine who
has been a really good CEO for some
[SPEAKER_00]: startup companies that I've worked with,
and I said, hey, would you be the CEO of
[SPEAKER_00]: this?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, no, but I'll help you be the
CEO and not fuck it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Edit that, please, I guess, maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so actually, Ethan and I are starting
a company called Breeders Best,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's really going to, this isn't even
a pitch for that because there needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: more than one of these.
[SPEAKER_00]: There needs to be a whole ecosystem of
companies like this so that breeders have
[SPEAKER_00]: more choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: My example of that is how boring would
downtown be if there was one restaurant
[SPEAKER_00]: and one bar?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's got to be selection to really
establish what is a fair market and what
[SPEAKER_00]: is a vibrant market and to give
opportunities to as many breeders as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're the first ones to try this
model, I think, and our goal is to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out, to hopefully be good at identifying
cultivars that really have strong
[SPEAKER_00]: potential and then protecting them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeder will own the rights
permanently.
[SPEAKER_00]: The breeder owns the rights.
[SPEAKER_00]: We would be the licensee, and we would
help them get this out to the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then probably the most exciting part
of this is that you've heard Ethan's wish
[SPEAKER_00]: list.
[SPEAKER_00]: He might now have access to a whole R&D
army like the world has never seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can communicate this, and we can
enlist breeders to say, hey, we can tell
[SPEAKER_00]: them, go look, see if you've got this
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might already have this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't, go make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ethan wants it, and he's a rock star,
and he's going to make you famous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're working on,
and we're excited about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not meant as a company pitch.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's meant as having us all think about
the vast potential here and that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: lots of ways to get from point A to point
B, but we need to get from point A to
[SPEAKER_00]: point B.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is us taking a shot at it,
but I just, I want as many breeders as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible to really succeed at this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_01]: Does this vision include, for instance,
testing for,
[SPEAKER_01]: are we going to be able to test some of
these things and sift them out and figure
[SPEAKER_01]: out what they are?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that part of the vision you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think if we ever have the money,
right now we have $10,000 in investment,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is pretty much paying for some
t-shirts in a booth at Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a start, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we had the money to do that,
I would love to, if some legacy breeder
[SPEAKER_00]: brings his or her seed collection and we
grow them up and test them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the breeders that I'm already
working with, he's a dear friend of mine
[SPEAKER_00]: now, and he actually sent some samples
that we will be able to try later on.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did vegetative testing at early stages
of some seeds that he obtained and found
[SPEAKER_00]: decently measurable levels of THCV even in
the leaves, selected some males,
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed them, and he's been working on
this project for a few years, but what he
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me on my way up here was a cultivar
that is 8.5% THCV and 17% THC and got a
[SPEAKER_00]: bottle of it that we can try.
[SPEAKER_00]: The point is that if we know what we're
looking for and people have these
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible collections and they have so
much passion to, you know, let's put the
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate with the peanut butter together.
[SPEAKER_00]: We might get something that tastes good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's incredible potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really do believe that it is old school
plant breeders that are going to change
[SPEAKER_00]: the face of medicine in the next couple
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's you and your friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do what I can to help with that,
but it's not, it doesn't depend on whether
[SPEAKER_00]: we do a good job of this or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on opportunities like this,
not only this, but opportunities like this
[SPEAKER_00]: for this great army of breeders.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted to say one other thing that I'm
really excited about.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabinoids 11 through 150.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know that if you can find it,
if it's there, it's going to do something
[SPEAKER_00]: with a cannabinoid receptor because that's
what cannabinoids do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things that we're doing
on kind of a heavy science part of this
[SPEAKER_00]: company is we're going to look at,
and I could talk about this now because
[SPEAKER_00]: we've done what we need to do to protect
it, but we're going to look at not just
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: If cannabinoids evolved as defense
molecules, do you think the plant might
[SPEAKER_00]: want to defend its roots and its seedlings
and its marist stems?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to look at other tissues to
see what turns on the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we find some there, we'll go to the
breeder that let us test this material and
[SPEAKER_00]: say, hey, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got some cool genetic there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to work on developing this
cannabinoid, there could be a real pot of
[SPEAKER_00]: gold at the end of the rainbow.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the kind of thing that with
investor support we would fund.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I really believe that the discovery
and use of cannabinoids 11 through
[SPEAKER_00]: infinity is going to come from old school
breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks so much, Dale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we didn't seem excited about your
8% THCV, oh, we are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're excited to smoke that later.
[SPEAKER_00]: 34.95% total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mostly THCV.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will be exciting.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's really proud of his work.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do that later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to add one thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What Dale said is not just theory.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't say too much about this,
but one of those undiscovered cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_03]: has shown recent tests.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it might explain why something tests at
10%, but people are getting their minds
[SPEAKER_03]: blown by it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's incredible potential out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, following on to what Dale said,
we know a few of the biosynthetic enzymes
[SPEAKER_03]: of the cannabinoids and a little bit in
the terpenoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: But how the plant controls that turns on
and off those genes has not been worked
[SPEAKER_03]: out at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are the kinds of things we'd
like to work on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it will require having the profiles
that are worth investigating to find out
[SPEAKER_03]: what makes this particular chemo vartic.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I can work on what it's good
for.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, we'd love to give you the
targets and have you get to work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Ethan, what about the four F's?
[SPEAKER_02]: Food, fiber, fuel, and pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like you covered that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, again, you know, I'm fond of saying
that if you're on the proverbial desert
[SPEAKER_03]: island and you had to pick one plant,
of course it should be cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been talking about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're going to say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe second.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to make a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: But unlike the potato, with cannabis,
you can not only have food, you can have
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine, you can have clothing,
you can have fuel.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's hard to burn a potato.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've burned potatoes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Apparently.
[SPEAKER_03]: Another thing I wanted to emphasize is,
as mentioned, other parts of the plant can
[SPEAKER_03]: be really valuable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're all familiar with fiber.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a walking Patagonia ad.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm wearing a good amount of hemp myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: But beyond that, I mentioned the fan
leaves before.
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually contain 0.2% of a thing
called canapren, which is a very promising
[SPEAKER_03]: anti-inflammatory agent.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now, going to waste.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nothing's been done with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you're probably familiar with hemp
seed nutrition, one of the most complete
[SPEAKER_03]: dietary ingredients on earth, having very
important essential fatty acids,
[SPEAKER_03]: as well as a high quality digestible
protein called adestin.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is in comparison to soybeans that can
contain genistein, which is actually very
[SPEAKER_03]: bad for your gut.
[SPEAKER_03]: Soybeans were described in China for 1,000
years before they appeared in the diet.
[SPEAKER_03]: It took them 1,000 years to figure out how
to use them in a way that wasn't bad
[SPEAKER_03]: nutritionally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why in Chinese food,
you see sprouts and fermented products.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't see raw soybeans being used.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm not an edamame fan.
[SPEAKER_03]: I will say that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if I turn those down at your meal,
you know why.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we've got the roots.
[SPEAKER_03]: The roots have been used traditionally in
medicine for as long as the flowers have.
[SPEAKER_03]: Interestingly, they don't contain any
cannabinoids, but they have very important
[SPEAKER_03]: other benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Trace amount of alkaloids and things
called triterpenoids, which again,
[SPEAKER_03]: very important anti-inflammatory and
anti-cancer effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Dale mentioned the flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flavonoids, I'll just talk about one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Flavonoids are very important antioxidant
molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you have a lot of good vegetables in
the diet, you'll be exposed to flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these will exert benefit on helping to
prevent cancer and things like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: One in particular, canflavin, A and B.
[SPEAKER_03]: Canflavins are unique to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They haven't been found in any other
plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have an anti-inflammatory profile
that is considered ideal in that they have
[SPEAKER_03]: the benefits of anti-inflammatories
without the liabilities of the
[SPEAKER_03]: non-steroidal anti-inflammatories,
which are all acting through enzyme COX-1
[SPEAKER_03]: or COX-2.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the side effects of those are well
known.
[SPEAKER_03]: They produce ulcers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can produce heart attacks or strokes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Canflavin doesn't have that activity and
should not have those side effects.
[SPEAKER_03]: So these are, again, just a few of the
products that we could extract or produce
[SPEAKER_03]: from cannabis beyond the flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
