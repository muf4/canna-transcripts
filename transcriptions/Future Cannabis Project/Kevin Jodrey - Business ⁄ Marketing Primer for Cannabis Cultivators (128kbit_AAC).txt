[SPEAKER_00]: Bottom line is you must create markets in
order for you to be in the market if you
[SPEAKER_00]: have something that's so Specific that
only three people want to buy it when
[SPEAKER_00]: those three people don't want to buy it
You're sitting on that shit, and you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't have an ability to sit on flour
You can't offload it you can't take it and
[SPEAKER_00]: say well now we're gonna blow it because
you've already processed it So you've
[SPEAKER_00]: wasted money you've spent time You have to
be very clear and the way this works is
[SPEAKER_00]: that you start to create these sun-grown
models?
[SPEAKER_00]: That allow the customer to say wow that
was really good I would like to buy more
[SPEAKER_00]: sun-grown instead of trying to fight for
your brand value what you fight for is a
[SPEAKER_00]: bigger picture of brand value that you can
then get under and Then you start to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to get differentiation you start to
get noticed once you're noticed you can
[SPEAKER_00]: now introduce the customer to what you do
and Then you can start to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: release the information of when your
products gonna come out if you follow the
[SPEAKER_00]: way people buy things They don't like
variety everyone's like I love variety,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm like really how many different
kind of shoes you got?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that many women women like variety and
shoes, but really they don't buy How many
[SPEAKER_00]: different foods do you buy how many
different things?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you really buy when you go you go to
the supermarket?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you leave at the different item every
time no?
[SPEAKER_00]: You have a range of things that you use
and that's basically how people function
[SPEAKER_00]: is they work off a repetition and pattern
and So what you have to do is really?
[SPEAKER_00]: Realize that that when you go into a
store, and there's 400 varieties The
[SPEAKER_00]: customer goes too many and they ask the
person who's selling it What's selling
[SPEAKER_00]: what's hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you like and in a simple sentence
you've destroyed the business for almost
[SPEAKER_00]: every one of those farms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the relationship has to be built
with the people who are interfacing with
[SPEAKER_00]: the public You have to be able to let them
understand why your product is better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to give them a t-shirt You
don't need to give them a hat they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: give a shit They're gonna give it away
what you need to give them is product
[SPEAKER_00]: Aloha I I command you because every time I
see you you give the same thing a pack of
[SPEAKER_00]: matches There's some pre-roll and two
business cards So you don't lose the damn
[SPEAKER_00]: thing and what that does it develops a
relationship so that people start to see
[SPEAKER_00]: you as an individual Not just the company
and they get to experience your product
[SPEAKER_00]: and they say hey the last couple times I
smoked it that she was pretty good when I
[SPEAKER_00]: go to the store and I need To pre-roll
I'll look for that blue and white box and
[SPEAKER_00]: they start to pattern and I think that
these are the things that we really need
[SPEAKER_00]: to discuss and talk about in in in an
honest sense because what happens is
[SPEAKER_00]: people become very very protective of
their genetics because it's your Material
[SPEAKER_00]: that represents you and so you're
emotionally connected to it and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: like I am my genes But you're not you're
not your genes There's something that you
[SPEAKER_00]: work with and over the course of your
career you have Definitely grown more than
[SPEAKER_00]: one line and so because of that what
you've done is you've always moved into
[SPEAKER_00]: things that are marketable and to me the
the destruction of our culture in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity of genetics was really around
2002 and that was when the perp came out
[SPEAKER_00]: and so when the perp came out the perp
comes into this perfect storm of Internet
[SPEAKER_00]: and it comes into, okay where you start
okay, and I don't mean the university I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about when Oakland became oakster
dam and the blunt and how people bought
[SPEAKER_00]: pot and So I'm watching this this I had
the perp couple years before it got hot
[SPEAKER_00]: and all of a sudden it blew up And I
couldn't understand why it blew up so I
[SPEAKER_00]: said I'm going down the bay to check this
out so I was always tied into the the hood
[SPEAKER_00]: in the bay so I said let's go into the
hood and let's figure out why people are
[SPEAKER_00]: buying the perp and When they ran up to my
car and threw that bag in the window I
[SPEAKER_00]: realized that under streetlights that
purple color with those orange hairs was
[SPEAKER_00]: instantly recognized in a way that nothing
else resonated and what it did is it let
[SPEAKER_00]: people get a hold of a variety that was
high in sesquiterpines that didn't taste
[SPEAKER_00]: like shit in the blunt so the blunt and
streetlights and instant recognizability
[SPEAKER_00]: created this desire and in a brief second
if you weren't in purple business you
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't in business and at that moment
every single person I knew who had
[SPEAKER_00]: collections of genetics they had
incredible lines from the past couldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: sell Any pot and so they started throwing
away all this material and going into the
[SPEAKER_00]: perp Because you can't hold libraries if
you're poor You can't hold collections if
[SPEAKER_00]: you pour it's kind of hard to light up a
mom room if you're not selling the clones
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of hard to hold a huge
collection if it's a risk and it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: felony if you're not getting paid because
if you're not getting paid you can't
[SPEAKER_00]: afford a lawyer and so if you're really in
business you kind of understand I need to
[SPEAKER_00]: make enough money to afford lawyers or I'm
gonna go to straight to prison because a
[SPEAKER_00]: public defender is only there to negotiate
a deal they're not there to beat a case so
[SPEAKER_00]: if your career at what you do there was
these realities that shaped your decisions
[SPEAKER_00]: and the purpose the first variety that
took over a market on a wide level and
[SPEAKER_00]: basically wiped out everything else and I
looked at that situation because I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: jump on it as quick as I should because I
couldn't understand why people were so
[SPEAKER_00]: caught up with it when there was all this
killer cannabis we were still consuming
[SPEAKER_00]: and growing and I was like People just not
making the right decision and I realized
[SPEAKER_00]: that what I was doing was I was
emotionally Blinding myself to the market
[SPEAKER_00]: reality and so when I went down and said I
got you They're doing it because of this
[SPEAKER_00]: it let me know that we needed to focus on
per production We needed to focus on perp
[SPEAKER_00]: nurseries We need to get better models to
get the perp higher level and more perp
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if it was anything under an 80 20
in terms of perp to green ratio,
[SPEAKER_00]: it didn't have the money So you started
seeing perp quantified as hundreds or 90?
[SPEAKER_00]: 10s or 80 20s or 70 30s mean in perp to
green ratios and It's changed the
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in to the degree that we've never
come back to the diversity prior The small
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary operations allowed people to be
able to move micro loads You know 10 15
[SPEAKER_00]: pounds to dispensaries in a diverse form
for a long time So most people who aren't
[SPEAKER_00]: old like me that had actually hustle in
the day they got used to 215 protection
[SPEAKER_00]: and storefronts to move pot and So they
said people love my stuff they do because
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a storefront to sell it and it's
convenient But as soon as they shut those
[SPEAKER_00]: storefronts down you screwed and everyone
said I'm gonna use Instagram You screwed
[SPEAKER_00]: when they ban you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna use Facebook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They banned you I'm gonna use Craigslist.
[SPEAKER_00]: They banned you so all of a sudden all
your marketing tools are gone You have no
[SPEAKER_00]: tools and all you now have is desperation
where you're begging to find a distributor
[SPEAKER_00]: who will possibly take your product and
then find some place to move it and what
[SPEAKER_00]: takes place is that you are victimized in
that process and when I when I researched
[SPEAKER_00]: this I discovered that the poorest person
in the economy is the agricultural worker
[SPEAKER_00]: the agricultural worker is the single
lowest paid person in any industry and I
[SPEAKER_00]: was like We're gonna get buried alive
because there is no appreciation for
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not how America works We work off
an industrial model so what we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: work off of is this luxury model and the
luxury model was highlighted in a quote I
[SPEAKER_00]: saw from the guy that owned Rolex and The
the the world was turbulent and a reporter
[SPEAKER_00]: yelled at the owner Rolex.
[SPEAKER_00]: How's the watch business and he goes?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not in the watch business.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the luxury business and I'm balling
and I was like I got you he was able to
[SPEAKER_00]: transcend an industry by perception and
It's perception that you're working with
[SPEAKER_00]: and right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're perceived as losers Because we
somehow aren't able to be 60 million
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar companies And because of that
consumers don't have access to your
[SPEAKER_00]: products at stores And so the black market
may be pumping because it's cheaper But
[SPEAKER_00]: the people that are coming into the new
market Don't buy in that form because they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know people that are growing The
people that you want to start to sell to
[SPEAKER_00]: with this burgeoning new groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: They only go to storefronts They only know
that access and they're the ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to allow you to be able to get
product That's in and move because as they
[SPEAKER_00]: systematically shut Down the black market
and they will over time it'll always
[SPEAKER_00]: exist, but I'm not buying any any beer on
the street corner I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's very few items that that we buy
That if they can get the tax rates low
[SPEAKER_00]: enough and they can get the supply
convenient enough Do you go to all the
[SPEAKER_00]: trouble to get it in the black?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just buy it normally and so the
situation is that you have to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you doing in the short term?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you can survive in the long term
and what I tell Most people is you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go take a look at your distributor first
who you who you working with and in this
[SPEAKER_00]: guy knows topics on genetics but it's the
genetics that you're using that allow this
[SPEAKER_00]: to take place and and to me the discussion
of how do you get paid is more important
[SPEAKER_00]: than anything else because you're not
going to survive if you don't and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not crystal clear about that shit
and grow six in your yard and enjoy being
[SPEAKER_00]: a cannabis consumer and have the best time
you've ever had because they can't get you
[SPEAKER_00]: in trouble for that and you can enjoy the
culture you can enjoy being a cultivator
[SPEAKER_00]: you can share with your friends you can do
all this wonderful stuff but if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be in business boy you better be
crystal clear who you're playing with and
[SPEAKER_00]: when I go take a look at operations that
are about to spit out two hundred and
[SPEAKER_00]: fifty thousand pounds a year with
brilliant individuals running them with
[SPEAKER_00]: agricultural programs that are on point
how do you compete and the only way that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going to do this is through being
crafty and crafty meaning you're good at
[SPEAKER_00]: what you do but you're sly and so you have
to be able to start to figure out the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that you produce what regions in
the state like those things I did this
[SPEAKER_00]: United States wide for clone operations
because the reality of it is all the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that was grown here majority of
it 90% was moving out of the area and so
[SPEAKER_00]: what I did is I did market analysis of all
the major regions in the US so I could
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what they wanted and when you
came in and spoke to me I would have a
[SPEAKER_00]: private consult with you and I'd ask you
where you're moving it and if you were
[SPEAKER_00]: moving it to Florida I knew what I knew
what you should grow and if you were
[SPEAKER_00]: moving it into certain into certain places
certain demographics certain niches I
[SPEAKER_00]: could tell you what you should grow so
that you had an ability to actually sell
[SPEAKER_00]: the product otherwise you're just growing
something hoping that it's going to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: and when the market was under produced
everything sold if you lived in Humboldt
[SPEAKER_00]: you know about red dog red dog was this
green thing covered in red hair that was
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't get your high she's laughing in the
back but you remember the days a red dog
[SPEAKER_00]: when red dog ran wild in the hills of
Soham that shits biomass fodder you
[SPEAKER_00]: wouldn't give it to a goat it was 4,800
bucks a pound people started to believe
[SPEAKER_00]: that they were actually successful because
there was a shortage of product and the
[SPEAKER_00]: fact that you could get it into the system
major major shot made you fly but as soon
[SPEAKER_00]: as it changed you were out of business and
so what I recommend to people is you
[SPEAKER_00]: really need to take a look at your supply
chain who is your distributor and who do
[SPEAKER_00]: they sell to and the key thing that I
think that we need to work on is the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to hold your genomic forms after
you've produced them in a manner that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't destroy the quality of the product
until it can move into the supply chain
[SPEAKER_00]: because once you let go of it everything I
see in the dispensary almost 90% of it is
[SPEAKER_00]: diminished and I know most of the people I
deal with I've historically done local
[SPEAKER_00]: sourcing and so I go and meet you I check
out your stuff and I'm like it's primo by
[SPEAKER_00]: the time it gets to me in a jar it's not
primo anymore and I look at the dates and
[SPEAKER_00]: I realize wow that was a seventh month
time frame that took for you to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: from here to get it to me and how many
people are really thrilled right now with
[SPEAKER_00]: their business models like man I'm so
happy I'm just gonna jump up and down and
[SPEAKER_00]: cheer not many and a lot of it is because
you can't get return on your money at a
[SPEAKER_00]: rate of speed that lets you cover your
costs and so what you have to do is you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to like I said earlier is take a look
at what you're trying to sell and realize
[SPEAKER_00]: that the things that you produce as
incredible as they may be don't get rid of
[SPEAKER_00]: them but sometimes you just have to hold
them so I hold banks of plants that I know
[SPEAKER_00]: will come back into trend for me it's old
stuff it's stuff from the 70s 80s and 90s
[SPEAKER_00]: things that make me happy from my youth I
know who I want to go after I want to go
[SPEAKER_00]: after 50 to 70 year old people people that
have disposable income because 30 year
[SPEAKER_00]: olds that are the the biggest population
of dispensary people are cheap because
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't have disposable income so
they're not gonna buy a lot of your weed
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're gonna buy little bits of your
shit and they're gonna be hyper picky
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's all they have to do is be
picky and you're in the wrong market and
[SPEAKER_00]: so for me I know where I'm gonna go
because I define it and it allows me to
[SPEAKER_00]: say okay my future is to go after things
from the past does that mean I can sell
[SPEAKER_00]: them to today no but I will in the future
once we can start to establish our market
[SPEAKER_00]: share what am I doing this season on my
own farm biomass because I know that I
[SPEAKER_00]: said if I can get 500 a pound versus 700 a
pound and it leaves all in two days and it
[SPEAKER_00]: comes back in two months why that's a good
business decision and yes I might lose
[SPEAKER_00]: total profit potentially but more than
likely I'm gonna make way more than I ever
[SPEAKER_00]: would have made if I try to play the weed
game I'm looking at so many people jarring
[SPEAKER_00]: shit up and I'm like this is unbelievable
you're not gonna sell this crap and by the
[SPEAKER_00]: time you do it's gonna be diminished and
it's gonna make you look like you're
[SPEAKER_00]: inferior and so when I go to I taught
dispensaries constantly and I look at
[SPEAKER_00]: product non-stop and I go wow I saw the
truth of it people love indoor because the
[SPEAKER_00]: people who do indoor production are
typically better financed because in order
[SPEAKER_00]: to put together a 3,000 light operation
you have to have a lot of money and when
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a lot of money you also have
financial planners that say hey we need to
[SPEAKER_00]: have supply chain management so let's get
a distribution license let's get a partner
[SPEAKER_00]: that has storefront ability let's get
packaging and manufacturing and so all of
[SPEAKER_00]: a sudden they can get their product to the
store in two months so indoor in two
[SPEAKER_00]: months is different than outdoor in seven
months and the problem with it is is the
[SPEAKER_00]: customer is unhappy and so I go in and and
have friends that buy product from an
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible number of dispensaries because
they are they're older and they have money
[SPEAKER_00]: they're affluent and they love weed and so
they sample pot constantly and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: never-endingly dismayed at the quality and
they're always horrified at Humboldt and
[SPEAKER_00]: Trinity and Mendocino God the herb is
fucked and I said it's not let me bring
[SPEAKER_00]: you up to Humboldt and let's go smoke
fresh weed and then they're like my god
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the best part I ever smoked but it's
lost in translation and so what I tell
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are caught in these situations
is that you need to have flour that is
[SPEAKER_00]: rock-hard because processing and
manufacturing will not damage it it needs
[SPEAKER_00]: to not be so mono turp dominant because
unless they keep that stuff at below 68
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna destroy it it needs to be
heavy sesquad dominant so that when they
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke it and burn it they get the
experience and you need to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: it yields enough in a convenient enough
way so that you're actually making money
[SPEAKER_00]: on what you're doing and people like yeah
but that's commercial I said no no it's
[SPEAKER_00]: targeted commercial is massive production
you're doing targeted production and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're putting yourself in a situation by
using genetic choices to find things that
[SPEAKER_00]: work one of the things I think that's a
important point is that you find what
[SPEAKER_00]: variety worked under what methodology
because you're gonna choose things that
[SPEAKER_00]: your friend grew and the problem is that
your location doesn't produce the same
[SPEAKER_00]: product so something needs to have a
cooler temperature and if it's warmer you
[SPEAKER_00]: flare off these monos no matter what you
do and if it's not sunny and hot enough
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't get density and therefore that's
an issue and so when you're trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: match up what you put on the market and
you're choosing things that people have
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're trying to do is make sure all
the factors match so that you can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: take data it's called extrapolating if I
take data from one set and apply it to
[SPEAKER_00]: another it doesn't mean it's accurate it
doesn't you have to make sure that
[SPEAKER_00]: everything holds true in both sets
otherwise what you're doing is you're
[SPEAKER_00]: you're you're doing a guess and what we
want to be able to do is take the
[SPEAKER_00]: information that you all have which is
this unbelievable quantity of information
[SPEAKER_00]: of how do you create incredible cannabis
and then what varieties shined in those
[SPEAKER_00]: production methodologies and then instead
of looking at your neighbor like he's your
[SPEAKER_00]: friggin competitor he's not he's your
collaborator you're all basically in
[SPEAKER_00]: collusion if you have to be careful
because I get yelled at when I say those
[SPEAKER_00]: words because price fix and collusion
scare the regulators but that is the drug
[SPEAKER_00]: business and it's also community business
and as long as you don't agree to set
[SPEAKER_00]: price you can most definitely communicate
about how to do production and what I did
[SPEAKER_00]: for this event was Josh brought me this
incredible plant that he bred so Josh a
[SPEAKER_00]: humble guy excellent cultivator and very
good at sifting good genetic material and
[SPEAKER_00]: he says kev I sift this out I want to give
you a copy here's some of the flower
[SPEAKER_00]: here's the plant and I smelled it and I
said holy shit that's sellable and so I
[SPEAKER_00]: did the snake jama test where I put it in
a jar and I hold it up to you and when you
[SPEAKER_00]: smell it I move the jar around and if I
can get you to dance with the jar back and
[SPEAKER_00]: forth and then you realize I got you I got
you so that lets me clearly know that you
[SPEAKER_00]: were enthralled by the flowers so much
that you didn't give a shit that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: making you move up and down and jump all
over the place then you realize whoa I was
[SPEAKER_00]: so attracted to the flower that you had
hypnotized me like it was a flute and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: snake charming and so then we go okay it
has the nose to grab someone's attention
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you smoke it and you go yes it
matches profile the expectation of the
[SPEAKER_00]: nose is delivered in the mouth so that you
don't let someone down how many times have
[SPEAKER_00]: you smoked something that was incredible
in the nose and it was hay in the mouth
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're like hey garbage and so the
problem is you're disappointed so you
[SPEAKER_00]: can't disappoint them so the profiles have
to match I'd rather have it low in the
[SPEAKER_00]: nose and awesome in the mouth than vice
versa and so his variety matched
[SPEAKER_00]: identically and so and I'm someone who
studies market and I'm good at picking
[SPEAKER_00]: things that go into markets and I said
whoo that has everything we want in taste
[SPEAKER_00]: and in smell visually it works what's the
highlight beautiful and I said oh this is
[SPEAKER_00]: a tool and it's not a tool that you need
to switch your whole garden to but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that you produce and what you do
is as a cultivator you're not allowed to
[SPEAKER_00]: do a lot of the things you were prior but
just like today I'm bringing six plants
[SPEAKER_00]: because I can bring six plants anywhere I
want I'm allowed to have six plants in my
[SPEAKER_00]: possession anytime I choose so therefore I
can bring six plants into this building
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can hand them to you with no
illegalities you can go to any one of
[SPEAKER_00]: these dispensaries across the state with
an ounce in your pocket and you can go and
[SPEAKER_00]: meet the people who are running these
facilities and you can say here here's
[SPEAKER_00]: some stuff that we mess around with and
what you do is you hit him with shit that
[SPEAKER_00]: slaps him in the mouth so hard it
basically takes the teeth out of the back
[SPEAKER_00]: of the jaw and they go wow that's
incredible because it's something that
[SPEAKER_00]: most people don't get their hands on and
that's an introduction so things like that
[SPEAKER_00]: allow you to open doors and so what I did
is I brought these plants in and I said
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna auction them off mean and you're
gonna pull straws to see who gets them but
[SPEAKER_00]: the real truth of it is is that I'm gonna
give them to you and you're gonna figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out a bunch of you share the goddamn thing
you're gonna take the plants and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna say listen I'll cultivate it I can
share a clone because you can share clones
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst each other as cultivators every
farm has an ability to produce its own
[SPEAKER_00]: material I helped write these laws on how
nurseries farms and stores interrelate
[SPEAKER_00]: because I have all of them and I said
nursery should be able to sell product but
[SPEAKER_00]: not retail farm should be able to not be a
slave to a nursery they should be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: have their own nursery option but they
shouldn't be able to sell the nursery
[SPEAKER_00]: products they grow because then it then it
competes with the nursery stores should be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to sell the retail so that each one
of these operations has an ability to make
[SPEAKER_00]: money because otherwise what happens is
you're favoring one over another and they
[SPEAKER_00]: all have to get paid a good business deal
is both of us walk away satisfied if we if
[SPEAKER_00]: we walk away pissed off bad business so in
order to make it work you have to create a
[SPEAKER_00]: fairness and in the situation that we
created so that we'd be able to have some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of success in the different forms was
that individuals who had their own farms
[SPEAKER_00]: could do their own nurseries for
themselves they could breed they could
[SPEAKER_00]: produce seed they could produce clonal
form you can share six plants and so I
[SPEAKER_00]: brought these plants and I propped up some
plants and I brought in six and I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: give them out but what you want to be able
to do is don't be a prick and hoard it
[SPEAKER_00]: take the plant and share it with the
people that you know so that what you have
[SPEAKER_00]: is something that was selected out of 400
plants in a greenhouse in Washington that
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely caught my eye so heavily that I
said whoa that's the introduction you take
[SPEAKER_00]: something like that you use that as an
introduction to the to the stores you
[SPEAKER_00]: introduce it to your distributors because
when they smell it it's instant
[SPEAKER_00]: sellability and what it does it allows you
to start to enter a market and then now
[SPEAKER_00]: you start to get a conversation but when
you're having to give things that are
[SPEAKER_00]: delicate and nuanced and fragile and and
designed for people who are more caught up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the ethereal qualities of cannabis
that's a limited number so in all our
[SPEAKER_00]: minds everyone knows pot like this and
then people get pissed off at bud tenders
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't know what they're doing I had
to give them an education I'm like they
[SPEAKER_00]: get paid 15 bucks an hour what do you
expect you got paid four hundred thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: a year to grow weed of course you're
intelligent at it because you get paid for
[SPEAKER_00]: it and you get to spend all your time
doing it but someone who's making almost
[SPEAKER_00]: minimum wage how smart do you think they
are about your product and you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: give them this long drawn-out bullshit
story about how special you are and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like look I'm gonna get a fucking
paycheck I just want to do my job but they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't want to do a bad job it's just that
how much education can they possibly have
[SPEAKER_00]: little unless you paid tenders 30 bucks an
hour which is like a living wage and they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't so what you have to do is make it
easy you have to make things loud you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to make things rich you have to make them
to where they're sellable and then what it
[SPEAKER_00]: does it allows a tender to recommend a
product that then makes them look good so
[SPEAKER_00]: the person who comes back doesn't tell
them you recommended some bullshit I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want to deal with you anymore because
everyone who buys weed I've my whole
[SPEAKER_00]: career I've seen it they are not
connoisseur in anything but when they come
[SPEAKER_00]: in they break out a loop I'm like holy
Christ here it comes because in cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: you could be ultra picky and and have this
ultra high level but everything else in
[SPEAKER_00]: your life you cause dirty your fucking
sneakers are falling apart your house is a
[SPEAKER_00]: shithole you got friends that are that are
that are nuts but with your herb you're
[SPEAKER_00]: the most discriminating connoisseur in the
planet and and since that's a reality you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to work with that reality and what
you do is you make it easy and so I know
[SPEAKER_00]: some people gonna be like damn I was gonna
win me one of those plants but really what
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to do is I want to give mine y'all
figure out who gets them I'm gonna put
[SPEAKER_00]: them on the table and y'all figure out who
gets them and get some share some phone
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers and say look give me a cut of that
thing when you prop it because you can
[SPEAKER_00]: share a cut with your friends and what
you're doing is you're doing regenerative
[SPEAKER_00]: culture you want to live you you better
work together you're gonna die and it is
[SPEAKER_00]: so clear I get to I get to do consultation
for some of the largest companies in the
[SPEAKER_00]: world and they fly and and I don't go
visit them I make them come visit me here
[SPEAKER_00]: because it brings them down to your level
so they have to fly into Humboldt they
[SPEAKER_00]: gotta rent a car drive to my greenhouse
and I look like I'm homeless half the time
[SPEAKER_00]: I shaved today I'm serious I shaved today
otherwise I'll get the janitor and and
[SPEAKER_00]: half the time when people meet me the
first time they think I am the janitor and
[SPEAKER_00]: they ask me hey where's the guy that I'm
supposed to talk to and I always busted
[SPEAKER_00]: balls and say oh the smart guys are in
that other room and they all go there and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they have to come back and they go
and and for me it's great because I like
[SPEAKER_00]: to play games like that because I'm really
checking you out as a person and and what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're doing is we're mentally wrestling
and once we even the playing field now
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna have to play and that's the
point of this this lecture is that man
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done these lectures forever on this
stuff but this one's specific because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: about everyone in the room that I
experienced their cannabis is really good
[SPEAKER_00]: grass I would say across the board 95% of
the stuff that I see the people in the
[SPEAKER_00]: space produce and I smoke and I see it's
gorgeous pot the question is who you
[SPEAKER_00]: selling it to and how do you get it to him
and how do you make sure you have
[SPEAKER_00]: something that the market wants and how do
you make sure you're not just looking on
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram saying oh my god I need a
skittle gelato hybrid or I'm screwed well
[SPEAKER_00]: the problem is everyone else has the same
idea if I don't have purple punch I'm well
[SPEAKER_00]: you get purple punch you got punched in
the eye you got a black eye because people
[SPEAKER_00]: only buy it once now you can hybridize it
and take those those visual qualities
[SPEAKER_00]: forward but if you're consuming it you're
like yes all I know nose no mouth no power
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram pot and so the people that are
in cannabis unfortunately because we were
[SPEAKER_00]: so and I was too I was someone who had
multiple identities I used to change rigs
[SPEAKER_00]: and and and outfits to go check all the
operations I ran I was somebody who was
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly under surveillance I used to
have the cops going through my trash and I
[SPEAKER_00]: used to take all the dog shit in the yard
and put it in the garbage so that when
[SPEAKER_00]: they went through the fucking bags that's
what they got was a bag of shit and and so
[SPEAKER_00]: you know I had to pay the price for this
but the bottom line is that I was somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who was living in a I
[SPEAKER_00]: was living a very secretive quiet life and
I'm not I'm someone who loves to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about what we're doing but I'm not someone
who's loud in public I'm kind of quiet
[SPEAKER_00]: which people find hard to believe but
actually I am and and I was very secretive
[SPEAKER_00]: with what I did criminally because I came
from a criminal background from family
[SPEAKER_00]: members that were an organized crime and
so I learned let's shut your mouth and
[SPEAKER_00]: never rat on your crew and you be
intelligent every step of the way because
[SPEAKER_00]: the punishments real and when you go and
visit your family in prison year after
[SPEAKER_00]: year you go all the punishments real and
so I was very very quiet and when I got
[SPEAKER_00]: into the position to be in what we call
legal cannabis what I did was I realized
[SPEAKER_00]: that in order for me to make the education
work I had to shut off all my black market
[SPEAKER_00]: operations so I took this massive pay cut
to become normal and and everyone who knew
[SPEAKER_00]: me was like they thought I lost my mind
they were like you lost your friggin mind
[SPEAKER_00]: man you you basically going to be poor and
I said kinda what I'm gonna do is be free
[SPEAKER_00]: so that no matter what I do anywhere I go
I'm not afraid of you coming to my house
[SPEAKER_00]: and checking out my shit my fact every
event I put on I invited the sheriff's and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the regulators so much so that
eventually they just said fuck we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be around you anymore because it's
almost a waste of time but what it did was
[SPEAKER_00]: it let me participate at a level of
involvement that was absolute to where I
[SPEAKER_00]: wasn't half step in I wasn't towed I
wasn't dip in I was fully submerged in the
[SPEAKER_00]: real because I was so afraid that I was
gonna reach older age and be working at
[SPEAKER_00]: Walmart I'd spent my whole life in
cannabis and it was such an incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: life and it was such a rich full rewarding
life that I realized that I need to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: this out and there was nobody that had a
map there was I didn't copy anybody you
[SPEAKER_00]: know the vertical nurse I was a first
person do vertical nursery in the country
[SPEAKER_00]: and so these models that I was coming up
with were based off the fact that I was
[SPEAKER_00]: looking for a way through a problem and
because I didn't have any any fear of you
[SPEAKER_00]: catching me and I knew that there was no
statute limitations issue with what I had
[SPEAKER_00]: done because I hadn't done any capital
crimes I could be unbelievably open and
[SPEAKER_00]: because of it it let me connect into the
media and it let me connect into
[SPEAKER_00]: universities and it let me connect into
academia and let me connect into massive
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses and it allowed me to be able to
get an education to a degree that almost
[SPEAKER_00]: no one I know has because I've spoken to
every monster in the game and what they
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted was my knowledge of a thing and I
made them trade me knowledge I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: let you hire me as a consultant you got to
play a game with me because I already had
[SPEAKER_00]: most of my stuff I own my property I own
my home and I made enough money doing
[SPEAKER_00]: legal cannabis on a salary that I could
afford to take care of my children and pay
[SPEAKER_00]: my basic bills I just didn't have
disposable money in anymore but the fact
[SPEAKER_00]: that I had already achieved the success
and I was building businesses that were
[SPEAKER_00]: generating millions of dollars let me have
an audience which then let me have an
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to use that power to blow a hole
in the wall so that everybody behind me
[SPEAKER_00]: that I knew could run through it so when
I'm able to take a look at a market and
[SPEAKER_00]: say that's the hot spot I go and tell my
friends that's the hot spot and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: something that I found that I'm
historically good at is it's a game called
[SPEAKER_00]: where's the money it's over there I can
see the money it moved it's over there now
[SPEAKER_00]: and I make sure I pay attention to this
and I make sure I use the tools that I
[SPEAKER_00]: have to share the information with the
people I'm around because unlike a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: people I saw drugs on a global level when
I got into when I get in trouble as a kid
[SPEAKER_00]: I went in the military when I when I got
out of training school I go back to high
[SPEAKER_00]: school and graduate and I looked at all my
friends and I realized we were all going
[SPEAKER_00]: to go to prison for the rest of our lives
and a bunch of them were gonna die and
[SPEAKER_00]: they did they're in the joint for the rest
of their life for crime or they got killed
[SPEAKER_00]: in crime and I was like this isn't what I
want and I didn't have any any alternative
[SPEAKER_00]: so I went in the military and when I went
in the military I became a salvage diver
[SPEAKER_00]: and because I was young and I was bold I
would dive on any project and so the
[SPEAKER_00]: military used to loan me out to the DOJ
and the DEA and in the mid 80s I used to
[SPEAKER_00]: get dropped out of helicopters in the
middle of the ocean on a billions of
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars worth of drugs so I got to see
what hundreds of tons of cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: cocaine look like coming into the country
and I realized holy shit we're smoking a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of weed and I realized that nobody
that you were in around was a competitor
[SPEAKER_00]: because nobody that you knew was producing
a hundred and twenty tons of weed and it
[SPEAKER_00]: was in the it was in these conversations
with the drug traffickers that I realized
[SPEAKER_00]: and they helped me understand it that
really I was actually way more like them
[SPEAKER_00]: than I was the military and that the
future of the world was going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and so I just said well I might
as well start to restudy it on like a
[SPEAKER_00]: scientific level and when I got out of the
military in 89 I sparked up indoor using
[SPEAKER_00]: the government vehicle to pick up all my
lights and so that background of seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in the billion dollar levels and
seeing you know half a billion dollars of
[SPEAKER_00]: cocaine and you realize oh there's a lot
of drugs being consumed and so it changed
[SPEAKER_00]: my perspective on the people I'm around
because you are not my competitor you are
[SPEAKER_00]: not the hole is so huge that the
perception that we're in competition is
[SPEAKER_00]: what screwed us because you had petty
competition with each other and you didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: share the info you don't share the genomic
forms you don't share the contacts you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't share the connects and I'm someone
who historically always have because of
[SPEAKER_00]: that experience and it changed me because
when you realize that nobody that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: around is the competitor that you're
collecting elaborator what it does it
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to allow you to share information
and I was been able to use that ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: gather knowledge so that I could survive
and I'm always really clear about it my my
[SPEAKER_00]: mission is to not be 65 years old working
at Walmart and I don't fault you if you
[SPEAKER_00]: work there but I know damn well you wish
you weren't you really wish you weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: having to work at 65 years old make a
minimum wage having to figure out how to
[SPEAKER_00]: chop up tuna can into six meals because
otherwise you're gonna be broke and I've
[SPEAKER_00]: seen enough people that were poor I was
around enough poverty enough struggle to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that when you're young you can
handle the beaten but when you're older
[SPEAKER_00]: you might not be able to and if God help
you you get sick and so my whole direction
[SPEAKER_00]: was I believe that cannabis will one day
be normalized and I believe one day we
[SPEAKER_00]: will have a craft industry but how do we
get from there to here and so that's why I
[SPEAKER_00]: give up so much information all the video
stuff I shoot is to share this information
[SPEAKER_00]: is really because I was covered so heavily
by all the major media I've been every
[SPEAKER_00]: newspaper in the country at the same time
simultaneously multiple times so if
[SPEAKER_00]: there's 1,500 newspapers in America I was
in every one of them same day over and
[SPEAKER_00]: over it was unreal and it was something
that I didn't intend to have happen it
[SPEAKER_00]: just did but I realized that if I use that
as a tool then I would be able to use it
[SPEAKER_00]: as a tool to help out my crew and when I
get into medical cannabis really heavily I
[SPEAKER_00]: realized that my crew was everybody I was
involved with in any capacity and so
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what the lecture today is really
about is what we did is we brought in all
[SPEAKER_00]: these killer breeders because the breeders
are the individuals that give you paint
[SPEAKER_00]: that you use to paint your picture and the
picture that people want to buy changes
[SPEAKER_00]: over time and you can only be so
intelligent with your palette and so what
[SPEAKER_00]: you need to do is you need to have access
to other people's palettes and the
[SPEAKER_00]: palettes that they use you can then use to
freshen up your paint so you're still in
[SPEAKER_00]: the selling art business otherwise you're
in the hang in the art business and people
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't buying it and to me the breeder is
completely diminished because no one
[SPEAKER_00]: understands really the work it takes to do
what they do and so I get connected to
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding all the time but I'm not a
breeder I'm someone who's a seed
[SPEAKER_00]: reproducer where I hold genomic forms in
seed form because I've been raided and and
[SPEAKER_00]: armed robbed and and workers kill shit and
you kill shit to where I've lost so much
[SPEAKER_00]: material that I like redundancy so if I
can take something I like and put it into
[SPEAKER_00]: seed form I can I can seal it put it away
and hopefully I can keep that genomic form
[SPEAKER_00]: through time so my breeding desires are
really to hold material and then to do
[SPEAKER_00]: sifting but I don't breathe breed for
stabilized lines I don't breed for the
[SPEAKER_00]: market so I don't consider myself a
breeder at all and I highlight the people
[SPEAKER_00]: that I do consider breeders because what
it does it allows me to utilize their
[SPEAKER_00]: artistic ability to stay current and if I
can be somehow involved with them in a
[SPEAKER_00]: positive way where I can promote them I
can carry their work I can introduce them
[SPEAKER_00]: to the public I can then utilize them in
collaboration then what happens is we both
[SPEAKER_00]: survive I stay current the breeder stays
current and so it was the basis of the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole breeder series we did a couple years
back where I paid for all of that that was
[SPEAKER_00]: that's free so my company paid for all of
that because I wanted the public to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that as much prop as you give
me I'm only someone who works with
[SPEAKER_00]: material that I get from them and I wanted
people to understand who the them was and
[SPEAKER_00]: I wanted people to understand what made
them and what drove them and where do they
[SPEAKER_00]: see the directions coming so that people
could make an emotional connection to them
[SPEAKER_00]: and then say you're the person I want to
work with because my desire is pain relief
[SPEAKER_00]: in cannabis I want to go that route and
you're someone who bred for that
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically in all your lines your
selection process was for people who are
[SPEAKER_00]: in extreme pain you're someone who breeds
for visual stunning you understand trendy
[SPEAKER_00]: markets you're someone who breeds for
resistance you're someone who breeds for
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass you're someone who breeds for
extraction every one of these people have
[SPEAKER_00]: a specific direction you can't be all of
them I don't care how bright you are I
[SPEAKER_00]: meet some of the smartest people in the
world and I'm telling you some of them
[SPEAKER_00]: can't tie their friggin shoe they have to
wear velcro but they can they can split an
[SPEAKER_00]: atom and they can't tie their shoes
because you're not everybody in all things
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis is so massive and so diverse
and so complicated and so complex that the
[SPEAKER_00]: only way you're going to survive is if you
paint the picture so that everyone has
[SPEAKER_00]: some kind of equal credit and in that
direction what you do is you end up having
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to access these people so this
situation today is to bring in all these
[SPEAKER_00]: killer breeders that are just fantastic at
what they do and what it does it lets you
[SPEAKER_00]: get to see them in real life and start to
introduce yourself to them so that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: access what they do as time goes forward
so that if the trends change and the
[SPEAKER_00]: products that you grow are no longer
moving on the market you know where to go
[SPEAKER_00]: to get material so that you can repaint
your work and my recommend is do not ever
[SPEAKER_00]: get rid of your core material hold it
because all things come back in time plaid
[SPEAKER_00]: is trendy polka dots are trendy and so at
one point red hot then not now back and
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing is that if all you and cannabis
and I'd say you know there's a few a year
[SPEAKER_00]: my age but most of you probably 20 years
younger to me you're gonna see that these
[SPEAKER_00]: trends keep rotating through and I don't
think any of you want to get out of Canada
[SPEAKER_00]: so you wouldn't be in a regenerative
conference because what you're doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: timelessness you're trying to build
something that transcends time my desire
[SPEAKER_00]: is to be able to also participate in that
I want to take the property that I use to
[SPEAKER_00]: make money and I wanted to turn it into a
farm so that my children could hold it
[SPEAKER_00]: over time I wanted to turn it into
something that had an ability to be an
[SPEAKER_00]: asset and not a liability so it was never
sold I wanted to be able to treat it as a
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve so that all the animals that were
there still remained I wanted to bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: biodiversity I got exposed to all these
brilliant people through what I do and I
[SPEAKER_00]: realized man I want to do that too but I
also realized if I fuck this up I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have to sell it and I don't have time to
make that mistake and so what I did is I
[SPEAKER_00]: looked at every single aspect that needed
to be covered done and understood and I
[SPEAKER_00]: got my hand in every single cookie jar I
could get it into and it aged me you know
[SPEAKER_00]: I if I grow a big beard I look like I'm 70
because it's so white but what it did was
[SPEAKER_00]: it gave me an unbelievable amount of
understanding of where we're at what are
[SPEAKER_00]: we doing and the fact that for most people
you're emotionally taking a beating more
[SPEAKER_00]: than anything and that what you have to be
able to do is realize that you're valid
[SPEAKER_00]: the genetics that you hold are valid your
choices are valid it's just that you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to be timely where are you valid in the
timeline and so for us it's to say what
[SPEAKER_00]: are we doing with our products who am I
selling it to who's the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: process it manufacture it and distribute
it what stores do they sell to what's the
[SPEAKER_00]: expectation of the people at those stores
so that you can make a market penetration
[SPEAKER_00]: so that you get some form of brand
differentiation where people start to
[SPEAKER_00]: realize that you are on a shelf that
you're still there next year and what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens is you start to build a
recognition and for me the longevity
[SPEAKER_00]: component is the biggest one most people
really don't understand that you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be constantly present all the time or
people forget who you are and so you make
[SPEAKER_00]: a big splash and then you're out of the
market for nine months and then you come
[SPEAKER_00]: back and you're gone but if you can create
a splash big enough to get an emotional
[SPEAKER_00]: buy-in and you can get people who want to
give you emails and you have an ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to highlight what you do through
digital marketing which is cheap and you
[SPEAKER_00]: send them flyers and you send them
pictures and you send them information and
[SPEAKER_00]: you let them know that your products are
coming out and you let them know that that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's limited batch and you know there's
only 200 pounds total available period and
[SPEAKER_00]: you let them know in advance people will
come and buy that product and hold it and
[SPEAKER_00]: you will be able to have an ability to get
people who want to mess with you and in
[SPEAKER_00]: the process of messing with you it's the
same thing I did with genetics where I
[SPEAKER_00]: moved as many plants for other people as I
ever did for myself I moved so many black
[SPEAKER_00]: market ops plants was no word for it and I
got no money off of it and people say why
[SPEAKER_00]: do you help out so many people move in
genetics and I said because ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody's coming to me for the
information and if I can put you into the
[SPEAKER_00]: right direction you're still gonna come to
me and when my day comes to sell you a
[SPEAKER_00]: product I'll sell you my product but I
don't have that product today so instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of telling you no I don't know where to go
I would refer you and what that is is
[SPEAKER_00]: that's networking and what you're doing is
you becoming someone very powerful because
[SPEAKER_00]: you answer the problem of how do I get it
and you're somebody that says you get it
[SPEAKER_00]: from him and instead of me getting in the
middle of the deal to decrease the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: profit that that person makes you become a
good middleman and step out of the deal
[SPEAKER_00]: you become more of a connector and then
what happens now is you start to get
[SPEAKER_00]: respect from the customer because they
realize that what you're trying to do is
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfy a desire and that desire is
success for all people and when that
[SPEAKER_00]: becomes synonymous with who you are people
will forgive you for your ups and downs
[SPEAKER_00]: and what happens everyone thinks you're
gonna be perfect in business and I'm like
[SPEAKER_00]: bro if you could hit a 92 man you you're
unreal that means out of a thousand people
[SPEAKER_00]: you serve 920 of them correctly because 80
of them are gonna be pissed 40 of them are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna hate you because they just hate in
general and 40 of them because you made a
[SPEAKER_00]: mistake but the 920 who you didn't have
issues with are the ones who sustain your
[SPEAKER_00]: business and most people have never been
in public business and they sure as hell
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't had to deal with public business
with the internet and what takes place is
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to be able to make a connection
and a penetration so that people just
[SPEAKER_00]: realize I do business with this person
because they give me something that I need
[SPEAKER_00]: and when I wanted to find things that were
comparable similar rare you become a
[SPEAKER_00]: network your digital marketing is more
important than any of your other brand
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit because and I don't mean on
Instagram because people who are 50 to 70
[SPEAKER_00]: don't look at it people that have money
don't look at it they don't look at it to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy weed they come into the store and they
trust the person at the counter your
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to go and figure out my
distributor sells to these seven stores
[SPEAKER_00]: you go drive to those seven stores
yourself and you introduce yourself to
[SPEAKER_00]: these people and say I'm the farmer from
this stuff here is something that I
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivate you can give them a joint you
can you can hold up an ounce in your
[SPEAKER_00]: pocket you make these connections so that
people start to see you as a real person
[SPEAKER_00]: they go wow that's really nice product
I'll remember that and then when someone
[SPEAKER_00]: comes in and they refer it they're able to
refer your products and then you and I'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have an identity anybody who's successful
right now in the market is connected into
[SPEAKER_00]: a vertical chain and I study this and I'm
like it's scary it is scary if you're the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer you're the most vulnerable and
you're relying on distributors to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: your pot and the problem is that they're
not qualified because most of them were
[SPEAKER_00]: selling shoes two years ago and so now
they're selling your stuff so what you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be able to do is be able to take
the things that you have that are highly
[SPEAKER_00]: attractive you meet these individuals you
showcase it and then you take a look and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're asking them what do your customers
want here and they're gonna tell you the
[SPEAKER_00]: customers here typically needed to be
under this amount of money so you need to
[SPEAKER_00]: go backwards and figure out what can I
grow that will let me make margin on
[SPEAKER_00]: something that fits that and then you're
able to use your craft skills your organic
[SPEAKER_00]: methodologies which are very efficient to
deliver products that fit those ranges and
[SPEAKER_00]: that gets you penetration and once you
have penetration you have recognition and
[SPEAKER_00]: with recognition comes acceptance and
trust and now you can take them anywhere
[SPEAKER_00]: you want in your portfolio but when you
try to say this is what you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: doing they step back and so this question
is this this thing today I thought about
[SPEAKER_00]: it I was like this has to be a marketing
lecture and it has it really does because
[SPEAKER_00]: most people are getting their shit kicked
out of them financially and I'm like wait
[SPEAKER_00]: a minute you all have incredible genomic
forms you'll have collections you got
[SPEAKER_00]: buddies that have stuff how you selling
selling good going well because I'm not
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing a lot of happy smiles when I asked
that question in general and it's really
[SPEAKER_00]: because of these issues it's about trying
to understand what's the material I have
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow to satisfy the sale and once I can
do that now I have an ability to start
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing my material and start to build
your unique brand and and I hate to use
[SPEAKER_00]: the word brand because there really is no
brands in cannabis nobody's big enough to
[SPEAKER_00]: satisfy brand when you think of brand
you're thinking Nike you're thinking Pepsi
[SPEAKER_00]: you're thinking Heineken you know name
anything that you know that's a brand
[SPEAKER_00]: you're none of those and what we need to
do is create the brand of high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: sun-grown biologically based cultivation
and under that brand we all fall
[SPEAKER_00]: underneath it and then what that does it
allows you now to really cheapen up your
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing because all you have to do is be
able to understand how do we work together
[SPEAKER_00]: to create an umbrella we all get
underneath it we fill this pile with the
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff we have when it's correct and we
identify the destination market once you
[SPEAKER_00]: identify the destination that's what you
produce and even though you might love
[SPEAKER_00]: your bridal to death well you're allowed
to grow six plants legally so I tell
[SPEAKER_00]: people all the time you want to get an
emotional ride grow six and those are the
[SPEAKER_00]: ones you get to keep I grow six and I turn
four of them into RSO that I donate
[SPEAKER_00]: because unfortunately I know too many
people from the med years that are dying
[SPEAKER_00]: of cancer and they can't get anything and
so I only need two plants to satisfy years
[SPEAKER_00]: worth of smoke I mean shit if it's a big
enough plant I can't smoke the whole thing
[SPEAKER_00]: in a year so I choose things that I like
and I choose things that I want to donate
[SPEAKER_00]: which lets me still participate in the
culture that we came from which was
[SPEAKER_00]: collaborative community and it lets me
still be able to feel like I'm a human
[SPEAKER_00]: being and then I put that emotional shit
to bed and I go after the business like
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing business and I'm crystal clear
about it and a lot of times it's offensive
[SPEAKER_00]: to people because when we have discussions
I mean I'm brutal and I rip your plant
[SPEAKER_00]: apart because I make you substantiate your
claim and it kills people because I watch
[SPEAKER_00]: them have emotional breakdowns in the
conversation because their connection to
[SPEAKER_00]: what they produce is some form of their
identity and we talked about that a little
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier it is not your identity you're
your identity the product is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that you produce that reflects your
desires it reflects your ethos it reflects
[SPEAKER_00]: your skills but it changes over the course
of your career and so if you remember to
[SPEAKER_00]: hold the material that you've been holding
for time do as much seed preservation as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible so this way you can keep these
genetics because there's a lack of them
[SPEAKER_00]: globally you are not gonna mine this stuff
I get hit up from countries all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world that are asking me to provide them
with genes and I'm like where's all your
[SPEAKER_00]: genes and I realize that they're gone
because cocaine took out all the genes in
[SPEAKER_00]: South America and heroin opium production
took out all the genes in Asia and so lo
[SPEAKER_00]: and behold you have radically shrunk gene
populations to mine from you go into any
[SPEAKER_00]: part of Africa civil war strife famine
plague took out the cannabis and so all of
[SPEAKER_00]: a sudden cannabis is just like coral and
so coral a friend of mine is a world-class
[SPEAKER_00]: coral collector and he said kev he goes we
hold more varietals in house now than is
[SPEAKER_00]: available in the ocean because the oceans
are acidified and all the corals dying and
[SPEAKER_00]: so people like him hold coral and then
they sell it as frags and they ship it
[SPEAKER_00]: globally so that other coral collectors
can access the material and I realized
[SPEAKER_00]: that only within the community of coral is
do you have access to coral because you
[SPEAKER_00]: can no longer mine it from the ocean
because it's no longer there so the
[SPEAKER_00]: material you're all holding is actually
priceless because you really can't go find
[SPEAKER_00]: it anymore but what you need to do is is
is don't believe that it's been been
[SPEAKER_00]: minimized because that's the lesson for
perp perp said hey your weed isn't worth
[SPEAKER_00]: anything anymore you need to sell perp and
instead of people saying I got you let's
[SPEAKER_00]: let's make seed pops they threw everything
away so they could go full perp and the
[SPEAKER_00]: problem was it screwed them down the road
because they got rid of half of their
[SPEAKER_00]: easel they no longer have the paint needed
to make new varieties they don't have an
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to stay current and when you start
to use stuff that's trendy you bottleneck
[SPEAKER_00]: your genomic form and you make it
susceptible to things you're not aware of
[SPEAKER_00]: and so by having a tissue culture facility
and having lab access we find that some of
[SPEAKER_00]: these very popular varieties if I pull
them from the general population sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: up to 60 percent of the samples are
carrying fusarium they're carrying a
[SPEAKER_00]: fungal problem some of them have viral
issues so everyone using these bottleneck
[SPEAKER_00]: genetic forms are susceptible to major
problems and so what takes place is you
[SPEAKER_00]: have to be able to say I got you I can't
go chase trends that are bottleneck genes
[SPEAKER_00]: because if we have a pathogenic issue I'm
screwed and so you have to have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: diversity and you have to be able to take
this diversity and understand how do you
[SPEAKER_00]: diversify it into the markets and that's
why we talked about the fuels the earth
[SPEAKER_00]: the florals and the fruits because
fundamentally that's how cannabis breaks
[SPEAKER_00]: up and scientifically it breaks up into
these divisions based off of these trip
[SPEAKER_00]: relationships and once you can start to
see this it starts to help you understand
[SPEAKER_00]: how to market your product it helps you
understand who your target audience is it
[SPEAKER_00]: starts to let you know that when you look
at the database you can figure out what's
[SPEAKER_00]: working I love to use the the digital
galaxy from phylos because it lets me take
[SPEAKER_00]: a look at relationships between plants it
lets me understand am I working with
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's unique or am I working
with something that's not unique and
[SPEAKER_00]: what's the level of homozygosity
heterozygosity so if I breed it am I going
[SPEAKER_00]: to get an incredible spread of genes or am
I going to get a narrow spread of genes so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's information that you can use to help
steer your directions and as we go forward
[SPEAKER_00]: there'll be individuals that do incredible
work that produce varietals at the market
[SPEAKER_00]: wants and you're gonna and we learned
yesterday all the different licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: agreements you'll be able to license
material from other people to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: product on your farm using your
methodologies so that what you have is
[SPEAKER_00]: sellability and then at some point in time
when you get enough brand recognition you
[SPEAKER_00]: can release new things you're allowed then
to say look I can do other stuff Adidas
[SPEAKER_00]: always had three stripes but lo and behold
once they got market penetration they
[SPEAKER_00]: could change some of those things and they
had other things that they could sell and
[SPEAKER_00]: so I always look at what people buy and
what they do and I try to overlay that
[SPEAKER_00]: over the reality of what we do and because
my my desire is to always be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve protect and move the genomic form
forward through time I know that the hold
[SPEAKER_00]: is priceless and to share is priceless and
to be able to understand how do you take
[SPEAKER_00]: this material that you have identify where
it's going identify where the supply chain
[SPEAKER_00]: problems are how do you get around those
issues by choosing genetically what you
[SPEAKER_00]: need and so it's just really a series of
checks on a box that you just start
[SPEAKER_00]: checking through and say the pot that I
sell has a lag time in processing don't
[SPEAKER_00]: make it in any way high monoterpene if
it's extremely aromatic be very careful
[SPEAKER_00]: because by the time the user gets it it's
done and when they burn it satisfaction is
[SPEAKER_00]: gone if it has a rough handling where the
people that do this mechanized work if it
[SPEAKER_00]: is in any way open it will shred in
process and by the time the person gets it
[SPEAKER_00]: it's in pieces so what you sold them was a
bag of crumble and it wasn't crumble when
[SPEAKER_00]: you let it leave your building but it's
crumble when I get it at a store and so
[SPEAKER_00]: you you these decisions have to be made
and you have to it just basically
[SPEAKER_00]: disconnect your emotional shit you have to
be a robot when it comes to making
[SPEAKER_00]: business decisions and then you able the
opposite of a robot in order to hold the
[SPEAKER_00]: culture and so it's very difficult because
there's almost no industry like cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: where all of us had to pay such a heavy
toll the whole time to participate so your
[SPEAKER_00]: connection to what you do your connection
to your plants it's your identity but the
[SPEAKER_00]: truth of it all is it's not these are
things that are part of you but not all of
[SPEAKER_00]: you and so I'm not gonna go on forever on
this because the the the point is I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to get all these breeders that come up
here and start to work and talk but I
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to cover some very specific things
of understand that cannabis breaks up into
[SPEAKER_00]: major categories that's scientifically
accurate that's important because the
[SPEAKER_00]: public loves people with titles behind
their names telling you them things so
[SPEAKER_00]: they don't listen to you but if you put
the word PhD in front of your name they
[SPEAKER_00]: will and what you need to do is have
science quantify the things that you do so
[SPEAKER_00]: that when you put it on the table and it
gets challenged there's a proof and now
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not an opinion and now what it does
it allows you to be able to not have to
[SPEAKER_00]: have such an intimate argument with
individuals because if you argue with them
[SPEAKER_00]: you lose the sale you want to be able to
make sure that you're measuring your
[SPEAKER_00]: supply lines who's moving your product
where do they sell it how do they process
[SPEAKER_00]: it most people don't have a vertical chain
it's too expensive it's very expensive to
[SPEAKER_00]: have all these things in hand and if
you're a distributor and a farmer on a
[SPEAKER_00]: micro license who's grew who's who's
growing the weed and doing the work when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're selling it and so a lot of it is
you start having the ability to do it but
[SPEAKER_00]: unfortunately you don't have the time or
the resources to do it correctly and then
[SPEAKER_00]: what stores are going to take you on when
you're not able to provide to them product
[SPEAKER_00]: on a consistent level all the time you're
basically a flash so what you're having to
[SPEAKER_00]: do is you're having to find specific
operations that specialize in niche pot
[SPEAKER_00]: what's a good example of people's people's
dispensary right a beautiful beautiful
[SPEAKER_00]: facility but they look for really high
quality product because the the buyer is
[SPEAKER_00]: discerning and he understands that the
customer wants a better product and so he
[SPEAKER_00]: sources out product from smaller entities
over larger entities because he
[SPEAKER_00]: understands this how many people are at
that education level not that many and so
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to go find dispensaries where the
people who are running them are
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligent and they understand the
reality of customer satisfaction and they
[SPEAKER_00]: understand that the only way to get really
high quality product is from craft
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers because the details are all
checked and if they can figure out that
[SPEAKER_00]: they want to deal with you and they want
your product they can find the distributor
[SPEAKER_00]: who will make that happen and so the
farmer in the store need to make the
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship everything else in the middle
can be worked out but if the store doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: want you people think that you're pushing
product what you want is it to be pulled
[SPEAKER_00]: you want your product pulled out of your
hands so that all you do is produce it and
[SPEAKER_00]: then people desire it and that has to be
through relationships and it has to be
[SPEAKER_00]: through given individuals varieties that
are easy to sell and it has to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand what the margin has to be and
if you can't produce that cultivar that
[SPEAKER_00]: you have and get paid for it put it back
in the library and then sell the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that have an ability to be sold and when
you eventually get the market penetration
[SPEAKER_00]: you want which should happen over the next
couple years and that's not really that
[SPEAKER_00]: long a time it's a lifetime when you pour
and it's just like oxygen three minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: with no air is a long time and so in life
it's whatever you have least supply of
[SPEAKER_00]: that's most important and when people
challenge me on that I tell them hold your
[SPEAKER_00]: breath and they start choking on like bam
you at least supply of air so while you
[SPEAKER_00]: are struggling to breathe you thought of
nothing else so whatever is in least
[SPEAKER_00]: supply is most important and for us the
thing that's gonna be in least supply is
[SPEAKER_00]: liquidity and finances and what we need to
be able to do is just survive these
[SPEAKER_00]: transitions until you firmly establish
this new industry they will go after the
[SPEAKER_00]: store situation they will open up these
opportunities because they're they're 700
[SPEAKER_00]: million short in California on expected
tax revenue in order to get the tax
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue they can't tax more they have to
open up more sales so the only way that's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna happen is through the the relaxing
of the laws and the development of an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry that means that in a couple years
all of us have an opportunity to really
[SPEAKER_00]: participate in the craft industry but
right now it's about survival and so like
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell people someone said you know what
are you gonna do I was talking same thing
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going crude this year I'm gonna blow
the farm crude so that I can blow it and
[SPEAKER_00]: walk away with the paycheck so that I can
afford to pay to keep the farm alive and
[SPEAKER_00]: what I do with my farm is I can hold all
my genomic forms at your farm because you
[SPEAKER_00]: have an ability to hold your material in
house you're not you're not set up for six
[SPEAKER_00]: if you have a license you can have as much
as you want within that specific square
[SPEAKER_00]: footage of what you do and you hold the
material and you start to create the story
[SPEAKER_00]: around the material and you do it
digitally because that's the cheapest way
[SPEAKER_00]: to market and you start to be able to meet
these people at these dispensaries and
[SPEAKER_00]: while they're there you pop it up on the
phone and you show them some cool stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: and you start to link to other farms and
you start to link to other varietals and
[SPEAKER_00]: pretty soon what you're doing is you're
creating an information network of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: available or otherwise I get it from a
distributor and it's a skew and we go
[SPEAKER_00]: through it and say all right this stuff is
that's the right one that's at the right
[SPEAKER_00]: price for my market because my customers
can only spend so much money so I can't
[SPEAKER_00]: give you a $90 bag but if I'm in Hollywood
I can and so if you can make a penetration
[SPEAKER_00]: into one of those places then you can move
some of these extremely less efficient
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars that don't give you the same
amount of yield but what they do is they
[SPEAKER_00]: give you differentiation but if you try to
put that into a market where people want
[SPEAKER_00]: to pay 45 bucks you screwed and you have
to clearly see it and so the the world
[SPEAKER_00]: we're in now is really to me a survival
world and it's about making sure that you
[SPEAKER_00]: keep your neighbors alive it's making sure
that when you get varietals like Josh
[SPEAKER_00]: bread that's nasty you realize that you
and your neighbor could both produce it
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe your whole hill could produce it
because what it'll do is it allow there be
[SPEAKER_00]: enough of it to satisfy the customer for a
whole year and then the customer comes
[SPEAKER_00]: back to go work with your group because
that's how it works with all products
[SPEAKER_00]: that's how normal things are marketed
that's how normal things are consumed and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what has to take place and that's
why I said I brought those plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: because I said oh my god this stuff is
killer and I wanted to hoard it and so as
[SPEAKER_00]: soon as I want to hoard something I know
that's what I need to release because that
[SPEAKER_00]: has the value and if you just instantly
want to release it so
[SPEAKER_00]: so so that's really the lesson on it it's
it's it's just trying to be very honest
[SPEAKER_00]: with what you're doing determine the
destination do your numbers if you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: really good at the business end of it have
someone do an assessment of your
[SPEAKER_00]: efficiency so you can figure out does it
make sense for me to grow this and does it
[SPEAKER_00]: make sense for me to work with it I and I
tell people a lot of it too is that if
[SPEAKER_00]: your desire is everyone's like I'm gonna
take the top 20% of my plants and I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna turn it into flour and the rest of
it's gonna be concentrate well if that
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff isn't over 22% it's tough to get it
into an extractor because they have to
[SPEAKER_00]: make money too so if they can't get a
return they don't touch it if the turps
[SPEAKER_00]: aren't high we're not stripping it so I
have a turp stripping facility where all
[SPEAKER_00]: it does is strip turps and then dry the
material convert it to blow it into
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass so it's pre-converted before we
have to turn it into distillate because
[SPEAKER_00]: these high-end cartridges are only from
cannabis derived terpenes what that means
[SPEAKER_00]: is that if you have varieties that have an
incredible turf profile and a quantity of
[SPEAKER_00]: it that makes sense you can grow that just
for that and you have an ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: diversify what you're growing to fit
certain markets so there's things that I
[SPEAKER_00]: started mining that really release an
incredible turpene signature with a high
[SPEAKER_00]: biomass load early so that you can get
your crop out by mid-august harvest the
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers that you need which is the the the
oil the scent and combine it but it has to
[SPEAKER_00]: work if it's low numbers extractors won't
touch it so you're gonna give them 20% to
[SPEAKER_00]: the customers flower and the other 80% is
gonna sit still because nobody wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: work with it and then you get caught up in
what people like and you're like no
[SPEAKER_00]: solventless is best in in Vancouver Canada
it is but try selling that shit in
[SPEAKER_00]: California don't want it they wanted it
such a small rate of speed that the best
[SPEAKER_00]: hash makers I know don't sell it quickly
at all people want convenience California
[SPEAKER_00]: market is convenience its simplicity its
pens it's the masses want this so you have
[SPEAKER_00]: to say I got you the variety that I'm
gonna grow not only does it do what I want
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's quality in the smoke but the
numbers are over 22 and 35 on the turps
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise I can't blow it and sell it now
I have to sell the whole plant is flower
[SPEAKER_00]: and so now what you're doing is you're
having to degrade the quality of your
[SPEAKER_00]: flower to be in the mid-market but the
problem is that still your label still
[SPEAKER_00]: your brand it's all tied in you'd have to
create two companies one to sell your
[SPEAKER_00]: high-end flower and then another name to
sell your lower-end flower because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: visually lower in quality and that's
complicated and so I tell people I said
[SPEAKER_00]: listen I said I'm telling you you have to
go after this reality and understand it
[SPEAKER_00]: well the beaten you're gonna take is gonna
be so aggressive you're gonna have to
[SPEAKER_00]: capitulate and the question here is on our
regions and our values is that someone
[SPEAKER_00]: told me there's no 25 years ago I hung out
with an economist who was a from a long
[SPEAKER_00]: history of farming so his family were very
successful farmers in the Central Valley
[SPEAKER_00]: but he became an economist because he said
I hate farming but what he was was a
[SPEAKER_00]: brilliant economist and he and I had this
was a man this would have been 95 so in 95
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm having discussions on the fall of
Humboldt County to Salinas and Monterey
[SPEAKER_00]: and Santa Barbara because he said the cut
flower industry disappeared due to NAFTA
[SPEAKER_00]: and so a free trade agreement made it
cheaper to ship flowers from Columbia to
[SPEAKER_00]: East Coast then from California to the
East Coast and overnight an entire cut
[SPEAKER_00]: flower industry disappeared he said that's
what's gonna happen to you you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get wiped out and you're gonna get
destroyed and I said to him I said well as
[SPEAKER_00]: an economist I said wouldn't my route
through that to be unique product
[SPEAKER_00]: differentiation and then micro craft and
he said yeah that's the only way out he
[SPEAKER_00]: said your regions have global recognition
what you have to be able to do is survive
[SPEAKER_00]: the transition and the region itself will
have the brand value and so everyone's
[SPEAKER_00]: arguing that I should have went and picked
up operations in Central California but I
[SPEAKER_00]: said I hate Central California I love
Northern California so why would I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be down there I want to be where I want to
be and I believe that the value here will
[SPEAKER_00]: hold and then I'm talking to someone who
does the buys for a major Canadian LP and
[SPEAKER_00]: they just picked up a million square foot
of Humboldt canopy so that it allows them
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a craft division in their
portfolio that's not bad because when you
[SPEAKER_00]: have people that are developing craft
businesses in your region what do they do
[SPEAKER_00]: they advertise the reason why it's craft
is because it's coming out of your region
[SPEAKER_00]: and so you get to do something called
piggyback and you get to go ride that
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and that's why I think that if we
can just survive this next couple of years
[SPEAKER_00]: and we make clear decisions on what we're
doing and if you want people to really
[SPEAKER_00]: love what you're growing then you need to
use your skills as a farmer and produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that they want and then over time
you can give them the product that you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: like to give them which then lets you feel
happy about what you're doing because you
[SPEAKER_00]: may not like smoking gorilla glue or blue
dream but the bottom line is the extractor
[SPEAKER_00]: sure do they love those products because
they're hot numbers high yield easy to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow and it allows you to catch holes in a
market that are here right now and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: really turning your ego down and just
saying look I'm here to do business if I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to experience my culture in the way I
knew it I grow six plants we smoke and
[SPEAKER_00]: share and enjoy and I have shit that
nobody wants to buy but I'm enjoying it
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the business of farming is
farming and if you really need to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the reality just go look at
agricultural pay scales and you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: find out that farmers get screwed globally
and when you put I never tell anybody I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: a farmer I said because I would imply that
I'm broke and what that does is it
[SPEAKER_00]: absolutely change even when I'm struggling
I don't tell you I'm struggling because
[SPEAKER_00]: people love to see people hurt because it
allows them to feel like they're in power
[SPEAKER_00]: so when I play business games I always
tell people I don't know what I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: and I watch your response and when I see
your eyes blinking I know that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to fuck me and so now I know I play
the game with you because I want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to feel out the reality I want to be
able to understand the deal that I'm doing
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's that understanding of what's
taking place and so the perception that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have to have is that we're being looked at
like we're failures that somehow we
[SPEAKER_00]: screwed up so bad that we're desperate and
that we don't produce good pot and that
[SPEAKER_00]: the big companies do it correctly because
that's the imagery that's being painted
[SPEAKER_00]: and so I always talk about yeah it's a
struggle but the bottom line is all
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses struggle and what it does it
allows people to see a normality and then
[SPEAKER_00]: we can also say but we were able to be
successful for decades prior so we have a
[SPEAKER_00]: history of longevity and now we're having
to work with the transition so that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: move forward and then the customer doesn't
see you as a victim as soon as you start
[SPEAKER_00]: begging for anything you screwed you
screwed never beg when I got in trouble in
[SPEAKER_00]: 2002 I had to write a letter of contrition
because I caught a felony right and I had
[SPEAKER_00]: to write a letter of contrition so I wrote
this letter and my my lawyer and my friend
[SPEAKER_00]: said are you out of your mind and I said
no no this is what I'm giving to him and
[SPEAKER_00]: it said the only thing I did wrong was I
moved too fast for the rest of you Kevin
[SPEAKER_00]: Jodry and I got the max penalty because I
knew I was going to get it anyways so I
[SPEAKER_00]: knew they were going to screw me anyways
and I said you might as well take it on
[SPEAKER_00]: your feet then on your knees because at
least at least you're holding yourself to
[SPEAKER_00]: a standard and that's the truth here is
that every time you capitulate bend beg
[SPEAKER_00]: pray the public sees you as a victim and
then they want to beat you down in price
[SPEAKER_00]: when you go to the store and you play this
game they want to beat you down in price
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's business and what you have
to be able to do is give them things that
[SPEAKER_00]: they want so that the negotiations are
fair get you on a shelf get you into the
[SPEAKER_00]: public eye get you an opportunity to make
connections you take those connections and
[SPEAKER_00]: you network them like you have your whole
lives because everybody here had to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: their own weed so you all know how to do
business you all know how to produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that the public wanted so what you
want to do now is just be able to kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: readjust that shift and use the genetic
tools that are available to you because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of material available to be
able to put yourself in situations where
[SPEAKER_00]: you can succeed and I think that's enough
of the conversation so the main point is
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys don't bow down don't get off get
off your knees only one time you should be
[SPEAKER_00]: on your knees is if you're looking for
your car keys because you drop them out of
[SPEAKER_00]: your pocket and other than that and maybe
and maybe as we stand under the crosshair
[SPEAKER_00]: as it falls in Chris crucifies me from
being shitty is is in is in humility but
[SPEAKER_00]: not in begging for mercy from the market
because no one gives a shit about your
[SPEAKER_00]: struggle and the people that you're
selling cannabis to are going through the
[SPEAKER_00]: same beating you are but they've been
going through it for a long time because
[SPEAKER_00]: they've been diminished in their wages and
so most people are taking a brutal beating
[SPEAKER_00]: and you don't get sympathy from people who
are also in the same circumstance what you
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be able to do is give them some
form of escapism some form of satisfaction
[SPEAKER_00]: some form of genuine quality and those are
the things that transcend and once you
[SPEAKER_00]: have that you're gonna able to have a
penetration that'll happen that allow you
[SPEAKER_00]: to move your products and then start to re
bring in your genetic libraries that
[SPEAKER_00]: you've held and built and nurtured and now
you start to have an ability to where your
[SPEAKER_00]: farm only produces one thing the thing
that you know produces best on your farm
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's there's there's 1700 people
who buy the entire farms worth the product
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you're done for the season but
when you re-release you re-release the
[SPEAKER_00]: information and you can set up the desire
the stores that want to carry it the
[SPEAKER_00]: prices will be there it's it's a reality
if you look at every other market and so
[SPEAKER_00]: for me I'm somebody who is career hustler
who said wow I'm gonna get buried alive
[SPEAKER_00]: let me study let me learn let me share and
together we're gonna do it so let's go
[SPEAKER_00]: applause applause
