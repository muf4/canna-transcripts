[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Jamie from Mendocino Generations,
and I'm interviewing Richard North from
[SPEAKER_01]: Terravesco.
[SPEAKER_01]: They create vermicompost and verma
extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell me a little bit about the
company's history and how you got started?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started about 25 years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, working in the vineyard
industry, we're based in Sonoma.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a chance to work with the wine
grape growers about eight years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ten years ago, cannabis guys found us,
and the movement started growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The number of people driving three,
four, five hours each way wanting to buy
[SPEAKER_00]: our product grew, and we've been expanding
into the cannabis market for the last five
[SPEAKER_00]: years pretty rapidly.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produce two products.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're both worm-based.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have over 60 million worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produce vermicompost.
[SPEAKER_00]: We produce vermicompost and verma extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why we use worms is to
introduce microbiology into the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Microbiology allows plants to uptake
nutrients more efficiently and translocate
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you see bigger root systems,
greater percentage of root hairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: thicker stalks, stronger laterals,
bigger leaves, higher units.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely saw that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had some six foot tall plants in
two gallon pots that had a bunch of your
[SPEAKER_01]: vermicompost in there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the root mass was just incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what makes your product unique?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we think it's a microbiology,
or we know it's a microbiology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, we work with the USDA in a
lot of different research projects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of them was documenting the
suppression of agrobacterium tumor in
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's crown gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in that, they discovered the levels of
microbiology that we have in the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've documented approximately 2,400
species of bacteria and over 300 species
[SPEAKER_00]: of fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those numbers are off the charts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they said that our product,
even though it's organic certified,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have our OMRI certification,
both in the US and Canada, our CDFA
[SPEAKER_00]: certification, as well as Clean Green
certification.
[SPEAKER_00]: They said that even though our product is
organic certified, it behaves like a
[SPEAKER_00]: conventional agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the quality and consistency are
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the results that you get are
consistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically, with organic products,
you can see some variability from year to
[SPEAKER_00]: year or batch to batch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our product is highly consistent every
time, not only in its composition,
[SPEAKER_00]: but its level of microbiology and the
results that it delivers for crops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I know you said you use worms.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the base of the worms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use organic dairy manure,
dairy cows.
[SPEAKER_00]: We use their manure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually rice holes that are in
the product.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bedding for the cows at the
dairy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are organic certified as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: They clean out the stalls.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes into a collection pond,
goes through a separator, squeeze out a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of the extra liquids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We receive it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go through a thermophilic composting
process to get rid of weed seeds and
[SPEAKER_00]: pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we feed it to 60 million worms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're the ones that do all the hard
work for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The amazing thing is that the density of
the worm population is about 1,000 worms
[SPEAKER_00]: per cubic foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing like you'd ever find in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what makes it so exciting from
the level of microbiology that's included
[SPEAKER_00]: in the product, as well as the diversity.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you also do an extract of that as
well.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the things that we were
trying to figure out is how to work with
[SPEAKER_00]: plants beyond the transplant process or
just when plants are born.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they're babies, how can we work with
them when they're established in the
[SPEAKER_00]: field?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where we came up with the
idea of extract, a liquid that's derived
[SPEAKER_00]: from the vermicompost, where we separate
the microbes from the organic matter and
[SPEAKER_00]: suspend them in solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: We created a process that allows a small
amount of microbiology that we include in
[SPEAKER_00]: the product to support the population for
about 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the microbes are still active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when they're utilized in liquids
for delivery, and we talk about a soil
[SPEAKER_00]: drench.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant will uptake it systemically.
[SPEAKER_00]: The efficacy is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so are you saying it has a shelf life
of about 60 days?
[SPEAKER_00]: The microbiology is active for 60 days.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the sooner you use it, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But actually, we have people that have
used it for up to nine months and seen
[SPEAKER_00]: great efficacy as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, yeah, if you can use it within the
first 60 days, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I know that your products are
primarily biological based.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do they also have an NPK?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another great question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the NPK of the vermicompost is 0.75,
0.75, 0.75.
[SPEAKER_01]: So very balanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very balanced, but very low.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not a nutrient.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we enable nutrients to be uptaken and
translocated more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like if you and I take a
multivitamin, it doesn't have magnesium in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll expel most of what that vitamin
contains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those minerals won't be absorbed by your
body.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you have magnesium in it,
you're going to absorb most of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, vermicompost is kind of the
magnesium for plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the plants are going to more
readily absorb the nutrients that they
[SPEAKER_00]: need to be able to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And strong, healthy, vigorous.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And more resistant to infections of all
kinds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed the soil, feed the plant,
make them more resilient.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It helps with the immune system of the
plant and all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, you know, what we find is
pretty interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even during the really hot summers that we
see, you know, in Mendocino Humboldt City,
[SPEAKER_00]: we see plants actually that are treated
with vermicompost or extract can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: be more resilient during those high
stress, high heat events.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the stomata on the underside of
the leaves actually become more active.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they feel a stress, they close
and they retain moisture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've definitely noticed a definite
increase in health with our farm from
[SPEAKER_01]: using your products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're thrilled that you're a happy
customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you're talking about mixing the
compost in the soil mixture, what kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: ratios do you suggest?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it depends on what part point of the
process that we're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: With babies in a potting mix, 10 percent
is the most that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about transplants,
actually putting the vermicompost in the
[SPEAKER_00]: transplant hole.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on the size of the
transplant, like a four by four might be a
[SPEAKER_00]: cup, cup and a half in the bottom of the
transplant hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then actually top dressing around the
plant, you know, during the season,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe once or twice, you know,
working that the vermicompost in again to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide a, you know, sustainable kind of
growing cycle for the plant using that
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you probably want to kind of after you
top dress, cover it up a bit so it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: exposed to the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not dropping it on and walking
away.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working it in or having a top dress
on top of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then of course using the extract.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we find is we've gotten a lot of
feedback from growers this past year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll be updating our labels to reflect
this, but 50 milliliters per gallon is a
[SPEAKER_00]: great, you know, 50 five zero is a great
application rate or concentration ratio to
[SPEAKER_00]: use for the extract all the way from seed
cracking to pre-harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are actually micro dosing if
they if they feed several times a week,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're actually taking that number down
to 10 or 15 one five mills per gallon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it becomes really cost effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're, you know, using such low
dosages of the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the 50 mills per gallon rate,
like how often would you suggest drenching
[SPEAKER_01]: with that?
[SPEAKER_00]: No more than once a week.
[SPEAKER_01]: No more than once a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be every couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really every grower needs to
understand what strains are using,
[SPEAKER_00]: what, you know, what they're dealing with,
the weather conditions and things like
[SPEAKER_00]: that and how they want to enhance the
efficacy for their plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it probably has to do also with your
soil media and what kind of soil you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using, how healthy your soil is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what challenges you're facing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So dialing in and figuring that out is,
you know, what that's what small farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: do, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We take it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's definitely a wonderful product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're honored.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Future of cannabis project.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good luck to everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
