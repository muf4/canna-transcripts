[SPEAKER_01]: What I'm hearing it sounds like is that
maybe there's, it's probably a lot more
[SPEAKER_01]: complex than this, but three general uses
or purposes for your teas.
[SPEAKER_01]: One would be to break down what is already
there and creating nutrition for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two would be to grow the plant and produce
some type of growth hormone there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And three would be some type of resistance
and or preventative measure in that you'd
[SPEAKER_01]: be fighting off the bad guys, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's say that we started with a new
clone, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What would be your tea of choice for a new
transplant into a sterile medium?
[SPEAKER_02]: I tend to lean more towards the fungal
dominant first.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of, if you're looking at the
roots of a plant, underneath the
[SPEAKER_02]: microscope, you have the main,
you know, in a lot of ways it mimics what
[SPEAKER_02]: you'd see above ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have, you know, kind of that main
branch coming off and then there'll be the
[SPEAKER_02]: root hairs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you look at it closer, what you see
is it actually is kind of deceptive,
[SPEAKER_02]: like in a lot of ways your skin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have hair coming off of our skin,
but we also have holes in our skin in the
[SPEAKER_02]: form of pores where there are spaces that
are actually going inside as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So roots have those, and what ends up
happening with a lot of the fungus that we
[SPEAKER_02]: introduced this is that they have a very
close relationship with the plant and that
[SPEAKER_02]: they will actually plug into those pores
and then they themselves will snake out,
[SPEAKER_02]: spiderweb out into the soil and actually
extend the surface area or multiply the
[SPEAKER_02]: surface area that that plant is able to
cover.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a plant root in and of itself,
or just like me standing here,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can only reach out and touch what's
immediately around me.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I am, you know, Spider-Man with the
webslinger, throwing out something,
[SPEAKER_02]: well I can grab something from across the
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how the fungal hyphae act when
they're in a direct relationship with the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for early growth, for establishing that
root system and getting it as strong as
[SPEAKER_02]: possible, as fast as possible,
and giving it immediate access to as much
[SPEAKER_02]: of that surface area as possible,
I tend to want to lean towards fungal
[SPEAKER_02]: dominant early.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as the plant starts to get established
and is able to kind of absorb what's
[SPEAKER_02]: immediately available in whatever soil mix
that you're using, then it starts to lean
[SPEAKER_02]: towards the breakdown of the soil,
which although the fungal growth
[SPEAKER_02]: definitely has a big role to play in that
as well, but a lot of the I guess a little
[SPEAKER_02]: more diverse side of that is really in the
biology, isn't it, the bacterias.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the bacterias are a lot of the ones
that create different hormones,
[SPEAKER_02]: create amino acids.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lactobacillus and bacillus will have a
little bit more active or faster role in
[SPEAKER_02]: breaking things down, especially when you
combine them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they can also occupy a lot of that
same space that the fungus would like to
[SPEAKER_02]: be occupying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the fungal growth tends to happen a
little bit slower.
[SPEAKER_02]: The bacterial growth can happen relatively
quickly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's the reason for kind of
establishing the, getting the fungal
[SPEAKER_02]: colonies established first, and then
starting to transition into the bacterial,
[SPEAKER_02]: more bacterial dominant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as you get into late flower,
there are all kinds of specific species
[SPEAKER_02]: that are producing a lot of those growth
hormones.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or some of them that will specifically
break down certain things in the soil
[SPEAKER_02]: faster.
[SPEAKER_02]: So early on, we're more interested in
nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Later on, it basically goes from N to P to
K in terms of our focus and the plant's
[SPEAKER_02]: life cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can kind of tailor that a little
bit with the biology as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I know that for me, you know,
the, the similar mind frame and that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the fungal colonies get them
developed first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the bacterias can break down
those things like you're mentioning green
[SPEAKER_01]: sand and mantra mullet clay, and these
very mineral rich trace element,
[SPEAKER_01]: rich compounds that are not readily
available to the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bacterias that produce amino acids
and enzymes help the plant to make that
[SPEAKER_01]: bio available.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I know for me that towards the
end of the life cycle, especially in
[SPEAKER_01]: flowering cannabis plants, you run into a
lot of problems towards the end.
[SPEAKER_01]: And being an organic cultivator and a
conscious cultivator doesn't allow me to
[SPEAKER_01]: put any sprays on my plants or do any of
that topical preventative measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would you utilize?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what are some strains you'd utilize
say towards the end to fight off a
[SPEAKER_01]: fusarium or pythium or botrytis?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there are 50 different species.
[SPEAKER_02]: That you'll find in a lot of the hydrosaur
mixes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you actually take any of those names
written on the back of them and look them
[SPEAKER_02]: up online, you'll see what kind of effects
they have.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a lot of them are kind of on both
sides, but they're, they're participating
[SPEAKER_02]: in or assisting with the breakdown of the
soil, but they're also, they're,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're also antagonistic to any sort of
pathogens in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then there are some that are more
aggressive than others.
[SPEAKER_02]: So streptomyces actinivate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Streptomyces was sold as actinivate is one
that a lot of people use.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it can be also used as a foliar,
although I think it's soil born naturally
[SPEAKER_02]: comes from the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can also be sprayed as a foliar.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something like that is a good one to start
adding into the teas as you get a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit later, later on down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a question for you on that,
on the streptomyces.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard that, you know, one of the
reasons why you wouldn't want to use the
[SPEAKER_01]: streptomyces early on as say a
preventative, like why wouldn't you get
[SPEAKER_01]: streptomyces in there right off the bat so
that that stuff can't come in?
[SPEAKER_02]: There, there are other species better
suited to that that are not going to
[SPEAKER_02]: actually attack the fungal growth in the
soil that you do want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And streptomyces, and again, I'm not a
biologist, but my understanding of
[SPEAKER_02]: streptomyces is that it is a pretty
aggressive, pretty aggressive organism
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to attacking different
funguses and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't necessarily differentiate
you know, there's going to be some
[SPEAKER_02]: differentiated, some of their preferred
foods versus things that they wouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: necessarily prefer, wouldn't necessarily
want to bother with, but that they are
[SPEAKER_02]: aggressive enough that they can have a
little bit of an effect on the fungal
[SPEAKER_02]: growth in the soil that we do want.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't necessarily know that to be
true.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's more of an intuitive, you know,
something that I think was more intuitive
[SPEAKER_02]: for me in terms of my practice,
but I didn't necessarily want to use those
[SPEAKER_02]: things right off the bat just because you
don't necessarily have to, but then as you
[SPEAKER_02]: get later on down the road and these,
you know, then the plants start,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially as the plants start to reach
the end of their life cycle and they start
[SPEAKER_02]: to get weaker, they are then subject to
any of these things.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of them are systemic, exist in
nature anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like here where we are, I think they say
that there's 20% of the dust in the air is
[SPEAKER_02]: actually active mold spores and things
like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these things all exist in the
environment anyway.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily that you need to have
a plant that's contaminated and then come
[SPEAKER_02]: and combine that with the fact that a lot
of the issues that we have are systemic
[SPEAKER_02]: and they actually came from, you know,
they've been with the plant for a very
[SPEAKER_02]: long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the stage of life where those
things will start to start to gain a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more of a foothold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that the plant's weaker and they have
kind of an avenue of attack.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as it gets later on, then I'll start
transitioning from, start transitioning
[SPEAKER_02]: more into those things that are really
going to be antagonistic to the pathogens.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's to where by the end of the life
cycle, that's really all you're trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: put in there because the plant is,
it's got, it's, you know, it's got the
[SPEAKER_02]: majority of its nutrients, the nutrients
that it's going to be using either in the
[SPEAKER_02]: stored form of measuring bricks levels,
things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of building up the bricks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the middle stage of using a lot of
those types of back areas will help to
[SPEAKER_02]: increase the bricks levels.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then that's a lot of the stored energy
for the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you get down to the last bit of the
life cycle and you know, a lot of that
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff is, is kind of already set in
motion.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not necessarily as dependent,
especially if you're supplementing foods,
[SPEAKER_02]: soluble foods, like we do a lot of times
in the late flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're supplementing from N to P
to K depending on where you are in the
[SPEAKER_02]: life cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you transition from P to K and you
get into the end of the life cycle,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, we're, we're using bloom
boosters and we're, we're feeding them
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff that's soluble, which is also going
to disrupt the biology in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: Prior to, I guess my personal approach
early on for a lot of this stuff is that
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't want to feed them heavily ever
really.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't lean towards that ever to,
you know, just pump full of steroids
[SPEAKER_02]: because that's not how I want to do it for
myself.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything in moderation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then as they get to the later part of
their life cycle, it just, it,
[SPEAKER_02]: to me, it seems much more, um,
uh, much more realistic or my intuition,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess then says to, okay, now we've
gotten pretty close to the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: road.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's make sure we don't have any problems
and concentrate really on, um,
[SPEAKER_02]: on the things that, that are either going
to help the plant finish, assuming that it
[SPEAKER_02]: already has access to everything else that
it wants, um, either by supplemental
[SPEAKER_02]: feeding because the end of flower were
always supplemental feeding on some level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, so then, then the teams become more
targeted towards pest suppression,
[SPEAKER_02]: disease, disease suppression, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, and then you can shift that at any
point in time too, if you're having,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're having specific issues that you
want to target.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have, you have fungus gnats or you
have a root aphids or, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that, then I wouldn't
necessarily add like, uh, but very bossy
[SPEAKER_02]: on it as one that I use.
[SPEAKER_02]: For some of that stuff, I wouldn't
necessarily add that to any T unless I was
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in making sure that I'm not
going to end up with a fungus,
[SPEAKER_02]: not explosion or rude aphids taking off or
anything like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I would, so later on in the process,
I start to add things like that more to
[SPEAKER_02]: the T.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll add more of the streptomyces,
I'll add more of the very bossy on a,
[SPEAKER_02]: um, subtilis is really a good one for the
whole process.
[SPEAKER_02]: That one also is, is, is an antagonist of
a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So those would be kind of the three
general T's for me would be first fungal
[SPEAKER_02]: dominant and then transitioning into
something that's a little bit more
[SPEAKER_02]: bacterial focus where you have some of
those, um, and anything that's producing
[SPEAKER_02]: like a, like a plant growth hormone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and then towards the end, it's just
making sure that we cross the finish line,
[SPEAKER_02]: uh, you know, in a strong way and not,
not get all the way to the finish line.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one, one peanut gallery question,
uh, I'm glad you mentioned fungus.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, do you think a lot of people who see
just sort of solely focus on bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, and sort of forget about or don't
think about the importance of fungus?
[SPEAKER_02]: My experience with the majority of people
that are using T's or a lot of people that
[SPEAKER_02]: I speak to using T's is that the
understanding of the difference between a
[SPEAKER_02]: fungal dominant T and a bacterial dominant
T and what it takes to achieve those two
[SPEAKER_02]: things is not necessarily common
knowledge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It requires a little more investigation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, and, uh, uh, so I guess in a lot of
cases, it just seems like a lack of,
[SPEAKER_02]: a lack of understanding of, okay,
this is what I'm trying to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why, and this is how I achieve it
versus I've heard fun, I've heard compost
[SPEAKER_02]: T's work really well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm going to buy these products and
I'm going to combine them in this rate
[SPEAKER_02]: that I found online.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to create a compost T and
I'm going to feed it to my plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the number of people that are doing it
and not able to actually determine
[SPEAKER_02]: anything about their T, other than the
fact that it's brown and smells the way
[SPEAKER_02]: that they say it's supposed to smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't have a microscope to look at
it and actually see those life forms and
[SPEAKER_02]: have I produced a bunch of fungal hyphaea
or if I produced a bunch of bacteria and,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that in my discussions with a
lot of people and a lot of the questions
[SPEAKER_01]: that I feel this, um, that it takes a bit
more sophistication and an expensive
[SPEAKER_01]: microscope that you utilize to look at
your T's and see where your T's are and if
[SPEAKER_01]: the balance is where it needs to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people don't have access to that
and don't have the knowledge of that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but there are plenty of good recipes out
there for general T's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you were saying, bacillus subtilis is
a good overall.
[SPEAKER_01]: It kind of works for everything and it's
pretty easy to find in bagged mixes and
[SPEAKER_01]: then to multiply in a five gallon bucket
with an air stone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, in general, a lot of the T recipes
come out as a general overall T.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but when you get into production as
large and specific as we do here,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you need to know exactly what's going
into your T and what's coming out of your
[SPEAKER_01]: T.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so you know when to use it and if your
T is ripe or not.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
Okay.
