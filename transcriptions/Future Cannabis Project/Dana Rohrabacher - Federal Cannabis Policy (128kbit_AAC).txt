[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Kyle Kazan and I'm honored to
be moderating this afternoon's exciting
[SPEAKER_03]: and in many ways groundbreaking discussion
about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Who I am?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a California native who went to USC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was a police officer who's spoken out
against the drug war over the last 10
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: My company forms and manages private funds
to invest primarily in real estate
[SPEAKER_03]: globally but now also in cannabis in
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have assembled today an amazing panel
who I know you will enjoy listening to and
[SPEAKER_03]: learning from.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our panel and timing have lined up
amazingly today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yesterday, the Rohrbacher-Farr amendment
was passed into law.
[SPEAKER_03]: For those of you who don't know what that
is, Congressman Rohrbacher is here and can
[SPEAKER_03]: and will be explaining.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last Friday, the draft marijuana
regulations for the state of California
[SPEAKER_03]: released and the head of that is Lori Ajax
and she is here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a discussion seemingly every day
about the opioid epidemic in the United
[SPEAKER_03]: States along with the addiction and death
associated.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a small but growing movement of
plant over pills.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Daniel Piemeli is here with his
expertise as is Dr. Menard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have, we are covering all the bases
for science and law.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dana Rohrbacher currently serving his 13th
term in Congress.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dana Rohrbacher represents California's
scenic 48th district which is in Orange
[SPEAKER_03]: County.
[SPEAKER_03]: He graduated from Palos Verdes High School
which is the best high school in the world
[SPEAKER_03]: since I also graduated from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: He attended Harvard Junior College and
received his bachelor's degree in history
[SPEAKER_03]: from Long Beach State in 1969.
[SPEAKER_03]: He received his master's degree from the
University of Southern California,
[SPEAKER_03]: also the best university in the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: Congressman Rohrbacher has been a champion
of state's rights issue for marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is one of the founders of the Cannabis
Caucus in Congress.
[SPEAKER_03]: His Rohrbacher-Farr amendment first
introduced 14 years ago in 2003 and
[SPEAKER_03]: finally passed in 2014 prohibits the
Justice Department from spending funds to
[SPEAKER_03]: interfere with the implementation of state
medical marijuana laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was the first time either chamber of
Congress had voted to protect medical
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dr. Daniel Piemeli is an Italian-born
American scientist.
[SPEAKER_03]: He received his PhD from Columbia in
neuroscience as post-doc at Rockefeller
[SPEAKER_03]: University.
[SPEAKER_03]: Daniel joined the University of
California, Irvine where he is now Louise
[SPEAKER_03]: Turner Arnold Chair in neurosciences and
professor of anatomy and neurobiology,
[SPEAKER_03]: pharmacology and biological chemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys should try to read all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: He is editor in chief of Cannabis and
cannabinoid research, the only
[SPEAKER_03]: peer-reviewed journal entirely dedicated
to the study of cannabis, its derivatives
[SPEAKER_03]: and the endogenous counterparts in the
human body.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was quoted in the documentary Ride with
Larry, I think it was a surprise to him,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's worth a view if you haven't seen it,
and has since become an internet
[SPEAKER_03]: sensation.
[SPEAKER_03]: He deserves a round of applause too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Laurie Ajax, Laurie Ajax is the chief
of the Bureau of Medical Cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: Regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Appointed by Governor Brown in February
2000, 2016, she was previously chief
[SPEAKER_03]: deputy director of the California
Department of Alcohol Beverage Control or
[SPEAKER_03]: ABC, so every liquor store, bar,
restaurant, where she had served in
[SPEAKER_03]: multiple positions for over 22 years,
including deputy division chief,
[SPEAKER_03]: district administrator and supervising
investigator.
[SPEAKER_03]: Laurie spent 10 years in private industry
prior to her state government career.
[SPEAKER_03]: She holds a bachelor of science degree in
criminal justice from Cal State
[SPEAKER_03]: University, Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_03]: She is the marijuana czar in the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: Laurie flew in today from her office in
Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_03]: Laurie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I just got back from Washington last
night, and it is always nice to be home.
[SPEAKER_02]: I live right across the back bay there in
Costa Mesa.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, you've noticed that I have
this arm sling on, and just so you'll
[SPEAKER_02]: know, no, they did not try to twist my arm
to go to the other side on this issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that happens sometimes,
you know, I was at a reunion recently,
[SPEAKER_02]: and this guy was telling me this story
about the fellow who had all of his high
[SPEAKER_02]: school chums visit him and host a little
party for them 20 years later after they
[SPEAKER_02]: graduated from high school.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this guy had been fabulously
successful at a beautiful home and a
[SPEAKER_02]: swimming pool and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he took about 20 of his buddies out,
and the pool was covered, and he said,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to show you all something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he pushes the button, and the covers
come off the swimming pool, and there the
[SPEAKER_02]: pool is filled with alligators and sharks
and pythons and all sorts of horrible
[SPEAKER_02]: animals.
[SPEAKER_02]: And anyway, he said, look, I really wanted
to do something for you and show who is
[SPEAKER_02]: the most courageous.
[SPEAKER_02]: We always had to prove who was the most
courageous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I will give a million dollars to any
of you who will jump in that pool and swim
[SPEAKER_02]: to the end.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're all looking at each other,
and nobody steps forward, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: says, okay, I didn't think any of you were
going to take that deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on down, we got a barbecue down here.
[SPEAKER_02]: As they go down for the barbecue,
here's the splash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he looks into the pool, and there's a
guy swimming across the pool, beating away
[SPEAKER_02]: the sharks and the alligators.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, he crawls up on the end of the
pool, and the guy says, my God,
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think anybody would do it,
but you're going to get your million
[SPEAKER_02]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says, I don't care about the
million dollars, I want to find out who
[SPEAKER_02]: pushed me in that pool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here I am in Washington.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know what that has to do with
shark pools.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yes, sometimes Washington can be a
shark pit for people who are principled.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have tried to be principled,
which means that I make people on the
[SPEAKER_02]: liberal side of the end of the spectrum
mad at me half the time, really mad at me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people on the conservative end of the
spectrum really mad at me half the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I believe in what I'm doing,
and that's what it's all about,
[SPEAKER_02]: isn't it?
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing that I believe in is I
believe that this country is founded on
[SPEAKER_02]: the ideal of individual freedom and
liberty, and it is up to adults to
[SPEAKER_02]: determine for themselves what they consume
on their property, period, zero.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what freedom is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this idea of ideal where we have
limited government and where you have
[SPEAKER_02]: individual personal responsibility for
themselves, for ourselves, this idea where
[SPEAKER_02]: you have constitutional rights and you
have criminal law being handled at one end
[SPEAKER_02]: locally and not at the federal level,
these are all fundamental things that our
[SPEAKER_02]: country is supposed to be about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are what a lot of people have
been talking about, doctor-patient
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another principle that we've always
lived with, the doctor-patient
[SPEAKER_02]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana laws in this country have
violated every basic principle this
[SPEAKER_02]: country stands for for the last 75 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's time to stop it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, well, I have always voted for
liberalizing marijuana laws, whether
[SPEAKER_02]: medical or adult use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we all know, there are serious side
effects to having something outlawed like
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana, and that is we end up with a
situation where money that would be going
[SPEAKER_02]: to local clinics or whatever, or financing
a regular business, now end up in the
[SPEAKER_02]: hands of drug cartels in different parts
of the world, undermining democratic
[SPEAKER_02]: institutions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's actually a byproduct that is
felt elsewhere, and also, of course,
[SPEAKER_02]: we have basically turned the police into a
situation where they now have an excuse to
[SPEAKER_02]: stop just about anybody and frisk them,
which I do think is not what our founding
[SPEAKER_02]: fathers had in mind for freedom when they
talked about liberty and justice for all.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, of course, they never foresaw a
federal police force, like we've
[SPEAKER_02]: established now with the DEA, coming into
local communities, bashing down doors,
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to excuse this by the fact that
somebody has a little baggie of weeds,
[SPEAKER_02]: for Pete's sakes, and see this is why we
were able to go in and bash down that
[SPEAKER_02]: door, then we end up what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Giving military equipment to people who
are coming into our own communities?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so this has had a very serious
negative impact more than just the
[SPEAKER_02]: individual freedom, but individual freedom
was enough for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with that said, I've been trying to
vote this way, and I failed for many
[SPEAKER_02]: years.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been in Congress now 28 years,
but I finally found the formula with some
[SPEAKER_02]: of my colleagues on the other side of the
aisle, on the democratic side of the
[SPEAKER_02]: aisle, and that formula was Republicans
believe in states' rights, the 10th
[SPEAKER_02]: Amendment.
[SPEAKER_02]: They always talk about it, so I said let's
challenge them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's say that if a state legalizes the
use of medical marijuana, the federal
[SPEAKER_02]: government cannot use the funds that we
have to supersede what the people of that
[SPEAKER_02]: state have already decided.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that amendment, that amendment,
because instead of doing the job ourselves
[SPEAKER_02]: and saying this is the law for the whole
country, we left it up to the states,
[SPEAKER_02]: and with that, in 2014, I was able to pass
what they call the Rohrbacher FAR
[SPEAKER_02]: Amendment, which, I'll give you the exact
numbers of the vote, which was 219 to 109.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what does that tell you?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a pretty close vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: What made the difference was that we had
Republicans coming over and supporting the
[SPEAKER_02]: idea of states' rights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without that, we would not have had
the success that we've had, and since that
[SPEAKER_02]: time, of course, we've had these years,
since 2014 till now, where we've had a new
[SPEAKER_02]: industry being created based on the idea
that you have states' rights and the
[SPEAKER_02]: people of 45 states have somewhat
modified, if not totally legalized,
[SPEAKER_02]: the use of medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: We just recently, as was announced
yesterday, it was a big day, because
[SPEAKER_02]: obviously I had to work to see that the
Rohrbacher FAR Amendment, which says the
[SPEAKER_02]: federal government isn't going to
interfere, I had to work really hard to
[SPEAKER_02]: make sure it was in the omnibus.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a bill of all sorts of things put
together to keep the federal government
[SPEAKER_02]: running till October.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the Rohrbacher FAR Amendment didn't
just appear by magic.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had to really run around and talk to
people and twist arms and all the rest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they, of course, we managed to
succeed, and let me just note that
[SPEAKER_02]: yesterday, we succeeded in placing
Rohrbacher FAR again, making sure the law
[SPEAKER_02]: was in, that it's legal in those states
where people want to use medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana, where the states have made it
legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That happened, it just happened,
the same day as National Prayer Day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, just as a believer, I say further
proof of the existence of God.
[SPEAKER_02]: We won that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what do we stand now, and what's,
why we must do things?
[SPEAKER_02]: Look, one of the side effects of all of
this control, you see, there are certain
[SPEAKER_02]: people who believe in the nanny state.
[SPEAKER_02]: They believe that government should be
watching out for us, even in our personal
[SPEAKER_02]: decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't buy a big glass of Coke,
it has to be a medium-sized glass of Coke
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, I don't believe in that,
but a large number of both conservatives
[SPEAKER_02]: and liberals believe that we're gonna try
to watch out for people by controlling
[SPEAKER_02]: their own decisions over their own lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we now have to make sure that that
benevolent feeling and reason for being
[SPEAKER_02]: involved does not oversee what we consider
to be personal freedom and liberty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's been serious consequences to
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the serious consequences has
been we have not done the medical research
[SPEAKER_02]: on the cannabis plant that we should've.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's no reason in the world why
a cannabis plant has not been the focus of
[SPEAKER_02]: major research to see if it can help us
people in various situations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why is it that we can do research on
opium, but we can't do research on
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: How stupid is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So, anyway, I have, there's an epidemic
now, as we know, in opiates across this
[SPEAKER_02]: country.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm gonna leave you with one story and
just say, we need to make sure every
[SPEAKER_02]: member of the House, if you're not in my
district, make sure you contact your
[SPEAKER_02]: member of the House to support this
situation with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really important for you to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Second of all, there was a statement
issued by the President of the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States, I think it was today, explaining
why he did sign into law the omnibus bill
[SPEAKER_02]: and reflecting directly on the
Roebacher-Farr Amendment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he stated, some people in the cannabis
community think it's a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: nebulous, and it is nebulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every time you get involved with lawyers
and politicians, things are gonna be
[SPEAKER_02]: nebulous so people can maneuver.
[SPEAKER_02]: But nebulous doesn't mean we've lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't mean we've lost ground,
it just means it's nebulous.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's up to us to try to make sure that
people go the right course.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the President said that he would,
he noted the amendment, and then he noted
[SPEAKER_02]: that, but he will be enforcing the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, does he mean enforcing the law,
as Roebacher-Farr?
[SPEAKER_02]: Does he mean the law that makes marijuana
illegal federally?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, there's a contradiction there.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, the Ninth Circuit Court of
Appeals and several other courts have
[SPEAKER_02]: sided with us saying it is clear that the
intention of Congress now is that federal
[SPEAKER_02]: agents shall not go out and try to
supersede state law in those states where
[SPEAKER_02]: they've legalized medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for the President, actually,
to enforce the law, at least up until the
[SPEAKER_02]: Circuit Court of Appeals level,
the court system is siding with us and not
[SPEAKER_02]: with those people who would just take us
back to the dark ages where your lives are
[SPEAKER_02]: all gonna be controlled for your benefits.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's not gonna, hopefully,
if we have to, in fact, if we have to take
[SPEAKER_02]: it all the way to the Supreme Court,
we will win.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will win on this because we have
already gone through several court layers
[SPEAKER_02]: and the judges understand that that's the
intent of Congress and that is thus the
[SPEAKER_02]: law.
[SPEAKER_02]: So don't freak out when you're looking at
the President's statement and think that,
[SPEAKER_02]: well, that leaves open another
alternative.
[SPEAKER_02]: It does, but we have other forces at play
as well, legal forces.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm gonna leave you with that and let
others get up and talk, but I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_02]: leave you with one story and some of you
who've heard me tell that story,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I'm gonna finish it tonight in a
different way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is, as most of you know,
I was elected, mainly I was elected 28
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago because I had been Ronald
Reagan's principal speechwriter in the
[SPEAKER_02]: White House for seven years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that sort of impressed people here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no money, I had no name ID,
because when you're a speechwriter for the
[SPEAKER_02]: President, you're supposed to be a
ghostwriter and I held that standard.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I had no money and no name ID,
but I had 50 pictures of myself with
[SPEAKER_02]: Ronald Reagan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I won by a landslide, of course,
and my people, they all outspent me,
[SPEAKER_02]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, so I was elected as the Reagan
Republican.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had a beard then, so that was really
cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: They elected me even though I had a beard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I had to shave it because my wife,
well, right before we got married,
[SPEAKER_02]: she pulls this one on me.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna get married to a man with a
beard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on, the wedding's two weeks away,
shave the beard.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay, so I shaved the beard.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember I was walking downtown in
Huntington Beach and I said to myself,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, my constituents, they remember,
they all know me with the beard.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, Reagan, Roy Bakker's the guy
with the beard next to Reagan.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I said, well, I'm gonna walk down
and talk to some voters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I stopped this guy and said,
hey, I'm running for Congress and I want
[SPEAKER_02]: your vote.
[SPEAKER_02]: The guy looks at me and says, you got it,
buddy, that bearded bum who represents us
[SPEAKER_02]: now.
[SPEAKER_02]: But let me leave you with one this last
thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't know what this would mean for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: All I knew is I believed in individual
freedom and I believe in what our founding
[SPEAKER_02]: fathers had in mind for our country.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all I knew when I got involved with
this particular issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I did know that I had some very
conservative supporters and didn't know
[SPEAKER_02]: how they would react.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there was a guy who came into my office
who was a retired military officer who was
[SPEAKER_02]: now in aerospace.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I asked him, and he was the typical
Warbacher voter.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I said, okay, how do you feel about the
fact that the guy you've been supporting
[SPEAKER_02]: all this time is the point person for
legalizing medical marijuana in the United
[SPEAKER_02]: States?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he looked at me and he said,
Dana, you don't really know me that well,
[SPEAKER_02]: do you?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, well, I knew you were in the
military and a pilot and now you're in
[SPEAKER_02]: aerospace.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then he says, yeah, but what you don't
know is I have three sons.
[SPEAKER_02]: Two of them, or three of them,
marched off the day after 9-11 and signed
[SPEAKER_02]: up for the military.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I said, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, a couple of years later,
two of them came home.
[SPEAKER_02]: The third one who came home wasn't my son
anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was on the ground in convulsions.
[SPEAKER_02]: What could I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, nothing we did could help
him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he said, we took him to the VA.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, this is sinful that we
don't allow the VA to handle anything that
[SPEAKER_02]: can help our veterans should be given to
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we went to the VA.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, it wasn't helping them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they kept giving him these other
things that turned him into a zombie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, after a year, he said,
some guy from the VA pulled us aside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come and see me downtown.
[SPEAKER_02]: We did.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said, look, I can't tell you this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Had the VA property.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he said, your son needs marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a prescription.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's how to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he says, you know, my son hasn't had a
seizure since that day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, he said, so I'm going to come over
and give you a hug.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: But he called me a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you guys have heard that story
before, he called me a couple of days ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how is your son?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are the seizures still gone?
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, yeah, the seizures are still
gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's a problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said, what's the problem?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the VA has got him addicted to these
opiates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's like a zombie.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when they try to take him off,
they're insisting that he stops using the
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the seizures come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is outrageous.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I will tell you right now,
here's what he told me.
[SPEAKER_02]: He says, and we're in a crisis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we need your help.
[SPEAKER_02]: His son was there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they were trying to get him off of
opiates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they're demanding to take care of
everything, which is going to throw him
[SPEAKER_02]: into a seizure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he went out in the car to consume some
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, the people who guard our VA
hospitals, the parking lot, are federal
[SPEAKER_02]: employees.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they arrested him.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they said, will you help?
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, I'm getting help.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm getting help.
[SPEAKER_02]: For God's sakes, this is the type of
nonsense and just inhumane ignorance that
[SPEAKER_02]: comes when people are trying to run other
people's lives for them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, everybody can be well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sure that people who made these
decisions were well-intended, just like
[SPEAKER_02]: those congressmen who voted for one of the
bills we put up that said the VA will be
[SPEAKER_02]: free to prescribe marijuana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Medical marijuana in those states where
medical marijuana is legal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was defeated by like three or
four votes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, those people who voted against that,
they were not mean-spirited.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't want this man to suffer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we now know we have to get the word to
these people that not only the veterans,
[SPEAKER_02]: but our senior citizens and lots of other
people are suffering because of this
[SPEAKER_02]: effort on their part to protect them from
themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: How stupid is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are smarter than that, but they all
have good souls.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not telling you these are evil
people doing this.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to reach out to those people and
change the law and give freedom to our
[SPEAKER_02]: people and give some help to those people
who are suffering who cannabis can help.
[SPEAKER_02]: So God bless you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, I'm gonna go to Dana.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna ask about the pool and the
snakes and the crocodiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people in here are thinking,
they're either in the business thinking
[SPEAKER_03]: about getting the business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the question I get asked most often
is, Jeff Sessions, what do we think Mr.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sessions might do as he tipped his hand,
coal letter, that kind of thing?
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff Sessions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jeff Sessions is a very good friend of
mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known him for 30 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, more than that, I actually met
him when I was still a teenager,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he was a teenager, and we were
involved in conservative organizations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every one of the conservative
organizations that we were part of
[SPEAKER_02]: stressed the constitutional government,
including the 10th Amendment to the
[SPEAKER_02]: Constitution, which leaves things like
this up to the states.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have reminded him of that many
times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so let me just note, he is a honest
man and a person who's got a good heart.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just like a lot of people who wanna
help you along by telling you what to do
[SPEAKER_02]: with your personal life, they are very
well motivated in that they really have
[SPEAKER_02]: good hearts.
[SPEAKER_02]: They think they're helping you out.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Jeff thinks that how horrible it is
when he's seen, he came up in the 60s and
[SPEAKER_02]: saw people who were getting really wild,
and that's impacted on his vision of what
[SPEAKER_02]: it's gonna be like.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's difficult to tell him that,
yes, normal people, and actually people
[SPEAKER_02]: you like, like veterans and senior
citizens, and a lot of other people,
[SPEAKER_02]: not just young people wanting to get wild,
need to have the freedom to use cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that should be up to the state
government and the people therein.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quite frankly, if I was here not as a
federal representative, I wouldn't think
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd want as much regulation as we're
talking about here in the state of
[SPEAKER_02]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's up to you, not up to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But Jeff Sessions, I talked to him,
I will have to admit, I talked to him
[SPEAKER_02]: yesterday.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on a number of subjects, this was one
of them, and we have agreed that we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have a meeting where we will
in-depth look at this issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can just rest assured,
I don't know if you, after listening to me
[SPEAKER_02]: speak, if I hope that you trust the fact
that I learned my lessons about
[SPEAKER_02]: communications from Ronald Reagan,
the great communicator, and I will put all
[SPEAKER_02]: of those to work to try to expand the
realm of freedom for you to live your
[SPEAKER_02]: lives and those people who want to use
cannabis to go right ahead and use it,
[SPEAKER_02]: adults, to use that cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will do everything I can in that
discussion with Jeff to push freedom for
[SPEAKER_02]: us.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll do my best, and I can't tell you,
I can only predict this.
[SPEAKER_02]: If Jeff Sessions goes the wrong way and
convinces the president to reverse his
[SPEAKER_02]: position in the camp pain, remember,
the president specifically said in the
[SPEAKER_02]: campaign, medical marijuana should be
legal and adult use should be left up to
[SPEAKER_02]: the states.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said that several times.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, if Jeff is convinced the president to
renege on that, I'm sorry, but I will tell
[SPEAKER_02]: you this much.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will tell him that I have no doubt that
it will go to the courts and the Ninth
[SPEAKER_02]: Circuit Court of Appeals has already
verified our position on this,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we don't expect other judges to find
fault with those with that decision.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it will be a huge waste of his time and
money, and why would he do that?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll make the case.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dana.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what is your advice to people in the
business thinking about entering the
[SPEAKER_03]: business?
[SPEAKER_03]: Growing a few plants at home, or if I put
out something and said, you should invest
[SPEAKER_03]: with me, what advice would you give those
people today in 2017, in May of 2017?
[SPEAKER_02]: The issue has not been definitely settled
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people who are putting money out,
there are entrepreneurs who are putting
[SPEAKER_02]: money into the cannabis business,
and especially the medical dispensary
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they are taking a great risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are profits that should come from
risks.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's as simple as that.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the way the free enterprise system
works.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would hope that no one here
begrudges them once it becomes legal in
[SPEAKER_02]: this state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if we manage to secure this arena from
federal intervention, I hope no one here
[SPEAKER_02]: begrudges these people the right to make a
profit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know this is the Republican part of
my personality coming out here,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you have a lot of people right now are
taking great risks in order to get medical
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana to people who need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yes, they should, if we move forward,
which is not certain yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, not only Jeff Sessions,
but who knows?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have to tell you folks,
but during Obama, and now even during
[SPEAKER_02]: Jerry Brown, I have not gotten the
cooperation from the Democrat side that I
[SPEAKER_02]: thought I was gonna get.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the attorney general's office
under Obama was not supportive of the
[SPEAKER_02]: efforts that I was making.
[SPEAKER_02]: We made that despite what was going on
with the president and the attorney
[SPEAKER_02]: general then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, Jerry Brown has not stepped
up to the plate either.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have, it's settled yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you folks are going to move
forward, remember, with what I just said,
[SPEAKER_02]: that means the future is not charted.
[SPEAKER_02]: We will make the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the great thing about this country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those of us in this room, freedom belongs
to the activists.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would hope that we all know that we
have to be very, very active with our
[SPEAKER_02]: elected officials.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by doing that, we will protect our
freedom to consume, but also, just as
[SPEAKER_02]: important, the right of people investing
now to make a profit so that they have
[SPEAKER_02]: done the right thing in providing us the
cannabis that people want to consume for
[SPEAKER_02]: their medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't know if that answered your
question, but that's what it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can our representatives protect
cannabis stakeholders from federal
[SPEAKER_00]: intervention if local law enforcement can
be deputized as federal agents?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have to go to the courts.
[SPEAKER_02]: The court has to determine what is the
law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you would deputize some local
person to become a federal agent,
[SPEAKER_02]: at that point, that person, if it is the,
if we're talking about the Department of
[SPEAKER_02]: Justice, at this moment, and at least
until October of this year, and hopefully
[SPEAKER_02]: we'll get it renewed, that that person
will be breaking the law.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if that person is now on a federal law
enforcement officer working under the
[SPEAKER_02]: control of the Department of Justice,
I'm sorry, the courts, I have written,
[SPEAKER_02]: along with a majority of other members of
Congress, written into the law that state
[SPEAKER_02]: law will be respected.
[SPEAKER_02]: And whether or not they're trying to get
around it by deputizing local law
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcement or not, they still come under
the jurisdiction of the Department of
[SPEAKER_02]: Justice.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't think there's any way they can
escape that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, however, this may be decided in
court.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so far, you know, I've had to
actually, when we're talking about whether
[SPEAKER_02]: or not these various political figures
that we would have hoped would have been
[SPEAKER_02]: more on our side on this issue,
whether it's Jerry Brown or Obama,
[SPEAKER_02]: I was hoping they would be, but I've had
to end up calling judges.
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally have had to call judges and
write judges saying, in the last few
[SPEAKER_02]: years, when these people have been in
power, and they actually ignore the fact
[SPEAKER_02]: that we have put this in a restriction
into the appropriations bill, and I've had
[SPEAKER_02]: to call judges and say, look, if you have
a federal prosecutor in your court today,
[SPEAKER_02]: and he is prosecuting someone who's
involved with the medical use of
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana, and this state, and your state,
has legalized the medical use of
[SPEAKER_02]: marijuana, there is only one criminal in
your court, and that is the guy who is the
[SPEAKER_02]: prosecutor, not the defendant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, and quite frankly, I remember
doing that once, and the Federal Court of
[SPEAKER_02]: Appeals backed me up on that in this
particular case.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what's the answer?
[SPEAKER_02]: The answer is they try to do things like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have to go to the courts.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as long as we have this coalition
between the 68 Republicans who believe in
[SPEAKER_02]: states' rights and the Constitution,
and the Democrats on the other side of the
[SPEAKER_02]: aisle, who, by the way, I think are
motivated by the fact their political base
[SPEAKER_02]: wants that, which is there's nothing wrong
with that in a democracy.
[SPEAKER_02]: First of all, go for your political base.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that coalition is the one who's writing
the law now, not the people in the
[SPEAKER_02]: executive branch.
[SPEAKER_02]: Their job is to enforce the law after it's
made by the elected representatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is for the congressman.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of talk today about doing
research, and my group is ready to do just
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're funding the next four years of the
Technion in Israel's research on cancer,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we have a top pediatric hospital in
the country ready to do seven different
[SPEAKER_01]: clinical trials with us and over 1,000
children.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you may know, the University of
Mississippi that has the contract with
[SPEAKER_01]: NIDA to provide companies like mine with
flour is growing what I call wheat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's contaminated, it's poor quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many universities have dropped out of
clinical research.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's being cited on papers that they think
their trials were of poor quality because
[SPEAKER_01]: of the poor flour that they had to use.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of advice can you give someone
like myself and my organization who
[SPEAKER_01]: desperately needs our own DEA grow
license, none of which have been handed
[SPEAKER_01]: out yet, what can we do in order to change
these regulations or get a better policy
[SPEAKER_01]: in place so we can get a federal DEA
license to grow quality cannabis for dying
[SPEAKER_01]: patients?
[SPEAKER_02]: The greatest sin that I think has been
committed in this whole era of where
[SPEAKER_02]: people want the government to be the nanny
government and take care of our lives and
[SPEAKER_02]: thus have perpetuated what I consider to
be fascistic controls over our personal
[SPEAKER_02]: lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: The worst effect of that has been is that
we have basically restricted the knowledge
[SPEAKER_02]: base that we have on this plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we learn in the future through opening
up, and we need to open this up
[SPEAKER_02]: dramatically, this research, you're right,
the Mississippi thing, that is a disgrace.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is a national disgrace that we have
left one university with limited amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: ability to look into this issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we learn in the future, which I believe
the evidence seems to indicate that there
[SPEAKER_02]: are some real uses and it's anecdotal now,
we need to prove that, but when that is
[SPEAKER_02]: proven, I think that we need to look back
on these people who have ignored the
[SPEAKER_02]: potential goodness of this in order to
save us from ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna save us wonderful.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're gonna control our lives,
and that's what happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyway, I will fight to make sure that
research dollars, by the way, just let me
[SPEAKER_02]: tell you this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't, people come to me every day with
a disease they want to have, that they
[SPEAKER_02]: want to have researched every day,
and I say, I'm not gonna focus on one
[SPEAKER_02]: disease.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not gonna do that, but I will support
increases in the general level of research
[SPEAKER_02]: in this country, which I always have,
and I believe that when we look at the
[SPEAKER_02]: general level of research, we need to make
sure that we don't eliminate areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some people want us just to focus on their
particular problem, but when it comes to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, we've eliminated an area of
honest investigation, so you can count on
[SPEAKER_02]: some of us there.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot of people now that are aware
that, I am so proud that the Israeli
[SPEAKER_02]: government has taken the lead on this,
but I think at the same time I'm proud of
[SPEAKER_02]: them, I'm ashamed of our own government
for not taking that same stand on open
[SPEAKER_02]: research into this a long time ago,
so thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, I just wanted to make one comment
concerning the schedule one issue and the
[SPEAKER_00]: University of Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know very well people at the University
of Mississippi, they're very respectable
[SPEAKER_00]: scientists and everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue is that really we can't do
research in the current regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I have to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: We cannot, schedule one seems like the
schedule system seems like a reasonable,
[SPEAKER_00]: logical regulatory system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is completely illogical and it's
completely wrong, and the only thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: it actually achieves is to really
blocking, preventing researchers from
[SPEAKER_00]: doing their job, because everybody else
who wants to use it don't really care.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I want to reassert again what the
doctor just said.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry, Hillary Clinton wanting to
reschedule, that means nothing.
[SPEAKER_02]: The fact is it could end up a disaster if
it's not rescheduled the right way.
[SPEAKER_02]: If someone says deschedule, all right,
let's think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We could end up with a worse situation if
it's just rescheduling.
[SPEAKER_02]: We literally could end up where there's
less research and there's further controls
[SPEAKER_02]: over each and every one of us here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we got to be very, very careful when
we're talking about rescheduling.
I think that's all I have to say.
