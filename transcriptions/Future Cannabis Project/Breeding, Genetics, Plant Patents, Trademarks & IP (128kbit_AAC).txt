[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, we're going to be transitioning
now into the IP intellectual property
[SPEAKER_00]: section of the discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: IP is a very misunderstood issue in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in flux.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very complicated in the United States
when it comes to patents and plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the United States system is very
unique in this regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing is that patents are kind of
the elephant in the room, and everybody's
[SPEAKER_00]: worried about patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of discussion online about
patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotech Industries LLC has applied for and
received several cannabis-related patents,
[SPEAKER_00]: some utility patents, as well as cultivar
patents that fall under the same category
[SPEAKER_00]: as their utility patent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is something that's not very well
understood.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of confusion about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also a lot of facets that
we're not necessarily looking at or
[SPEAKER_00]: discussing online, things like trademarks,
ablations.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of different ways of
protecting IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're lucky enough to have Sheila here
with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's a patent attorney.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has experience in this field.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so yeah, I'm going to kick it over to
Sheila to give us a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: background on the patent system.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's misunderstood in this industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's so much in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such an open-ended question.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would start by saying maybe,
yes, you can patent a plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the US, like Trevor mentioned,
is different than most other countries in
[SPEAKER_01]: that there is a system that's divided by
whether it's seed-propagated or it's
[SPEAKER_01]: clones asexually propagated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so plant patents that you see are
asexually propagated clones.
[SPEAKER_01]: And those are just for the clone,
that one genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whatever else you see in the
description that's all required in order
[SPEAKER_01]: to describe that clone, it still only
covers that clone and anything asexually
[SPEAKER_01]: propagated.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it would be identical genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of infringement, you'd be looking
at genetic testing and finding out that,
[SPEAKER_01]: yes, more likely than not, this is the
same clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also utility patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: Utility patents aren't limited by whether
it's asexually propagated or
[SPEAKER_01]: seed-propagated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they do require a seed deposit,
which currently in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: you cannot deposit seeds within a US seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you can deposit in Scotland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can have a utility patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be somewhat broader.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we can talk a lot about the scope of
patents and whether or not going for too
[SPEAKER_01]: broad of scope, which I think we've seen
some of with biotech industries,
[SPEAKER_01]: LLC, might actually get you an invalid
patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's utility patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I skipped over USDA protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: USDA protection is the plant breeder's
rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you see that internationally,
that there are programs set up around the
[SPEAKER_01]: world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of them might differ slightly.
[SPEAKER_01]: US differs right now because it is only
for seed-propagated cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it is for, they are opening it up to
asexually reproduced cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's under USDA control,
USDA following the 2018 farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as most of you are aware, USDA hasn't
set forth what their regulations and
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements are going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we hope they're coming soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing about that is that you do
have to make a deposit to get that type of
[SPEAKER_01]: protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, for seed-propagated,
it's 2,500 seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they go through DUS testing to
determine that it is a stable line.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the patent and plant side of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Trevor also mentioned trademarks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And currently what I'm seeing,
and I think that there was some discussion
[SPEAKER_01]: today, if patents isn't the way that
you're thinking about going, you have
[SPEAKER_01]: trademarks as an option for protecting
your brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is that you are the source of
these genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that nobody else can use that brand
name because that brand name designates
[SPEAKER_01]: you as a source.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of a very high level overview
of what's available.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's also trade secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I guess if you're vertically
integrated and you are not worried about
[SPEAKER_01]: your clones getting out or any of your
breeding techniques or things,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're gonna protect them with trade
secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do that provided that everything
remains in your control and everything
[SPEAKER_01]: remains secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do have to have precautions that would
protect your secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you do have to be able to establish
that you have taken precautions to protect
[SPEAKER_01]: your secret in order to have any claim for
damages in the lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's trade secret.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then copyright is the last branch of
IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copyright is more for creative works,
but can be used for logos.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then another thing that I see a lot of
in this industry, a lot of pictures of
[SPEAKER_01]: your genetics, whether or not you're
protecting those pictures, whether or not
[SPEAKER_01]: other people are using those pictures,
especially on social media, are they just
[SPEAKER_01]: reposting your pictures without your
permission?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there are all these different
layers of IP protection, but the one that
[SPEAKER_01]: I see the most talked about right now is
patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and so the point there is that
there's an incredibly complicated system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in flux right now because it's
changing literally right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The USDA is drafting their regulations
with regard to how they're going to deal
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically with hemp plant variety
protections.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are for seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have seed protections for plant
variety protections.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was created under the 1970s Plant
Variety Protection Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, dating all the way back to
the 1930s, people could get protections
[SPEAKER_00]: for clone only varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, the plant or fruit tree
producers lobbied the Congress to pass the
[SPEAKER_00]: Plant Patent Act of 1930.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why clone only reproduced plants
are held under a different sort of system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is why the United States is totally
different than everybody else.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody else has plant patent,
the PVP, plant variety protections apply
[SPEAKER_00]: to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, we have two separate
systems where plant variety protections
[SPEAKER_00]: apply to seeds and plant patents apply to
clones, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why so much of this is in flux
and is really something that is a gamble.
[SPEAKER_00]: People like biotech industries are seeing
this emerging legalization and are
[SPEAKER_00]: pursuing an IP strategy that is very
similar and akin to what big tech was
[SPEAKER_00]: doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it wasn't big tech back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the 1980s, Silicon Valley,
people were just gobbling up patents and
[SPEAKER_00]: patenting all sorts of things that may or
may not have been unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they were setting very minute patents
up and collecting all of them as an IP
[SPEAKER_00]: strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biotech seems to be pursuing a similar
strategy right now because it's not even
[SPEAKER_00]: clear that they could enforce or protect
their patents as it stands today.
[SPEAKER_00]: They may be able to in the future,
though, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that's really
interesting about the USPTO, so we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: government, and I think that's something
that's really important to realize,
[SPEAKER_01]: is these are all different government
agencies and they're all treating cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: very differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, and even within a single agency,
so you have the United States Patent and
[SPEAKER_01]: Trademark Office that is responsible for
issuing both patents and trademarks,
[SPEAKER_01]: reviewing them, issuing them, and they
treat them completely separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of that, and so you'll hear a lot
of misinformation about, no, you can't get
[SPEAKER_01]: patents because it's federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, for patents, that's not even one
of the inquiries of the patent office.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it has not been a hurdle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, that there have been patents
been issuing for cannabis for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, in fact, I think the government
applied for theirs, I think, I want to
[SPEAKER_01]: say, like 1980-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly, but the government
does have patents on the life-protecting
[SPEAKER_00]: or, you know, life-saving properties of
cannabis, which is a biting irony.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not an inquiry of the patent
office.
[SPEAKER_01]: The patent office, what they want to know
is, is it new?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it, well, is it useful?
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you described it in order to meet the
statutory requirements?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it novel and non-optimal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it obvious over what was already known
in the art?
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no inquiry about whether it's,
you know, there's any moral or,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, legal reason to not issue a
patent on that technology.
[SPEAKER_01]: Contrast that with the Trademark Office,
which is the same USPTO, and the Trademark
[SPEAKER_01]: Office has a requirement that you are
using the mark in commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in commerce has historically been
interpreted to mean regulated by Congress.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, the state can regulate what
goes on within the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then once you move, you know,
outside of the state, then, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: interstate would be in commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that is the issue with trademark
protection for cannabis, is that you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: show lawfully that you are using your mark
in commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not for anything that's federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can for ancillary parts of your
business that are federally legal or that
[SPEAKER_01]: don't present the issues of the CSA and
now even after the farm bill and once the
[SPEAKER_01]: USDA gets their regulations out and we're
able to show that we can use the marks in
[SPEAKER_01]: commerce for hemp, even still for CBD,
for example, the Trademark Office is still
[SPEAKER_01]: going to look at the Food, Drug,
and Cosmetics Act.
[SPEAKER_01]: So still that would be something that you
wouldn't be able to put that in commerce.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the Trademark Office is very
literal in how they're issuing that type
[SPEAKER_01]: of IP protection, but you have the same
government agency, the USPTO, not worrying
[SPEAKER_01]: about that at all as far as patents are
concerned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mojave, you might have some experience
here, at least observing how this has
[SPEAKER_00]: played out a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Amsterdam, there's been issues and
controversy surrounding names and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: been IP strategies predicated on
trademarking names like White Widow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how has that played out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, well, I can't really speak to other
people's trademarks, but I can.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's three different companies who have
trademarks on plants that I've bred.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have those trademarks.
[SPEAKER_02]: People just went and preempted me and went
and got trademarks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one particular company actually
acquired some genetics of mine and because
[SPEAKER_02]: they understood that they couldn't
trademark the plant, they just trademarked
[SPEAKER_02]: every possible package that the plant
would be in.
[SPEAKER_02]: From vape pens to bottles to baseball caps
and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Amsterdam, there was a lot of internal
battle going on between seed companies
[SPEAKER_02]: over the rights to these different lines.
[SPEAKER_02]: And most of them didn't trademark them
until it was too late.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there was also, I mean, we could get
into some nasty stories, but there was
[SPEAKER_02]: people who broke into people's grows and
stole clones and killed moms and then went
[SPEAKER_02]: and trademarked that variety essentially.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or didn't necessarily trademark the
variety that they killed, but saw that
[SPEAKER_02]: there was this opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Sheila mentioned something really
relevant is that the trademark has more
[SPEAKER_02]: value in many ways than the patent.
[SPEAKER_02]: A patent is, as far as I understand,
very difficult to enforce compared to a
[SPEAKER_02]: trademark.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Although a patent can, you have more
rights.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in terms of a trademark, you can
prevent them from using your trademark,
[SPEAKER_01]: but a patent is what would allow you to
prevent them.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had a utility patent, for example,
you could even prevent them from breeding
[SPEAKER_01]: with your genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you had a plant patent,
you couldn't prevent that but in the case
[SPEAKER_01]: of having stolen, then you could
certainly, that they couldn't use it or
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to use it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: What if, I'm sorry, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, the point I was just gonna make
was that we need to be thinking,
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals, if you're out there,
if you're branding, if you've actually
[SPEAKER_00]: built a brand, start thinking about
trademarks now and start thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: that ahead of time because your brand
could become hijacked from you like so
[SPEAKER_00]: many have before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've experienced this, the Amsterdam
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all have, to a certain extent,
the benefit of having seen what's happened
[SPEAKER_00]: with other crops.
[SPEAKER_00]: We talked about that earlier, be it crops
like apples or in the wine and the booze
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have Amsterdam and we can look to
there as a historical example for what has
[SPEAKER_00]: happened and how to protect ourselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, one thing I'm wondering is that what
strategy do we have as breeders?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it seems to me the biggest issue
is prior art and novelty.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how far do you look into the ecosystem
to prove that there is prior art or that a
[SPEAKER_02]: variety is novel?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been told that the USPTO is
looking further every day, that they're
[SPEAKER_02]: gaining new tools to actually look into
this cannabis issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it seems that it's really just come
first surf at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and there's a difference between,
well first you have to, you always have to
[SPEAKER_01]: be clear whether you're talking about a
plant patent or a utility patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for a plant patent, because that's only
protecting a single clone or single
[SPEAKER_01]: genetics, then there isn't much that you
need to establish in terms of novelty.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, the fact that you have produced
this new clone, it's different,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's novel, it's not existing.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, it's not existed before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's just accepted and there
isn't that hurdle.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're talking about novelty,
you're really talking about utility
[SPEAKER_01]: patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is the biggest hurdle right now
is because this, you know, we're talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about an illegal industry, there isn't a
lot of art to sell what was known in the
[SPEAKER_01]: art before, even though, you know,
in the culture everyone knows,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, or you probably have a lot more
understanding of what was known or you see
[SPEAKER_01]: these patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'll see companies like biotech
industries, and I hate to keep beating up
[SPEAKER_01]: on them, but, you know, they have this
really broad patent coverage and they were
[SPEAKER_01]: able to get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're able to convince an examiner at
the USPTO that this is novel and
[SPEAKER_01]: non-obvious and they have a patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's more interesting is when we're
going to see if they're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: asserted because what happens once a
patent is asserted is that defendant gets
[SPEAKER_01]: to, and typically one of the first things
they'll argue, the first two things
[SPEAKER_01]: they're going to argue, one, is that
they're not infringing, two, that the
[SPEAKER_01]: patent is invalid.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if a defendant can invalidate a patent
in court, that's just gone for everybody.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's one thing, and I know we've
talked, or not we've talked a little bit,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I've seen you talk a little bit with
Dale about the recent case law.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the most interesting things to
me is in what I haven't seen yet and I
[SPEAKER_01]: hope to see is I hope to see the community
band around that defendant and invalidate
[SPEAKER_01]: that patent because it doesn't just help
that defendant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just quickly, this is United, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't just help that defendant,
but it helps the community as a whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I do think we're going to see a lot
of very broad, overreaching patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I hope to see is I hope to see the
community band around and help invalidate
[SPEAKER_01]: those patents, bring forth the prior art
that we could use to invalidate those
[SPEAKER_01]: types of patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I hope that eventually we'll see
actual patents for true innovation because
[SPEAKER_01]: there is, you know, there's so many people
who've dedicated their entire lives to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, innovating in this field.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they deserve to be rewarded for
that innovation.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now it is a little bit of a land
grab.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what they choose to do with that,
we'll have to wait and see.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already seen, you know, that one
that's been asserted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so my hope is that it will be
invalidated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other thing that happens is,
you know, there is a lot going on behind
[SPEAKER_01]: the scenes as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they chose to pursue it in court.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing is to try and make
everyone pay royalties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it isn't until you ask someone to
pay royalties and they say no that you end
[SPEAKER_01]: up, you know, typically that's how it
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: You end up in court.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in kind of one analogy is I used to do
a lot of work in the pet diagnostics
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this was very early on that I learned
this is I was doing a invalidity search or
[SPEAKER_01]: an invalidity opinion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was doing a search to see what sort of
patents that my client might be infringing
[SPEAKER_01]: on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I was giving an opinion on
whether, you know, we had a
[SPEAKER_01]: non-infringement or an invalidity position
as to each of those patents.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was one of them that was clearly
invalid.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, there was prior art all over it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the claims were way too broad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when I presented it to the client,
the client's response was, well,
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone in the industry just pays that
royalty.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That can happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: If people decide that it's easier just to
pay the royalty that they're asking rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than deal with it in court.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the game that's played.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things about IP and patents is
that this is a game that is being decided
[SPEAKER_00]: by people that have deep pockets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And patent litigation is always a
financial calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for individuals, sometimes it's
going to be worth it just to pay the
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing fee and not to pursue litigation
because you're up against a highly
[SPEAKER_00]: capitalized firm that is going to be able
to just draw out litigation and beat you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other times, there are certain instances
where people are going to be pursuing this
[SPEAKER_00]: litigation very actively and aggressively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it remains to be seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing I would like to kind of talk
about is different models .
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've talked about biotech.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've likened it to a land grab.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've likened it to the Silicon Valley and
the tech industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also Phylos.
[SPEAKER_00]: Phylos is probably why I'm sitting on the
stage right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've pretty clearly adopted the
Monsanto model.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're looking at creating a plant
production pipeline wherein they will
[SPEAKER_00]: create tons of asexually produced plants
that they will seek patents on and will
[SPEAKER_00]: then sell through a licensing arrangement
with different farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most likely easiest way for them to do
this, we all know that they're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: powder mildew resistance.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they identify genetics that have powder
mildew resistance, they can take that
[SPEAKER_00]: powder mildew resistant gene, introgress
it into all of the existing clone only
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties that we have, Josh D's,
OG, the chem, the cookies, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of the varieties that have large
market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could then create powder mildew
resistant, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is what looks to be their strategy.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've written it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've talked about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mowgli's talked about this at the AEIC,
which is a big biotech conglomerate where
[SPEAKER_00]: they all get together and share their
plans.
[SPEAKER_00]: That model, is that model one that is here
now that literally could be rolled out and
[SPEAKER_00]: implemented today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is this a model that they're looking
five years down the road where we could
[SPEAKER_00]: essentially roll this out if we start now,
be ready by the time federal prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: ends?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is this like literally today?
[SPEAKER_00]: Could Phylos start pumping out tons of
clone only, powder mildew resistant,
[SPEAKER_00]: clone only varieties?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not even genetically modified.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just traditional breeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is marker assisted back crossing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say, we've demonstrated that this
genetic is powder mildew resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because of these specific markers
that it is powder mildew resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we take those markers, introgress
them, cross them into these other
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics, and then just back cross it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you know who's doing that work for
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual work.
[SPEAKER_00]: The actual work?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the extent, there are people who we
assume might be doing it, but we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: really say because they won't come clean
on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We suspect that there are certain
individuals in ... Well, I would say that
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly their intention was to
crowdsource that information.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why most of the people who
submitted samples to Phylos, myself
[SPEAKER_02]: included, if it came with no chemotypic
data, no terpene analysis, cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_02]: analysis, it really is of little value to
them for this breeding project that
[SPEAKER_02]: they're embarking on.
[SPEAKER_02]: But boy, I'm sure they wanted it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If everyone who submitted a sample said,
oh, by the way, mine is powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_02]: resistant, sure, they'd go searching for
that marker.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that sample.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or looking for a common marker within all
the people who submitted that,
[SPEAKER_02]: hey, mine is powdery mildew resistant.
[SPEAKER_02]: But most people didn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a lost opportunity for them that
forced them to embark on their own
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding program in order to identify
those markers because the galaxy didn't
[SPEAKER_02]: fulfill that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and that was really stage two.
[SPEAKER_00]: The discovery project, as it's been dubbed
by them, was specifically about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've read the contract that they presented
to Heroes of the Farms, and it's very
[SPEAKER_00]: clear from that contract that they were
trying to identify powdery mildew
[SPEAKER_00]: resistant varieties in his genetics,
and they were claiming to be able to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: others to bear.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, they took that same deal to at least
16 other producers, breeders who have
[SPEAKER_00]: historically been breeding and growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know who actually agreed to move
forward with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know for a fact that Patrick at Heroes
of the Farms said no way and never signed
[SPEAKER_00]: anything with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's our concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, real talk, a lot of people are
concerned about Phylos' ability not only
[SPEAKER_00]: just like to steal, not steal,
but crowdsource and crowdfund a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: bunch of information and create an
opportunity across where we just put into
[SPEAKER_00]: their system but what is the possibility
that they're going to now take the
[SPEAKER_00]: information that they have and build out a
Monsanto-type pipeline where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: producing plants that they're able to then
get patents on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that something they could do today?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, any time that you're
creating a new clone or a new variety,
[SPEAKER_01]: then yes, absolutely you can get a plant
patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But remember, it is for that specific
clone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but the issue comes with Big Ag in
that if you're talking about a commodities
[SPEAKER_01]: market and they can grow it more
efficiently and effectively and produce
[SPEAKER_01]: it, you know, your genetics with,
you know, this resistance in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where the Monsantos of the world
come from.
[SPEAKER_01]: They did it with genetically modified but,
you know, if you're saying do the same
[SPEAKER_01]: thing with marker-assisted breeding,
then yes, if you have something that,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, if you eventually get it to a
stable seed, and you can distribute seeds
[SPEAKER_01]: and have everybody growing this more
efficiently than anyone else, then yes,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can get patent protection on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, as long as you're not growing their
genetics, then you don't have a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: from an infringement standpoint,
but you absolutely might have a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: from an efficiency and keeping up with
them standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, this is a big concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ability of the Monsantos or large
capitalized ag, they're able to bring
[SPEAKER_00]: economies of scale, and the main concern
is that we as producers, licensed
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators, don't buy into the hype of
efficiencies and economies of scale,
[SPEAKER_00]: but stay true to what we've historically
done, selecting the thing that may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: the largest yielder, but is the best for
our particular needs and desires and what
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to produce and create here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need to recognize that while
there are companies that are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: pursue these IP strategies, we got to
develop our own responses and not get
[SPEAKER_00]: caught up in the hype, you know,
and we also need to not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't you think they're going to just
really select for size and yield?
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, think about Monsanto, since we're
talking about Monsanto.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the main thing that they sold to
the world?
[SPEAKER_02]: Roundup Ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: Roundup Ready.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was, they said, hey, this is a seed
that can take the beating from the
[SPEAKER_02]: pesticides and all the crap that the
herbicides that we're going to also sell
[SPEAKER_02]: to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it was a little bit of shame on you
farmer for buying that dream, a little
[SPEAKER_02]: bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's the same thing with biotech and
these patented varieties is that if it
[SPEAKER_02]: becomes the overwhelming, the cultivar of
choice, where a lot of people bought into
[SPEAKER_02]: Monsanto's dream, they said, wow,
I really have a problem with weeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would really rather kill all these
weeds and still be able to grow my crops,
[SPEAKER_02]: where the people who didn't mind weeds and
were growing biodynamically or
[SPEAKER_02]: organically, they didn't have any,
they didn't have an issue with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It wasn't until the drift thing when
Monsanto said, oh, well, some of that
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen drifted over into your cornfield
and we tested your corn and it shows that
[SPEAKER_02]: it has our genes in it and therefore you
can't grow your corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so they get bigger and bigger
and their impact becomes stronger and
[SPEAKER_02]: stronger and they control a bigger market
share of whatever crop they're producing.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's really resisting that is our
strength at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see it a little bit differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think with the Roundup Ready,
when you're talking about organic farming,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's a lot more expensive
process to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless you have a market who's going to
pay for that, then you're forced to
[SPEAKER_01]: compete.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't think it's necessarily that the
farmers, I'm sure some of them bought into
[SPEAKER_01]: the dream, but I think some of them were
forced into it just from a pure survival
[SPEAKER_01]: standpoint.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, could they produce, you know,
their corn at the same price and sell it
[SPEAKER_01]: and still have a profit margin compared to
all the farmers who were selling the
[SPEAKER_01]: Roundup Ready corn?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, I mean, I think that's,
you know, an unfortunate reality of big
[SPEAKER_01]: ag.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the things that you mentioned
about the pollen blown into the crops,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I know that's something people are
very afraid of and it's something that I
[SPEAKER_01]: looked into because I wasn't sure very
much myself, but I ended up reading the
[SPEAKER_01]: case law and where that came from was that
was actually one of the farmers defense
[SPEAKER_01]: when they were sued by Monsanto's.
[SPEAKER_01]: They said that, you know, the wind,
they didn't know how they ended up with
[SPEAKER_01]: this growing in their field and that maybe
it was the wind that had blown it into
[SPEAKER_01]: their field.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, what was found out is they had
bought the seed from the back of a truck,
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody else's leftover seed,
and it was something, I've seen numbers
[SPEAKER_01]: between 60 and 90% of their crop was
Roundup Ready and that they also knew it
[SPEAKER_01]: was Roundup Ready because they had sprayed
it and noticed it was Roundup Ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little bit of a myth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is really a good point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what we're faced with right now is a
proprietary economic model and it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: predatory economic model.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they will try to maximize their control
of the market share and leverage their
[SPEAKER_00]: economies of scale in ways that are
designed to try and push us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need to be able to bring our own
IP strategies to bear and part of that's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be pursuing trademarks for our
brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of that's going to be in certain
instances when it's appropriate,
[SPEAKER_00]: people pursuing plant variety protection
and patent protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another version of IP protection that I'm
not sure how well you're versed on it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I know that Appalachians of origin are
something that the state has mandated for
[SPEAKER_00]: us to create.
[SPEAKER_00]: So California is going to create
Appalachians for cannabis and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: mandated to do so by January 1st of 2021.
[SPEAKER_00]: Licensed cultivators will be able to
submit applications laying out standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: practices, and varietals that are grown
within a particular region that can apply
[SPEAKER_00]: for Appalachian standards or status and
you'll be able to essentially apply a
[SPEAKER_00]: sticker to your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or to your products and say this was
produced here under these standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: these practices and with these varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is Appalachians are a form of
intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a collective form of intellectual
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is something that we can,
everybody needs to look into, read up on
[SPEAKER_00]: it, check it out, get with licensed
cultivators in your own area and start
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about these things and start
thinking about them in a way where what
[SPEAKER_00]: are the standards, the practices and the
cultivars that are unique to your place?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the outcomes that are unique to
your place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know where I'm at, we have a
very unique environment that is very
[SPEAKER_00]: distinct from up in Mendo or Humboldt or
in other areas because we're more inland,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's much drier, much hotter, much more
arid environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are unique outcomes and results.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I grow a cultivar in my county or on
my hillside, it's gonna be way different
[SPEAKER_00]: than that same cultivar grown up in
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something that could be very
unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have people essentially saying
okay, Calaveras County, we grow OG and the
[SPEAKER_00]: OG ends up like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over in Mendo, they grow the same cultivar
but it ends up expressing differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're both protecting the intellectual
property and the specific product that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're producing that's unique to our
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even though we're both calling it OG,
it's different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's different because of the
environmental inputs that, I mean,
[SPEAKER_00]: we all know that phenotypes are an
interaction between the gene and the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those environmental factors are going
to produce unique distinct intellectual
[SPEAKER_00]: properties and product properties that we
can hopefully protect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is something, it's gonna be
rolled out by 2021, we can start to
[SPEAKER_00]: organize around these ideas now and start
to develop this as a more of a communal or
[SPEAKER_00]: collective form of intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got individual corporate
strategies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got a business, start thinking
about trademarks, start thinking about
[SPEAKER_00]: patents, start thinking about the
implications that it has for you for
[SPEAKER_00]: better and for worse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also start thinking about linking up
with fellow cultivators in your area to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop an Appalachia system.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not as familiar with that,
but it sounds to me like a trademark type
[SPEAKER_01]: protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would be like a certification mark
where only, again, trademarks identify the
[SPEAKER_01]: source of the goods.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that would identify the sources coming
from this one specific region a lot like
[SPEAKER_01]: champagnes or even tequila is regulated
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, no, I was the one who introduced
Dale to tequila.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's set the record straight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it was interesting with Appalachia
because the challenge with an Appalachian
[SPEAKER_02]: is that it can limit what you can do.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's remember that, that like,
for instance, you mentioned champagne.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is champagne?
[SPEAKER_02]: Champagne is Pinot Noir or Chardonnay
grapes grown in champagne.
[SPEAKER_02]: Period.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bordeaux is, I believe, Cabernet,
Merlot, Pertite, Verdot, and one other
[SPEAKER_02]: grape.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you want to grow an Italian varietal
in Bordeaux, France, you cannot call it
[SPEAKER_02]: Bordeaux.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can call it Sangiovese, but no one's
going to buy it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Bordeaux, the Bordeaux winemakers and
the Bagonia Winemaker Association got
[SPEAKER_02]: together and mandated what can be grown in
this Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it can go the wrong way when big
corporate interests get in there and say,
[SPEAKER_02]: no, we're trying to protect this
Appalachian and this can only be grown
[SPEAKER_02]: here and it's the variety that we happen
to own.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: One good thing about this system is that
it is driven by the licensees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So licensees, it's a form of local control
that we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's probably the only decent form of
local control that came out of Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you are a local licensed cultivator,
definitely be thinking about this and get
[SPEAKER_00]: out there in front because all of these IP
strategies all across the board have risks
[SPEAKER_00]: and benefits.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are ways that this could protect
people in the industry and there are ways
[SPEAKER_00]: that it could be used by other capitalized
interests that are trying to push all of
[SPEAKER_00]: us out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we definitely, we got to take hold
of the tools that are at our disposal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And make sure that we're in there playing
the game and not just getting pushed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the Appalachian, it seems like what it
would do is prevent, let's say,
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody from New Jersey saying that they
are growing, you know, weed from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't see the protection in the form
of making sure that your genetics,
[SPEAKER_01]: your particular genetics are protected.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it is a form of IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a trademark, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in that sense, it absolutely is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't see it offering the full
protection in terms of actually protecting
[SPEAKER_01]: your clones and actually protecting your
life's work and what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in that regard, what I hope to see,
and maybe that will be part of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: is I hope to see communities start to pull
together their patents and their IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've seen this in other industries
where, you know, they will pull patents
[SPEAKER_01]: either that there's two different forms of
it, either that you're all going to allow
[SPEAKER_01]: each other to use each other's technology
without the threat of having these patents
[SPEAKER_01]: asserted against them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody brings their patents to the
table, puts them in the middle and
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody has access to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the other form of it,
you know, in terms of you can use all of
[SPEAKER_01]: this patented technology, the other form
is everybody puts their patents together
[SPEAKER_01]: in terms of defending against a lawsuit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we agree, you know, the four of us
agree, if any of us get sued, you can use
[SPEAKER_01]: my patents, his patents, you know,
because the best thing to do when you get
[SPEAKER_01]: sued is to have a counter defense,
to be able to counter.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just quickly, where have you seen these
two strategies played out?
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at like Android technology,
for example, the way that they've been
[SPEAKER_01]: able to build that platform is they allow
everybody from Google to LG to Samsung to
[SPEAKER_01]: use their, you know, the different
patents, they all pull their patents
[SPEAKER_01]: together so they can all build on that
platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, there's a difference
though with, with software and that
[SPEAKER_01]: software comes with its own IP.
[SPEAKER_01]: Software is protected as soon as you write
your program, it's got copyright
[SPEAKER_01]: protection attached to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have to do anything to get the
copyright protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should register it, but you don't have
to.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little bit tougher in the cannabis
scenario where you would actually have to
[SPEAKER_01]: file and get patent protection or your,
your plant breeder's rights attached to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you would then agree to share
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you know, it's done in others,
but that's the most familiar one that I
[SPEAKER_01]: can think of off the top of my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're talking about patents and these
sorts of IPs, these strategies,
[SPEAKER_00]: what type of costs are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are we, is it even viable for somebody
like myself to consider pursuing a patent
[SPEAKER_00]: and break that down both in terms of the
application process and also in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: the defense or the prosecution.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in prosecution, I know to file a plant
patent, I would ballpark that around
[SPEAKER_01]: $2,500 just to file and that's to have the
description in order and every way that
[SPEAKER_01]: you need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, obviously the person that you
hire who's more experienced is gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to write it more thoroughly and
correctly in a way that you shouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: expect as many office actions and not
make, you know, typical mistakes that I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: seeing in some of these patent,
patent applications that are being filed,
[SPEAKER_01]: plant patent in particular.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's for a plant patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then in terms of prosecuting it,
you know, getting it from, getting your
[SPEAKER_01]: original filing all the way through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I asked Dale because he does more plant
patents than I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, I don't do any, I refer them to
him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do trademarks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he ballparked it, I want to say
around $10,000 is what you're looking at
[SPEAKER_01]: over the course of obtaining the
protection, which could take a few years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trademarks is a little bit less expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: I typically encourage everyone to do a
thorough search before they file for their
[SPEAKER_01]: trademark protection and that's because
trademarks, you have common law rights as
[SPEAKER_01]: soon as you start to use a trademark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I'm using a trademark here in
California, someone in Florida decides to
[SPEAKER_01]: file their trademark application for that
same mark, I still have common law rights
[SPEAKER_01]: as far as I've used it and established
that trademark.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't shut me down just because
they've now filed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so particularly in this industry where
I see everybody using the same marks,
[SPEAKER_01]: which by the way, don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, let's just start using more original
marks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so in that way, you know, I do
encourage doing a full search so that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're aware of what are the common law
rights that somebody else might have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though you get federal protection,
where are you going to be limited from
[SPEAKER_01]: using your mark or where are you not going
to be able to shut down this mom and pop
[SPEAKER_01]: shop who's been using it since,
you know, 1980.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you were to get the full search,
and the trademark application,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're looking again at about $2,000 to
file a trademark application for a single
[SPEAKER_01]: class of goods and that includes the USPTO
fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if you've done your search and
you don't get these more substantive
[SPEAKER_01]: rejections in terms of finding marks that
are confusingly similar, then there's only
[SPEAKER_01]: a couple other time points where you need
to spend, you know, another 300,
[SPEAKER_01]: 500.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say probably just ballparking
$3,000, $4,000 to get a trademark if it
[SPEAKER_01]: goes through cleanly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Utility patents are much more expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a much more thorough disclosure.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't have opportunities to amend the
way that you do with a plant patent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything has to be done right from
the outset.
[SPEAKER_01]: So utility patents, you can get depending
on what your disclosure is, what your
[SPEAKER_01]: technology is, how broadly you want to
claim it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you wanted to just claim your deposit,
that's obviously going to be less work
[SPEAKER_01]: than trying to claim some broad
formulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that can range in terms of filing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say, again, probably starting at
the $3,000, and I've seen patents just for
[SPEAKER_01]: drafting a patent application go up to the
$10,000, $15,000 to draft a patent
[SPEAKER_01]: application.
[SPEAKER_01]: Copyrights, much less expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do it yourself if you care to go
through all the tedious screens on the
[SPEAKER_01]: copyright registration portal or what have
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's $55 to register.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can register your copyright.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of your more prized pictures,
your videos, I've seen people getting very
[SPEAKER_01]: creative with how they're advertising
their genetics, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: register your more important stuff for
copyright protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I think I saw Dale quote the
plant variety protection.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think he said something about it's
$5,100 just in filing fees alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just quickly, because we have a band
that has to set up, for the two people on
[SPEAKER_04]: the stage who have unique genetics,
what's your strategy for protecting your
[SPEAKER_04]: intellectual property?
[SPEAKER_04]: And go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, my strategy was to not share.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I started breeding sage in 1994 in
Amsterdam, and I was just a young guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Living overseas and plenty of people
offered me money for cuts over and over
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seed banks, traveling American
cultivators, and I turned them down over
[SPEAKER_02]: and over again, over and over and over
again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the few people that I did give plants
that were very explicitly told not to
[SPEAKER_02]: share them, that this was a backup that I
need you to hold on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it, one of my varieties got out
because someone stole it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Simple as that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone stole it out of a grow room and
sold it to another group, and that group
[SPEAKER_02]: sold it to another group.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's trade secrets.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's protecting your trade secrets by not
letting them go.
[SPEAKER_02]: And since that happened a number of years
ago, I have held plants even closer to the
[SPEAKER_02]: chest than before.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that there's some varieties that I
think people should be enjoying that I
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't let out yet because I didn't have
a robust tool to protect them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's not just the physical
security that they require in a facility,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's the ability to go out into the
ecosystem and make sure that other people
[SPEAKER_02]: aren't utilizing your plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's what I'm doing and waiting
to do great things in the future,
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess, as much as I could say.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, man, for me, it's different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't create OG, but really more
importantly, I think everybody should grow
[SPEAKER_03]: OG as a variety in their garden,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that would make me more happy than
anything right now, is if it just ended up
[SPEAKER_03]: all over the country, all over the world,
and everybody had a piece of their farm
[SPEAKER_03]: growing it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody should get a cut for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in the future, I mean, then the other
side of it is like, holy shit,
[SPEAKER_03]: I better think about this because I'm
going to be paying a lot of money in
[SPEAKER_03]: licensing fees.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just the irony right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So of course, we're looking into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a strange thing, but I mean,
for me, it's hard to come to terms with
[SPEAKER_03]: this, but we're going to do some breeding
projects in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, for me, it's all about the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we'll talk about patenting
something that is actually something we
[SPEAKER_03]: created.
[SPEAKER_03]: Patent going out to like, what are you
going to go to a clone shop, somebody with
[SPEAKER_03]: some cash?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to buy like Sour D,
all these things?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you just going to patent everything?
[SPEAKER_03]: Spend like a billion dollars, like I'm
just going to patent the whole library of
[SPEAKER_03]: everything out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's... And that is the reality
also, since I mean, we talked about Philos
[SPEAKER_02]: earlier and like, Philos is kind of,
you know, they're the bad guy right now
[SPEAKER_02]: because they came from our community.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the reality is, is all these plants
are in, they are in the ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all available at a shop or in seed
form.
[SPEAKER_02]: Anyone can go online and buy all the most
amazing seed and they can go to shops all
[SPEAKER_02]: over California and get all the most
amazing buds and you can buy clones.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, we're, we, it is about the future
because up until this moment, we were
[SPEAKER_02]: working under a different umbrella and now
we're working in a totally different world
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're structuring things differently,
breeding, trademarks, patents,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the past is the past, you know,
and Philos kind of speak, spoke to that in
[SPEAKER_02]: a way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, they were the bad guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they were from us, but everyone's
doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, there's, there's biotech
companies all around the world and
[SPEAKER_02]: pharmaceutical companies all around the
world and people who go into the
[SPEAKER_02]: rainforest to exploit, you know,
whatever they can get their hands on,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, so that's, that's the world we
live in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that, I'm told that the band
that's going to rock the house from 9 p.m.
[SPEAKER_04]: on needs to get on stage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thank you all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Trevor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a tiny background in how I came to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been doing IP law for 17 years now
and I was in the biotech industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: not biotech industries, LLC, the actual
biotech industry and for 14 years
[SPEAKER_01]: prosecuting patents for cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: immunology therapies and by that came to
cannabis via Canna Kids, Tracy Ryan and
[SPEAKER_01]: Sophie Ryan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I began following them as part of my
passion of finding a cure for cancer and
[SPEAKER_01]: became so intrigued and inspired by what
they were doing that found myself all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way into the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in January of this year, decided to
start my own firm because one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: hurdles I was facing as a big law attorney
was the limitations that my firm was
[SPEAKER_01]: placing on me about whether or not they
wanted to have cannabis clients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's a little bit about my
background.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of what I do, so I had I had
a shared practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Many of you might know Dale Hunt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dale and I had a practice together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've done biotech plant patents,
ag patents, green tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I also do trademarks and
copyrights.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've also done trade secrets.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a little bit by way of
background.
