[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin, what genetics are you seeing
trending?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, let's get into kind of what people
are growing this year and what's trending
[SPEAKER_01]: up, what's trending down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then prices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, Eric, you know, you've been
in the price game for a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, are we going to see stable
prices in the, you know, light depth
[SPEAKER_01]: season and the fall harvest?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we going to, are prices going up?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they going down?
[SPEAKER_01]: What cultivars are people growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the hot stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hot stuff is always what's the trendy,
but trendy internet driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has a commonality in the sense that
it's got something gas in it, something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's got a battery cake, something that
has some type of citrus or flavor from
[SPEAKER_00]: like cherry pie.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have Skittle, which dries orange,
that's in your runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have any of your gelato, and then any
of the cakes, and then they go ice cream
[SPEAKER_00]: cake, they throw the cherry pie back in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything that's OG driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that the people are seeking OG
that used to be more OG.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want to go back to the foundations
of OG where they don't have such a changed
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that when people talk about
trends, you got to understand that if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're a greenhouse operator, an indoor
operator, you can control yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a swing between day and night,
your diurnal temperature change is much
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller than an outdoor grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you use grape as an example,
when you start to have a small swing,
[SPEAKER_00]: it produces a lighter, more delicate
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: The greater swing produces a more robust
flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when people take varieties that
have a robust full flavor that they're
[SPEAKER_00]: used to, and they transfer them into
situations where they get less of a day
[SPEAKER_00]: night swing, they turn down the volume.
[SPEAKER_00]: And conversely, if someone takes something
that has delicate flavors and they put
[SPEAKER_00]: them in the outdoor environment,
it harshens it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you have to be able to determine
like, what are you doing as a producer?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what works in your environment that's
going to give the customer what they seek?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's their expectation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're trying to give someone
something that is going to catch what's
[SPEAKER_00]: currently in vogue, which is something
that has flavor and has power.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're power addicted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Low number stuff just doesn't move.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that are trendy most definitely
move.
[SPEAKER_00]: The education on small batch craft
cannabis is an educational process because
[SPEAKER_00]: the average consumer isn't aware of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to take a look at what's
trending, but what is on the ass end of a
[SPEAKER_00]: trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you go to a dispensary and you see
17 July, you might not want to grow gelato
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're going to have to compete
with 17 other people on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what big companies don't do is they
don't run past day 65, 63.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like a little sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that takes them right out of GMO type
stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: GMO meaning that beautiful chem cookie
cut, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really rich, but it'll pull 34.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's hot, but it needs to go a
deep cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff like that is where the craft
cultivators have to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to go to things that give you a
natural advantage because the market won't
[SPEAKER_00]: be big enough to overpopulate because
larger companies won't produce those
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to go into storefronts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to identify, because that's where
this is all moving in storefronts.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to go take a look and say,
what's on the shelves?
[SPEAKER_00]: What seems to be not in stock frequently?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what you do is you don't have to
look for that exact product.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to understand what it is that
people are getting from that product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once you have that, now you can create
something that's a substitute for that
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it allowed the bud tenders,
the salespeople to be able to move it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as long as it's a distributor needs
where it's above a certain numeric,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say, and this doesn't have to be about
real and perceptions and all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's not above 25, this shit's sitting
in a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to have numerics that are
adequate to move through distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has to be on a level that's not so
overproduced that you'll be able to have
[SPEAKER_00]: velocity of return on your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is cannabis doesn't
break up into so many divisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still breaking up into fuel,
earth, fruit, and floral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the subsets that follow within that
are true.
[SPEAKER_00]: And each one of those divisions hit
specific markets differently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for you as the producer, you have to
be aware of what distributor you're using
[SPEAKER_00]: and what stores they sell to so that you
can understand where your product's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to end up, so that if you're dropping OG
into San Francisco, it's not going to move
[SPEAKER_00]: to the tech crowd because that's not what
they desire as an effect, maybe in
[SPEAKER_00]: coronavirus time because they're in the
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: But prior, they needed things that were
more cerebral, uplifting, more in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fruits and florals.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're moving it to old school,
school groups, they're not looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need something that's got a heavier
sit down, something that reminds them of
[SPEAKER_00]: the past, those earth groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the trending part about it is that
everyone looks like what's the big
[SPEAKER_00]: picture, but you as the grower have to
identify who moves your product,
[SPEAKER_00]: does your distributor, where does your
distributor move that product to?
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these questions can be answered.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's trying to keep it secret from
each other because the distributor,
[SPEAKER_00]: the storefront, the producer does not want
to lose money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just have to be able to be
proactive on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what people, they just,
I got some clones, I grew it, now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to get rid of it because that's how
we always grew pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is not the way you grow pot right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You form your reliance on your distributor
because you need him.
[SPEAKER_00]: Without him, you can't move the grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: He needs you to have product that moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can sit down and say, where are you
short?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you see supply issues?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the rover production?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can actually start to make
the decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tough part about trendy shit is trying
to go through the nurseries to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: material because you have so many
nurseries popping up and none of this
[SPEAKER_00]: shit's necessarily genomically marked.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have a goddamn idea what
you're picking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get things that are this,
but they're not really that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're an S1 of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality's not present.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's no list of nurseries right now
that have the things that you need.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that information has to be present
unless you hold all your own stock and you
[SPEAKER_00]: produce it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're developing a stability,
which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that it doesn't let you get
trendy markets, which is higher price
[SPEAKER_00]: points because there's less of it and
there's more marketing that's built in
[SPEAKER_00]: through the internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for the larger producers,
recognize that your facilities produce a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that has a lighter, more delicate
flavor period.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just holds true.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stress from that switch makes the
plant produce differently in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: flavonoid and terpene production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So accentuate that fact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most people like wild wine, not robust
wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the crowds that want the robust,
let them get it from the craft producers
[SPEAKER_00]: because their situation will accentuate
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Larger producers go after the varieties as
they sift and smoke and say, ooh,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is delicate and light.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make me choke?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it make me cough?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very, very refined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go that route and identify which is the
hot items in the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then try to figure out why are people
buying it repetitively?
[SPEAKER_00]: Trendy shit only sells once if it's really
just trendy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it sells over and over again,
it's satisfying something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to identify what that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I smoke and I go, what am I getting out of
this shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I go, I'm not getting a damn
thing out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just getting the best marketing ever
seen where they're able to push this
[SPEAKER_00]: product so fucking well that they convince
you, you need to buy it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if it's genuine, you'll buy it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what you're trying to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the things that are hot?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are they moving?
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone talks about, you know,
we don't like new strains and it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: heritage strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, fucking white ruts won the
Amaro Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: The judges of the Amaro Cup aren't a bunch
of new people.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're old smokers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That variety satisfied their needs to the
degree that they liked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you look at Josh D.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not small.
[SPEAKER_00]: He took the original OG cut or he had
moved it and did well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think he did an ice cream cake that
moved well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So using his production methodologies,
using varieties that have current
[SPEAKER_00]: applicability, he was able to also win an
Amaro Cup for his division.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it shows that some of these things
can shine in the right environments and
[SPEAKER_00]: that the people don't swing so radically
in what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to chase the new,
new perpetually because what takes place
[SPEAKER_00]: is you don't have an ability to optimize
your production.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never get comfortable with the
cultivar where you're able to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: what was the optimization that make it
primo.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when people chase trends, I'm like,
look, 20% of your canopy, let it be the
[SPEAKER_00]: trend.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, another 60% of your canopy,
let it be the stuff that's your goody.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then have another, you know,
20% of the canopy as insurance where that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit comes off no matter if the fucking
grasshoppers inhaled it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you need something to pay the
bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that, you know, the way you
stratify your crop portfolio is about
[SPEAKER_00]: insurance, stability, burgeoning trends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that?
[SPEAKER_02]: That was solid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that was awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because the daytime smokers are the main
consumers that are going to the
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries throughout the day aren't,
you know, trying to get annihilated all
[SPEAKER_02]: the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, most of us, the seasoned
veterans, I guess you could say,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're, you know, going for that
annihilator shit first, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the new recreational market is fine
with Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Blue Dream cannot be bound.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the problem that if Blue Dream sold
all the weight that it did, does that mean
[SPEAKER_00]: that everyone who smoked it was stupid?
[SPEAKER_00]: You mean they didn't like what they liked?
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that smoke it aren't on
Instagram, that's all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Busy doing shit, taking the kids to
school.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Blue Dream done right is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blue Dream got turned into really bunk
where people started pulling it early and
[SPEAKER_00]: just pushing the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But long cycle Blue Dream is really a nice
variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And done right, it's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so those things fit certain markets.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at Blue Dream, Blue Dream
Seattle and San Francisco, two tech hubs,
[SPEAKER_00]: number one fucking product in those groups
because they don't want to get wiped out.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need enough mental acuity to continue
stealing all America's money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That says enough right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about this?
[SPEAKER_01]: What was in the mason's yard that you were
smelling earlier?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a Black Lime Reserve F2 from
the old Aficionado release.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we went into it and I went
looking for something that had really no
[SPEAKER_00]: gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: More in line with Jackson's Black Lime
than the Black Lime Reserve because the
[SPEAKER_00]: reserve was that heavy chem that Leo and
Ellie put into that mix.
[SPEAKER_00]: And rest in peace Ellie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just really clear and light in terms
of the smoke and just gives me this uplift
[SPEAKER_00]: and buzz.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of fun to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes when I want to get high,
but I don't want to have to wrestle with
[SPEAKER_00]: the high, I'll burn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's just really, really limey and
clean.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good grass, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good selection.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't select it.
[SPEAKER_00]: A friend of mine did.
[SPEAKER_00]: But he's got a really developed palette
and pulled out a large breeding project.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, hey, I got the cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're looking for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll hook you up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Eric, when you say you smoke the
knock you out shit starting when you wake
[SPEAKER_01]: up, what are you smoking?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, I'm always an OG leaning
towards but living in Grass Valley for
[SPEAKER_02]: almost 20 years now, there's been a lot of
OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: We went from Afgui to OG overnight around
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the OG just, I don't know,
it just sits well with me, but I can't
[SPEAKER_02]: always find or get the traditional OG that
we started out with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm kind of onto that variations of
things of different OG phenos or cuts or
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever renames they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know, I'm always happy when I can
get linked up with people that have some,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, Kim D or I'm happy with Gelatos
and some of the, you know, like when I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: up north, I try to search out some of the
stuff that won the Emerald Cup,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, because you can't find it
further south.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the local dispensaries up in
Humboldt have the, if not the variety of
[SPEAKER_02]: those farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, I personally am a big
fan of all the craft farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, from here to, you know,
any of them anywhere, but from here north
[SPEAKER_02]: of where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can't find stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give some love to some of those farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kevin, since you're based in Humboldt,
you want to give some love to some farms?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot of good farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ridgeline, I know Gelman that won the
Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say, you know, if you look at
companies like Redwood Roots, their
[SPEAKER_00]: distributors, almost all the groups that
are running under their banner are Local
[SPEAKER_00]: Good Farms, the Moon Gazer, the Jacob and
Carla from the farm over in Trinity,
[SPEAKER_00]: just stunning farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Brycelin, you have a lot of really nice
farmers in the sense that their
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship with cannabis is developed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what they're really trying to do is
give you the best possible product where
[SPEAKER_00]: they take it to the the moment of
ripeness, like there's a level of care.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's something that I look up to as a
farmer, because these people, that's all
[SPEAKER_00]: they do is farm that grass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a variety of things I'm
involved in as a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I most definitely look to these people
for inspiration on terms of the finest
[SPEAKER_00]: details of care.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just reflects, but it's all over
the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just us here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everywhere I travel to, craft farmers or
craft farmers, whether they're from New
[SPEAKER_00]: England, Michigan, the whole Pacific
Northwest, it's all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's people and it doesn't have to be old
or young.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's this desire to do a better job and
drive a higher level product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's a beautiful thing to see.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, it's kind of heavy
because they're not capitalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't gain funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to tell an investor that you're
here to do the best job.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, I just need to get fucking
paid.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, well, I can I only make
this much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't see the value.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can't gather the funding they need
to have liquidity to stay alive during the
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you see them breaking down.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's it's it's brutal.
[SPEAKER_03]: The best you can go wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: No mistakes made.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they look old, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I thought I look old.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, holy shit, they're catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's that struggle of trying to
hold your ethics on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to produce the best grass that I
can grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to give it to the customer so
the customer gets that experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's it's it's incredible to be able
to source those farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's why I shout it out to the
roots, guys, because yes, talk to move in
[SPEAKER_00]: the brands forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's a humble brand,
humble brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ruben and the boys are trying to get the
humble products out into the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm sure there's groups in other
counties that I'm not familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're also the purveyors of farm
products and putting it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the bottom line is the farms
don't get enough of recognition.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is you see a video and it
shows some farms, but it never lets the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer sit down and kind of talk to you a
little bit and connects to the public
[SPEAKER_00]: about what we're trying to deliver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the farmer, the farmer can then
portray the picture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumer can say, you know,
what, I like things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like stone fruit herb, meaning,
you know, peach flavors, apricot flavors,
[SPEAKER_00]: cherry flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys focus on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems to do well.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where I'm going to go make my
decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of this information is is accessible
by the public.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just miserable because the public
is getting fucked because they don't get
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the good grass they want for the
exquisite experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as these farmers disappear,
so much of that desire to produce anything
[SPEAKER_00]: over 60 days disappears.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of the good, there's a lot of good
people on the bench right now still from
[SPEAKER_02]: the changeover of prop 64, whether in a
band County or, you know, just aren't able
[SPEAKER_02]: to pull a license together yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of the things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, I mean, there's still a lot more to
come as soon as some of those things get
[SPEAKER_02]: worked out, you know, a lot of missing
people are going to come back and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people that maybe had to take a break,
whatever the case is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because yeah, I mean, I think there's a
lot of room for, for craft for a long time
[SPEAKER_02]: coming because like we said earlier,
some of the bigger facilities,
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the consumers, there's a lot of
education that needs to go to the consumer
[SPEAKER_02]: too, because a lot of that craft stuff
stays in these crafty areas as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: The consumers that know craft,
don't let that shit get out very far.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like you were saying, I got a second,
that big ups to the redwood roots family
[SPEAKER_02]: because they really get it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There and work with a lot of great farms
and I've always kind of thought they were
[SPEAKER_02]: a cool group of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just quickly focusing on the California
market and kind of the economy right now
[SPEAKER_01]: and coronavirus and all that Eric,
you're you're current.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, if I understand correctly,
you're consulting with a large Salinas
[SPEAKER_01]: project, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so which implies that there's a large
investment and they're putting money in,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doubling down in this market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are you all seeing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like is this year, are we going to see
year over year growth and in, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: acres harvested and total weight in the
California?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like is stuff still growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are investments being made?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are people pulling back?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are your predictions for 2020 given
that it's a complete knuckleball of the
[SPEAKER_01]: year?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think people are, are going
forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they can, because the prices have gone
up, you know, I mean, we saw a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of a drought last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the idea is to capitalize on the
chances that that drought could exist
[SPEAKER_02]: again, starting now until, you know,
maybe even July, depending on how the
[SPEAKER_02]: weather goes, is going to dictate a lot of
that stuff too, because with the colder
[SPEAKER_02]: Springs, it's harder to get planted.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even though people get planted,
a lot of people don't have adequate
[SPEAKER_02]: heating systems to primarily keep the soil
and the water warm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they're irrigating with colder water
until the temperatures warm up and things
[SPEAKER_02]: like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so really last year, you know,
as much as prices were going up,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was hard to get everything to market
and have depth season be a true depth
[SPEAKER_02]: season like it normally was in July,
because a good amount of people didn't get
[SPEAKER_02]: planted right away.
[SPEAKER_02]: Part of it was the licensing too.
[SPEAKER_02]: If your license was coming out of that
temporary zone or whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there was just a lot of calamities
going on at one time, but depending on the
[SPEAKER_02]: weather going forward this year,
because even more sophisticated
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouses are bigger, not even that
sophisticated, don't have a root zone
[SPEAKER_02]: heating.
[SPEAKER_02]: They just have up above heating.
[SPEAKER_02]: And nine times out of 10, when I go to
places, they'll tell me the angle of the
[SPEAKER_02]: sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when I ask them what the temperature
of the soil is, they don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if it's below 55 degrees, we're
growing popcorn and it isn't the angle of
[SPEAKER_02]: the sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, you know, we kind of have to see,
it's hard to make those projections,
[SPEAKER_02]: but if everything goes right weather wise
coming into spring right now and people
[SPEAKER_02]: get planted and we get the yields in July
is what it's supposed to be, then,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, I think, you know, everybody's
got a good chance.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we start to see cold spring
continue in areas, we're going to see less
[SPEAKER_02]: product coming out that's viable and not
everybody can bounce to biomass anymore,
[SPEAKER_02]: unless you're vertically integrated and
you're making your own oil and freezing
[SPEAKER_02]: your own product right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not everybody's running around going,
where's the biomass?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where's the biomass?
[SPEAKER_02]: The people that are hunting biomass are
really strict about what they want
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not just biomass.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got to be high THC, non-detect,
an intense screening process goes on and
[SPEAKER_02]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, you know, it's always changing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the art of the pivot is really the
name of the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: The art of the pivot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a writer book.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the beard bros did a thing with the
TG genetics on his propagating purpose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the name of the podcast,
but it couldn't be more poignant because
[SPEAKER_02]: that's, you know, I met with the beard
bros the other night and it's all strategy
[SPEAKER_02]: and how are we going to pivot through this
one, whether it's an upcoming job that
[SPEAKER_02]: we're trying to pitch or, you know,
work on or if it's just the long term
[SPEAKER_02]: game, what's next and how do we see what's
coming, you know, without having to revert
[SPEAKER_02]: to news articles and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really the boots on the ground and
talking to people.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, luckily, some of us like,
you know, Scott and Kevin and some of
[SPEAKER_02]: these other guys are able to get onto
farms or talk with farmers and kind of get
[SPEAKER_02]: the real aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're not out here writing articles
and letting everybody know, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not a billboard that you can drive by
or a ticker tape or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It really is, you know, like farming.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking to people and you're trying
to look at Mother Nature and you're
[SPEAKER_02]: looking at the other aspects and trying to
put this puzzle together and see,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, where it's going to go.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I'm missing the golden tarp days
and wondering if we're ever going to have
[SPEAKER_02]: any events.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are we going to be able to get together
and share a joint?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we're not sharing joints.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not sharing hugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a fucking whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got you know, there was,
you know, this isn't this isn't done yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This this stuff is just beginning this
type of viral contamination issues for us
[SPEAKER_00]: socially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it changes dramatically about
people's connection to others and how they
[SPEAKER_00]: use cannabis and how they get information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everyone's on the Internet right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why that's why the signals jam,
because everybody's on the net.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem is there's so much bullshit
info.
[SPEAKER_00]: It fucking blows my mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are so quick to attack other
people that anybody that has a question
[SPEAKER_00]: gets beat down by people that can type
quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nobody nobody has any fucking clue
what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem is, is that you have no no
no way to know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm you know, I'm just grateful
that I've been in the game for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: enough time that it lets me see what's
taking place by just virtual being here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I try to share the information I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not on a disclosure agreement.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a disclosure agreement, I can't tell
you any of that shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the stuff that I uncover myself,
I can share because I know that the
[SPEAKER_00]: information isn't going to make you take
me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to have to go execute.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to see people do well,
because I've always had this dream of a
[SPEAKER_00]: unified industry where we could all grow
cannabis all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you got to see the diversity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to see the complexity.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to see the unity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my mid 50s, you know, that's still
my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a really good thing that,
you know, you put this together,
[SPEAKER_00]: Pete, to get a bunch of us together to
talk to the public.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd love to pick your brain.
[SPEAKER_02]: I monetize that, you know, it's 300 bucks
for an hour on the phone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I tell you so much shit that you don't
know what the fuck to do with it after I
[SPEAKER_02]: give you every fucking option you pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: You pick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, let's wrap on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we still have a hundred and seventy
something people tuned in.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be right back.
