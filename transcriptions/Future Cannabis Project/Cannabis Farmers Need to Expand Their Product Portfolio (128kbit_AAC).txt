[SPEAKER_00]: For a lot of people, they've only sold
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for most people, the only thing that
they know how to sell is flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow flour, I sell flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the new white market, where they're
going to enter, who's going to buy a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand pounds of your flour?
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when it's sold by the eighth of
the quarter, maybe at a dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking 10,000, 20,000 pounds of
flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20,000, 30,000 people.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a lot of people on a bipod.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you have to understand is that
the markets have stratified in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so California cannabis is basically
half oil production, half flour
[SPEAKER_00]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: Five years ago, 100% flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in five years, you're talking half the
market is now oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And oil means all forms of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you look at the all forms of
concentrate, you're going to find that
[SPEAKER_00]: basically one-thirtieth of it is rosin,
shatter, fresh freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other 29 out of that 30 slices is
all distillate, which is basically stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: used for food production, food grade,
for edibles, and predominantly for pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the pen market is probably 46%,
47% of the total sales in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people are obsessed with pen sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the new change in how we smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: People don't roll pot anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm old school, it's what I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for everyone else who's e-sigging and
likes devices, the pen is really this new
[SPEAKER_00]: mode of usage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of it, it's a very interesting
thing because it used to scare people who
[SPEAKER_00]: sold flour because the trim people,
I call them the pen people, basically the
[SPEAKER_00]: trim people, they would just want trim and
turn it into pen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'd never want to pay any high dollar
for the flour because they add
[SPEAKER_00]: plant-derived turpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't need quality turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can take anything and make it into
something.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we go forward with the shortage of
clean cannabis and testing, testing makes
[SPEAKER_00]: the distillate market the toughest market
to get in because it's a concentrate
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So therefore, if there's 88% of the flour
that's really needed for cannabis and
[SPEAKER_00]: legally is dirty, that means there's only
12%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means there's only 6% to cover all
distillate because 6% of that flour is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to cover the flour and 6% of it's
going to cover to go to distillate because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the breakdown in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's only 12 pounds, 6 are going
to distillate, 6 are going over to flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a massive amount of product needed
in a highly regulated, tested market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that that's one of the things that
the farmers who are clean, who are
[SPEAKER_00]: organic, who didn't get into the business
to make the money as much as they are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually been doing it for time as a
lifestyle, their margin should be a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: less.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the margin mean and the cost of
production.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you don't have an incredibly expensive
lease on your farm and you're in Humboldt
[SPEAKER_00]: where the cost of production is
relatively, I think it's the lowest in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state, you have an opportunity to grow
intelligent choices, farm them correctly
[SPEAKER_00]: and turn them into products that then sell
in a market that has an incredible
[SPEAKER_00]: velocity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Velocity is speed of product through the
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if I made $100,000 over a year,
that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I made $100,000 in a week,
it's better because that $100,000 in a
[SPEAKER_00]: week now capitalizes me and lets me use
that money as a tool versus as a paycheck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we go forward, it's velocity of
return that really determines the farmer's
[SPEAKER_00]: liquidity, the amount of money you have to
use, that's your capitalization,
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of money you have to invest.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these things you need to survive
and your choice is dictated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I grew a thousand pounds and I didn't
sell them until next year, woo,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's a tough one.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might not even survive through the
winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you got trim costs and all this
other, who's paying it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for a lot of us, I think that when
you look at cannabis, you'll look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: more stratified, meaning pieces of your
flower go, pieces of your total go with
[SPEAKER_00]: flower and you'll find the markets that
want those specific things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everything else is going to go
into these other forms until the large
[SPEAKER_00]: entities come in and vertically take over
the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine if we were all small crop farmers
for Philip Morris and we were all
[SPEAKER_00]: producing tobacco for them because right
now it's impossible for them to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: total quantity.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once they have the ability to get into
the system, five years, totally no
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations in terms of scope and probably
a lot less restrictive legal system,
[SPEAKER_00]: then all of a sudden that would change
because they would vertically fill their
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chains.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until these supply chains are filled,
you have a window of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that for predominant number of
the smaller farmers, that's how they have
[SPEAKER_00]: to see it is that they have to
recapitalize to pay the costs,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get the farm squared away, to get their
lives in order so that when the next
[SPEAKER_00]: transition comes, they're not left like
they are right now, which is basically
[SPEAKER_00]: underprepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk more about distillate and
what the challenges are to making good
[SPEAKER_01]: distillate for farmers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Distillate is the product that's been
cleaned up from crude.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crude is basically they're throwing
cannabis that's clean, meaning no
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not chemically grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're using a two-part fertilizer,
that's not what I mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I mean is you're using illegal
products that are going to taint the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis that you've applied yourself
chemically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So fungicides, pesticides, growth
regulators.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it doesn't have any of that stuff,
then this is perfect because any of these
[SPEAKER_00]: products can go into basically hexane
extraction where they take the material
[SPEAKER_00]: that you have and they use hexane to strip
it all out and that has all your lipids,
[SPEAKER_00]: your waxes and the chlorophyll and all the
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: No terps.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they take that product and they
run that through a distillation system,
[SPEAKER_00]: closed paths, some short path,
something that's going to peel it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that gets rid of all the heavy waste,
the lipids and the chlorophylls and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the other components, and it's left with
now something that can be combined with a
[SPEAKER_00]: vehicle or a solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And nowadays we're using terps as
solvents, but before they used all
[SPEAKER_00]: polypropylene glycol, which is a
carcinogen, so now they know not to use
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But most pens were polypropylene glycol
pens prior.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now they're trying to figure out
how do we use terpene mixes to keep the
[SPEAKER_00]: distillate liquefied enough to function in
a pen correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the challenge is creating these
formulations that make them work.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is the pen market is
so big and regulated cannabis requires
[SPEAKER_00]: clean product that for many farmers you'll
find yourself growing product and then
[SPEAKER_00]: what do you do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll be able to have people come to your
property and extract it through hexane
[SPEAKER_00]: labs that are permitted on trailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this year I had Fresh Frozen done at my
property where I had a group of
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals come out and harvest all my
cannabis and go into freezers and then
[SPEAKER_00]: blow it and then return it to me so I
could sell it to my store.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is basically where it's just being
blown right on the spot and it's coming
[SPEAKER_00]: out looking like kilo-size black abalone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the machine can spit out any size,
but typically it looks like you're pushing
[SPEAKER_00]: about a key at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In its load form and then those keys get
vacuum wrapped up with all the invoice and
[SPEAKER_00]: then they get shipped out to the
individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distributors need this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: All edible and pen industries rely on
crude.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just like saying you don't care
about crude but you're buying gas.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they don't have crude coming out of the
ground there is no gasoline at the gas
[SPEAKER_00]: store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So crude is the basis of all this and it's
one of the simpler methods to utilize for
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers because it allows them to put
themselves into a position where there's
[SPEAKER_00]: bulk sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shatters, concentrates, they're not bulk
sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to be able to move them to stores
and most of the stores, most of the larger
[SPEAKER_00]: places that used to do a lot of this work
became vertical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they started to purchase their own
farms so they could grow their own
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They own their own distillation facilities
so they can make their own products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now they can sell it as pen and they can
control the whole path.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for a lot of people that was how they
made their money with shatter and super
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates was they put it into places
they couldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those places are now vertical also.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you need is some place that's
going to take it in a level that's bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: than you can produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want there to be a mouth too big for
you to feed yourself and most people can
[SPEAKER_00]: blow their whole farm of crude and it
would leave but I challenge you to blow
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole farm of super concentrate and
sell it in one shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's going to have to get sold and
bled into little pieces through.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the pen market is insatiable.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need the raw material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different than I need a finished product
to sell at a store.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is you're selling coal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the steel mills need the coal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't make the steel without the
coal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're the one making the coal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you can understand that,
then it's easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people just don't understand this
because we're pot growers, we're pot
[SPEAKER_00]: sellers.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you were, you were.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you are no longer that if you want to
stay in business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Business is going to tell you what you're
going to become.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you get too emotional about it,
then you get to go bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you make good decisions,
it means you're flexible and you move to
[SPEAKER_00]: where the markets expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If people still wanted to smoke sativa
from the 70s, it would still be selling.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers had to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: People do not understand what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I talk about this shit.
I don't know what I'm talking about.
