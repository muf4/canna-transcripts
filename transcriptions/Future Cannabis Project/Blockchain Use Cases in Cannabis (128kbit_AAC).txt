[SPEAKER_04]: When we start talking about blockchain,
I was thinking about this in preparation
[SPEAKER_04]: for this panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been doing technology development for
the last 20 years, which basically means
[SPEAKER_04]: that for the last 20 years I've been
hearing middle management spew buzzwords
[SPEAKER_04]: at me about the latest technology that we
need to integrate into the solutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's made me really bitter in a lot of
ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can rattle off a list of a lot of
technologies that you've probably heard
[SPEAKER_04]: acronyms for that don't know a whole lot
more other than the name of.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot that we can blame
that for.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how many of you are familiar
with a concept called Moore's Law.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a concept in computer science.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a concept in technology period.
[SPEAKER_04]: Basically what it comes down to is it
dictates that the speed and capacity of
[SPEAKER_04]: any technology will double approximately
every 18 months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ever since the advent of personal computer
and the internet, that's been something
[SPEAKER_04]: that's been pretty steady.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at processor speeds,
if you look at internet speed,
[SPEAKER_04]: Moore's Law has been a pretty good
indicator of how things are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's created this culture of the shiny
new object in technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's created this culture of, well,
I'm using technology that's two years old
[SPEAKER_04]: and my new guy, this 24-year-old who just
started working for me, is trying to sell
[SPEAKER_04]: me on this new technology that just came
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It must be better.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's two years newer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: For the purpose of this conversation,
I was joking with these guys that I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: going to play devil's advocate a little
bit because of the fact that, really,
[SPEAKER_04]: if I had a nickel for every time someone
told me that blockchain was going to solve
[SPEAKER_04]: every problem I had in my software
company, I would be retired by now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're going to take some time to figure
out what's going on with that,
[SPEAKER_04]: what's really real, what's important,
what are the real applications of this
[SPEAKER_04]: technology, and what's not.
[SPEAKER_04]: From the perspective of a technologist,
for me, I look at blockchain as a
[SPEAKER_04]: modern-day example of what we've always
referred to as a data store, as a
[SPEAKER_04]: database.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes down to it, it's a digital
ledger, it's a distributed ledger,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's a place where you can store data
and reference it later on.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first question I want to ask the panel
and give these guys all a chance to answer
[SPEAKER_04]: is what differentiates blockchain?
[SPEAKER_04]: What makes blockchain different,
better, and more applicable to the issues
[SPEAKER_04]: that you're each facing on a day-to-day?
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll start with Ken.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the primary value of blockchain
technology from a transaction perspective
[SPEAKER_01]: is the absence of third-party financial
intermediaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you think about processing a
traditional payment, it goes through
[SPEAKER_01]: multiple layers, probably about seven
different parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you compare that to that of the
blockchain, it's a transaction that's
[SPEAKER_01]: occurring between you and the other
individual.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that being able to have the
decentralized model allows each person to
[SPEAKER_01]: become their own bank and have full
control of their own money, and without
[SPEAKER_01]: all the expenses, the cost that it
associated with paying each individual in
[SPEAKER_01]: that transaction stream.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just from a transactional
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm thinking of it a little bit more from
what you mentioned as a new type of
[SPEAKER_00]: database.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Aegis, we're looking at cannabis data
from a couple of different angles.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is that you've got everywhere from
manufacturers, testing facilities,
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries, really collecting a lot of
extremely valuable data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Data that's both valuable to them in a
business sense, as well as potentially a
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable source for medical findings,
for research findings.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the billion-dollar question right
now in this industry is matching up a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific person or their needs with a
specific strain, which is really a
[SPEAKER_00]: specific set of chemical compounds that
best help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike many other medical industries,
we don't have an NIH institute that's
[SPEAKER_00]: doing this for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the blockchain is a really great
way to organize this data in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone can contribute the data in
exchange for returning data back or
[SPEAKER_00]: returning results back.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Aegis, we're also really interested in
the bottom-up approach, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: collecting that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone knows that their data is valuable
these days.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just most people understand they
don't get paid for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They get their free service in exchange
for personal information.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's a chance to couple the
transactional potential of the blockchain
[SPEAKER_00]: with a way to actually collect some of
these data from individuals in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: we can incentivize them and reward them
for the sharing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was fortunate enough to be part of
the web hosting and domain industry back
[SPEAKER_03]: in the early 2000s when we had Oracle
databases and Microsoft and SQL databases.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we look at the stored value of data,
which is blockchain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being able to utilize that, capture it,
and have it in a place where you can't
[SPEAKER_03]: alter it unless you change the hash is
going to enable people to be successful in
[SPEAKER_03]: a way where they can utilize that data
over and over again without having to have
[SPEAKER_03]: the hindrance of big data cumbersome
companies coming in to really alter my
[SPEAKER_03]: business plan like a Microsoft or an
Oracle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we all can become our own Microsoft
and Oracle to develop these products for
[SPEAKER_03]: our customers on a very quick basis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really the agile development that
blockchain gives us in order to deliver
[SPEAKER_03]: the right product to this industry in
particular.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to stick with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Banking is an area that I think a lot of
people are very intrigued about as far as
[SPEAKER_04]: how blockchain can help.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a widespread problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was talking to my team about this today.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had individuals just today,
two separate individuals on my team,
[SPEAKER_04]: have to transport thousands of dollars in
cash to a bank.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not dealing with the same level of
currency that we're talking about for a
[SPEAKER_04]: day-to-day dispensary operation,
so I can only imagine how nerve-wracking
[SPEAKER_04]: that is for those teams.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously, Mark, you can speak to this a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: As far as a transfer of value,
a banking solution, what led you to the
[SPEAKER_04]: solution that you're working on right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: What was the problem that you first
identified, and what led you to the
[SPEAKER_04]: blockchain as a solution?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, really, banking is not the problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the cost of banking that's the
problem, is really what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: The compliance and the rules that you have
to follow, which are set.
[SPEAKER_03]: 2014, FinCEN came out with rules to
follow.
[SPEAKER_03]: How I got into this, my background is
actually technology and private equity
[SPEAKER_03]: funding.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a group come to me that wanted to
invest in one of my projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was so excited.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, this is going to be amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go, here's my terms.
[SPEAKER_03]: Loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my contract.
[SPEAKER_03]: They loved it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, here's my wire information.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go, why don't you come out to the
farm and we'll spend a little time
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_03]: They showed me more cash I've ever seen in
my life in one spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go, let's get it to the bank and put it
to work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, well, that's our problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have a bank account.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't figure it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not from the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, okay, I can figure this out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then after months and months of
finding out it's a serious problem for not
[SPEAKER_03]: just these folks, but everybody in the
industry, I was fortunate enough to find a
[SPEAKER_03]: company called Integrated Compliance
Solutions that does AML and KYC and BSA
[SPEAKER_03]: software for banks today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I became a venture partner and they go,
you know, one of our biggest problems is
[SPEAKER_03]: the ability to move payments from B2B
selections and capturing that known source
[SPEAKER_03]: of funds for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I go, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hence, C2 was born and that's why we chose
blockchain to solve that problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ken, I know you guys focus a lot on,
at All36, you have a lot of focus on the
[SPEAKER_04]: consumer experience as far as the
transaction from the, I know you do other
[SPEAKER_04]: things as well, but there's a lot of focus
on the consumer experience.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I would have to say that this crypto
as a solution to a lot of the lack of
[SPEAKER_04]: credit card processing is one of the
pitches that I hear most often when it
[SPEAKER_04]: comes to blockchain.
[SPEAKER_04]: What differentiates All36?
[SPEAKER_04]: Why have you guys been able to achieve the
amount of success that you have?
[SPEAKER_01]: You've probably heard a lot of pitches due
to the increase in ICOs in the market,
[SPEAKER_01]: initial coin offerings.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of projects have come up in the
market that have created and developed
[SPEAKER_01]: their own single-use utility coin that's
specific to, say, cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have Potcoin.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a couple other projects out there
I don't want to mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Essentially, what we've done is we're
really tackling it from the omnichannel
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: We realize that the cannabis industry is
extremely vertically integrated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The B2C is one of the aspects that we're
tackling it from.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've done is, from the consumer
perspective, we wanted to make it as
[SPEAKER_01]: seamless as possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blockchain digital currency is confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: It probably scares most individuals that
are not in this room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some of them that are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our whole goal was to basically humanize
digital currency.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we've done is we've essentially
created a simple way for consumers that
[SPEAKER_01]: mimics traditional financial services,
but yet has all the benefits of being able
[SPEAKER_01]: to leverage all the benefits of blockchain
technology and cryptocurrency in the
[SPEAKER_01]: background.
[SPEAKER_01]: When consumers from the B2C side interact
with our application, there's very little
[SPEAKER_01]: difference between what they're doing now
with PayPal and what they're doing with
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, we also rolled out the B2B
side of it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: We completed the first integration with
Cantrade.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's our first B2B wholesale marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: They connect the dispensaries of the
vendors and suppliers.
[SPEAKER_01]: From the consumer adoption perspective,
we didn't want to just tackle the issue
[SPEAKER_01]: from one angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We wanted to be able to approach it from
all angles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even moving to how do we get rid of the
remaining amount of cash that's in the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry from those that won't adopt
technology and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually even rolling out our
self-checkout kiosk slash ATM.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those that are, I don't know what digital
currency, who's alt 36?
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to pay in cash and I want to
get my product and get out.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can pick out their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can go over.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can put their cash in and they're
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think by really taking an omni-channel
approach to this, I think we're really
[SPEAKER_01]: able to not only achieve mass consumer
adoption, but really get a grasp on this
[SPEAKER_01]: problem in the cannabis industry as far as
cash is concerned.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Adam, so happy that you're here as well
looking future forward and thinking about
[SPEAKER_04]: solutions that are not involving banking
or payment.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's I think where a lot of the focus
has been placed on where there's potential
[SPEAKER_04]: solutions using this technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: With Aegis, you guys are doing product
development.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing research.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're trying to formulate products to
help individuals that are otherwise using
[SPEAKER_04]: opioids, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we can all get behind the cause.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious to hear more about how you
foresee blockchain being a tool that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're able to leverage to help in that
endeavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: This builds a bit on my academic
experience and doing campaigns.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cancer research, in that environment,
we have of course the NCI, the National
[SPEAKER_00]: Institutes of Health, the National Cancer
Institute, as well as the big pharma
[SPEAKER_00]: system.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of these central organizations are
what have created these really amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: data repositories that have sped up so
much molecular biology research.
[SPEAKER_00]: The human genome, there's protein atlases
where you can look at what's expressed in
[SPEAKER_00]: any particular cell type in my body.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are tools that when scientists and
researchers go to ask the next question,
[SPEAKER_00]: you go to these databases first.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't want to reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to look for something next.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, in deconvoluting this
multitude of chemistry, of chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds that you have in cannabis with
what hits any particular cell or set of
[SPEAKER_00]: receptors in a given tissue, in a given
disease state, that's a hugely complex
[SPEAKER_00]: problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless we go back 30 years and start doing
hugely reduction of science to doing these
[SPEAKER_00]: compounds one by one, we're going to want
to use large data sets and some AI
[SPEAKER_00]: approaches and ultimately deconvolute what
are the most effective compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Getting back to the database problem,
in cannabis, of course, due to the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations and laws, we don't have any of
these central repositories built.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the National Institute for
Cannabis Research, but what we do have is
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are in this room that have all
of their own endeavors going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all producing exactly this kind of
data that we need, and really it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: same kind of data you would get out of a
multitude of research labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we need to be able to do is integrate
that data in a way that you can not only
[SPEAKER_00]: analyze all of the data, but ask really
your important question of how does my
[SPEAKER_00]: sample, how does my chemistry compare to
what's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that you can establish your unique
niche in the market and target the right
[SPEAKER_00]: customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the blockchain is uniquely fit for
this cannabis approach in that the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry really prizes their independence,
as has already come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: People, I don't think, are even looking
for one corporation or one national agency
[SPEAKER_00]: to put this together for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want results now.
[SPEAKER_00]: The blockchain is going to be a great way
to contribute data where everyone knows
[SPEAKER_00]: that they're contributing validated data
as things.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the big problems in data
integration and analysis is data
[SPEAKER_00]: formatting and getting different kinds of
data sets integrated for further analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all things which can happen with
community building in a way that doesn't
[SPEAKER_00]: have a centralized trust structure through
the blockchain approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: The lack of essential moral authority is a
whole topic that we can get onto as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to stick to the script for the
time being.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a fun one to talk about in the
cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Historically, in technology, there's a
difficulty in getting adoption for what
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll refer to as black box technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something where you give it an input,
something happens that you don't know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then the output comes out and you
trust it and move forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that consumers have a hard
time with.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a lot longer for people to adopt
those sorts of technologies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm curious, what do we have to do?
[SPEAKER_04]: How can we get the consumer to trust
blockchain technology, whether it's for a
[SPEAKER_04]: crypto perspective or otherwise?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll start with Ken.
[SPEAKER_04]: How have you seen the adoption of the DAS
solution among the consumers?
[SPEAKER_04]: What sort of education have you had to
provide in order to provide comfort to
[SPEAKER_04]: people in order for them to actually
interact with your system?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd face this every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I was on a call about three hours
ago where I had to kind of argue my way
[SPEAKER_01]: out of this.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a consumer adoption perspective,
most people, what they know is the word
[SPEAKER_01]: blockchain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, they know the benefits of
it, maybe the four or five benefits of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: For anybody that's ever used digital
currency, it's extremely, I mentioned this
[SPEAKER_01]: before, it's extremely confusing.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you even obtain digital currency?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I were to tell you guys right now that
Dash is at $9 a coin, and tomorrow it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna be at $300, I mean, you guys would
probably be able to do it, but they might
[SPEAKER_01]: not be able to.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you go acquire Dash coins?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of aspects that are
hindering the consumer adoption of not
[SPEAKER_01]: just only Dash digital currency,
but of digital currency in general,
[SPEAKER_01]: of blockchain projects in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: For the purpose of this, I'm just gonna
talk about transactional purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one thing that I had mentioned before
that we've done is our whole goal is to
[SPEAKER_01]: simplify the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's so familiar with traditional
financial security, you trust them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You trust PayPal, you trust Stripe,
you trust Square.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they first came out, why did you
initially decide to enroll with those
[SPEAKER_01]: services?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the hope and value that it
provided.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that most dispensary operators
talk, two big things, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the two, price volatility of the
currency and consumer adoption?
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the top two things that
everybody has concerns with, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we take a look at consumer
adoption, you have to provide incentive to
[SPEAKER_01]: the consumer to change their behaviors,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about Apple Pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I use this as an example all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have Apple Pay draped on me all day
long.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've used it never.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no incentive for me to use it
other than convenience, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not convenient for me to actually
go and change behavior that I've known for
[SPEAKER_01]: 20, 30 years now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if Apple said, listen on every one of
your purchases, we'll give you 1% back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or they had a loyalty program that
incentivized me to get rewards that I
[SPEAKER_01]: could use towards travel or other things,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we've done is we sat down with the
Dash network and we explained to them that
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers are not going to adopt a process
unless they feel like there's a benefit in
[SPEAKER_01]: actually adopting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what we've done is we're incentivizing
the consumer in multiple ways for
[SPEAKER_01]: registering and adopting our platform as a
preferred method of paying for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So incentives exist from $25 off the first
purchase just for registering in our
[SPEAKER_01]: platform to double loyalty rewards points
with the loyalty platforms that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: integrated with.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's the biggest thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that combined with not scaring with
all the aspects of digital currency and
[SPEAKER_01]: blockchain, hash algorithms, like Bitcoin
prices to how many digits, that all freaks
[SPEAKER_01]: me out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So try to keep it as simple as possible
and not freak anybody out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably a good move.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mark, I think you're in a slightly
different position with the services that
[SPEAKER_04]: you guys are providing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're focused largely on B2B.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a smaller audience that you have to
convince to use your technology.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that being said, I'm sure you have had
plenty of pushback on the fact that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: using blockchain.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is the pushback?
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that look like?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are the detractors saying are
potential issues with technology?
[SPEAKER_03]: We decided to go a different route from a
technology standpoint utilizing
[SPEAKER_03]: blockchain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we offer traditional banking services
first.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the blockchain is utilized to capture
a known source of funds from the POS
[SPEAKER_03]: systems, the know your client data when
you do background checks and we sign
[SPEAKER_03]: people up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So from a currency side, that's not how we
utilize our blockchain.
[SPEAKER_03]: We utilize it simply as utility token to
move data from one place to another.
[SPEAKER_03]: Since we are a traditional banking system
nationwide, we can bank THC in any state
[SPEAKER_03]: legal and CBD in every state.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm convincing a business owner to open up
a bank account, a traditional bank account
[SPEAKER_03]: that they don't have access to today.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really our biggest standpoint
on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then blockchain gets utilized as just
part of our compliance suite, just like MS
[SPEAKER_03]: SQL does or Oracle databases.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just something that gets utilized in
the background in order to enable those
[SPEAKER_03]: transactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we do get OCC audits or state
audits from a banking perspective,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can meet those compliance and we can
ensure that no three letter agencies come
[SPEAKER_03]: at anybody's door.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really, we solve that problem just by
being a traditional banking resource to
[SPEAKER_03]: allow customers to do traditional wires
when they need to send out to make
[SPEAKER_03]: payments from a utility perspective or
their landlords.
[SPEAKER_03]: But if they handle any cannabis related
business, it has to be utilized within our
[SPEAKER_03]: blockchain perspective so we can capture
the known source of funds.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when the receiver gets that money and
if they get audited, they're gonna know
[SPEAKER_03]: exactly where that money came from and who
did the transaction and what it was for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we capture all that data.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really it's a slightly different model,
but traditional banking is really what we
[SPEAKER_03]: have to offer.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how we can take blockchain and
apply that to this industry and not just
[SPEAKER_03]: this one, but every other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to do faster transactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can do it cheaper and more efficient
than you're gonna do in any other thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys probably wired money before,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, what a pain in the ass that is,
plus it's expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: What if I could tell you I can put a
million dollars in Ken's account right now
[SPEAKER_03]: in two seconds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Does that appeal to you?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what blockchain does.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can do that in a compliant way.
[SPEAKER_03]: One dollar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Transaction fee, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Transaction fee's one dollar.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to charge something.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you want me to charge more,
I will, if you don't mind.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nobody?
[SPEAKER_04]: No takers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, Adam, I'm curious to hear about...
Well, by the way, that's on any amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's one dollar to move, 100 million
dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, moving away from the finance guys,
sorry, for a second.
[SPEAKER_04]: Adam, I want to talk more about the
scientific community.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are there concerns amongst your peers
about a blockchain-based tracking system?
[SPEAKER_04]: If there are, what are people worried
about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say it's just the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the approach overall is more
similar to Mark's in that really the
[SPEAKER_00]: blockchain is kind of built into the
backend and it's really not the user's
[SPEAKER_00]: concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's their concern as it gets the job
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main concern when people are
discussing how to use this data is how do
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that I get the value for my data?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I know I'm not disclosing anything
I don't want to?
[SPEAKER_00]: And really these are exactly the kind of
answers that the blockchain can provide in
[SPEAKER_00]: that it is a way to lock down your data.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a way to track what happens to it
when it gets transferred afterwards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think a lot of both the security and
the potential data security that comes
[SPEAKER_00]: along with some blockchain applications
are more of a solution to data handlers
[SPEAKER_00]: than a problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and I think with a lot of,
especially in this industry as well,
[SPEAKER_04]: bringing it back to how this relates to
cannabis with the breaches in data,
[SPEAKER_04]: breaches in security, systems going down,
I think that's something that probably a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of people can, that's a problem that a
lot of people can relate to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to, not quite pivot, but I want to
focus on something that I think is really,
[SPEAKER_04]: to me, one of the more interesting aspects
of blockchain technology, and that's smart
[SPEAKER_04]: contracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: For those here who don't know what a smart
contract is, it's basically a scripted
[SPEAKER_04]: contract that all the criteria for
completion are scripted into the contract
[SPEAKER_04]: before it takes place.
[SPEAKER_04]: The contract automatically executes upon
the fulfillment of all said criteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: So to think about it at a high level,
it's like when you stand in front of a
[SPEAKER_04]: vending machine, there's a smart contract
between you and the machine that if you
[SPEAKER_04]: give it two bucks and 50 cents and push a
button, you're gonna get a Coke,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a very high level example of what a
smart contract looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really curious to hear what the
implications of smart contracts are for
[SPEAKER_04]: each one of you and your businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you all think that smart contracts
are gonna impact the business world at
[SPEAKER_04]: large, but also specifically around what
you guys are doing, and what are some
[SPEAKER_04]: potential shortcomings there?
[SPEAKER_03]: What we use smart contracts for is if
traditional escrow services, somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: might have bought a house or some other
transaction where you needed, two parties
[SPEAKER_03]: had to agree and provide certain things in
order for a transaction to get completed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we can use smart contract from that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we provide full escrow services for all
our clients that are on our banking
[SPEAKER_03]: platform, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I wanna buy a thousand kilos of ice
lid, or I wanna move $10 million from one
[SPEAKER_03]: transaction or another.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can actually put that in a smart
contract, act as an escrow service for
[SPEAKER_03]: you, and again, we can do it almost for
nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's the cost of electricity at
that point.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's one of the most appealing
things for us.
[SPEAKER_03]: So instead of costly, you might use safe
funds or something like that to do a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of your larger transactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: You don't need to do that when you have
smart contracts.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can already capture your data because
you're on our banking platform,
[SPEAKER_03]: so we know who you are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We know your known source of funds,
and now all you gotta do is give us a
[SPEAKER_03]: criteria for your transaction.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it at a licensed bonded warehouse did
it get delivered?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are those expectations?
[SPEAKER_03]: We put that in.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once those are met, transaction's
completed, and then it's done.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's smart contract for us,
and I think it's really amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna revolutionize how costly
transactions happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can absolutely see applications at the
higher level once we have a lot of data
[SPEAKER_00]: pooled together, where there are some type
of incentives for doing analysis,
[SPEAKER_00]: for working on the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm really excited about the
smart contracts is for data collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's so much, we're in this really
unique position with cannabis right now,
[SPEAKER_00]: where because of not only the medical
recommendation system, but especially
[SPEAKER_00]: legality, we basically have an
uncontrolled clinical trial going on at
[SPEAKER_00]: all times with millions of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are treating specific elements with
their favorite products, and this data is
[SPEAKER_00]: hugely valuable as a whole for medical
analysis, and everyone knows that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I like the idea of if people are
willing to give us more data, longitudinal
[SPEAKER_00]: data, more personal data, we can use a
smart contract system to pay them for this
[SPEAKER_00]: data, and then pay them again once say the
data is in a pool that's used by a company
[SPEAKER_00]: for analysis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think using these methods we can
incentivize people to not only give us
[SPEAKER_00]: data, but really give us kind of a live
look at what's happening with them on the
[SPEAKER_00]: level of every other level of little
internet of things device and Apple Watch
[SPEAKER_00]: that is coming out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, I think as a whole that would
be, we need to collect this data before
[SPEAKER_00]: it's gone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think smart contracts are awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think about how many inefficiencies
are within every one of our experiences in
[SPEAKER_01]: life, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever go, you have a broker involved in
any process that you do, mortgages,
[SPEAKER_01]: buying your car, it's inefficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what are they doing that's in your
best interest, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the broker doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's everything that's in his best
interest, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not necessarily an efficient,
fair transaction, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But from a smart contract perspective,
I think that within the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: given that it is so vertically integrated,
let's use California for an example,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think smart contracts combined with,
and this is cool what you can do with
[SPEAKER_01]: different blockchain projects is you can
have every blockchain project which as you
[SPEAKER_01]: guys probably know has a different
purpose, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ethereum smart contracts dash
transactional.
[SPEAKER_01]: So by combining two of the projects,
incorporating a transactional blockchain
[SPEAKER_01]: project within a, say a smart contract
project, as the supply chain moves
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout, as the product moves
throughout the supply chain, everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: knows, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many points is it in 15 points right
now in California?
[SPEAKER_01]: Something around there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that we can enable micro transactions
so that as the supply moves throughout,
[SPEAKER_01]: the product moves throughout the supply
chain, the individual will get paid in
[SPEAKER_01]: real time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's probably one of the most
beneficial uses too in removing the whole
[SPEAKER_01]: aspect of brokerage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, coupling it on escrow because
that's probably one of the most utilized
[SPEAKER_01]: resources for smart contracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, awesome, thanks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another thing that I've been doing a
little research on lately and strikes me
[SPEAKER_04]: as really intriguing is blockchain as a
tool for identity management.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we've probably all heard some
story about a crypto millionaire who lost
[SPEAKER_04]: all their money because they left a USB
drive with their private key in their
[SPEAKER_04]: pants that they lost, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: That sort of thing, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So identity management is a real
significant issue when it comes to
[SPEAKER_04]: blockchain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there, I mean, along with this as well,
I've been reading a lot about the
[SPEAKER_04]: refugees, so many refugee problems around
the world, and how they're having problems
[SPEAKER_04]: with identity as well, not so much from a
financial point of view, but more so of
[SPEAKER_04]: these are individuals who've had to leave
their home without their passports,
[SPEAKER_04]: they have no way to identify who they are,
and basically that means that they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: exist in a lot of ways, and there's no way
for them to identify who they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question I have, and I guess you
guys can each take it in your own way,
[SPEAKER_04]: is there a way to leverage a distributed
blockchain solution for identity
[SPEAKER_04]: management that will help alleviate some
of the issues that we've seen?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we already carry a few things that
fit identity management, which sees right
[SPEAKER_03]: here, which enable us to work 24-7,
unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sure most of us do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really, you're gonna see blockchain focus
on more of just like you said,
[SPEAKER_03]: aggregating data and information and being
stored in a central location.
[SPEAKER_03]: Might be a chip in your neck or a chip in
your phone, but it's gonna be somewhere
[SPEAKER_03]: that you store with you, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just like a poker chip.
[SPEAKER_03]: You carry around a poker chip,
that's the value.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I lose that, just like my ID or my
credit cards or anything, I'm really upset
[SPEAKER_03]: about it, but I can lose those things,
so if I put that in a blockchain and being
[SPEAKER_03]: able to use from an identity perspective,
if I can scan my arm and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_03]: the paramedics know that my blood type and
any other known sickness or illness or
[SPEAKER_03]: whatever's wrong with me, that'd be pretty
cool and I'd do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Some would call it big brother,
but really, that's the future where we're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna go and I think that would be one of
the best ways to solve a refugee problem,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I could identify myself and if
somebody came across me and they scan me,
[SPEAKER_03]: they know where my family could possibly
be because then maybe we have GPS locators
[SPEAKER_03]: on us.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, we already do with camera and our
phones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that'd be pretty cool to help
solve that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, identity is a really big piece of
the evolution of healthcare right now and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure most of us have had the situation
where you go from one doctor or another or
[SPEAKER_00]: you go to see a specialist and somehow all
you do is walk down the hallway in the
[SPEAKER_00]: same hospital and suddenly your records
aren't available and it gets even worse if
[SPEAKER_00]: you're going between hospitals dealing
with insurance and blockchain based
[SPEAKER_00]: identity for health record tracking has
been really a pretty big application
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_00]: IBM's getting big into the area and I
think really cannabis use is just going to
[SPEAKER_00]: integrate with the rest of your healthcare
and how does cannabis interact with the
[SPEAKER_00]: rest of your drugs and it really just kind
of dovetails into I think the larger
[SPEAKER_00]: future of having your medical records not
only shareable between hospitals,
[SPEAKER_00]: but accessible to yourself as well,
because that's another thing that's really
[SPEAKER_00]: hard to get done when you need a paper
copy of something.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that all rolls together with
some of the digital healthcare and
[SPEAKER_00]: identity that's coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a identity management perspective,
we'll talk about kind of like identity of
[SPEAKER_01]: specific products because it can be
tracked to personal identities as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: but when you think about genome tracking,
right, from a cannabis perspective,
[SPEAKER_01]: you created OG Kush, how can you prove
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You store that information in the
blockchain as a sequential form of blocks
[SPEAKER_01]: that are built behind it that are
immutable.
[SPEAKER_01]: So essentially if you're able to store
that data within the blockchain,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're able to identify the original
creator of that specific strain and be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to track it back throughout all of
history and that's the great thing about
[SPEAKER_01]: blockchain technology is permanent until
the end of history.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's, from a cannabis
perspective, that's one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_01]: things.
[SPEAKER_01]: From an actual user perspective,
I think one of the benefits of blockchain
[SPEAKER_01]: technology is the fact that when you make
a transaction, your personal identity is
[SPEAKER_01]: not tied to that transaction, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The only thing that's tied to that
transaction is your wallet address and the
[SPEAKER_01]: transaction amount, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So one thing that I think from a
compliance perspective that the government
[SPEAKER_01]: is trying to really try to figure out,
and this is the topic of conversation in
[SPEAKER_01]: blockchain, is how is the federal
government going to regulate this from a
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance perspective, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We talk about AML, KYC, anti-money
laundering, know your customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, when somebody makes a transaction on
the blockchain, there is no identity PII,
[SPEAKER_01]: personal identifiable information,
associated with that transaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think you guys are all aware of what
happened in Silk Road, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're still going back and mining the
blockchain and pulling out records,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they still can't tie those individual,
I mean, Ross Albrecht, poor guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, so they can't tie those
individual transactions with those wallet
[SPEAKER_01]: addresses to an actual human.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think from an identity perspective,
the government and I guess where we,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I'm not trying to pitch our company,
but and also him.
[SPEAKER_01]: No pitching.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me and him, we won't, I'll pitch him.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do kind of similar things from a,
you know, an AML KYC perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we're able to verify and tie an
actual identity behind that transaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way, you know, nefarious illicit
transactions are being able to be tracked
[SPEAKER_01]: and stopped in real time versus,
I mean, what's been happening with
[SPEAKER_01]: blockchain technology and people using it
to avoid all sorts of everything,
[SPEAKER_02]: everything, all sorts of law enforcement.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to open it up to questions here
in a little bit, but I just want to give
[SPEAKER_04]: these guys a last minute, last chance to
kind of talk about what's next,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, a lot of people look at
blockchain as this blank canvas solution
[SPEAKER_04]: to so many of the world's problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I guess last question I'd have for each
of you, and we'll start with Mark and work
[SPEAKER_04]: our way back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: What else?
[SPEAKER_04]: What haven't we talked about tonight that
is a valid application for blockchain
[SPEAKER_04]: technology as a solution?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we already touched on quite a bit
from a medical perspective, a personal
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective, a financial perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can tokenize anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got people coming to me right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I work with us gold.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're making tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're going to hear about a launch of a
new gold tokens coming out of Wyoming.
[SPEAKER_03]: So watch out for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That didn't pitch though.
[SPEAKER_03]: But so we can tokenize anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you have an asset like energy,
which is a really big one, real estate,
[SPEAKER_03]: just think of how we can get away from,
again, escrow services, or the reason for
[SPEAKER_03]: all the transactional pieces.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, I might put people out of
jobs, but we'll all figure something out
[SPEAKER_03]: later.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really what that's going to do is
enable very quick transactions,
[SPEAKER_03]: again, compliant to ensure everything's
the way it's supposed to be.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like title companies, there's no
reason for a title company.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's really no reason for brokers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I'm all brokers too,
but there's no reason for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can really solve all those problems
utilizing blockchain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It may sound corny, but it's real.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you guys are right here sitting in
front of a lot of people that are pioneers
[SPEAKER_03]: in this industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we've been in this 15 minutes longer
than you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You should get involved because it's
really going to be something that's going
[SPEAKER_03]: to change your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the way my research career evolved over
the last decade or so, I got really
[SPEAKER_00]: involved in, well, it's a company called
Science Exchange.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things they do is connect
people that need experiments to people
[SPEAKER_00]: that have the equipment and expertise to
do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this kind of distributed science
approach has a lot of potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: It certainly is faster and cheaper than
spending $2 million to set up your own
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment and reinvent the wheel in your
own laboratory.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing that comes into play
is there is a glut of PhDs in this country
[SPEAKER_00]: right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 years ago, the NIH system exploded.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are people that have been
sitting in the same lab working on the
[SPEAKER_00]: same thing for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are just talent and minds that
are ready to be put to work if they have
[SPEAKER_00]: some incentive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I love the larger concept of using the
blockchain to issue some type of tech or
[SPEAKER_00]: science challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me what you can do with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Earn your reward.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like an XPRIZE situation for data
wrangling.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smaller and maybe smart contracted.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I really see people that would
love to work on this if they had the data
[SPEAKER_00]: in hand and a little bit of incentive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wouldn't take much for these academics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really think that's the way a lot of
good science is going to get done in the
[SPEAKER_00]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll throw out two.
[SPEAKER_01]: One from the cannabis industry,
one from not the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the cannabis industry, I think a good
applicational use would be cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: futures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's an entire market that
there's a lot of players right now that
[SPEAKER_01]: are exploring it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're starting to put together
platforms and markets to try to tackle
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think if we were to utilize
blockchain for the cannabis futures
[SPEAKER_01]: market, I think it'd be a significant
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Non-cannabis, we partner with the Dash
Network probably about a year and a half
[SPEAKER_01]: ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working actually with the
congressman Schweikart in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing that we've been talking about,
and I think it would be super beneficial
[SPEAKER_01]: to not only part-time workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these microtransactions, they cannot
occur in a lot of environments.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single transaction has to go through
a bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's fees associated with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not worth actually processing the
transaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have a bunch of Uber drivers or
Lyft drivers and so forth, these part-time
[SPEAKER_01]: employees that don't necessarily get
retirement benefits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what we've been working on is being
able to provide microtransactions for
[SPEAKER_01]: these large organizations so that way they
can provide incentives to these part-time
[SPEAKER_01]: workers that may not be privy to getting,
I'm not a full-time employee, I can't get
[SPEAKER_01]: retirement.
[SPEAKER_01]: But being able to at least provide them
the fractional amount that they should be
[SPEAKER_01]: getting based off the work that they're
doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of cool things you can do
with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tool, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's one thing that,
if there's one takeaway for me from
[SPEAKER_04]: everything I've learned about blockchain
is that it is a tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people want to give it magical
sort of attributes and paint it as the
[SPEAKER_04]: solution to all the world's problems.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the end of the day, it's a tool no
different than Oracle was a tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tool no different than jQuery was a
tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really interested in seeing what
everyone does with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, you guys have been sitting so
patiently and quietly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to thank you guys for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Covered a lot of different things,
jumped all over the map on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Curious if anyone has any questions for
anybody up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The main topic here is around the
volatility concerns that people have
[SPEAKER_04]: around cryptocurrency, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I don't know how many people know
how a transaction in cryptocurrency works,
[SPEAKER_04]: but basically you take fiat currency,
dollars, Canadian dollars, whatever have
[SPEAKER_04]: you, euros, you transfer it into a
cryptocurrency.
[SPEAKER_04]: You then use that currency to transport
that value from one individual to another,
[SPEAKER_04]: at which point if the individual wants to
be able to use that currency for anything
[SPEAKER_04]: else, they'll have to transfer that back
into fiat currency.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question I think specifically is
around that volatility.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if the market is very volatile,
if the transaction takes a long period of
[SPEAKER_04]: time, there's a potential for the asset to
be worth less when converting it back into
[SPEAKER_04]: fiat currency than it was when it first
was converted in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the question is how are you
accounting for that?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what are the solutions that you
provide?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like I said earlier, that's one of the
one of the two major concerns for
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensary operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we were lucky enough to partner with
probably the top five blockchain projects
[SPEAKER_01]: in the world, one of them being a
exchange.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what that does is it allows us to
provide the ability within our platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when somebody pays in digital currency,
we can actually convert immediately back
[SPEAKER_01]: to US dollar with zero exposure to the
volatility of the price.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so at the beginning, what we're doing
is we've enabled our auto conversion
[SPEAKER_01]: feature on all transactions because we
feel that most people, and forgive me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about those guys, not you
guys, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most people don't understand digital
currency, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't understand the markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't understand what volatility
means.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't understand that over the course
of eight hours that the price can drop
[SPEAKER_01]: significantly or it can increase
significantly, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So given the fact that most people's
exposure to risk is very low, we've
[SPEAKER_01]: enabled the auto conversion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we feel as people get more comfortable
to accepting digital currency and the
[SPEAKER_01]: volatility of price, understanding how the
markets work, we allow them to control
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, we still do right off the bat.
[SPEAKER_01]: We allow them to control that feature.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say the price of the digital currency
is significantly increasing that rate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm not going to auto convert
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: We give them the option to create
strategies around increasing the valuation
[SPEAKER_01]: of the funds that they're intaking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So say for a week, Dash currency is
significantly increasing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I would encourage them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they accept money from the consumers at
a certain price.
[SPEAKER_01]: By the end of the day, they've increased
the price of that by a certain percentage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe they batch out at the end of the
night.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we give them the option to say maybe do
nightly batching, hourly batching,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever they feel like doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we want to be able to give them the
control as they feel comfortable as their
[SPEAKER_01]: threshold of risk.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how is that any different than using a
banking solution, correct?
[SPEAKER_04]: The question is, with this digital
currency system being merely for
[SPEAKER_04]: transferring the monetary value from one
holder of fiat currency to another holder
[SPEAKER_04]: of fiat currency, but at the end of the
day, they're still left with that fiat
[SPEAKER_04]: currency.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a banking solution?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or how can they work around the fact that
there's not a banking solution for that
[SPEAKER_04]: fiat currency?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the thing that we're running into,
it's not even a banking problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the ability to accept payments via
Visa MasterCard, the payment card
[SPEAKER_01]: networks, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So from a banking perspective,
banks, actually, they love us because
[SPEAKER_01]: they're seeing those funds coming from the
exchange of digital currency rather than
[SPEAKER_01]: from the proceeds of cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And given that we have money transmission
licensing, or service business through
[SPEAKER_01]: FinCEN, or fully registered, they don't
have a problem with that whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more or less getting the money from
Visa MasterCard in the system without
[SPEAKER_01]: actually going through the actual rails.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't see a problem with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you at that point?
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to get in the mic?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's very similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Ken's product, just like ours,
is we start as a compliance company first.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when Ken's taking in that money,
he knows the known source of funds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry, I don't know where you're at.
[SPEAKER_03]: But known source of funds is probably the
biggest thing for banking.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we go through OCC audits and state
audits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we have that information,
then we can comply with FinCEN 2014
[SPEAKER_03]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are you seeing the cash problems?
[SPEAKER_03]: So now if they have cash on hand,
how do they get it to the bank?
[SPEAKER_04]: The follow on question was, now that the
banks have a known source of funds,
[SPEAKER_04]: is that what will placate them in order to
allow these individuals to then bank with
[SPEAKER_04]: their institutions?
[SPEAKER_01]: So the topic that a lot of people,
they don't even like to mention,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like money laundering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's talk about money laundering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Money laundering's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you understand regulation and
compliance, there's two types of money
laundering.
[SPEAKER_04]: You might not want to be on record doing
saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely I do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to look at the camera and point
at it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe in my compliance team.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's illegal money laundering,
and there's legal money laundering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Illegal money laundering is basically you
trying to clean money without tracing it
[SPEAKER_01]: or without reporting it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's legal money laundering to
where you're actually reporting that money
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're receiving, and you're creating
a traceable record of it back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: government.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're complying within FinCEN,
BSA, Bank Secrecy Act, all of their
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, which the amount of time and,
believe me, cost that we've put into doing
[SPEAKER_01]: this, I think that we're in full
compliance of everything that the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government's asking for at this point.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how are you solving the solution to the
problem of tying an identity to a source
[SPEAKER_04]: of funds using your solution?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we provide that KYC layer as far as
understanding who our clients are and
[SPEAKER_01]: where the money is coming from.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually built in just like his
platform as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've actually automated the entire
KYC process within our platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that way we're identifying where the
money's come from, how much it is,
[SPEAKER_01]: reporting it to the necessary entities.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot I can't talk about,
but FinCEN, SAR's reporting, all that good
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not supposed to talk about it,
according to my compliance officers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a lot of the stuff that's
going on in the back end that we're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: that ensures the government that we're
tracking all of the funds that are going
[SPEAKER_01]: through our system, and we're actually
tying an identity to those wallet
[SPEAKER_01]: addresses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at the same time, if we want to take
it one step further, we've integrated
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance aspect to where risk scoring.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually, every single wallet that
hits our platform, we hit every terrorist
[SPEAKER_01]: database, we hit every dark web database
to ensure that that wallet address has not
[SPEAKER_01]: been used for terrorists.
[SPEAKER_01]: Terrorist activities, illegal activity,
dark web.
[SPEAKER_01]: We make sure that our environment is as
compliant as we can be, given the
[SPEAKER_01]: pseudo-anonymity of blockchain
transactions.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to take the opportunity,
Ashley, to add a follow-on question,
[SPEAKER_04]: because I think there's a distinction
between your platforms that is very
[SPEAKER_04]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: You glanced over earlier, Mark,
in that you guys use a utility coin,
[SPEAKER_04]: as opposed to what Ken is using.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's more of a traditional coin token.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you give a brief explanation of the
difference and why it matters?
[SPEAKER_03]: Utility token compared to a transactional
token is we use ours to store data and
[SPEAKER_03]: value and move it from one place to
another.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you deposit a dollar into your bank
account, I give you a digital
[SPEAKER_03]: representation of it so you can move it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just as you do when you do digital
payments, it's just, again, happening in
[SPEAKER_03]: the background where you have a
transaction that gets utilized.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's no volatility.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's nothing to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The dollar's in your bank account.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can look at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: At any time, we just use a digital
representation to move that in a cheaper,
[SPEAKER_03]: faster, lower-cost way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So utility tokens are going to be more of
a norm.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll call it asset-backed.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's really what's going to happen as
we talked about energy or gold or anything
[SPEAKER_03]: else.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as something has some type of
asset, it's going to help utilize that as
[SPEAKER_03]: a utility to transmit information or data
from one place to another.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got any more questions out there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, got a bunch.
John?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question was,
[SPEAKER_04]: around the fact that, and it's a topic
that I've actually spoken about a lot,
[SPEAKER_04]: until the day comes when I can swipe my
credit card and there is no difference in
[SPEAKER_04]: the process to me as the observer,
the consumer, of how that value gets
[SPEAKER_04]: transferred from my credit card to the
proprietor of the dispensary, how far away
[SPEAKER_04]: are we from that day to when that can
happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, again, we'll get back to the banks,
ACH, Automated Clearinghouse, versus Visa
[SPEAKER_01]: MasterCard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're probably a ways away from Visa
MasterCard being PR-friendly with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis-related companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from the consumer perspective,
that's really all we care about is the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer picks out their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pay for it using the account,
the means that they have necessary to pay
[SPEAKER_01]: for that transaction with minimal friction
involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from the consumer perspective,
when you register within, I'm not trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to promote our platform, but essentially
when the customer registers, super simple
[SPEAKER_01]: process, they link it to their check-in
account via the Plaid integration.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually incentivize them for doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one-time behavior.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single time they go into the
dispensary, all they have to do is pick
[SPEAKER_01]: out their product, verify the transaction
via SMS text notification.
[SPEAKER_01]: The dispensary has their funds in real
time and the customer has their product.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's actually simpler.
[SPEAKER_01]: than a PayPal transaction.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I will say, and here's where I get to
play devil's advocate, that's not what he
[SPEAKER_04]: asked about.
[SPEAKER_04]: What he asked about was when can I swipe
my credit card and everything is exactly
[SPEAKER_04]: the same as it was before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Snap?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not the federal government.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We launched about two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just got fully integrated with our
first B2B wholesale marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our second partners almost completely
through with their integration,
[SPEAKER_01]: the B2C platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have about 15 other integration
partners.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be hitting the industry pretty damn
hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll see us soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question is, basically,
are the banks cool with this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, the banks love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The banks love it because here's the
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like he was saying before, why are the
banks not accepting cannabis-related
[SPEAKER_01]: accounts?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis-related business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of all the compliance policies and
procedures that go into know your customer
[SPEAKER_01]: starts filing on every single transaction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's costly.
[SPEAKER_01]: They actually do not make money on
cannabis-related businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you sign up, say you do get a bank
account, look at the fees you have to pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we just priced one of those
$12,000 just to get a bank account.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the whole thing about it is that the
banks from our perspective, they love what
[SPEAKER_01]: we do because we keep them arm's length
distance away from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually provide and we provide all
those, let's call it compliance features
[SPEAKER_01]: that they would normally have to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We send them great accounts and they love
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from our perspective, we have a
portfolio of banks that we work with,
[SPEAKER_01]: both domestic and international,
because we don't just operate in the US.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a global company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it works out pretty well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I guess we're going to have to wait and
see what the adoption looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: You guys should have a conversation,
it sounds like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's convene in six months.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have any more questions?
[SPEAKER_04]: This gentleman.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we take on all the risk?
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as we're abiding by FinCEN's
regulations, we do not take the risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk about what risk are you
talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Legal risk or financial risk?
But the bank does not want to take one of
you guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, snap, yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was kind of our whole purpose in
us implementing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not just building out a KYC AML
policy, but actually building that into
[SPEAKER_01]: the technology and creating the software
protocols that automate the process so
[SPEAKER_01]: that way we don't have to think about what
we're doing and we stay compliant while we
[SPEAKER_01]: sleep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds great.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are the questions we got?
[SPEAKER_04]: We got one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We got one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So track and trace.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's actually something that
we didn't touch on.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually did attempt to get some folks
to join us to speak about tracking trace.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think those of us in the industry,
especially anyone involved with
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary, knows the nightmare of the
current compliance landscape, whether it's
[SPEAKER_04]: metric or any one of the other systems,
that everyone has to comply.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether it's outages or any other sort of
situations that people have seen or just,
[SPEAKER_04]: for lack of a better way of saying it,
a lack of sophistication amongst the
[SPEAKER_04]: systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally think there's a lot of
opportunity for someone to step in and
[SPEAKER_04]: really disrupt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's great to hear that someone is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you're probably not alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's definitely a lot of other folks
who are seeing blockchain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's kind of tailor-made for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a distributed ledger that allows you
to track all these different transactions
[SPEAKER_04]: with no central moral authority to say,
we're going to shut this down because x,
[SPEAKER_04]: y, z, which is exactly what you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because of the fact that it's
distributed, there's no central system
[SPEAKER_04]: that is required to be operational in
order for any of this to work at any given
[SPEAKER_04]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It should just always work.
[SPEAKER_04]: The question is, who's going to build the
best?
[SPEAKER_04]: In my mind, the question is, and I'm
sorry, I've been waiting to talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the question in my mind is,
who's going to build the appropriate
[SPEAKER_04]: system?
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, it comes back down to the point of
this being a tool as opposed to a
[SPEAKER_04]: solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the blockchain is a tool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's going to build the appropriate
solution that has the best user interface,
[SPEAKER_04]: that does the best integration with all
the point of sale systems, that does the
[SPEAKER_04]: best integration with all the cultivation
management systems?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who's going to build it so that that
actually happens quickly and efficiently?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a question I don't have an
answer to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you guys want to add
anything to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's something that's TBC.
[SPEAKER_00]: One thing that's another part of that big
system, I've been working on this,
[SPEAKER_00]: is that at least testing laboratories,
and I believe manufacturers, are required
[SPEAKER_00]: to keep their records for seven years in
the state of California to comply with
[SPEAKER_00]: metric.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is, once again, not that
blockchain is the best solution,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's certainly another data storage is
another component.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so ICS, what we do is we integrate
into all the known seed to sale systems
[SPEAKER_03]: and metric.
[SPEAKER_03]: We integrate into the green bits.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in trees.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're in MJ Freeway, Biotracks.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you're using any of those systems,
we're already connected to those systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all I do is I take your ID,
and I can integrate that information in.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that behavior doesn't have to change
from a front end.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I don't aggregate all that data,
because we can't do that yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, that would be really cool if
just one authority was able to integrate
[SPEAKER_03]: into all those systems and go do something
awesome with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just a matter of- It's not hard to
do.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're there, and those APIs are
available, and that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: The question is to Adam about a statement
he made earlier about wanting to track
[SPEAKER_04]: product efficacy amongst patients who have
specific needs and the need to then
[SPEAKER_04]: compensate those patients for the data in
order for Adam to get the data he needs to
[SPEAKER_04]: be able to identify what's a fact and
what's a myth about what strains work for
[SPEAKER_04]: what application.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the question is how are we
going to incentivize the patients to do
[SPEAKER_04]: that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, so just to add on the last bit is
how do you make sure that that falls under
[SPEAKER_04]: HIPAA compliance and that all the boxes
are being checked in order for it to be
[SPEAKER_04]: legal?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I think there's a couple of good
reasons here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is the integration of the
smart contracts for the micropayment sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of data.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we want to do is really reward people
for reporting and tracking what they're
[SPEAKER_00]: using and how it's working in as close to
real time as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this data is going to be hugely
messy.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are self-reported observations on
how did this particularly make me feel
[SPEAKER_00]: this time, but that's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of fields in science that
are able to handle extremely messy data
[SPEAKER_00]: with the proper computational tools and
data set.
[SPEAKER_00]: And not only that, but the smart reward
system I think allows us to tune in what
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of data is most valuable in order to
get over the messy data process and really
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on what could be meaningful,
such as longitudinal data is something
[SPEAKER_00]: that's extremely difficult to collect in
clinical research right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means this patient's taking
medication, how does this work over time?
[SPEAKER_00]: They may know in the first treatment,
but really if you have a chronic disease,
[SPEAKER_00]: and cannabis is often for a chronic
disease kind of state, your data following
[SPEAKER_00]: up with that single patient for 100 data
points is a lot more valuable than 100
[SPEAKER_00]: single data points from different people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the smart contracts are a way
to incentivize really smart data
[SPEAKER_00]: collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number two is that there's not going to
be, I don't think, one authority,
[SPEAKER_00]: one corporation that takes over this data
collection and just dominates the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a lot of different people
doing these efforts in a way that most
[SPEAKER_00]: helps their business and their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I think putting stuff on the
blockchain with the kind of micro control
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have over who gets to access what
data, people can pool their data and yet
[SPEAKER_00]: still have it scrubbed in a way which is
traceably HIPAA compliant, because there's
[SPEAKER_00]: clearly only certain data packets that are
included in that particular transaction.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are the ways I think these
micro-transactions have helped us
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregate the data into a size where we
can find something meaningful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just want to touch on one point that
you brought up, which is HIPAA compliance,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's something that a lot of folks talk
about.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you use the word patient and
medicine, all of a sudden you fall into
[SPEAKER_04]: the category of something that at some
point should be HIPAA compliance.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's this really weird catch-22 right
now, because it's not federally legal and
[SPEAKER_04]: HIPAA is a federal body, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's not going to be a need for
HIPAA compliance until that happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once that happens, then those,
there's still patients, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: They absolutely deserve that right for the
HIPAA protections.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, even getting back to the
federal regulations, when somebody's
[SPEAKER_00]: using, considers themself a recreational
user, oh, but it helps me sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, do they classify as a patient?
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course we want to treat their data with
the same consideration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's not a bad thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a great thing for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true, but when it gets down to the
regulations, the difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: running an FDA-approved clinical trial
with 100,000 patients and collecting this
[SPEAKER_00]: data on the ground the way we're able to
is, I think, where the opportunity is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's a really good point to
bring up is that with a lack of federal
[SPEAKER_04]: legal ization, there's a lot of things
that we can't do, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So people are trying to figure out ways
around that so we can do it legally and
[SPEAKER_04]: effectively.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's very same problem that
you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've had brand customers of ours come to
us and say, hey, we need to know how
[SPEAKER_04]: efficient our products are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, people are coming into the store and
buying product X because they think it's
[SPEAKER_04]: going to help them sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: They think it's going to help with their
lack of appetite.
[SPEAKER_04]: They think it's going to help with their
arthritis pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we do the best that we can in order to
give them a recommendation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That should work for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then they disappear into the ether.
[SPEAKER_04]: These people never come back and give you
feedback about whether or not it worked.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a huge problem that currently has
no solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, people are trying to fix it in
many different ways.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is a really interesting
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, you know, we're focused on the
patients on the medical aspect,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it would be hugely informational and
important to dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how about the growers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Growers don't get any credit for pride in
good product right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go to the dispensary, you don't even
know if, you know, your green crack's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the same thing next week.
[SPEAKER_00]: It may come from somebody else in
different conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so finding that thing that works for
you, the track and trace, and connecting
[SPEAKER_00]: you to the right medicine is really where
it's at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have any more questions out there?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we probably want to start wrapping
it up here pretty soon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm very proud of all of us for making it
through an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, question guy number one.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, and this is actually a really
interesting question.
[SPEAKER_04]: It comes up a lot, right, as the industry
continues to grow, you know, talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: the origin of green crack for example,
how, you know, how can we be sure that as
[SPEAKER_04]: the industry grows, the right people are
getting credit, that it's actually tracked
[SPEAKER_04]: and that we can identify that this is the
actual formulation for green crack,
[SPEAKER_04]: for, you know, whatever it might be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, how can blockchain be leveraged in
order to make sure that that intellectual
[SPEAKER_04]: property is stored correctly and
reviewable and easily accessible?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really interesting question for a
couple of the reasons we already
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned.
[SPEAKER_00]: One is which you really can't file
patents.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really can't go to the FDA because of
federal regulations right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's a little bit of people
trying to come up with solutions that
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see people doing things like
sequencing the genome of their plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: hashing it into a blockchain for
posterity, and they're calling it proof of
[SPEAKER_00]: prior art a lot of times.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a pre-legal classification
for showing this publicly.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other problem or the other twist is
that, what was that, 15, 20 years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: the patent system cited that you cannot
patent natural genes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you discover a gene in nature,
if you discover a seed, as I think this
[SPEAKER_00]: would fall under, you're not allowed to
patent that natural genome sequence,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now you can patent modifications to
genome sequences, which, of course,
[SPEAKER_00]: would say, I'm going to have GMO cannabis,
which freaks people out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to be really interesting to
see even what is patentable versus
[SPEAKER_00]: trademarkable.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could say, this is my green crack,
and now you've said I've got this chemical
[SPEAKER_00]: profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is a way, you know, when I'm
doing, I work in a lot of drug discovery
[SPEAKER_00]: research from natural products,
actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you could patent was the
application of a certain compound,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if it was natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you may be able to say, well,
I can't patent the genome to my seed,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'm going to find an application
patent for this exact ratio of THC,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, and these four terpenes for treatment
of nausea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you patent a formulation and
application.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is still going to be possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, of course, then it comes back to,
can you replicate that in plant form,
[SPEAKER_00]: or now are you talking about some type of
pharma product?
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and we're seeing that with
Epidiolex, right, coming out now first.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know how many of you guys know
about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: First, FDA approved cannabis-based
medicine for a very specific kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: epilepsy, if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's already starting now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's, you know, we can have a
long conversation about the predatory
[SPEAKER_04]: practices of pharma.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure everyone in the room who's
involved in cannabis has had plenty of
[SPEAKER_04]: those conversations.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, you know, they're talking about this
being, you know, a medication that costs
[SPEAKER_04]: upwards of something like $12,000 a month
or something like that for the patient.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really pretty absurd what people
are trying to get out of this status right
[SPEAKER_04]: now.
[SPEAKER_04]: 32,000?
[SPEAKER_04]: 32,000 a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, there you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's actually really interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to add something onto that,
because obviously you haven't heard enough
[SPEAKER_04]: from me yet tonight, what I think is
really interesting, you know, for me as
[SPEAKER_04]: the tech and data guy for so long at
Baker, one of the big problems that we've,
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we still tackle is data
normalization period, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we work with close to 1,200
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Each one of those dispensaries has their
own menu system.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now we might have gotten that menu system
from their data they put up on Leafly or
[SPEAKER_04]: on Weedmaps or from their point of sale or
from any number of sources, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no UPC code.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is no universal product code in the
cannabis industry to indicate that this
[SPEAKER_04]: product is the same product that I bought,
you know, six months ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or that even that this product is made by
the same producer as this other product
[SPEAKER_04]: that I bought.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it makes for an enormous mess.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, this whole company, Headset and
BDS Analytics are two companies that,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, have been making great strides
in trying to solve this problem and trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to figure out how to normalize data across
the industry and run analysis of that
data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, they can already provide
trend information about what sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: products are trending up, what sort of
products are trending down.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of, I know, operators are using
that data to be very, to be more efficient
[SPEAKER_04]: in their operation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But at the end of the day, it doesn't
exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: The most simple, like, single product,
universal traceability system doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: And again, I think that's another
opportunity for a blockchain solution to
[SPEAKER_04]: have a centralized registry based on the
blockchain.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got any more questions, guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, Rahul.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, so the question is when we refer to
a blockchain or the blockchain,
[SPEAKER_04]: which actual blockchain are people running
off of?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it Ethereum or is it another chain?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it proprietary?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think both these guys have their own
answers to that question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, my company uses proprietary
blockchain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was developed for the music industry
years ago to capture song data and then
[SPEAKER_03]: royalty data so it couldn't be altered to
ensure everybody got paid.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's, we turned that into a fintech
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so again, we own the exchange and we
own the tokens.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we're able to do transactions
in the background without outside
[SPEAKER_03]: interference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're not a distributed ledger.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been at least considering working
with, on the Stellar platform,
[SPEAKER_00]: especially because of their partner,
Stellar, because of the partnership with
[SPEAKER_00]: IBM Healthcare and we've also been working
with them through a different direction,
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of came back around nicely.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work with the Dash Network.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been working closely with the founder
and the CEO and basically what they did
[SPEAKER_01]: was they took a look at the blockchain
protocol and they've improved upon it.
[SPEAKER_01]: From blockchain scalability to transaction
time, transaction cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So given the fact that they've improved on
the metrics that was first introduced into
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry in 2008, Dash proves to be
kind of the transactional blockchain that
[SPEAKER_01]: works best for our project and for
transactional money transfer monetary
[SPEAKER_01]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and just to clarify one thing
there, I know we talked about transaction
[SPEAKER_04]: speed earlier and efficiency.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know there was a question about it from
the audience.
[SPEAKER_04]: The speed at which transactions complete
is something that's very, it's crucial to
[SPEAKER_04]: this sort of solution, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, you can probably speak to this
better than I can, Ken.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bitcoin, how long is the average
transaction taking right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Four to eight minutes can spike up to 30.
[SPEAKER_04]: Four to eight minutes can spike up to 30
minutes for a transaction to finish,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're looking at this as a solution
to I'm standing in front of the point of
[SPEAKER_04]: sale wanting to pay for something,
it's just not viable.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just can't do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't ask someone to stand there for
up to 30 minutes waiting for their
[SPEAKER_04]: transaction to complete.
[SPEAKER_04]: For that transaction, in order to use that
on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the fact that Alt36 is using Dash
specifically, if I'm not mistaken,
[SPEAKER_04]: one of the reasons is because of
performance, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: We got transaction time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Dash has gotten transaction time down to a
fraction of a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: And transaction costs a fraction of a
cent.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, from a utility perspective,
the merchant doesn't want to pay high
[SPEAKER_01]: transaction fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: The customer doesn't want to stand at the
point of sale.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to be able to, it's a
two-sided platform.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to be able to maximize the
utility for both parties involved.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think Dash, the way that they built
out their network has been able to tackle
[SPEAKER_01]: all those different components.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people don't realize this,
but no one really knew what they were
[SPEAKER_04]: getting into when they built these
exchanges early on.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the major flaws of,
since no one's representing Bitcoin here,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll just go ahead and talk about them.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the major flaws of Bitcoin is that
no one really took into account that the
[SPEAKER_04]: transaction time was going to grow
somewhat exponentially with the size of
[SPEAKER_04]: the network.
[SPEAKER_04]: So their own success is their own doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more transactions that happen on the
system, the slower the transactions
[SPEAKER_04]: become, and it gets worse and worse,
a lot worse over time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it'll be interesting to see where that
ends up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can't just stop trading and fix it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just is what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we'll have to see what that means
for the Bitcoin community.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know that other exchanges have
looked further ahead than this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, one thing that you got to think
about as well is who makes the decisions
[SPEAKER_01]: in the blockchain network?
[SPEAKER_01]: The miners, those that are solving the
hash algorithms that are verifying
[SPEAKER_01]: transactions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where are these miners located?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're in China right now, and they're
based next to dams, and they're paying off
[SPEAKER_01]: Chinese officials so that way they can get
free electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, the Bitcoin network uses as
much electricity as the country of
[SPEAKER_01]: Denmark.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Ireland last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's up to the country of Denmark.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you think about a governance
perspective, who makes the decisions in
[SPEAKER_01]: the Bitcoin network?
[SPEAKER_01]: Another reason we chose Dash as well is
because they built in a second tier
[SPEAKER_01]: governance system that allows actually the
members in the network to be able to vote.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a truly democratic network.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Kind of fully encompasses the
decentralization of the blockchain.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one last question from anybody
before we think about wrapping it up.
[SPEAKER_04]: No?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we got one more.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK, so the question is, when do we all
think that, I'm assuming you're talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about cannabis legalization, that cannabis
will be federally legal?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what should we anticipate?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's going to happen?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll throw that out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a conversation that I think we all
have on a regular basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some people are saying as long as five to
10 years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's far too out in the future.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's going to be used as political
leverage in the next presidential
[SPEAKER_04]: election.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that everything that we're seeing
happen right now on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the legalization dominoes
that are falling on the East Coast,
[SPEAKER_04]: Chris Christie gets put out of office by a
guy who says he's going to legalize
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lo and behold, he actually does it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cuomo goes, god damn it, now I have to do
this thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because Cynthia Nixon is also breathing
out his neck, telling him that I'm going
[SPEAKER_04]: to run on a legalization platform.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whether or not she wins, he still has to
change it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not to mention, they both got
Massachusetts looking over their shoulder
[SPEAKER_04]: going, hey, well, we're about to do this
in earnest starting next month.
[SPEAKER_04]: And unlike the states where everything's
legal now, Colorado, Oregon, Washington,
[SPEAKER_04]: where they're relatively isolated,
you can be in half of the eastern seaboard
[SPEAKER_04]: within half a day's drive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we'd be naive to say that
people are going to stay within their
[SPEAKER_04]: states to buy the cannabis that they want.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's going to be nothing stopping
anyone from driving from New York to
[SPEAKER_04]: Massachusetts.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just want the month to pick up their
medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that loss of tax revenue on top of
the fact that this is totally political
[SPEAKER_04]: leverage right now I think will mean that
I'm calling it two to three years before
[SPEAKER_04]: we start seeing rumblings.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's up?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to happen within this
administration.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually have the same exact thoughts he
has on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree, except I think that CBD,
and perhaps maybe from cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe only from hemp, will be federally
legal by next summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think CBD is going to happen real fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the farm bill just basically did
that, right?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think full interstate transport,
everything is.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where I was going to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD and hemp is going to be what's going
to be legalized first across the board.
[SPEAKER_03]: And right now I can transact in all 50
states.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as far as a product goes, it's up and
going, and it's pretty amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the health benefits there
outweigh, and more importantly,
[SPEAKER_03]: the marketplace, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: My parents have never smoked weed in their
life, but they're taking CBD now,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they feel amazing because of it,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people actually want the
cypertropic effects, and how many people
[SPEAKER_03]: want the benefits?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that market is going to outweigh,
and guess what the government wants?
[SPEAKER_03]: Taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they want to receive that revenue
base, and that's what's going to change
[SPEAKER_03]: the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the ability to capture that revenue.
[SPEAKER_04]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guys, please help me thank these guys for
taking the time out of their days and
[SPEAKER_04]: helping us.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know I'm going to stick around for a
little while afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rico's here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are we doing the raffle right now?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's raffle time, so we got some
goodies for folks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
See you next time.
