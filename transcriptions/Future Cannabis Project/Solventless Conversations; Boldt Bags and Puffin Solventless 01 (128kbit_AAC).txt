[SPEAKER_02]: Are you just gonna wash it right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we should.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't think it would take long.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks awesome on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I love when you when you make something
new and The whole room smells like a
[SPEAKER_03]: flavor you weren't ready for I got some
stuff the guy was like, oh, yeah Some type
[SPEAKER_03]: of like Gorilla og or something and then I
washed it and it's the whole room just
[SPEAKER_03]: stunk like blueberries I'm like dude,
there's no way this is any type of
[SPEAKER_01]: gorilla.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me can you stand up for a second?
[SPEAKER_00]: I get a spoon really quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Yeah, I can smell that
[SPEAKER_02]: No 220, huh you just do a 190 Just curious
curiosity, that's all I had I do I'm all
[SPEAKER_03]: big on making sure I get as much
contaminant out as possible So I wash in a
[SPEAKER_03]: 220 kind of like these but much bigger
which I might want to talk to you about If
[SPEAKER_03]: you can make me a custom bag really really
like that because it's so hard to find
[SPEAKER_03]: bags that fit The what I want to use I'm
very specific But what kind of size are
[SPEAKER_00]: you thinking like big?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, it's a big I'm looking for I
want it to fit a 44 gallon trash can But
[SPEAKER_03]: here's the problem every single place I
look doesn't matter if I order from Canada
[SPEAKER_03]: wacky bags doesn't order if I order from
Europe with where they're using liters,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm saying nobody can make me a big enough
circumference, you know a big enough
[SPEAKER_03]: diameter that fits and is short enough the
bags will be like Six feet long and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: like I only need it like three feet long,
but I need it wide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and nobody makes one I do I make
that size 44 make a lot of those now.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like it fits in the pure pressure
big
[SPEAKER_00]: We roll them around Roll them around and
like a pump station and the pumps out with
[SPEAKER_00]: a water pump.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Don't use any pumps.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a gravity fed guy.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't like Any type of tubing I just
feel like you're gonna lose some or you're
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna waste some It works good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know it works And especially if I'm on
like a massive scale like some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: massive scale guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what they do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course You can't lift it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't even I I use a damn hoist You
know freaking Block and tackle base.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I see your product?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, this is indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's wicked.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are outdoors This is a really older
batch of So this is this is solventless
[SPEAKER_00]: hash all of that amazing that's beautiful
Yeah, you were you were an amazing person.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you This is amazing This is wicked
Do I need a rig for this or what?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is like you can fucking dab this on a
rig and so so soft and beautiful Oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're gonna use a rig Josh you're you're
an amazing artist artisan hashish and Long
[SPEAKER_00]: hard road wicked So did you get your
license?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you all ready to rock?
[SPEAKER_03]: No I have a lot of friends with licenses
that have been asking me to to join the
[SPEAKER_03]: team and I'm a hundred percent ready But
every time that they get you know where
[SPEAKER_03]: they're supposed to go There's another red
flag of rigmarole Dude bureaucratic
[SPEAKER_03]: nonsense that doesn't even seem to be real
that they have to shell out another 50 60
[SPEAKER_03]: grand for that sucks You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I've seen the rooms where they can't
that they've been spending money and
[SPEAKER_03]: paying rent and building these things and
it's down here a year to spend there for a
[SPEAKER_03]: year and they can't open it because Oh,
well this paperwork didn't go through
[SPEAKER_03]: because some jack wagon doesn't want to
sign something You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like this is ridiculous And the fact
that we're just that we're only allowing
[SPEAKER_03]: rich people to to to work in this industry
is not fair there's been so many people
[SPEAKER_01]: that put in so much hard time and effort
and and risk and risk and They need to
[SPEAKER_03]: release people from jail that sell sold
weed it's just ridiculous that They're
[SPEAKER_00]: reducing sentences I have some friends who
got arrested and it was actually good
[SPEAKER_00]: because they got like all their stuff
Expunged while they're at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's also what it should be.
[SPEAKER_03]: There should be a complete expungement if
you're gonna let rich people do this just
[SPEAKER_03]: because they have money That's not okay
That's not the way it works.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Totally, I'm doing nothing like,
you know volatile, you know, there's I
[SPEAKER_03]: mean I've ran those closed-loop systems.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not what I want to do
[SPEAKER_00]: There's places where you know,
they're mixing a bat trash cans and
[SPEAKER_00]: buckets left and right, you know,
that's me That's all I do doing 10,000
[SPEAKER_00]: grams like like some of the big companies
do 10,000 a month There's there's like
[SPEAKER_00]: black market people doing that much a day
up there and big barns just mixing making
[SPEAKER_01]: hash Yes, and no yes and no because you
can have the small batches but you can
[SPEAKER_03]: always just pour into it into a Into one,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to say like All your workers
are going to the same location exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no need to to drive seven
different cars there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just have your mixers mix I mean you
can do large scales for sure I've seen
[SPEAKER_03]: where like I've walked over to a guy and
the guy has six trash cans Going with six
[SPEAKER_03]: different dudes and I'm like you guys are
way out of hand here I'm like you're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: clog all your bags, you know, especially
if you have a sticky product, you know To
[SPEAKER_01]: me one of the questions I have is like as
you see more and more hash makers popping
[SPEAKER_01]: up And you have a lot of people who want
to just be washing the best material as
[SPEAKER_01]: they're starting material Like how do you
all like even if everyone's really good?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're all competing for a limited supply
of quality starting material.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how does that play out?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's always The major factor is
can you get the good material,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was why I did this because I knew
the material was there I have those
[SPEAKER_03]: connections with local growers that are
small boutique growers where I'm gonna get
[SPEAKER_03]: the quality cannabis and I'm gonna be able
to produce the amount that I need so that
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody can be happy and it also helps
You know, like the trimming situation is
[SPEAKER_03]: going lower and lower and lower They're
paying people less and less and less and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're giving them less and less and less
when we go to a trim you start To go to a
[SPEAKER_03]: trim and you would get catered to you
would get lunch You would have waters and
[SPEAKER_03]: food and drink and you'd be able to smoke
and drink at a at a trim now It's like
[SPEAKER_03]: corporate America and they're putting like
I've gone to a trim where there's like 15
[SPEAKER_03]: Russian girls that don't even speak
English and they're just like working
[SPEAKER_03]: these people I'm like this isn't our This
isn't our community.
[SPEAKER_03]: This isn't our group of people like I
Don't know so now Chopping all the weed
[SPEAKER_03]: down putting it to fresh frozen you
eliminate that Entire step and there's a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot of trimmers that are upset with that
also.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's the game is changing on a major
Like it happens so fast too and you don't
[SPEAKER_03]: notice it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Mean we used titanium nails four years
ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: We didn't even know what quartz was right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the way things are smoked the way
things are done Thankfully, I'm glad
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble bags came back Hashes in right now
hash is so In no, well, that's what I was
[SPEAKER_01]: saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you have everybody making hash And
if you want to be truly good at it,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to start with that was my point
You got to start so everyone's fighting
[SPEAKER_01]: for this limited supply of good because
like when you talk to a Frenchie He's like
[SPEAKER_01]: once I can't find what I'm looking for
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm done I tap out and I'm not gonna make
like B grade hash Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not worth it to your company
either, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But all the contracts have been made all
the big companies have their next 10 years
[SPEAKER_00]: all their farms Like literally locked in
for the next 10 years all these farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fine There's no way you're gonna
get the quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah a giant farm that you're gonna get
out of a petite grow That's why black
[SPEAKER_03]: market will never go away It needs to be
it needs to be You know Divvied up amongst
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess maybe a couple Local dispensaries
because the fact of the matter is is the
[SPEAKER_03]: best marijuana is grown in California
There's no question about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been all over the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've searched for it and you're not gonna
find better weed than here and to try to
[SPEAKER_03]: like Take that away from us the small
groups the small guys the small people.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just it's so wrong like we put in so
much effort and Yes quickly before We
[SPEAKER_01]: start can you open each one of those and
quickly talk about yeah, you're gonna aim
[SPEAKER_01]: it at me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah for sure Basically these right here
Are my indoors these are my outdoors
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything is a whole plant fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_03]: We chop the plant down freeze it
immediately wash it freeze dry it After
[SPEAKER_03]: freeze drying we I place it in 15 micron
bags I go the smallest that I can possibly
[SPEAKER_03]: find and get I get those from rosin
evolution I press on a flux rosin press
[SPEAKER_03]: most of my tech I take directly from a
good friend.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think you guys have actually interviewed
him Sunfire farms kid named cannabis or
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Yeah, he's he's really knowledgeable
and he does really good work and usually
[SPEAKER_03]: passionate about what like this is going
on, you know And then most of my actual
[SPEAKER_03]: technique like pressing and how I press
and stuff like that I get from superior
[SPEAKER_03]: solid list Yeah, they've been super super
kind with me and in giving me,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know information that I can't find
anywhere and in reality though the The
[SPEAKER_03]: best information is just getting your
hands dirty and figuring it out for
[SPEAKER_03]: yourself and you know messing up But these
right here.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Wi-Fi.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is locally grown in San Fernando
Valley by a good friend It was Chopped
[SPEAKER_03]: down maybe a week ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Wash the day after it was chopped
down and then press the day after that and
[SPEAKER_03]: it's probably had like a five-day cure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah So this is this is fairly recent and
I like to give it a cure because when
[SPEAKER_03]: you're when you're When you're chopping
down a fresh frozen plant, it hasn't had
[SPEAKER_03]: time to actually have all those those
smells and all that like The plant is
[SPEAKER_03]: decomposing and it's doing a lot of
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's fermenting It's doing all sorts of
cool stuff and when you leave it in a jar
[SPEAKER_03]: closed It'll really start to change and
and make a really good flavor This right
[SPEAKER_03]: here is the caps cut the cap later cut Mac
one This is maybe two weeks old This is a
[SPEAKER_03]: really good batch it's extremely gasoline
like there's not there's not much
[SPEAKER_03]: Marijuana taste.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like extremely just Terps it's almost
all Terps.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost too heavy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I like more of a an og taste or
I really like GMO Just a little more
[SPEAKER_03]: mellower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Don't get me wrong GMO super stony This is
an older batch of GMO.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is probably two months old.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've had it sitting and curing and you can
you can tell a Major change and you can
[SPEAKER_03]: see different colorations as I turn it
over Like how it's much lighter on the
[SPEAKER_03]: bottom and all the Terps have sort of
moved to the side And this is after like
[SPEAKER_03]: like I said two months of sitting in a
cold room in the dark So there's just
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff that I like to experiment with this
is like kind of you know, how you see you
[SPEAKER_03]: can only stuff Can only stuff turns a
little darker because he likes to let it
[SPEAKER_03]: sit for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and no matter what If you let hash
said it's gonna darken because oxygen
[SPEAKER_03]: ruins everything that's dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: So The only thing well, it's also gonna
make it a lot more kind of couch lock
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean people say that but I think
once you're smoking hash of this level.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's so stony, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean like You have to smoke so much to
be able to tell the difference between one
[SPEAKER_03]: to the next I I smoke them all the all the
time and the outdoor gets me just as high
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion Is there some that's like if
I want to go like clean my house for the
[SPEAKER_03]: next four hours I think super turkey and
you know, that's I think person-based
[SPEAKER_03]: because there's people that smoke weed and
want to smoke and we clean their house all
[SPEAKER_03]: the time and then there's people that
smoke weed and want to sit and play video
[SPEAKER_03]: games and sit on the couch and do nothing
and Cheetos I I feel there's not much of a
[SPEAKER_03]: difference even from sativa to indica
where if you're high and you're smoking
[SPEAKER_03]: hash you're gonna get high to The point
where you're gonna do whatever it is you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to do I don't know if there's the
only thing that I know that like makes you
[SPEAKER_03]: want to like Clean or like actual
pharmaceutical drugs, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, and I'm not I'm not I'm not about
to take some Vicodin so I can clean the
[SPEAKER_03]: house I'd rather just get stolen and clean
this one this one for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean that that I recommend that
one That's Wi-Fi So should we smoke that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, definitely you guys can try whatever
you want.
[SPEAKER_03]: Feel free.
[SPEAKER_01]: I brought them all here for for everybody
I'd like you to curate the experience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah knows it all the most Definitely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a really Really nice glass piece
made by Eric Crunk And is he local where
[SPEAKER_03]: is he from Eric Crunk is a gypsy He lived
a long time in his car wandering around
[SPEAKER_03]: Grateful Dead shows selling his pipes and
now these are like one of the most
[SPEAKER_03]: sought-after pieces It's awesome in the
world There's maybe like ten other
[SPEAKER_03]: glassblowers that are on his up
restaurant.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's a really nice guy makes awesome
pieces and I Don't know just a craftsman
[SPEAKER_01]: super craftsman who would some of the
other people be that you respect at that
[SPEAKER_01]: level Are you thinker at that level?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's there's a few I mean you got Darby
you have you sheen There's a few of his
[SPEAKER_03]: apprentices that are super super really
talented but You know, I they pay him the
[SPEAKER_03]: respect Which is really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those guys are like chunk and hermit
There's there's so many good glass blowers
[SPEAKER_03]: out there and there's so many lower glass
blowers that are doing such great work and
[SPEAKER_03]: For whatever reason they're just not
getting this extreme Blow up of the of the
[SPEAKER_03]: market where these are going for you know,
thirty to fifty thousand dollars and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're making something very equivalent
but it's like maybe two thousand dollars
[SPEAKER_03]: or fifteen hundred dollars and it's just
it's a It's a weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a weird niche market.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess you could say so But let's smoke
them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are pieces that just go into
someone's like art collection.
[SPEAKER_03]: Basically Well, no a lot of it is is these
big hash companies these newer hash
[SPEAKER_03]: companies or these people that are I guess
brokering a lot of the hash it's all
[SPEAKER_03]: Monopoly money and they need to wash their
money so they'll buy something like this
[SPEAKER_03]: and You know fifty thousand dollars then
they look cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have more followers on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have all that sort of stuff Oh,
don't tell them the secrets, huh?
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah Yeah, that's the way it goes man.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is this is what's going on in our
world right now of our Cannabis community
[SPEAKER_03]: and it's really cool that there's a lot of
good cannabis coming out from Michigan
[SPEAKER_03]: There's cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was surprised when I went there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wasn't really I didn't even know what to
expect I was like I'm in the Midwest and I
[SPEAKER_03]: met a lot of cool growers and Superior
solvent list does insane good work out
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michigan main melts is awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have Great strains and they're
purposely not letting them out because
[SPEAKER_03]: they know we got good strains too,
which is which is cool I understand that
[SPEAKER_03]: and I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just happy that that there's someone
else and some other communities out there
[SPEAKER_03]: that are taking the time to to perfect
this and to make it more Healthy make it
[SPEAKER_03]: more enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: The the fact that we're smoking it this
way is there's no question about whether
[SPEAKER_03]: or not this is the healthiest way to smoke
it and You can vaporize it and that's all
[SPEAKER_03]: good But you're not going to get all the
terpenes and and all of the mix of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant that you need The way you're smoking
this there's no question about that Wait,
[SPEAKER_01]: so where are you mostly sourcing your
local all very very local and if not,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's grown in my backyard And what do you
try like are you sourcing all outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: material?
[SPEAKER_03]: Everything's indoor that I source
Otherwise if I do do outdoor it's very
[SPEAKER_03]: very limited and it'll only be in October
or November when the outdoor is ready you
[SPEAKER_01]: know, so What are your thoughts on like?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you like about outdoor and what do
you like about indoor as a kind of?
[SPEAKER_03]: Outdoor is is 90% of the time gonna be
growing in soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: First of all, I like so you'll always get
a better taste I feel from soil You get
[SPEAKER_03]: usually a better return on soil of your of
your hash And if it's yield yield,
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll always get a better yield in
growing in soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's that's Not a scientific fact,
but that's just what the hash makers have
[SPEAKER_03]: noticed, you know, none of this has been
written down Nobody's writing a book.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish they did But it's it's more of
hearsay, you know or whatever it may be
[SPEAKER_03]: But Do you need a dabber?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, I do need a dabber.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was just about to say that I'm like,
you know what I did forget one thing How's
[SPEAKER_03]: it going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now outdoor will always come out a little
darker I feel just cuz you're gonna have
[SPEAKER_03]: more Elements the more Sun the more
exposure dirt and everything and every
[SPEAKER_03]: time I wash outdoor the water is dirty
You're cleaning the water washing indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's obviously gonna be much nicer So
sorry These are outdoor these are indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I'm looking at the consistencies So
this has not been pressed, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: All of these have been pressed all of
these have been exactly Manufactured the
[SPEAKER_03]: exact same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all strain dependency.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and you'll also Notice a little bit
of different consistency in the washes
[SPEAKER_03]: because the first couple of washes if you
mix them you'll get more of the Oils from
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant and that the oils are what will
create this That's
[SPEAKER_01]: it yeah, I I assumed it was process
dependent and no not even So I've even had
[SPEAKER_03]: the exact same strain grown at a different
time of the year Turned out different
[SPEAKER_03]: grown in the same room with the same
nutrients the same exact way processed
[SPEAKER_03]: everything the exact same way because of
the time of the year the plant doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: Perform or it doesn't you know do the same
things It's doing at a different time of
[SPEAKER_03]: the year just based on outside parameters
of whether it's raining or whether it's
[SPEAKER_03]: windy and 115 degrees like it happens here
Stainless perfect.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, that's nice one Don't try it first you
first Okay, just first And so you you said
[SPEAKER_01]: you did press all of this so are you are
everything's pressed are you doing
[SPEAKER_01]: anything that you don't press Or I do not
pressing everything I press everything
[SPEAKER_03]: people like the full melt But then you're
separating a spectrum of the of the plant
[SPEAKER_03]: you're pulling only 90 you usually to like
120 or what some people go to like 150 160
[SPEAKER_03]: and it'll still melt pretty good but
you're gonna have a lot of contaminant on
[SPEAKER_03]: your nail and These things are expensive.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're 180 bucks.
[SPEAKER_03]: I prefer the taste of this don't get me
wrong.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get a slightly different high I've
noticed off of off of the full melt and
[SPEAKER_03]: you know before it's pressed but I don't
want to sit there and use four q-tips to
[SPEAKER_03]: clean my banger every time and I Just
don't want to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is kind of a functional thing It's
like if you had that for me banger if
[SPEAKER_01]: bangers were disposable, you'd be like
Maybe but then also you're taking that
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum away.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now you have Your 40 you to 90 you or
what 89.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are you doing with that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't ever see I've never seen a single
company sell 40 to 89 you Tell me one that
[SPEAKER_03]: does I?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can't see a single one on the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So either if one they're lying to you or
they're doing something else with their
[SPEAKER_03]: product Where's it going?
[SPEAKER_03]: Where is that massive amount of hash
going?
[SPEAKER_03]: I?
[SPEAKER_03]: Want to know nobody will answer those
questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just like screw that I'm doing full
spec.
[SPEAKER_03]: Here's my spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do 40 to 179 everything's pressed On
extremely small micron levels,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I know I'm getting all my contaminants
out and yeah You might end up with a bag
[SPEAKER_03]: full of hash still that you've pressed and
there's a shitload of stuff in there that
[SPEAKER_03]: you didn't get out Well, that's all your
contaminant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's why my hash is usually so clean
and burn so well You will never hear no
[SPEAKER_03]: sizzling, you know and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: So That's that you've set this up nicely.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm actually pretty fired up to try it
That's the way I I've asked everybody and
[SPEAKER_03]: nobody gives you straight answers The only
one that gave me a straight answer was
[SPEAKER_03]: superior solvent He's like I want my full
spectrum I want the whole taste of the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant of all of the hash that I'm getting
and I want it all mixed together so is it
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent what you're getting out of each
spectrum like the 40 to 50 to 50 to set
[SPEAKER_03]: like I don't separate them because then
you're just wasting your time pulling bag
[SPEAKER_01]: after bag after bag I know but just to
understand for like educational purposes
[SPEAKER_01]: like to like try the 40 and be like,
okay, I Understand what I'm getting but
[SPEAKER_03]: then you'd have to that but that's all
based on different bags like his bags that
[SPEAKER_03]: He has he does a different size some other
bags go 40 to 70 40 to 104, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's like Who knows per strain exactly?
[SPEAKER_03]: What heads are there were correct heads
that we're supposed to be smoking?
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't the amount of time that that would
take to figure out It's not possible we
[SPEAKER_03]: haven't created a device that could figure
it out I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know of one, you know,
I mean I'd love to have that but it
[SPEAKER_03]: doesn't exist So that's why scientific
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, I'm trying to break this down
It's basically thinking about the
[SPEAKER_01]: different bands, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What from a terpene standpoint a
cannabinoid standpoint other Compounds
[SPEAKER_01]: like and then what effect each of those
hasn't because you're marrying on which I
[SPEAKER_01]: love I want the full but I want full
spectrum too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd also like to understand what the
different bands Do whether it's how they
[SPEAKER_03]: make you feel personally have in them
personally from all the experience that
[SPEAKER_03]: I've gathered as much as I've done this
And all the people that have smoked hash
[SPEAKER_03]: with It does give you a little bit
different high that that That 90 to 120
[SPEAKER_03]: you it gives you a little bit different
high But that's before pressing it if you
[SPEAKER_03]: were to press it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just looks better It comes out like
white, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's all it is and that's just a color
thing and that's all mental, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean people are CRC Brown bh o and now
it looks gold and now everyone's like,
[SPEAKER_03]: oh my god.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's the best.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like no you just You can do anything
different, you know you same thing with
[SPEAKER_03]: distillate it's sludge you just took you
just took raw sludge and you filtered it
[SPEAKER_03]: down and you used a rotovap and he and Now
it looks like distillate and it's clear
[SPEAKER_03]: and you can put it in a pen and smoke it
But is it good?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's not good.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want I want what I want my whole plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like traditional All science aside I
want it all making hash traditionally with
[SPEAKER_00]: good product that just naturally Occurs it
happens and just happens you have good
[SPEAKER_00]: trim like this right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get great hash Yeah, there's nothing
bad.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all comes together, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good bags help too, you know,
but you like traditional bubble
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional bubble it just happens and
it's the best tradition the best ritual
[SPEAKER_00]: and it just If it's there it's gonna come
It always does and then you have other
[SPEAKER_03]: people that are like man, I love finger
[SPEAKER_03]: Love it I Love it all I still smoke weed
out of the box.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm not like what was funny was when
I was talking to cam He was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I don't smoke the flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like really he doesn't smoke flour I
know and I was like next time you harvest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you save me some of your flower?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because he just I've never seen any of his
flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's crazy You even mentioned that
now that now that I think about I'm like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never seen any of his flower He just
turns it all And I told him that he dated
[SPEAKER_01]: himself as being super young because he's
super young Yeah, he's like, why would I
[SPEAKER_01]: want to roll joints and smoke flour when I
can?
[SPEAKER_01]: Make it even cleaner shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I gotta let it cool down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a sec Timing it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, how many more second we got seven?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's delicious I love it when it
comes out good The real technique I've
[SPEAKER_03]: noticed is everyone can wash it Everyone
could put it on a tray and put it in a
[SPEAKER_03]: freeze dryer Everyone can stick it in a
bag and press it And have it come out on
[SPEAKER_03]: parchment.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what you do after that is the real the
real technique You need to be patient you
[SPEAKER_03]: need to leave it in a jar You need to let
it cure and do its thing for a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: some strains are harder than others
They're like like I can't even get in
[SPEAKER_03]: there with a chisel when it's cold,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like which what give examples?
[SPEAKER_03]: For example this Wi-Fi right Here looks
all nice and buttery Not before I whipped
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I couldn't even get in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had to actually set it on a heat mat For
like 20 30 minutes just to get it
[SPEAKER_03]: malleable so I can get in there and break
it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was so hard Like I never see anybody's
hash turn out like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't I've had a lot of people just
telling me like whatever you're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, I'm trying I'm trying I'm trying
real hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Well, I don't think all of it will come
off
[SPEAKER_03]: We're good for now
[SPEAKER_03]: I Don't know if you recognize the logo
It's an old no smoking logo From like the
[SPEAKER_03]: Northeast they have them a lot in like
Washington and it'll have a puffin But it
[SPEAKER_03]: says no puffin like you're not allowed to
puff and there'll be like a red line going
[SPEAKER_03]: through it And I was just like man That's
such a good idea Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hash has come such a long way like when I
first started making hash like 20 years
[SPEAKER_00]: ago started making it for my mom I had
cancer and We used to make this Full melt
[SPEAKER_00]: black hash and then we'd make this blondes
and the 73 micron.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's so flaky and good This is
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it tastes good Yeah, it's got the
flavor Definitely flavor very Tangerine is
[SPEAKER_00]: good gifted hashish and my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: That was good smoke Peter I do Feel free
And I definitely if you guys are still
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna smoke, please try this the caps cut
