[SPEAKER_09]: With that said, I would like to open it up
to two questions right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you relying on counties to require an
EIR?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you just establishing an EIR to begin
with?
[SPEAKER_08]: Are you doing a master EIR or program EIR
or individual EIRs per cultivation area?
[SPEAKER_08]: Can you expand on that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sure, yeah, I'm happy to talk about that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Department of Food and Ag is
preparing a programmatic EIR that's
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at the potential impacts of the
licensing program across the entire state.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so by nature of that, that it's a
statewide environmental impact report,
[SPEAKER_03]: it is not going into a gory amount of
detail for individuals, cultivation sites,
[SPEAKER_03]: or individual locations.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just beyond the scope of what the
state can accomplish.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of the real challenges for the
sequence analysis for the environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: impact report is that when you do an
environmental analysis, what you're
[SPEAKER_03]: supposed to establish is the baseline,
what's happening today, and then what's
[SPEAKER_03]: going to change as a result of the
licensing program and what the impacts of
[SPEAKER_03]: that increment of change might cause.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, one of the things we don't have is a
lot of good information on what exactly is
[SPEAKER_03]: happening today.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we understand how people grow
cannabis, but we don't know where exactly
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody is, how large their operations
are, how long they've been doing it,
[SPEAKER_03]: what the specifics of how they in
particular.
[SPEAKER_03]: So baseline conditions.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very difficult to establish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the increment of change.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many people are going to come under
this licensing program?
[SPEAKER_03]: At what size are these existing
operations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Are they new operations?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Department of Food and Ag has
circulated some surveys trying to gather
[SPEAKER_03]: that type of information and better
understand what level of interest there is
[SPEAKER_03]: in the program, how many licenses are
going to come online.
[SPEAKER_03]: So those are some of the kind of
methodology challenges.
[SPEAKER_03]: But getting back to your question about
local requirements, the state is
[SPEAKER_03]: definitely looking to local government to
address issues that are most important for
[SPEAKER_03]: the local communities.
[SPEAKER_03]: And similar to a state's rights issue,
the state is looking at that zoning and
[SPEAKER_03]: land use type of decisions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are decisions that are made in city
and county general plans.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really within the purview of local
agencies to comply with.
[SPEAKER_03]: A local noise standard, that would be
something also that would local government
[SPEAKER_03]: would establish.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when an applicant comes forward to
the state, and they make application,
[SPEAKER_03]: the state's going to be interested to see
the CEQA document that was done,
[SPEAKER_03]: the environmental impact report or
whatever it might be, that was done for
[SPEAKER_03]: either the county ordinance or that
specific grow site.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're going to have to independently
verify that all of the environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: impacts between the statewide EIR that
they did and whatever the local government
[SPEAKER_03]: did covers it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if it doesn't, then there may be a
need for the Department of Food and
[SPEAKER_03]: Agriculture to do an additional more
detailed study or perhaps push back on the
[SPEAKER_03]: counties and cities.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have not made a determination as how
exactly to handle that.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the full range from what I've
heard, local governments have gone
[SPEAKER_03]: everywhere from a notice of exemption all
the way up to a full blown EIR.
[SPEAKER_03]: And another thing for the statewide EIR,
we understand that there's a number of
[SPEAKER_03]: counties and cities throughout the state
that have outright banned cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation, all sorts of cannabis
commerce.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our fundamental assumption is that that
may change at any time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we are not going to be assuming that
just because Fresno County has a ban in
[SPEAKER_03]: place today, that ban will be in place
three years from now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're really trying to create
environmental analysis and a regulatory
[SPEAKER_03]: program that's going to be durable in the
light of all the changing regulations and
[SPEAKER_03]: laws and ordinances that are passed.
[SPEAKER_07]: In my misspent youth, I was an assistant
deputy mayor for Richard Riordan.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was a Democrat, Republican,
and my job was a planning deputy for him.
[SPEAKER_07]: And in that role was to look at EIR,
CEQA, and ways to make businesses,
[SPEAKER_07]: make CEQA less onerous on business.
[SPEAKER_07]: More important, to try to achieve
certainty.
[SPEAKER_07]: So when you go into the process,
you know when you're going to come out and
[SPEAKER_07]: you'll know what you need to do once the
local authority has opined that you're
[SPEAKER_07]: good and ready to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: When I talk to Ag and the rest of the
other governmental agencies, I tell them
[SPEAKER_07]: that let's not keep piling restrictions on
top of restrictions on top of restrictions
[SPEAKER_07]: because we're trying to figure out every
type of problem that could occur.
[SPEAKER_07]: Instead, let's think of ways that we can
protect the community but also ensure that
[SPEAKER_07]: businesses are able to know what it will
take to actually open that door.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think for most of you, if not all of
you, that's what you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not trying to get around EIRs or
NEGDECs or any of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just don't want to get trapped in some
kind of spiral, out of control EIR that
[SPEAKER_07]: lasts 10 years or 20 years.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so I plan to personally work with all
the entities involved to ensure that maybe
[SPEAKER_07]: for the first time we can come up with
some type of certainty on EIRs and other
[SPEAKER_07]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just to build off that because I think
that's a really good point is just the
[SPEAKER_03]: endless cycle.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way the law is set up is that the
state standards are the minimum standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: Local governments can establish standards
that are more stringent but not less.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in theory, by the time you've come
forward to the state, you already have met
[SPEAKER_03]: the basic minimum standards through
complying with the local requirements
[SPEAKER_03]: which have to at least match the states.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that said, there's a little bit of a
chicken or the egg thing because many
[SPEAKER_03]: local governments want to have people
ready to go with their approvals on
[SPEAKER_03]: January 1st, 2018, yet the state won't
have adopted regulations yet.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the local governments don't even know
what the state requirements are going to
[SPEAKER_03]: be.
[SPEAKER_03]: There is a first draft of the regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be circulated early next
year.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's going to be three more rounds
of public review.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's our hope that through that
process, people will have a pretty good
[SPEAKER_03]: idea and start to get ready for what the
state requirements will be.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, the banking issue is a huge
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a major issue for the
state of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when will we see action in Congress?
[SPEAKER_10]: There is.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's movement all along along a wide
front now compared to what it was ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I would expect that there to be some
major improvement or at least laying the
[SPEAKER_10]: foundation for this industry's financial
status sometime within the next two years.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is, let me just note,
that is if the administration has a
[SPEAKER_10]: positive approach to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we don't know exactly what Donald
Trump's approach will be.
[SPEAKER_10]: But let me just make the Republican
argument on this.
[SPEAKER_10]: And that is I have personally been deeply
disappointed in what so many Democrat
[SPEAKER_10]: officeholders and people with authority,
now that they could do something and have
[SPEAKER_10]: them step back, including our own attorney
general of the United States Attorney
[SPEAKER_10]: General's Office.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wrote into the law.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know I wrote the law that says that the
federal government cannot spend any
[SPEAKER_10]: dollars, any resources on overriding a
state that has agreed to make the medical
[SPEAKER_10]: use of marijuana legal.
[SPEAKER_10]: And how many times ignoring that do we see
the DEA and people from the Justice
[SPEAKER_10]: Department going in and attacking people
in medical marijuana operations and of
[SPEAKER_10]: course stealing their property through
confiscation.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it's stealing.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care what to say.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is asset forfeiture.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's nothing more than theft of the worst
kind.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we need to make sure that,
anyway, to answer your question,
[SPEAKER_10]: I believe now and I hope again,
this isn't just, you can't just say the
[SPEAKER_10]: Democrats are liberals so they're gonna be
on board and help us.
[SPEAKER_10]: They haven't been, okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I've had to write judges.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had to threaten the attorney general
of the United States.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is illegal for you to do because I
wrote the law and it will pass from
[SPEAKER_10]: assigned time.
[SPEAKER_10]: And in the law, I think that we are going
to see some major reform if indeed my
[SPEAKER_10]: Republican colleagues can look at the
marijuana business as they should.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is a business.
[SPEAKER_10]: And there is nothing more.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people have hurt themselves on
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: We know that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We know some people have just smoked
themselves outside of a job, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: et cetera.
[SPEAKER_10]: But compare that to alcohol.
[SPEAKER_10]: Compare that to gambling.
[SPEAKER_10]: Compare that to people who eat too much
sugar for Pete's sakes.
[SPEAKER_10]: And right now, we're gonna have to look at
the marijuana business financially,
[SPEAKER_10]: should be treated like any other business,
and my darn Republican friends should
[SPEAKER_10]: understand what that means.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thank you, Congressman.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope it's true to your words.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am very hopeful, but we have to prepare
in case it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: This year, Susan Bonilla had a bill AB
2149 that would allow the BOE to collect
[SPEAKER_02]: the fees for all of these new agencies who
are gonna be licensing all of you.
[SPEAKER_02]: The Department of Food and Ag,
the Department of Consumer Affairs,
[SPEAKER_02]: Department of Public Health, Department of
Fish and Wildlife.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now if, number one, there is no banking
access and everyone is still paying cash,
[SPEAKER_02]: where is everyone gonna go to pay all
these fees?
[SPEAKER_02]: One place in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, so we are hoping that the BOE,
we have 23 offices around the state,
[SPEAKER_02]: that we will be able to accept these
payments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And unfortunately, that bill got stuck,
but we're gonna try to move it next year
[SPEAKER_02]: because we're hopeful, but we also have to
prepare.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have been studying this for a good
year.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tim Moreland and I have been trying,
we've met with everyone, talked with
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone, have gone through every
scenario, and unfortunately, until the
[SPEAKER_02]: Congress acts and allows banking access,
we are kinda stuck here in California
[SPEAKER_02]: unless we figure out how we're gonna
create our own state bank or expand the
[SPEAKER_02]: services of the BOE since we have been
collecting taxes, right, for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kinda where we're at right now,
Congressman, and we look forward to your
[SPEAKER_02]: leadership.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, let me make sure I give you a
specific challenge.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anybody who's just agreed with the things
I've said, go and see your congressperson.
[SPEAKER_10]: Make an appointment to see your
congressperson.
[SPEAKER_10]: You are a constituent.
[SPEAKER_10]: You wanna be more effective?
[SPEAKER_10]: Get a couple veterans from town to go with
you.
[SPEAKER_10]: You wanna be more effective?
[SPEAKER_10]: Have a meeting with your congressperson
and it's a group of senior citizens and
[SPEAKER_10]: some veterans and yourselves.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go and see them, confront them with what
their constituents are telling them.
[SPEAKER_10]: And to get the business end done,
we've gotta make sure that that
[SPEAKER_10]: congressman is confronted by their own
constituents.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hi there, Congressman.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is geared to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm kind of a new mayor.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just reelected again, but we have an
issue in Catalina, as you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm sure you've visited us before.
[SPEAKER_04]: Transportation of any cannabis is a
federal offense.
[SPEAKER_04]: The FFA regulates it, the Coast Guard,
the local carriers, U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: Post Office, so we're kind of in a
quandary as we move forward to try to get
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine to our residents of Avalon.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have any advice on anything we
might be able to do so that every one of
[SPEAKER_04]: our patients are not breaking the law?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't have a magic bullet on this.
[SPEAKER_10]: We are evolving out of the most stupid law
in the history of our country.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's no way that we're going to shoot
through all of those years of idiocy in
[SPEAKER_10]: which our public officials were spending
their time trying to control our private
[SPEAKER_10]: behavior.
[SPEAKER_10]: And especially the private behavior in
terms of consuming marijuana.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that was, and as we know, Canada grows
hemp, and we can't even grow hemp to make
[SPEAKER_10]: a rope, and we're denying our farmers a
billion and a half dollars a year.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how much Canada makes for selling
the hemp to us, just for rope,
[SPEAKER_10]: and not to mention the other uses for hemp
and marijuana, I think.
[SPEAKER_10]: So look, there's no easy answer,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just gonna take day after day,
year after year, reform after reform,
[SPEAKER_10]: we gotta walk it back, and it's gonna take
about five years before it's probably
[SPEAKER_10]: gonna be a point where we can all say,
well, this is now operating like a full
[SPEAKER_10]: regular business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and then my question is then with
regards to the DEA.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything from a grassroots level
on up we can do to get them to reschedule
[SPEAKER_04]: that as a class one instead of waiting for
them because they just denied it again?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, the secret is that we don't want
them to reschedule, we want them to
[SPEAKER_10]: de-schedule.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I know that's what you meant, but that's
not what they meant.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've gotta tell you right now,
they know what they're doing, and oh yes,
[SPEAKER_10]: we'll go to the schedule, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's wonderful, they can control all of
us just as much, and it would disaster for
[SPEAKER_10]: everybody who's going out of the way to
try to help people, especially in the
[SPEAKER_10]: medical marijuana area.
[SPEAKER_10]: A total disaster for the whole medical
marijuana option.
[SPEAKER_10]: So no, listen, we gotta walk it back,
we gotta, what I just said, you guys
[SPEAKER_10]: applauded, you get a majority of members
of Congress wouldn't know what the hell we
[SPEAKER_10]: were talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you gotta get their attention,
go see your congressman, get the vets to
[SPEAKER_10]: go with you, get the seniors to go with
you, and other people that can just talk
[SPEAKER_10]: to them, and that's the way you do it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I'm sorry, I wish I could be more
optimistic that there's gonna be one bill
[SPEAKER_10]: passed next year that's gonna solve the
financial part of it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we will move forward, we'll try our
best, so thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just wanna offer, the congressman is
right about getting the right-minded
[SPEAKER_07]: individuals in Congress that will
ultimately move on this issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now I believe that hopefully after
November there'll be a Congress and a
[SPEAKER_07]: Senate, and that the president,
that she will be able to make the changes
[SPEAKER_07]: that we need.
[SPEAKER_07]: To, like the congressman said,
de-schedule it, not re-schedule it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Because ultimately, any agency will only
go as far as what Congress, the Senate,
[SPEAKER_07]: and the president will let them.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so yes, it's important to go and
insist that your elected officials are on
[SPEAKER_07]: the same page as you and deal with
reality.
[SPEAKER_07]: For me, why it's personal, because
cannabis in the African-American
[SPEAKER_07]: community, Latino community, has been
devastating.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's been used to lock up more Latino and
African-American individuals in this
[SPEAKER_07]: country than ever before.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it's another form of incarceration,
or what we call a prison plantation,
[SPEAKER_07]: and in a lot of ways, a form of slavery.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we've gotta make that change.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've gotta get that message through.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason I talk about the public
safety aspect, they're using it to not
[SPEAKER_07]: de-schedule it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're using the harms, the supposed
harms that come from it to convince others
[SPEAKER_07]: that we can't do anything, or to paralyze
elected officials, and I'll say both
[SPEAKER_07]: Democrats and Republicans, to not move on
this issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so it is imperative, it's imperative
that as alcohol, was way back when,
[SPEAKER_07]: was considered harmful, and no one wanted
to bring it back.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is our responsibility to ensure that
people understand what the true safety
[SPEAKER_07]: aspects of it, so that the DEA will have
the comfort level to either get out of the
[SPEAKER_07]: way, or to advise the Congress,
the Senate, and the president,
[SPEAKER_07]: so that we can make some substantive moves
on this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is specifically to Mr. Reggie
Jones.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is regarding AB 2385, which I believe
you authored, and the UCBA have been the
[SPEAKER_00]: backers of.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the same organization that a
couple of weeks ago in the city hall
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting were the only opposition to
opening up the licensing market in LA to
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically allow for a more diverse
market and ownership rather than just
[SPEAKER_00]: people that were working for the 43 or 65
white dispensary owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now since the city of LA has really
changed their stance on it, and are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking to the community to get feedback,
and are really interested in a licensing
[SPEAKER_00]: system, do you plan on withdrawing that
bill, or amending it so it will be a fair
[SPEAKER_00]: market to everyone, rather than a
specific, let's say leeway to a very
[SPEAKER_07]: select group?
[SPEAKER_07]: So measure D, the one you're referring to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also allows for the local government to
see Los Angeles, which I'm from,
[SPEAKER_07]: the ability to open up the market to
others.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right now they feel that the prohibited
because of the measure D law, and in
[SPEAKER_07]: between when we make the regulation,
when we ultimately have all the rules and
[SPEAKER_07]: regulation, and now it gives the city of
Los Angeles, especially the elected
[SPEAKER_07]: officials there, the city council,
and the mayor, and to some extent the city
[SPEAKER_07]: attorney, an opportunity to either go back
to the citizens or to create laws so that
[SPEAKER_07]: it can become a little more inclusive.
[SPEAKER_07]: Their challenge is they have as you said
there are very few, 135 dispensaries,
[SPEAKER_07]: but they're dealing with close to 1400
dispensaries in Los Angeles, and my
[SPEAKER_07]: concern is not the legal ones,
or the potential legal ones, and the
[SPEAKER_07]: concern of the council are probably the
hundreds and hundreds of the illegal ones
[SPEAKER_07]: that give all of you a bad name that have
been opened.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've got to be a little more diligent,
and we've got to be a little more,
[SPEAKER_07]: not a little more, we've got to be a lot
more responsive to closing those down so
[SPEAKER_07]: that those of you who are working here
will not be saddled with what they're
[SPEAKER_07]: doing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's what measure D, I mean that's
what the bill is supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'd just like to say that BOE,
we love referrals, so you can refer people
[SPEAKER_02]: over to us, I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dana, my question is for you, and an
extreme amount of gratitude I have for you
[SPEAKER_06]: for defunding the Department of Justice
from going after legitimate compliant
[SPEAKER_06]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, we're now seeing some rogue
agencies that aren't necessarily the DEA
[SPEAKER_06]: go into other counties outside their
jurisdiction, raiding licensed facilities.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to know, other than a lawsuit,
what are our options to stop this from
[SPEAKER_06]: happening?
[SPEAKER_06]: It's actually called Trident, it's
Sacramento County, Placer County,
[SPEAKER_06]: and El Dorado County, a tri-county task
force that went into Yolo County with a
[SPEAKER_06]: Placer County warrant and took down a
licensed and legal farm 12 days ago.
[SPEAKER_09]: Was there any federal agents involved at
all, cross-warrant?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't believe so, they showed up in
unmarked cars, and they didn't identify
[SPEAKER_06]: themselves, I don't believe that there
were any DEA agents present, they just
[SPEAKER_06]: pulled in people from these three
counties.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is totally insane.
[SPEAKER_10]: They got a bunch of people to thank
because they got a badge that they wear,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know where they go in and act like a
criminal gang and like a bunch of
[SPEAKER_10]: marauders breaking into people's homes?
[SPEAKER_10]: One of the things, we have a horrible
situation in our country right now,
[SPEAKER_10]: and right as we speak, and it's not this,
it's that we've got black Americans and
[SPEAKER_10]: law enforcement in a dynamic that's a
horrible, horrible dynamic, where they're
[SPEAKER_10]: both feeding on each other's fear,
and they're feeding on each other's
[SPEAKER_10]: hatred, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_10]: The more police officers get, somebody
shoots at them, the more they shoot a
[SPEAKER_10]: bunch of people, the more we then shoot at
police officers.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a horrible cycle, and let me tell
you, the marijuana element of this,
[SPEAKER_10]: there's an element, a huge element.
[SPEAKER_10]: The fellow they just shot the other day,
they said, oh, well, hey, he had some
[SPEAKER_10]: marijuana on him.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, big deal.
[SPEAKER_10]: The bottom line is, this law has done more
to cause the hatred between the police,
[SPEAKER_10]: who should be there to protect people in
every one of our communities, and are,
[SPEAKER_10]: but we put them at odds with honest
citizens, and of course, when they said
[SPEAKER_10]: this to the other guy, they all said,
well, they have a gun.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sorry, I'm sure some people disagree
with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Excuse me on this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who cares if he has a gun?
[SPEAKER_10]: If he's an honest person, and is
protecting himself, I don't care if he has
[SPEAKER_10]: a gun, and I don't care if he has a baggie
of marijuana either.
[SPEAKER_10]: The bottom line is that he was no threat
to anybody else, and the police,
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot of police will use marijuana as an
excuse in the black and Chicano
[SPEAKER_10]: neighborhoods, and of course, if a kid
from an affluent neighborhood gets
[SPEAKER_10]: arrested, we know what happens.
[SPEAKER_10]: His mommy and daddy get the lawyer and
this guy not only doesn't have,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's expunged from his record,
and we're lucky they spent even one day in
[SPEAKER_10]: jail, but in the poorer communities,
you end up with giving a guy a mark on his
[SPEAKER_10]: record that will prevent him from getting
work 10 years down the road, and it ruins
[SPEAKER_10]: his life, so these people, if there are
groups of people running around with
[SPEAKER_10]: uniforms and all kinds of badges,
molesting the people who are not doing any
[SPEAKER_10]: harm to anybody else, the only thing
that's gonna do, we've gotta rise up and
[SPEAKER_10]: make sure that there's some basic change
in our country.
[SPEAKER_10]: By the way, I thought you were talking
about international things.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do not give authority to international
organizations.
[SPEAKER_10]: If you think that the oppression that we
suffer here are bad, wait until you give
[SPEAKER_10]: global government the right to do some of
these things.
[SPEAKER_10]: What a horror story.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know if I answered your question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and please let us know, because I'm
looking at my staff, and we haven't heard
[SPEAKER_02]: about it, and a lot of times when there's
raids in the community, we do get calls,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're trying to figure out who it is,
where it is, who authorized it,
[SPEAKER_02]: who was on the raid, what was the purpose,
who had the warrants, and we have not
[SPEAKER_02]: heard about this one, so Tim Morlin right
there, if you can exchange cards with him,
[SPEAKER_02]: we will follow up on this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's our last question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Last question.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is the last question.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I wanna thank you all for all the
work you've done on this, but I do have
[SPEAKER_05]: one question for Reggie Smith.
[SPEAKER_05]: I met you last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the grower, and I'm a grower,
and I'm probably one of the few people
[SPEAKER_05]: here who's a grower, so I need to
represent them.
[SPEAKER_05]: The biggest burden for growers in the
Macarissa is the distribution system,
[SPEAKER_05]: and we find that that is gonna kill us
all.
[SPEAKER_05]: The law says every movement of a product
from one licensee to another licensee must
[SPEAKER_05]: be done by a distributor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that gonna change?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because if it doesn't, all the small
growers are just dead in the water,
[SPEAKER_05]: run out of business by the alcohol
industry.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know when that discussion came up,
there was a very cognitive decision that
[SPEAKER_07]: was made about the distributorship.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can talk about ways that it's not
onerous on the growers, but for,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'll just use the word bureaucrat,
because I was one at one time.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to ensure that the product gets to
the sale point, that everything is not
[SPEAKER_07]: only legal, but it's safe, and that we can
tax, and that's what that discussion was
[SPEAKER_07]: really about.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm telling you the reality of it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm perfectly willing, after this,
to talk to you about making sure that it's
[SPEAKER_07]: not onerous on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know law enforcement had a concern about
straight point to sale, but not a but,
[SPEAKER_07]: and we can discuss it right after this,
so I can come up with some solutions for
[SPEAKER_07]: you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_09]: As an association, I'll just speak on it
real quick, that's our number one
[SPEAKER_09]: priority, is to fix that as soon as we
can.
[SPEAKER_09]: The reality is, with the distribution
companies who kind of came in to try and
[SPEAKER_09]: force some of those issues on there,
didn't even understand what they were
[SPEAKER_09]: getting on them, the amount of liability
they were gonna have to have, so there is
[SPEAKER_09]: a lot of room to move on this.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've already been having discussions with
some of the labor unions who are working
[SPEAKER_09]: on this, and I mean you will also have
some discussions in more detail,
[SPEAKER_09]: but as a trade association, that is our
number one priority, is getting that
[SPEAKER_09]: fixed.
[SPEAKER_09]: That is it for questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's one thing I would like to add to
all of this.
[SPEAKER_09]: The topic of this was what's gonna happen
in 2018, with the goal being you hearing
[SPEAKER_09]: what might happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: The reality is you can actually help
effect that change.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right now, the three agencies,
the Department of Food and Ag,
[SPEAKER_09]: the California Department of Public
Health, the Medical Cannabis, no,
[SPEAKER_09]: they changed it, not Bummer, now it's like
Big Murder.
[SPEAKER_09]: The Bureau of Medical Cannabis Regulation,
they're holding stakeholder hearings up
[SPEAKER_09]: and down the state.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can go to their website, you can also
go to our website, cacannabisindustry.org,
[SPEAKER_09]: we have all that data there.
[SPEAKER_09]: Get involved, even if you can't attend a
meeting, take the time to type up what
[SPEAKER_09]: your priorities would be.
[SPEAKER_09]: Send it in, because they are taking
comment from everybody, and unlike in the
[SPEAKER_09]: past, someone who's been working on this
issue for about six years, I've worked on
[SPEAKER_09]: local ordinances, state ordinances,
state initiatives, the reality is now
[SPEAKER_09]: these regulators want to hear from us.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, these three agencies that are
having to write your, create your,
[SPEAKER_09]: your licenses, understand, they don't know
everything.
[SPEAKER_09]: They are reaching out to us on a daily
basis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, my members have gone through
numerous meetings with the directors of
[SPEAKER_09]: all three agencies, so get involved now,
and you won't have to wait until 2018 to
[SPEAKER_09]: find out what actually happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: And let me, let me just add that the
Department of Food and Ag is having
[SPEAKER_03]: scoping meetings tomorrow night in
Pasadena from four to seven, and also
[SPEAKER_03]: Wednesday night in Desert Hot Springs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same time, it's on their website,
if you search MCCP CDFA, you'll find it,
[SPEAKER_03]: so please come out, you can talk to the
director of their program there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, Fiona, real quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on our website, we do have
brochures and information specifically to
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis industry, www.boe.ca.gov,
and we've also done a couple of YouTube
[SPEAKER_02]: stakeholder meetings on track and trace,
transportation, and banking, which is also
[SPEAKER_02]: on our website.
[SPEAKER_07]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want to make sure, Daisha Austin,
could you stand up, Daisha?
[SPEAKER_07]: She's from my office, she has my cards.
[SPEAKER_07]: I plan to be intimately involved in the
regulations, because that's what I like,
[SPEAKER_07]: that's what I do, and that's what I have
experience in, and so I need your input so
[SPEAKER_07]: that we can make sure that when 2018 rolls
out, it doesn't harm anyone, and it's the
[SPEAKER_07]: best thing since sliced bread,
because we actually want to put Oregon and
[SPEAKER_07]: Colorado out of business.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he's not lying, I mean, after he
passed the bill, and we had numerous
[SPEAKER_09]: discussions with him, he has a lot of
concerns on the way things are going.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, all these people are here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, everyone, for joining us,
and we'll see you next time.
