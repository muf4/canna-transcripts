[SPEAKER_05]: A process that each one of these guys has
gone through.
[SPEAKER_05]: And interesting for a lot of different
reasons.
[SPEAKER_05]: We talked earlier about scaling compliance
and safety and those types of things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we've talked about regulatory aspects
of scaling.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's the mechanical side of that
that is really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was 10 years ago, if you asked me
how many people were doing large scale
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis processing, I would tell you that
there was probably four or five people in
[SPEAKER_05]: the world doing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that number really hasn't changed too
much today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Most of the extractors and the distillers
and the people that are in that industry
[SPEAKER_05]: are really operating at this very cottage
level still.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are some people that are building
massive plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Those plants are processing 5,000,
10,000, 40,000 pounds a day of hemp and
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis material.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some people out in the US now
building 100,000 pound a day processing
[SPEAKER_05]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a lot of that innovation, a lot of
that technology is being driven by other
[SPEAKER_05]: industries.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's also being driven by people that
are in the industry working from the
[SPEAKER_05]: bottom and facing massive amounts of
bottlenecks and massive amounts of
[SPEAKER_05]: equipment failures.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's really changing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And those failures are feeding back energy
into creation.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of those creations have
revolutionized this industry and really
[SPEAKER_05]: taken us to a new level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people are taking notice.
[SPEAKER_05]: And people are recognizing that.
[SPEAKER_05]: For the first, I guess, last five years or
so, there was a huge focus on cultivation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now there's not a lot of people buying
cultivation farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in fact, the price of buying a farm
these days is dropping precipitously.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's this huge focus on
brands.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're like, oh my god, the best new
pod and the coolest new strain.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now those things are kind of like,
yeah, they're really cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: This third wave that's hitting us right
now is all about technology and medical
[SPEAKER_05]: science, which is why this conference
exists.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we're going to start there.
[SPEAKER_05]: And one of the first things I know,
because it's been an interesting part of
[SPEAKER_05]: my life the last few years, is what is the
biggest problem that you foresee in
[SPEAKER_05]: scaling operations today?
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'll start with Ken.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it kind of actually goes back to
what we were just talking about with
[SPEAKER_02]: Boris.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ethanol is a great solvent for extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can skip a lot of the post-processing
steps if you use the right conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: But ultimately, as you're using ethanol as
a solvent and you're recovering that
[SPEAKER_02]: solvent, you have to scale up all of the
utilities that heat and coincidentally
[SPEAKER_02]: cool that back into a liquid.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as you go larger, there are definitely
sources like steam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And falling film water towers literally
just to provide that cooling heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that's going to be a pretty
big issue that we all bump into if there's
[SPEAKER_02]: not a better solution available.
[SPEAKER_05]: Noah?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think one big problem we're going to
have is we have so many different farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: that we're getting our material from
having a consistency of material and
[SPEAKER_01]: making sure that we can actually scale
these systems to process several different
[SPEAKER_01]: types of materials that are potentially
laden with different cannabinoid ratios
[SPEAKER_01]: and pesticides that we want to remove.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we start just throwing in 20,000 pounds
into a big reactor and somebody says,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I'm telling you it's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, did they check every single bag that
went into that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be really difficult to
be able to have traceability.
[SPEAKER_01]: For every batch and maintain clean
material through day to day process when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're pumping out not jars of oil,
but barrels of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the issues as well is going
to be, can you guys hear me okay in this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think one of the issues also is going to
be sourcing of that material.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you think about how large we're
all going here and there's going to be
[SPEAKER_04]: quite a few people in this room as well
that are doing multiple thousands of
[SPEAKER_04]: pounds a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you really equate that to
acreage, that's so much biomass and
[SPEAKER_04]: realistically with THC and with
regulations that are in place now,
[SPEAKER_04]: for us to be able to go this large,
it's going to be difficult to source that
[SPEAKER_04]: much.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also too, like what Ken was saying,
with power.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we can pretty much design anything
as far as availability of condensing area
[SPEAKER_04]: and things of that nature that's applied
across many other industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that much heat in the zones that we're
allowed to do it in now and with all this
[SPEAKER_04]: regulation, it's going to be difficult to
be able to scale source key batches and
[SPEAKER_04]: worry about being able to have an upgrade
of power that you need at the drop of a
[SPEAKER_04]: hat in an ever changing market that
happens so quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Edison's two years out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ace?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm actually going to give three answers.
[SPEAKER_00]: One, from my perspective, mechanically,
I think chilling, getting those massive
[SPEAKER_00]: chillers to get, particularly ethanol down
to temperature at the scale that we're
[SPEAKER_00]: aiming for, it's just a big engineering
challenge and it's going to require some
[SPEAKER_00]: new equipment on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just a challenge that needs to be
overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's also quality control issues,
process control issues that Noah talked
[SPEAKER_00]: about that are just going to be hard for
operators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be an everyday effort to
track your material, make sure all the
[SPEAKER_00]: processes are as followed, get just all
that control documented and processed and
[SPEAKER_00]: just work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the last one,
which is totally out of my league,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is regulatory compliance because
it's this moving thing that there was a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole talk on two hours ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll leave them to that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's actually a good transition
into what that's going to do for how we
[SPEAKER_04]: process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if one of the reasons why we can't
scale is because we can't get things cold
[SPEAKER_04]: enough, then we're going to start doing
things like finding ways to do it warm.
[SPEAKER_04]: How can we start extracting with room
temperature ethanol and being able to
[SPEAKER_04]: refine through things like filtration and
stuff, which is something that you guys
[SPEAKER_04]: know quite a bit about.
[SPEAKER_04]: But post-processing is a bitch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But not if you can do it without media.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can do it without media.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that's a good segue.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are you most excited about
products, services, whatever coming out on
[SPEAKER_05]: the market today?
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't give any secrets away.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually something that I think you
guys are working a lot with.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's insane.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to?
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead, Noah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been working on a membrane recovery
of ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been able to mechanically separate
ethanol from crude oil down to about a
[SPEAKER_01]: five to one ethanol to crude ratio.
[SPEAKER_01]: About 150 gallons on 30 amps.
[SPEAKER_01]: 150 gallons an hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can clap right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from there, the distillation of
ethanol is really it's not much of a
[SPEAKER_01]: problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at that point, you don't really even
need to distill your ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: The ethanol is so cheap.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's ways to louch your ethanol out in
water and basically turn the ethanol you
[SPEAKER_01]: dilute it enough to where it's just water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you separate your ethanol and
water through maybe you put it in a
[SPEAKER_01]: non-polar, use some gravity.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of different ways to skin a
cat.
[SPEAKER_04]: And with that type of filtration,
also, you can get into removal of fats.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can remove a lot of other things from
it as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as far as efficiencies go with large
scale and having to address the whole cold
[SPEAKER_04]: problem, which is the huge issue,
because how are you going to do 5,000 plus
[SPEAKER_04]: pounds a day with, well, 5,000 is probably
pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my dex.
[SPEAKER_04]: But multiple tons a day.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a lot of cold ethanol.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then that's a lot of heat to work
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: To recover it, if you can address that
through filtration, that destroys that
[SPEAKER_04]: bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to interject that I think it's
very interesting that we have this
[SPEAKER_00]: filtration technology that's coming out
that will allow warm processing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also that cold chilling something even
to minus 80 is a solved problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know how to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just takes electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't currently have access just to
off the shelf machines that do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are systems that have been
engineered in industry that do that on a
[SPEAKER_00]: daily basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's how we get dry ice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can apply those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be interesting to see
what becomes the most cost competitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it electricity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or is it membrane filters?
[SPEAKER_00]: And membrane filters might have an edge
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to be very interesting to
me to see that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or just post-processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Throw a hammer of solvent and filtration
might be a way, but any way of
[SPEAKER_01]: post-processing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might just want to rip absolutely
everything out of your material and have a
[SPEAKER_01]: very dirty crude that you wave a magic
wand over and you develop your own methods
[SPEAKER_01]: to make it a beautiful oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've seen a lot of tricks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't know what was going to happen
when we tried that pesticide remediation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when people started getting water
clear delta 9.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just through so many people working
through these problems and trying it at a
[SPEAKER_01]: R &D scale and then open sourcing that,
bringing it to the table so like minded
[SPEAKER_01]: people can discuss.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that we're actually going to be
able to solve a lot of these problems
[SPEAKER_01]: before there's actually larger equipment
companies that are coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And taking the space, taking the culture
from us.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you see manufacturing in this
space going?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your ideal two years, five years
from now?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's your ideal of how this space looks
like?
[SPEAKER_05]: How much are we processing every day?
[SPEAKER_05]: What kind of products are we making along
those lines?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if we're continuing down the path
we're going right now, it's going to be on
[SPEAKER_02]: a THC side we're going to be seeing
probably, like you guys are crunching out
[SPEAKER_02]: around 5,000 pounds a day probably is a
feasible scale that also doesn't outscale
[SPEAKER_02]: your supply chain for trim and all of
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, on the CBD front, you're probably
going to see CBD isolate prices drop to
[SPEAKER_02]: like dollar, maybe sub-dollar in the next
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'll be a competitive environment for
sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is why scaling and being able to do
this stuff effectively and efficiently is
[SPEAKER_02]: really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that isolated cannabinoids will...
Analogs, prodrugs, the ones that aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: protected by patents, it will be pretty
big.
[SPEAKER_01]: But isolated cannabinoids breaking down
the ones that are already present in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis plant, being able to actually
reformulate them into medicine that we
[SPEAKER_01]: actually...
[SPEAKER_01]: There's actually clinical studies
happening in Canada right now that we
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't able to do now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if we start seeing the formulations
that are working in Canada, we are way
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead of them in manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we start isolating these products,
when things start to get a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: easier on the regulatory side,
we'll be there with some of the best
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine available at bulk to be able to
not just provide it in the United States,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we will be the trendsetter again once
we get over those regulatory hurdles.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think as far as production goes,
I think it's vastly going to be done by
[SPEAKER_04]: larger companies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know it's kind of an industry-wide joke
that we're like, oh, Marlboro,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or Philip Morris is coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that that is the reality.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that it's going to break down a
lot like beer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you're going to see a wide range
of products made by two or three very
[SPEAKER_04]: large companies that pretty much pins down
a lot of the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I think you're going to see kind
of like the craft beer aspect of it,
[SPEAKER_04]: where you're going to have people like us
who are probably refuse to sell out or
[SPEAKER_04]: started a brand and want to hang on to it
or just have a really good product that
[SPEAKER_04]: can't be done on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as far as processing goes in the
future, large scale, yeah, I think
[SPEAKER_04]: unfortunately we're going to have to deal
with what we're already seeing happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of these big players coming in who
may make a lot of like, we look at what
[SPEAKER_04]: they're doing and kind of laugh from the
sidelines like, ha ha, that's dumb because
[SPEAKER_04]: I already did that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's the deal is that they can
afford to make that mistake.
[SPEAKER_04]: They'll figure it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they'll just keep going.
[SPEAKER_04]: So inevitably, they're going to get it
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not too difficult to figure out
how to make distillate.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that they're going to be here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think THC and CBD are going to be
commodity products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to speculate on the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be big players that pump
it out by the literal ton.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a lot of room for
effectively craft brewers.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's thousands upon thousands of
different types of wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's Carla Rosa pumping out commodity
wine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's also room for manufacturers to
do craft processes, make high quality
[SPEAKER_00]: products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's interesting to see who becomes a big
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's also a lot of room for small,
efficient players.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because beer and wine, it's not as high a
margin as what we're used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's lots of craft players.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a huge industry to be a small player
in those fields.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need efficient equipment,
efficient ways to produce at those small
[SPEAKER_00]: scales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that equipment will be available.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's being developed right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: At Beaker and Wrench.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: One positive side of the CBD
commoditization and it being readily
[SPEAKER_02]: available is the ability to actually
interconvert cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So taking a kilo of CBD and converting it
to CBD using various reactions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or CBD to CBN or THCV or any of those
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or even just synthesis of cannabinoids in
general.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's well published.
[SPEAKER_02]: People know how to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure why people aren't doing it
yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe it just wouldn't be accepted as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you'll probably see that in the
future.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's missing from the industry?
[SPEAKER_05]: We see a lot of bottlenecks every day.
[SPEAKER_05]: We run up against something.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we innovate our way out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But right now as we all sit here,
what's missing?
[SPEAKER_05]: We just purchased a centrifugal
partitioner.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're kind of staring at it like a big
paperweight right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But is that separation something that's
missing that needs to be honed in on?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think diversification of readily
available cannabinoids is going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: huge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same with terpene content.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if everyone's cranking out 5,000
liters a day of distillate or whatever,
[SPEAKER_02]: what are you going to put in that that
actually makes it resemble cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's going to be a big part
of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_01]: Having cannabis-based terpene profiles
that people actually like.
[SPEAKER_01]: And developing methods using the solvents
that we have to where we aren't just
[SPEAKER_01]: thrashing good terps just because we need
to make a few distillate bottles.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually developing some methods and
saving those compounds that are more
[SPEAKER_01]: valuable than the cannabinoids right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's not necessarily missing,
but it would definitely help if there was
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot more cross-knowledge from other
industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, if you look at what we're applying
to cannabis now that's making huge
[SPEAKER_04]: changes, almost all of that stuff has
existed in other industries.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been right in front of our face the
entire time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's just being able to have
access to, well, funds to be able to
[SPEAKER_04]: explore a bunch of other things in order
to become more efficient in processing a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of these things because currently
right now we're all self-funded.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it costs a lot of money when you're
wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not as incentivizing to take
these risks in order to purchase such an
[SPEAKER_04]: expensive machine because you think it
might work.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that being said, I think that's kind of
something that's missing is some type of
[SPEAKER_04]: research funding for being able to
discover a lot of new ways to process
[SPEAKER_04]: things.
[SPEAKER_00]: To go back to the value added of the
terpenes and stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: An anecdote from the petroleum industry is
like gasoline is less than half the value
[SPEAKER_00]: of a barrel of oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make byproducts that go into plastics
and pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything that we can't possibly
imagine that makes up more than half the
[SPEAKER_00]: value from the remaining 10% that doesn't
get converted to gasoline.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have lots of problems with,
OK, we need this size of equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be specialized in that way,
blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are all solvable engineering
challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I haven't seen anyone really do yet
is separate all the terpenes, make it into
[SPEAKER_00]: these beautiful profiles, find other uses
for them, find other pharmaceutical uses
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that really excites me to see where
the industry is going to go in that
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_02]: One request I've got on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to determine what is it in a
hydrocarbon extract from the terpene
[SPEAKER_02]: perspective that does not come through
with other forms of extraction.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely prevalent there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can taste it in whatever sauce cart or
whatever you're trying out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's definitely some backbone that is
there that we need to profile or determine
[SPEAKER_02]: what it is so that we can replicate that
on a larger scale because it really does
[SPEAKER_02]: round out the flavor profile of all the
other more dominant terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to half answer that in that we know
it's light terpenes because everything
[SPEAKER_00]: that, and when you do an ethanol extract,
when you recover the ethanol, all the
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes that are remotely close to the
boiling point of ethanol and lighter go
[SPEAKER_00]: away.
[SPEAKER_00]: We still need to profile those,
figure out what those are, extract those
[SPEAKER_00]: from the plant, save them, and put them
into flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So research is needed, and I 100% agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those light terpenes, at least we have
a category of what they are.
[SPEAKER_05]: You touched on it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And in the distillate world, terpenes are
a byproduct, a waste stream,
[SPEAKER_05]: unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there's all these other waste streams
that we haven't even begun to touch.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a very fibrous plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are biofuels and biochar.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a company just reached out to talk
about turning spin pulp material into
[SPEAKER_05]: cellulose to make clothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that something that's missing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that the future as we start figuring
out where that other 50% of the value
[SPEAKER_05]: comes into play?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think so for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any process you're trying to make all of
your products run as efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: To your point, like the cellulose,
if you are an ethanol extractor,
[SPEAKER_02]: you could take all of your biomass,
send it to some company that does
[SPEAKER_02]: cellulose processing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll turn it back into ethanol and
cellulite ethanol to reprocess more
[SPEAKER_02]: material.
[SPEAKER_02]: It'd be kind of a good closed loop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and the market is getting more and
more competitive.
[SPEAKER_01]: We see the prices dropping.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the prices drop, we need to find
other profit streams and other ways to be
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those profit streams are one thing,
and also becoming more energy efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: And potentially carbon neutral,
going towards a carbon neutral goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way when you've got every other
company that's being protested against and
[SPEAKER_01]: tearing up, being thought of as a bad guy,
and the cannabis guys are finally being
[SPEAKER_01]: called the bad guys just like we saw up in
Northern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be that good guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be the one that's using the
best methods, the best practices to create
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine, and not just do it for the
bottom dollar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we should have terpene water
balloon fights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ouch.
[SPEAKER_04]: Crucial.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you should go dump them at your local
police station.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just kidding.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it's really brilliant that there's
a lot of jobs that can be created around
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had people ask about creating soap with
the plant fats.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's something that's really
brilliant about it is that not only are we
[SPEAKER_04]: taking what we want off of it,
but now it's the creation of new products
[SPEAKER_04]: that can go out there and continue to make
money off of the same stuff while doing it
[SPEAKER_04]: efficiently and not trashing a bunch of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, if you're going to be making that
commodity product, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's critical to have all your waste
streams be part of your revenue,
[SPEAKER_00]: or at least part of your process.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been wanting to see someone take the
biomass and just burn it and turn it into
[SPEAKER_00]: steam and use it to power the falling
film.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something I've wanted to see from
the very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty basic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hemp clothing would be amazing also.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpene water balloon fights approved.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's interesting that we started out six,
seven years ago collecting trim from
[SPEAKER_05]: farms, and they call it their trash.
[SPEAKER_05]: We get it basically for nothing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're moving back into an era of
finding other trash, terpenoid trash,
[SPEAKER_05]: biomass trash that we've thrown away,
and now we're finding different uses for
[SPEAKER_05]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've actually purchased a pelletizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: After you run your product, it actually
pelletizes super, super well.
[SPEAKER_04]: If there's any subtle amount of ethanol
left over on it, it also burns really,
[SPEAKER_04]: really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: This isn't the same thing that he was
bringing up because I wanted to generate
[SPEAKER_04]: steam in order to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: California doesn't allow me to do so,
but if I was in a state that would,
[SPEAKER_04]: that would be the most efficient way of
running your processing plant would just
[SPEAKER_04]: be pelletize your waste, burn it,
generate steam, distill, probably use some
[SPEAKER_04]: natural water source in order to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just thinking here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've done the math.
[SPEAKER_00]: The burning of the biomass provides at
least the amount of energy required to
[SPEAKER_00]: boil all the ethanol to extract it,
probably two to three times more.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to say.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have biochar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where are your heads going?
[SPEAKER_05]: We've seen a lot of changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot of you consult for other people,
build equipment for other people.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's next on your plate?
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have a five-year plan?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you trying to tackle next?
[SPEAKER_04]: Five-year plan?
[SPEAKER_04]: Six-month plan, maybe.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try like a two-week, dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're in an ever-changing... It's moving
so fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: Next thing you know, it's like,
oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just figured out how to filter it all
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just trying to figure out what's
next.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, automation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not here yet, but by this time next
year, I'm quite sure that we, if not
[SPEAKER_00]: someone else, will have completely
automated systems where you press a
[SPEAKER_00]: button.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to have a person that knows
every bit of thermodynamics to be like,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, what temperature do I set it at to
strip this terpene?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do I get this purity?
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever, it'll have sensors on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fraction finder that measures your
purity, adjusts the parameters real-time,
[SPEAKER_00]: tells you how you're doing, and tells you
if there's any problems, and literally
[SPEAKER_00]: texts you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, I think, is the goal for at least
our equipment in the near future,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think other people will follow that
as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think, for me, I'm kind of focused on
that interconversion of cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the wet chemistry you can do with
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: One thing I'm kind of curious about is,
for example, you can acetylate THCA,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is similar to how they convert
morphine into heroin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Same chemistry, actually, but it makes the
THC molecule five times more potent.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm curious if that same chemistry,
which you should be able to do the same
[SPEAKER_02]: chemistry with CBD and actually make it
more bioavailable or resist breakdown as
[SPEAKER_02]: it travels through the liver, because
that's really the big problem that happens
[SPEAKER_02]: with CBD is that everybody thinks it's
wonderful, we're all consuming a fuck ton
[SPEAKER_02]: of it, but if you were to look at what the
dose was given in these trials,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's far more than anybody's buying in a
consumer-level dose.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we can make them more active in the
body, I think that's of serious value to
[SPEAKER_02]: all of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking I really want to stick with
the membranes, but I want to go a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit more in-depth with it and play with
vapor phase membranes and look at the
[SPEAKER_01]: potential of separating cannabinoids and
also remediating pesticides with lower
[SPEAKER_01]: amounts of energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now, chromatography is so hard to
scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: The separation of molecules is extremely
difficult on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hemp industry is going to be burning
through a lot of THC unless there's really
[SPEAKER_01]: solid methods out there for separating
these things with lower energy solutions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that's what I'm most excited
about is to see just large advances in
[SPEAKER_04]: areas of filtration.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and with the pesticides like you're
talking about and kind of echoing what
[SPEAKER_02]: Jack was talking about, really your best
foot forward there is to get yourself an
[SPEAKER_02]: analytical setup and do small,
micro-extractions of your plant material
[SPEAKER_02]: and concentrate that and test that for
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that if that doesn't pop for
pesticides in the concentrated form,
[SPEAKER_02]: you probably likely won't see it,
so you have the choice to either buy that
[SPEAKER_02]: material or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: So a little bit of a wider angle.
[SPEAKER_05]: CO2, ethanol, and hydrocarbons are the
three ways we're going about this right
[SPEAKER_05]: now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pros and cons for those different
methodologies.
[SPEAKER_05]: What scales?
[SPEAKER_05]: What doesn't?
[SPEAKER_05]: And is there something we're missing?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hearing about water extraction
coming online and other tech.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody want to take a swing at some of
that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the prospect of the biphasic
countercurrent exchange is really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: The concept of taking a solvent that the
cannabinoids are soluble in and then
[SPEAKER_02]: basically passing them across a
non-missable solvent and transferring the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids from one phase to the other.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, all the nasty stuff like
fats and lipids and gross stuff you don't
[SPEAKER_02]: want stay in the upper layer or bottom
layer depending on what phases you're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then your cannabinoids go along to the
next process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that's pretty interesting for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's oil made from many other plants
that are done without ethanol.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's a lot of them that are
done with pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have really high hydraulic screw
presses that take out quite a bit of oil
[SPEAKER_04]: from things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always wanted to play with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in essence a giant rosin press,
pretty much.
[SPEAKER_04]: Imagine pressing hundreds of pounds,
thousands of pounds all at one time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure that would work or not,
but it's fun to think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or maybe not.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm relatively certain it would work.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can talk later.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, as far as CO2 goes and ethanol and
hydrocarbons go, I think the only real way
[SPEAKER_04]: that you could make any argument for any
type of CO2 would be subcritical.
[SPEAKER_04]: They use them for washing bulletproof
vests and things like that from the
[SPEAKER_04]: military.
[SPEAKER_04]: You pretty much just huck a bunch of bags
in there, push a cycle.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because it's subcritical, it doesn't
really destroy your terpenes as much as
[SPEAKER_04]: supercritical would.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you can produce a crude oil that's
okay that way.
[SPEAKER_04]: But any type of supercritical extraction
through CO2 I don't think is scalable or
[SPEAKER_04]: responsible to purchase as far as how much
bang for your buck you really get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hydrocarbons are fun, but I think they're
a little bit too difficult to do on that
[SPEAKER_04]: large of a scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: People will definitely disagree with me,
but that's my opinion on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna agree that the CO2 and the
hydrocarbons are not going to be the
[SPEAKER_00]: commodity producers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's definitely room for all of
the variants of extraction technology in
[SPEAKER_00]: the sort of the boutique market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least right now, until giant screw
presses come online or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: ethanol is definitely the bulk commodity
driver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just how it is until a new
technology overtakes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are room for CO2 boutique
technologies or butane unarguably produces
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the best smelling stuff that I've
ever had.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's room for all the technologies,
but ethanol is the bulk driver.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's some loose patents on this,
but I've been wanting to build using an
[SPEAKER_02]: inert sweep gas to basically heat that
inert gas flow it through your stream of
[SPEAKER_02]: material, evaporate the terpenes,
and it's basically in a closed loop.
[SPEAKER_02]: You condense those terpenes in the closed
loop, and then you increase your
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures until you get to the point
where you're actually distilling
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you could do that in an environment
that actually didn't combust the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: material, you might actually have a nice
little super efficient extraction setup.
[SPEAKER_01]: I definitely agree that ethanol is gonna
be the easiest to scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's plenty of people using or plenty
of industries using hydrocarbons,
[SPEAKER_01]: but some of your heavy hydrocarbons,
hexanes mostly.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with those, there's still going to be
that extra step of winterization or some
[SPEAKER_01]: type of fat separation that you have to
deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: With CO2, I think there is a lot of
utility, just not for extracting from
[SPEAKER_01]: biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that CO2 has a lot of utility for
post-processing of crude oil, for
[SPEAKER_01]: separation of terpenes, CO2 flash
chromatography, so you're not dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: flammable solvents to recover,
which is one of the big issues now for THC
[SPEAKER_01]: remediation from hemp distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are either using large amounts of
adsorbents or huge amounts of solvents
[SPEAKER_01]: through rhodochromes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I definitely think that there's a lot
of utility with CO2, but it's not being
[SPEAKER_01]: approached the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's mostly a bunch of CO2 companies that
are seeing other people, putting a machine
[SPEAKER_01]: out there, adding a couple bells and
whistles, but not really listening to what
[SPEAKER_01]: we need in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: A few of the things that everybody thinks
that CO2 turps taste the same,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's actually not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: The issue is that most people decarb their
material before they throw it into a CO2
[SPEAKER_01]: machine, so they've just cooked most of
their turps and it all tastes like hash
[SPEAKER_01]: machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a method would be to pull a turp
run, pull your material out, decarb it,
[SPEAKER_01]: or have jacketed columns that you could
heat, do your decarb inside after you do
[SPEAKER_01]: your terpene pulls.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are just small little things that
haven't been utilized by the CO2 industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think that there will be a lot of
utility for it, but not in the processing
[SPEAKER_01]: of biomass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Noah brought up a really interesting point
about multi-stage processing, where you
[SPEAKER_00]: can pull a turp run on CO2 and then dump
it in ethanol, or do a screw press and
[SPEAKER_00]: then do a butane extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: In order to get all those product streams
in the most pristine form where they're
[SPEAKER_00]: most valuable, you're going to need to
produce multiple processes, and I haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: really seen anyone do that yet,
but it's definitely something that's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to be a necessary step in order for THC to
be less than half the value of the whole
[SPEAKER_00]: product.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are kind of doing a form of that
now, when they're using either creating a
[SPEAKER_04]: crude oil from CO2 and then they have to
winterize in ethanol.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're already making steps like that a
little bit, but yeah, further on down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another weird one that I'd be really
curious to check out a lot would be direct
[SPEAKER_04]: distillation, which would be really crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Really crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you see as a way to do that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, in essence, when you burn biomass,
you can recondense all that pretty much,
[SPEAKER_04]: or it's like a vaporizer.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's where the nitrogen stream comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just recondense the stuff in your volcano
bag, basically.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to open it up for questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: These guys have a lot of knowledge on
stage, so if anyone has a question for one
[SPEAKER_05]: of them, raise your hand, and we'll get a
mic or just yell real loud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody in the room?
[SPEAKER_05]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about doing a mechanical separation
to conserve your ethanol beforehand,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then utilizing the ethanol or the
other processes for your post-processing?
I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking mechanical, and when I'm
talking mechanical, I'm talking about a
[SPEAKER_03]: dry sift or a water hash first,
and then utilizing the ethanol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you could even pull the material.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it was finely ground up, you could pull
it through a cyclone separator,
[SPEAKER_02]: and all of your fines will actually
separate and condense in a micron screen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then all of your heavy material,
where most of the trichomes and
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabinoids have been removed,
would be collected in basically bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you could sell them to another
processor to process the lower
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration of cannabinoids and do
exactly like you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Take that and use smaller volumes of
ethanol to extract it.
[SPEAKER_00]: To answer your question specifically,
if you ethanol extract a dry sift and then
[SPEAKER_00]: try to distill it, something weird
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: That makes the oil really gritty,
and I'm sure there will be a solution to
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you winterizing it when you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Willie Bill did those experiments,
so I don't have the direct answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something happens weird.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a solvable problem, I'm sure,
but it hasn't been solved by anyone I know
[SPEAKER_00]: yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I have also not solved it,
and I have tried it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've done it with a lot of pretty much
just like keif, like hundreds of pounds of
[SPEAKER_04]: keif.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know quite a few people who break it
down into ethanol and have success,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I just find it a huge bear because
it's really difficult to separate out.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll clog any type of filter that you try
and use.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any micron bag that you try and use,
it will fill and then just keep full.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you're talking about longer
exposure time of ethanol to this,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it starts to pull other weird stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just kind of a nightmare.
[SPEAKER_01]: I second that.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is a question in the back of the
room.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not use isopropyl over ethanol at room
temperature?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because isopropyl is not pulling some of
the same stuff at room temperature that
[SPEAKER_05]: ethanol will, namely fats.
[SPEAKER_02]: Slightly more toxic requires slightly more
energy to evaporate and condense.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it likes to stick around a little
longer too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's harder to evaporate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think you're about to tell me to
restate.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, so what he's saying is if you're going
to distill it anyway, you know the final
[SPEAKER_02]: product is not going to have any final
solvents in it, like isopropyl especially
[SPEAKER_02]: because it's so volatile.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why would it matter if you just use that
solvent?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a great point.
[SPEAKER_02]: You totally can.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think from maybe like a business
standpoint, you're trying to market
[SPEAKER_02]: products that a customer base might be
paranoid about how the isopropyl they use
[SPEAKER_02]: in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regardless, if there's 0.0%, you've got
the test to prove it, the fact that you
[SPEAKER_02]: use isopropyl at all, they'll throw their
hands up.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the only thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't believe that isopropyl is
actually considered one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: non-volatile solvents here in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that ethanol being used has to be
food grade anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would imagine that there's some
regulatory issues with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've also heard that it pulls slightly
more waxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: It pulls a few more undesirables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why we've stayed away from it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've only used it on a small scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I guess we've just kind of followed
everybody else's path.
[SPEAKER_05]: Noah, did regulation push you towards
ethanol?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: After it had pushed us away from butane,
and to limonene for a while, and we went
[SPEAKER_01]: down that rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: It did OK, but it took some time to figure
out.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes back to those azeotropes you were
talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you talk about limonene recovery using
what methodology you used to recover
[SPEAKER_05]: limonene?
[SPEAKER_01]: The way I did it was basically you'd need
to azeotropically distill your ethanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, you're limonene crude oil
out by adding distilled water in a rotary
[SPEAKER_01]: evaporator.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it can get pretty funky.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really have to dial in your
parameters, have enough water in it,
[SPEAKER_01]: because you'll see it distilling
perfectly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll see the craziest bump
explosion that brings all of your- So
[SPEAKER_01]: volatile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, it's crazy volatile when it's in the
presence of water and under the vacuum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we eventually figured out a way to get
most of it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're still going to have a taste to
it if you're not distilling your
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your lab probably smelled so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, until it mixes with ethanol,
and it breaks down into carvone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that smells like black licorice.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a 12-hour rabbit hole to
figure out why every distillate you're
[SPEAKER_05]: doing tastes like star anise.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it's about a 12-hour rabbit hole on
the internet.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then you finally figure out,
oh, this converts to this because there's
[SPEAKER_05]: an alcohol involved, and limonene and
alcohol at heat.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a breakdown.
[SPEAKER_05]: It turns into carvone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's a free one.
[SPEAKER_05]: You guys don't have to spend that time.
[SPEAKER_05]: The actual terpenoid isomer is called
carvone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Or carvone?
[SPEAKER_05]: C-A-R-B-O-N.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not a great speller, apparently.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, sir, the one in the glasses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Regulation and lipid pickup.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not allowed in the type 6 license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, type 6 doesn't allow it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's considered a volatile solvent,
and ethanol is also considered volatile
solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they threw us a bone and decided to
throw that under the umbrella of
[SPEAKER_01]: nonvolatile solvent.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you use ethane under type 7?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulators don't know physics.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're idiots.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who's going to go pass it with ethane?
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know the definition of volatile
solvent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's defined by the paper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because technically, ethanol is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they decided to not call it that,
so it's easier to.
I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: it definitely pulls fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: It definitely pulls fat.
[SPEAKER_01]: The colder you go, the less fats it pulls.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it needed some winterization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless you're doing extremely small scale
extractions, you'll usually pick up some
[SPEAKER_01]: wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe not enough to.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and it for sure pulls chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because there's water that's sparingly
soluble in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the water that's in it actually does
pick up some.
Chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unless you're at super cold temps.
[SPEAKER_05]: Interestingly enough, just to answer that
question about ethanol, why it got dropped
[SPEAKER_05]: into type 6 is because all the tincture
makers in California, the small scale
[SPEAKER_05]: cottage people that make small scale
products, used ethanol as their extraction
[SPEAKER_05]: device.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like Rick Simpson oil, even though I think
acid naphtha, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: But that same kind of concept where the
state wanted to give those small cottage
[SPEAKER_05]: people a way to extract without having the
safety around a hydrocarbon.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any other questions we're going to wrap
up?
[SPEAKER_05]: In the back there?
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the first part of the question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pusher type centrifuge.
[SPEAKER_05]: Pusher type centrifuge?
[SPEAKER_05]: He's asking, has anyone on the panel used
a pusher type centrifuge?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like a continuous feed, horizontal
extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like a decanting centrifuge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've heard that they leave way too much
ethanol in the biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to mill down to extremely fine
particle size.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you don't, you'll have flowing
problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it's too fine, you'll have caking
issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're also breaking open the cell
wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're extracting a lot of things that
you don't want to extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I've heard that the people that have
gone towards a decanter centrifuge have
[SPEAKER_01]: actually been regretting those decisions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Decanter or pusher type?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they are different.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the pusher type.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pusher type centrifuge to give reference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big spinning drum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: White board.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of those decanting centrifuges
that are being used right now,
[SPEAKER_04]: they're kind of made popular, I think,
probably by Deutsche.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you guys have all been to Vegas and
stuff, you see them on the floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And anyhow, the reason why I bring that up
is because that's used for the coffee
[SPEAKER_04]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I'm saying is that it's a very
fine material that they use.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it doesn't really feed in the same
way that we feed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The pusher type has essentially a basket
very much like the Delta separator that
[SPEAKER_00]: you're familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there's actually a piston in the back
that pushes everything forward that's
[SPEAKER_00]: stuck to the walls, pulls back,
allows more material to be deposited,
[SPEAKER_00]: and keeps pushing it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Based on the fact that basket type
centrifuges are the industry standard,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would expect it to perform very well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But haven't tried it yet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Boris, have you tried it?
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The short note on that was, didn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all that self-funding.
[SPEAKER_02]: That doesn't mean it won't work,
though.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he lost, apparently, a Honda Civic in
the trade.
[SPEAKER_05]: About $10,000 worth of, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Anybody else got a question they want to
pipe in with before we wrap up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Coming up next is kind of the culmination
of today's event.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's going to be a few of our
machine guys, our tech guys, on the same
[SPEAKER_05]: stage as a few of the doctors that we're
over in and clinical researchers that were
[SPEAKER_05]: over in the other room.
[SPEAKER_05]: And where those two worlds are now
intersecting.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I said before, we've gone through
this wave of cultivation.
[SPEAKER_05]: We've gone through this wave of branding.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now we're getting into this wave of tech
and clinical research, finding out why
[SPEAKER_05]: we're dosing the way we are, what changes
need to get made to that, and what
[SPEAKER_05]: conditions are targeting.
[SPEAKER_05]: And most importantly, the one thing that
almost everybody in this industry forgets,
[SPEAKER_05]: the harmful effects of cannabinoids on the
human body, which come to find out there
[SPEAKER_05]: are some.
[SPEAKER_05]: That people don't talk about.
[SPEAKER_05]: So stay tuned.
[SPEAKER_05]: Give a big round of applause for our
panel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
