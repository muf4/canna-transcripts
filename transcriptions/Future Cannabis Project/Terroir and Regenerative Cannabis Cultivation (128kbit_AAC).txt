[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't know until the last couple of
years that this was even a thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, oh, our resin heads are huge.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it's like, sometimes I see it in
people who live in our, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I don't know what all the factors are.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's just that, if it has to do with
the sun, the soils, some sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: combination of things, maybe because the
UV intensity in our, in our valley area,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like it's just hard to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It could be a lot of factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty intense in the summer,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, but it's almost desert,
like in the valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very interesting because like you go
out on the river plain, we're like kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: right on the edge and yeah, if you go out
there in the middle of the day in the
[SPEAKER_01]: summer, it's like the desert, it feels
like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're on the edge of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're on the edge of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then on the other side of that is a
little more rain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, more on the other, on the coastal
side of the mountain is definitely higher
[SPEAKER_01]: rainfall for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're kind of in a banana belt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's interesting to explore.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many, there's a lot of
variables we'd have to really examine to
[SPEAKER_04]: know for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it's cultivar specific
because we have seen the same cultivars,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, they're not necessarily looked
that way when other people have done the
[SPEAKER_04]: same exact cutting or seed stock or
anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not necessarily that, but I think
it must be a combination of things,
[SPEAKER_04]: not one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think there's one reason why that
happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of it, you know,
has to do with the natural farming too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think cannabis likes being farmed this
way, you know, and I think it responds to
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I have it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think, you know, likes being farmed
naturally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've noticed with a lot of the natural
farmers, they have their weed is like an
[SPEAKER_01]: expression of their place in a different
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like there's a lot of the weed that is
just like, oh, this is commercial weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: But everybody who does natural farming,
there's like something special about it
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's their connection to their
land and it's their own unique creativity.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the thing is there's a lot of style
to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, there's a lot of art to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, I mean, you're not, you're never
going to see the same thing twice in any
[SPEAKER_04]: performance and the flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: They just have their performance too and
we're just collaborating with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But ultimately when you're really letting
the flowers and the biological
[SPEAKER_04]: intelligence of the soil and of the land
express itself, then I mean, amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: things keep happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're evolving for us to select from
their amazingness, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: So like we're just the people at the end
of the day that get to be like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, I want that one, I want that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're the ones really dictating
their own evolution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people are really, we're seeing a lot
of amazing test results coming from
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative farms too, you know,
like where it's like 30 plus percent or
[SPEAKER_01]: like total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, like TFC.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also like very high total
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, above 35 total cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 8 or 10 percent other BPHC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what I noticed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then like really interesting terpene
profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And high numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's like one thing I noticed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't get off my farm much, but when I
go to different events, like I don't like
[SPEAKER_00]: the commercial events, but if I do go to
them, the product's a lot more similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I think is super cool,
the wonderful things I learn and the
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderful conversations I have are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: But something cool is like these,
like you guys are saying about like in the
[SPEAKER_00]: more than natural farming community,
you have this like, oh, this is this
[SPEAKER_00]: random cross off my hill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like my neighbor's dad like worked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I've been working with it for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I don't know, but that's just
really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have these really crazy different
experiences.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the tie to that is super,
super cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and then the stories that go with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like some of the varieties, I'm sure you
see it in your local region, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe some older, like, legacy farmers
that are like, hey, we have these.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like that's where the best things have
come from.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've worked with this, you know,
stuff that has been handed down.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a long time and it's been a lot
of people's hands and work.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not like, and even the people who
really were like the keepers of the lines
[SPEAKER_04]: and the breeders, the elders, the older
generation that brought a lot of these
[SPEAKER_04]: seeds out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Hills and started working with
them.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know, they had tons of people that
were instrumental in helping them acquire
[SPEAKER_04]: all these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, none of us did it alone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like the library that we hold today that
we're working with is an extreme privilege
[SPEAKER_04]: and honor to be working with.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you know, it is like, it took so many
people's hands along the way to,
[SPEAKER_04]: to bring a catalog of genetics together
like that and to take the time Don't hit
[SPEAKER_01]: it like a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to sit there like brandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like a scotcher.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's, you know, it's, it's very
special to the cultural heritage of all of
[SPEAKER_04]: these different little regions in the
triangle, especially is all of the stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: that we've been keeping as communities,
you know, and in circles of friends and
[SPEAKER_04]: family and sharing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, and so now this whole, you know,
explosion of like everything that's
[SPEAKER_04]: happening with genetics and with
technology and just in all realms,
[SPEAKER_04]: even aside from cannabis, but here we are
the keepers of all of this biodiversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, there's people like us all over
the world who are cannabis, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know what you would call us,
but with all seeds, with all biodiversity
[SPEAKER_01]: plants, something that we're going to lose
if we let another generation go by.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we don't try and keep this
information.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we didn't, we didn't grow up,
you know, like doing this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our grandparents did our parents,
like remember their grandparents stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like it's, it's almost lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I always have the memories of
like the tomatoes that I ate when I was
[SPEAKER_02]: little.
[SPEAKER_02]: The strawberries that I ate when I was
little had more flavor.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the thing that's really interesting
is, you know, with biodynamic farming and
[SPEAKER_01]: so when Rudolf Steiner gave his lectures,
they were having these concerns in,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the twenties, you know, and that was a
hundred years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's concerning synthetic
fertilizers were first coming in and that
[SPEAKER_01]: was before even synthetic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was when they were starting to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Industrialization is in a big shift in how
they were, how they were providing their
[SPEAKER_04]: fertility.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were start when they first started
outsourcing fertility and changing the way
[SPEAKER_04]: they were raising animals and not keeping
that system integrated and monocropping
[SPEAKER_02]: and separating fertility means.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in traditional natural farming methods,
your fertility is coming from the land.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's basically you're taking all the
manures and wastes and byproducts of all
[SPEAKER_04]: the living things on the land and things
that fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all that goes into the soil as waste.
[SPEAKER_04]: The soil consumes it and makes it
available as nutrition for the next
[SPEAKER_04]: generation of seeds to grow.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's a closed system of fertility or
an integrated cycle that all works
[SPEAKER_04]: together so that you don't have to spend
money or go outside of your immediate
[SPEAKER_04]: locality to source your fertility.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's renewable, but we changed the way we
farmed about a hundred years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was essentially peasant farming,
you know, and, and it really wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily fair for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, we've gone through a lot
of different, different issues with like
[SPEAKER_01]: people's rights and stuff where we've gone
away from peasant farming too,
[SPEAKER_01]: but for the health, and how we need to be
feeding ourselves and working with the
[SPEAKER_01]: land, like that kind of farming is in tune
with nature and it's connected.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's actually how we evolved from
nature, you know, and it's our,
[SPEAKER_01]: what we're supposed to be doing with
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're very machine oriented.
[SPEAKER_01]: Daniel from Radical Herbs gave a really
awesome biodynamics talk yesterday and he
[SPEAKER_01]: was talking about some of the Steiner
concepts about how it's very mineral
[SPEAKER_01]: oriented and we're so obsessed with
machines and making machines to do
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not connected with the natural world
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, when we do connect with
the natural world, amazing things start to
[SPEAKER_01]: happen that we, we see them happening
without science to explain it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when we bring science in to
explain it, it's like, well, we maybe,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, we maybe understand a little bit
more about what's happening, but we're
[SPEAKER_01]: just, science is just there to explain the
phenomena.
[SPEAKER_01]: The phenomena is a mystery and when we
participate with the mystery, then the
[SPEAKER_01]: magic happens and science is like,
oh, let's take some observations on that
[SPEAKER_01]: magic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause like, we've, we've been doing this,
like, and we've been finding like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, we didn't know we could grow weed
that tested like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: We weren't really thinking about the
testing, but that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like, we didn't know that when we
picked the trichomes at that ripeness,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, when you, we had somebody out who
takes very, very, very macro photos and
[SPEAKER_01]: that are like every five microns,
he has a picture in focus and a trichome
[SPEAKER_01]: is, you know, like 73 to 190 or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean what they look like when
they're actually ripe.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just like, I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you see indoor trichomes and
they're just these clear, plain,
[SPEAKER_01]: bland little, little things, you know?
[SPEAKER_02]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, most,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't really run into a lot of indoor
hydro growers here, honestly, but usually
[SPEAKER_01]: we just, I like to smoke, like we like to
show people each other's weed,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And cause people love weed and you know,
I don't usually talk shit to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm nice about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I have my convictions and was
like, you know, to each their own,
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't really feel like, like I'm into my
thing and you can be into your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But usually people are, it's, I like it
when I talk to a hydro grower and they're
[SPEAKER_01]: like, whoa, your weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, this is my full term
outdoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I made everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't, you know, like we still buy
animal feed, but aside from that,
[SPEAKER_01]: we try to really be conscious about like
everything being crafted to go,
[SPEAKER_01]: that goes into it and making our own
compost all the way to all our own
[SPEAKER_01]: fertilizers and vinegars and various
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: The compost making is, we kind of,
we do by more by the biodynamic guidelines
[SPEAKER_01]: with the preps and, and so we've been
practicing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's just refining and getting
better at that and building piles of
[SPEAKER_01]: layers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, but what I've been experimenting with
more lately is our rainwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pond, which is like an open reservoir.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we had, we did some like water
testing and we found it has above adequate
[SPEAKER_01]: phosphorus.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have like a high bat population that
comes every night and eats the mosquitoes
[SPEAKER_01]: that grow, you know, so we're,
we're trying to create like an ecosystem
[SPEAKER_01]: with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They fly over the, over the pond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're trying to use, we're trying
to use the pond.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're like realizing we can use this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not necessarily an aquaponics system,
but it's kind of like, it's a,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's like a, it's kind of like
aquaponics because we have a lot of frogs.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lot of, you know, we're
encouraging it to be, habitat,
[SPEAKER_01]: although we're not necessarily supposed
to, like I feel like according to the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations, you know, like I don't care.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing something good with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's both.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, that's me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bullfrog management plan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is, yeah, this is a little bit,
a little bit different, but just in
[SPEAKER_00]: general is that you can make habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't take it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where it gets very difficult in
terms of using our water source.
[SPEAKER_00]: I assume that this is like not in any way,
shape and in-stream pond that you guys
[SPEAKER_00]: know.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's solely, sole origin is like the
catchment surfaces of our buildings.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but that being said, we're,
we're trying to create this, we're trying
[SPEAKER_01]: to use this stored water to create benefit
to the whole landscape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're bringing in bats.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're bringing in yellow-legged frogs,
which are a threatened species.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they might be listed as endangered
soon, but they're, they're everywhere all
[SPEAKER_01]: over our place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that that's beautiful, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we bring in the green heron and
the blue heron comes sometimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and so this year, what we want to do
is when we go do willow, get our willow
[SPEAKER_01]: for basket making, and we're going to keep
them supple in the pond.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're basically using that to make a
big willow tee that we're watering over
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole garden.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're using these, combining all of
these different things to like make more
[SPEAKER_01]: fertility and make more abundance,
not just for us, but for, for everybody,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, not so, you know, other farmers,
but also like the plants and animals that
[SPEAKER_01]: live, live around us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's been really cool to see stuff
start to really explode after we've been
[SPEAKER_01]: at it for a few years.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I really like what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a cat, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you can touch it the right way.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, exactly.
