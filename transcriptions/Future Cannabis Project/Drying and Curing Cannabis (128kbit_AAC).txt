[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of my passion is in farming and
teaming with microbes and you know and
[SPEAKER_02]: just the love that cannabis gives you back
when you give it love is just so
[SPEAKER_02]: empowering you know and you see it come
out and but but it's fascinating with your
[SPEAKER_02]: dry and curing because you put such a long
period of time and energy and effort and
[SPEAKER_02]: love and intention into growing a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's so fascinating how in the last week
of harvest and like dry and curing you can
[SPEAKER_02]: take your like A++ and turn it into C and
it smell like hay you know and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: fascinating how perishable of a plant
cannabis is really when it comes down to
[SPEAKER_02]: it because there's so much on how you set
up the drying and curing you know it
[SPEAKER_02]: almost you know puts you I mean because if
you bag plant you know if it gets crispy
[SPEAKER_02]: and dry on the outside and yet there's
tons of moisture in the middle and you bag
[SPEAKER_02]: everything up too soon and then like you
just let it sit for too long and all of a
[SPEAKER_02]: sudden the moisture just bombs and kills
and it smells like hay from then on you
[SPEAKER_02]: can't really do much to get it back up
well you can do certain things and you
[SPEAKER_02]: know re drip and re-moisturize it but it's
just it's amazing how how much how big of
[SPEAKER_02]: a hit you take.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got multiples there it's hilarious
because it's like you've got multiples and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're playing around with the moisture
content it's like you know you have from
[SPEAKER_01]: from whole plant to hanger to buck down
you have paper you have plastic you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like you know eventually someday
we'll have glass and curing you know I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't know anybody that's doing all jar
curing yet but but I do know that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like when I'm taking you know when
I'm taking my A++ right and I'm hanging it
[SPEAKER_01]: just being present in the dry room right
daily just going in the the cannabis that
[SPEAKER_01]: I leave for a week and come back you know
like because it's like it's inconvenient
[SPEAKER_01]: for me to get to that space you know like
I'll have someone else when I go and check
[SPEAKER_01]: that cannabis turns out to be a much less
of a quality the cannabis like cure on
[SPEAKER_01]: site well I'm able to check daily and I'm
able to adjust you know fan speed or you
[SPEAKER_01]: know run the D hum for the first day and
then you know and then and then take the D
[SPEAKER_01]: hum out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well it's the thing it's such an involved
process you can't just it's not you know
[SPEAKER_01]: you can't just like throw it on where I
was supposed to check out you know and
[SPEAKER_01]: then and then you know and then six days
later seven days later depending on you
[SPEAKER_01]: know if I'm in all wood or if there's some
plastic involvement if you know whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: it is with the ventilation system like
it's like you know let's just call it six
[SPEAKER_01]: days and buck it all down in the paper
right and then go up into the attic and
[SPEAKER_01]: then and then you know have it all curing
up my out of it my daughter's room during
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest season smells like freaking you
know it smells like better than my outdoor
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it's because it's all the outdoor
in in paper bags in in the attic you know
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's like and it's right next to their
room so it's like but then I take you know
[SPEAKER_01]: so I can take an entire harvest and put it
in you know and then lay it out on all the
[SPEAKER_01]: floors and it cures and then I take it out
of there dump it back into plastic you
[SPEAKER_01]: know saying and then get you know and then
get it you know then get it trimmed and
[SPEAKER_01]: then you know and then gets trimmed from
there and sometimes the trim goes back in
[SPEAKER_01]: the paper you know saying before then it
goes into turkeys and sealed up and and
[SPEAKER_02]: and how is it being trimmed so many people
will just like fucking hack at it you know
[SPEAKER_01]: or put it through trim machines every day
I gotta watch I gotta watch the trimmer
[SPEAKER_01]: like hey listen I like those calyxes
they're my friends you know please respect
[SPEAKER_01]: outside looking at that every day you see
in the development watching the hairs
[SPEAKER_01]: ripen like all the watching the trichome
development watching it all right you need
[SPEAKER_01]: to express itself to its fullest I don't
take pictures of developing tribe and
[SPEAKER_01]: trichomes and show them off because I want
you to knock them off with a pair of
[SPEAKER_01]: fiskars you know it's like you know so
yeah so like being present watching them
[SPEAKER_02]: do and you know it gives me so many ways
to it repetition repetition repetition one
[SPEAKER_02]: of my friends one of the most meticulous
kind of a dry cure guys I've ever met dude
[SPEAKER_02]: Morgan amazing dude named John green Bodhi
this dude you know intentional
[SPEAKER_02]: horticulturist you know very on the
organics vibe anyway he he's got one of
[SPEAKER_02]: the best cure jobs that I've ever seen and
and he's like he gets so pissed at
[SPEAKER_02]: trimmers and people if they do it
improperly you know because of you know
[SPEAKER_02]: the whole thing the work all that you know
and and you know one time you know I was
[SPEAKER_02]: helping him move some of his herb way back
in the day and took his fire pound of his
[SPEAKER_02]: and you know like so many farmers do I
took the turkey bag and I went and just
[SPEAKER_02]: you know like cuz you know and he chapped
me so hard and from that moment I learned
[SPEAKER_02]: and I chapped everybody from now on that
that went that because it's like it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: dude each time that you're opening a bag
to like take a look at and smell and then
[SPEAKER_02]: you just you're just compacted you're just
ripping yeah well and you're just ripping
[SPEAKER_02]: all the buds off or all the trikes off
buds you know that are like you come
[SPEAKER_02]: against each other just so you could take
a look at it and it's just amazing how how
[SPEAKER_02]: quick that degrades a pound and how quick
the bag appeal after six people doing that
[SPEAKER_02]: you know kind of changes you know and it's
like you know respect to the trike dude
[SPEAKER_01]: you know it's like do no harm that's such
a brokering technique too because we're
[SPEAKER_01]: all standing around in the quarters that
somebody somebody somebody throws us like
[SPEAKER_01]: ten bags of OG we want to pick the one
that we like and then we're done with it
[SPEAKER_01]: we like to just suck it all out spin it
twist it hand it back you're done and it
[SPEAKER_01]: looks like here look there's no oxygen in
there so that you're it's gonna store
[SPEAKER_01]: better that's the thought you know it's
like no actually that's not like we're
[SPEAKER_01]: actually you know butchering yeah
bludgeoning you're bludgeoning the trikes
[SPEAKER_01]: dude the best person if anybody wants to
like get schooled on your curing invite
[SPEAKER_01]: Frenchy into your into your room right
it's like he does our he does all of our
[SPEAKER_01]: hash some of our hash and you know he's
there he's there for foreign development
[SPEAKER_01]: flower development all the way till he
picks his date based on what he sees what
[SPEAKER_01]: week six and then he'll come out for two
weeks you know on a date where he feels
[SPEAKER_01]: like if we cure properly and he'll run our
stuff that's not it's not done well just
[SPEAKER_01]: because he wants to do you know he just
wants the relationship wants to do it but
[SPEAKER_01]: I could tell he'd rather be doing
something else it's like he's not afraid
[SPEAKER_01]: to tell you you're curing like shit so
tell me some of what he's saying or some
[SPEAKER_03]: of the stuff he's educated you on in terms
of like as a hash maker like what he's
[SPEAKER_01]: looking at as these plants dry and cure I
mean you know it's it's like he's a fine
[SPEAKER_01]: China dealer right so it's like he's less
involved in the specifics around
[SPEAKER_01]: ventilation humidity control things of
that nature like I mean ideally I think we
[SPEAKER_01]: would all be in stone floor wood wall
buildings or even cob building I think
[SPEAKER_01]: ideally in his world we would all be
bundling everything and then just like
[SPEAKER_01]: setting it like away from everything with
like very minimal airflow and then going
[SPEAKER_01]: back and beating it on sieve on sieve tray
you know like and then just beating the
[SPEAKER_01]: living shit out of it and scoop sweeping
and scooping I mean if I see if that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's where you see him get passionate
right he's I mean yes he respects flower
[SPEAKER_01]: but he doesn't he's he wants to try he
respects what he's like oh that's really
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty but he is a he's gonna what he
wants to be the one that brutalizes
[SPEAKER_01]: attractor supper yeah he wants to be the
one that does it he wants as many of them
[SPEAKER_01]: as possible in one area to go through that
process so it's it's when he's walking
[SPEAKER_01]: through the rooms we want to do anything
he's like don't touch that don't walk
[SPEAKER_01]: there you know turn that fan around you
know don't you like like like these are
[SPEAKER_01]: things you saying you know basically you
want it to develop just like that nobody
[SPEAKER_01]: touch don't throw it into totes you know
he calls trimmer stupid you know you're
[SPEAKER_01]: like all the time us stupid you know like
you know he gets really frustrated when he
[SPEAKER_01]: looks at the trim bins and he sees all
that you know he's like he thinks it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: way wrong yeah and you know in so many
ways to it's funny how like you know the
[SPEAKER_02]: art of the you know hashishin you know
kind of like frenchies but but the heart
[SPEAKER_02]: of the farmer you know it's just that all
the intuitive things that we've come upon
[SPEAKER_02]: you know figuring out almost intuitively
from this relationship of the plan and the
[SPEAKER_02]: plan almost communicating with us and
teaching us these things because like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: I find it really fascinating because now
science is around you know testing and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're able to help substantiate or qualify
these certain aspects you know it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: then almost just like that much more
proving like why people figured it out all
[SPEAKER_02]: along long ago in this certain way you
know and and you know it's it's it's it's
[SPEAKER_02]: a trip because like cannabis with terpenes
you know there's you know we test actually
[SPEAKER_02]: that's we test for about 34 different
terpenes but but what we see of you know
[SPEAKER_02]: of all those terpenes we only really ever
see between five to nine of them ever show
[SPEAKER_02]: up in any real amount and and of the nine
there's only really like three or four
[SPEAKER_02]: that ever show up as the dominant or
co-dominant terpene and then some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: other ones will be there in very small
secondary tertiary amounts but what we're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about like is like and there's and
there's two different types of terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: right there's the mono terpenes and
sesquiterpenes right and so the difference
[SPEAKER_02]: really is the mono terpenes boil off at
much lower temperatures as opposed to
[SPEAKER_02]: sesquiterpenes would boil off at higher
temperatures and so so with the mono
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes those are the ones that are there
in the most amounts in any really given
[SPEAKER_02]: any given strain so you know so you're
talking about limonene you're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about pionene you're talking about
turpinoline so so so turpinoline is the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpene high in like Jack and train rack
and sage Durbin Zeta you know a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: those kind of like quote sativa type
strains you know and that's predominantly
[SPEAKER_02]: turpinoline and then there's little other
terpenes but predominantly turpinoline and
[SPEAKER_02]: then and so then you have the you have
myrcine also as a mono terpene and you
[SPEAKER_02]: have linalool which is lavender as a
terpene but but the so all those terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: which are the ones that ever show up as
the primary secondary terpene you know
[SPEAKER_02]: they are the ones that go away and
volatile eyes at the quickest whenever you
[SPEAKER_02]: know you're introducing them to prolong
like improper heating kind of what have
[SPEAKER_02]: you you know it's like drying in a barn
you know that's super hot and unable to
[SPEAKER_02]: keep control temperature and humidity you
can just immediately drop so much turbines
[SPEAKER_02]: and your sesquiterpenes like beta-carotene
and humaline will then kind of concentrate
[SPEAKER_02]: while the other ones are boiling off so
you can almost alter the turf profile of
[SPEAKER_02]: the archetype of a strain you know through
kind of improper drying curing because
[SPEAKER_02]: then all of a sudden like say the you know
if it's if it's like you know you know
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah like Dutch treat or something which
is like you know turpinoline and little
[SPEAKER_02]: like beta-carotene all of a sudden it
could become turpinoline and like almost
[SPEAKER_02]: equal amount of beta-carotene you know and
and so it's just in the process of drying
[SPEAKER_02]: curing you know you can very significantly
alter the expression of what the plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be just from you know slightly
and as you said so it's like it's all it's
[SPEAKER_01]: all of it you you you you
