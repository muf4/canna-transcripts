[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the most ancient device to
smoke hash that is known basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we did a mixture today of a little
bit of tobacco and a hash made from
[SPEAKER_01]: sunbolt farms grown in Humboldt dry farmed
sunshine Johnson yeah so did the rebel
[SPEAKER_01]: moon for this and then Craig from alpine
glow did the THC bomb these are both
[SPEAKER_01]: regenerative farms which for me and my
data topped yield and THC and cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: content so it's a huge proof that you
don't need inputs you don't need chemicals
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you just work with nature you can
produce the most fire no sorry no
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial synthetic inputs no it's like
sunshine sunshine she is in a very
[SPEAKER_00]: specific place where she can do dry
farming it's not dry farming that define
[SPEAKER_00]: quality she's she's into in osmosis with a
place where she is growing and she's using
[SPEAKER_00]: that ability to limit totally the water
input so that the the plant have to kick
[SPEAKER_00]: into her defensive system and produce a
lot of resin to protect from dehydration
[SPEAKER_01]: basically so yeah so this is the third
this is the fourth year we're doing on the
[SPEAKER_01]: same exact spot but also to make people
kind of understand so it's a flood zone
[SPEAKER_01]: that place floods every 50 years it's
underwater it's also right in between the
[SPEAKER_01]: Avenue of the Giants which are some of the
biggest plants and the biggest respiratory
[SPEAKER_01]: they're breathing all the time and they're
blowing they're blowing so much moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout that valley in the morning that
yes they're doing your watering for you so
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not like people say oh how can you
grow plants without water it's not without
[SPEAKER_02]: water so when you say what's average use
for cannabis you're really talking through
[SPEAKER_00]: your head because there's no average use
for no it all depends it all depends on
[SPEAKER_02]: the long potential so she's got redwood
air where I grow I have Doug fir air right
[SPEAKER_02]: Doug fir and oak air and so I think that
makes a difference so you're gonna the
[SPEAKER_00]: beauty of India that was the first time
where it's spiritual so and this is a
[SPEAKER_02]: brand new chillum right now blessings on
the chillum so here we go thank you
[SPEAKER_02]: Frenchy wow
[SPEAKER_00]: was a big deal in India because when you
dedicate the chillum to the to the God
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a lot of awareness that come to
what you're doing like that the panel last
[SPEAKER_00]: night we're talking about making the tea
in India when you smoke it's a wall it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: big deal and there are all sorts of
details about details about the ritual see
[SPEAKER_02]: normally just for next place normally the
chillum always goes to the right and you
[SPEAKER_02]: pass with your right hand you only take
with your right hand and so on but Frenchy
[SPEAKER_02]: out of honor to me passed it this way and
then you have to say Kali chillum which is
[SPEAKER_01]: the feminine energy going to the left side
but it's it was all unsaid but he I
[SPEAKER_02]: realized he did it and I realize why he
did it too oh look at that stone there's
[SPEAKER_02]: two done from Franco all of them I don't
know the whole lineage of the chillum
[SPEAKER_02]: thing was there a Lorenzo too or not no
who is that that that first guy was Renzo
[SPEAKER_00]: and does anyone still have a Renzo chillum
no my mind was broken but it was funny
[SPEAKER_00]: because I'm the first second the first
year I was in a mountain we were lucky to
[SPEAKER_00]: meet a good friend of my best friend that
that spent some time in Colombia and the
[SPEAKER_00]: friends guys they were with a guy had been
15 years in a mountain and he was buying
[SPEAKER_00]: all the best of the best in Tosh and
Naktang so for three weeks I saw a lot of
[SPEAKER_00]: ash come in front of my nose and the
lesson I took from it you want jungle Tosh
[SPEAKER_00]: and Naktang you want cultivated Malana so
the second year I send my best friend to
[SPEAKER_00]: get some field as far away from the
village as possible in in Malana Valley
[SPEAKER_00]: and and I want to do the jungle in Tosh
and Naktang for three weeks alone when I
[SPEAKER_00]: came down I stayed a night in Pulga with
an Italian house and that Italian dude was
[SPEAKER_00]: burning chillum was burning chillum in
oven and in the morning and I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: really understand how special it was to
share my own jungle I didn't get release I
[SPEAKER_00]: didn't understand the value people put
into the chill the quality of your chillum
[SPEAKER_00]: and the quality of your raising that
defined the respect that you receive so
[SPEAKER_00]: because I cracked up my jungle all night
long with him in the morning he fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: gave me a chillum but I didn't know that
dude so when arrive in Manicaram and I
[SPEAKER_00]: broke my chillum with a bunch of Italians
they look at me like I had fucking stole
[SPEAKER_00]: the piece you know what I mean because
that guy literally changed totally what
[SPEAKER_00]: chillum was in India he used three
different type of clay this is a very
[SPEAKER_02]: important part of any chillum smoking you
want to clean it right because that's
[SPEAKER_02]: another thing they look at your chillum
they pull up the chillum is this chillum
[SPEAKER_02]: clean is this dude clean right isn't that
right it's part of the ritual and so on
[SPEAKER_00]: you look how fine the polish is inside the
chillum it has to be like a mirror but
[SPEAKER_00]: it's porous so it's going to absorb a lot
of the tar from it no it's all clay it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all clay often two three four different
type of clay yeah it absorb you want that
[SPEAKER_02]: absorption but see this is the high art
this is the high art of chillum making you
[SPEAKER_02]: see because you can get these little
throwaway chillums all over the place that
[SPEAKER_01]: are little tiny one to one or two people
chillums yeah that's true that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: status in California somebody will drop
four or five thousand ten thousand dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: on something they can dab with I suppose
yeah in India in India or Italy it's all
[SPEAKER_00]: about the chillum like what maker they
don't give you that chillum to smoke when
[SPEAKER_00]: they look at your ash they don't know you
you need never touch that chillum it's
[SPEAKER_00]: like and when you're new in India you
don't understand that the wall respect
[SPEAKER_00]: that you receive it's a chillum you have
in your hand and the quality of the resin
[SPEAKER_00]: you put in even 15 20 years old people in
in India if you have the goods they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to give you respect doesn't matter
how long you've been in India if you don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have it they don't even give you the time
of the day I swear it's not very nice
[SPEAKER_02]: actually they are not really welcoming
well it's the caste system yeah
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah you gotta you gotta earn your credits
no question about it but that's the thing
[SPEAKER_01]: going up to India like how hardcore is it
to go up into the mountains like I've got
[SPEAKER_00]: lost there before it's like you live in
the cave for months the closest shop is
[SPEAKER_00]: like today's walk the closest bath is
today's walk hot spring and you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: bring all your shit and it's crazy you
have to be crazy crazy crazy about raising
[SPEAKER_00]: quality to put yourself through that type
of shit then it's at the at the before the
[SPEAKER_00]: winter if you get stuck in Malana with the
snow and there is one pass at 12,000 feet
[SPEAKER_00]: when you have that pass and you have like
snow up to your your tight and the shitty
[SPEAKER_00]: basket all and plastic bag to stay you
know I mean it's your you can kill
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself you have to be now that I think
of it with such a stepping back so far
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like I was insane to do shit like
that but it's the best time in my life
[SPEAKER_02]: I was in Nepal and I went from Pokhara to
Kathmandu and I had to walk about
[SPEAKER_02]: two-thirds of the way right just making
the road and at one point it's like
[SPEAKER_02]: barefoot you're walking along this thing
and you're just out of the village and no
[SPEAKER_02]: one speaks English for like whatever right
[SPEAKER_00]: they were moving from EP to Tracker like
they changed my visa I was going to change
[SPEAKER_00]: my third month visa I was supposed to pay
30 rupees they wanted 3,000 rupees
[SPEAKER_02]: the first time I went to Nepal I believe
was 70 70 we I was working on a movie
[SPEAKER_02]: called Sunseed and we were filming various
teachers around so we went and filmed at
[SPEAKER_02]: the swayambu right we filmed the Rinpoche
at swayambu with the long trumpets like
[SPEAKER_02]: that and they're doing this snapping thing
and they're chanting this amazing chant
[SPEAKER_02]: and pouring tea it's up on top of the hill
there and then I went back a year later
[SPEAKER_02]: but I went over land from from Amsterdam
right all the way up to Nepal again and
[SPEAKER_02]: then I had a house in back of swayambu and
I stayed there for about three months
[SPEAKER_02]: there and every day around the temple you
know around the hill swayambu hill right
[SPEAKER_02]: and yeah I wasn't really into the hash at
the point it was just there I wasn't like
[SPEAKER_02]: you I wasn't seeking out that most rare
extreme place I was there just to be
[SPEAKER_02]: sitting and painting and being and
meditating
