[SPEAKER_04]: We've got an all-star panel packed up
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a testing facility owner.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a doctor actually representing
patients for the first time, I think,
[SPEAKER_04]: in probably a year.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we have the owner of Carrova,
which, according to BDS Analytics,
[SPEAKER_04]: is the number one selling edible at the
moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Congratulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have Andrew D'Angelo of Harborside.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Flourish and Andy D'Amico,
who is a cultivator in Monterey County.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of these business owners have
different types of vertical integration.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to touch a little bit on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But first, I'm going to let each speaker
introduce themselves.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Don Land.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a chief scientific consultant at Steep
Hill Labs.
[SPEAKER_09]: I started off with a competing lab.
[SPEAKER_09]: We merged in 2013.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been in the business since 2010.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also a professor of chemistry,
forensic science, and biotechnology at UC
[SPEAKER_09]: Davis, where I still have graduate
students doing research not on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I'm required by the university to tell
you that I'm not here representing the
[SPEAKER_09]: university on cannabis, because they still
have an ancient approach to that.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm here representing Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Dr. John Talleyrand, founder of
Medican.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in the business for 14 years
now, feeling old.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our doctors have had over half a million
visits in these 14 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've learned a lot from the patients who
are suffering and getting better from the
[SPEAKER_03]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I definitely would like to represent
their force here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Danny Noonan.
[SPEAKER_07]: I do Carova.
[SPEAKER_07]: We produce and distribute edibles and
flour all over the state of California.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've been doing it about eight,
nine years now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And apparently, I'm doing pretty good,
according to BDS Analytics.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Andrew D'Angelo, one of the founders
of Harborside.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a dispensary here in San Jose,
one in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have a farm in Monterey County.
[SPEAKER_08]: Andy D'Amico, founder, owner of
Daydreamers Medicinals and Pacific Reserve
[SPEAKER_08]: Nursery, which is a large farm in Monterey
County.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm Jackie McGowan.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't even introduce myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am the director of local licensing and
business development at K Street
[SPEAKER_04]: Consulting in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also run a Facebook group called
California City and County Regulation
[SPEAKER_04]: Watch.
[SPEAKER_04]: We currently have 7,000 members that all
reside in the state of California.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was important to me when I started
the group.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we debate regulations every day.
[SPEAKER_04]: All day.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a very active, busy group.
[SPEAKER_04]: You may have to have me add you,
because I do believe Facebook is shadow
[SPEAKER_04]: banning my group at the moment,
just like they're shadow banning the
[SPEAKER_04]: Bureau.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't feel like I'm alone there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to do something a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the way that Lori ran the panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want to talk a little bit about each
of the panel members up here's past.
[SPEAKER_04]: The topic today is the path forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think that we can actually
assess the path forward without touching a
[SPEAKER_04]: little bit about where each of these
gentlemen have come from.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I have heard Don's name in the
marketplace for a very long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm definitely curious how you made the
jump from being a UC Davis researcher into
[SPEAKER_04]: the cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you know, it was pretty simple.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was a local entrepreneur that wanted
to open something in Davis.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had a mutual friend.
[SPEAKER_09]: He approached me, hired me as a consultant
originally.
[SPEAKER_09]: It grew into much more of an interest for
me.
[SPEAKER_09]: We got a person, Reverend Dr. Kim Ron De
Caesar involved, who's been doing terpene
[SPEAKER_09]: rich herbal medicines for 50 years.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's basically what cannabis is,
a terpene rich herbal medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: You may think of it differently,
but ultimately that's what you get.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so he was he was incredibly
knowledgeable of how other terpene rich
[SPEAKER_09]: medicinal plants were being used and
regulated and tested, mostly in Europe,
[SPEAKER_09]: because the United States doesn't do a
whole lot of that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we set out with the goal of at that
time, nobody was requiring testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: There were maybe a half a dozen testing,
cannabis testing labs in the world.
[SPEAKER_09]: And our goal was to make sure that every
patient and consumer now was able to get
[SPEAKER_09]: tested medicine that they knew was safe
and effective and it had the right stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of the early examples that I can tell
you, we had a mother of one of these
[SPEAKER_09]: Dravet syndrome's children who had figured
out that high CBD was working for that
[SPEAKER_09]: kid.
[SPEAKER_09]: She got some stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: She brought it into us, said, this is not
working.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was told it was high CBD.
[SPEAKER_09]: We tested it.
[SPEAKER_09]: There was virtually no CBD in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was THC and they were giving this to
their kid.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that really solidified it for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And Jean Talleyrand, I know that I haven't
met you until today, but I've been sending
[SPEAKER_04]: children your way because I had heard in
the marketplace that you were one of the
[SPEAKER_04]: very few doctors that would actually
recommend to a child.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm really happy to meet you and thank
you for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would love to know how you made that
dive when no one else was recommending to
[SPEAKER_04]: kids.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't difficult.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was trained in family medicine at UCSF.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I used to seeing kids have been in the
pediatric emergency room and so kids are
[SPEAKER_03]: patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was looking at this as I started out
in family medicine and kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: transitioned being in San Francisco to
complimentary and alternative medicine is
[SPEAKER_03]: there.
[SPEAKER_03]: San Francisco is a diverse place,
the Bay area is, and there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: people using alternatives to your
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I felt my role as a doctor should be
to observe what they're doing and guide
[SPEAKER_03]: them with science rather than say,
no, you have to use a pill or you have to
[SPEAKER_03]: go to surgery.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the only way here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And cannabis was just one of those things
that they were using.
[SPEAKER_03]: I became a believer when patients started
throwing their opiates away in front of me
[SPEAKER_03]: and having struggled with patients seeking
opiates to have them throw them away in
[SPEAKER_03]: front of me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he just convinced me that this was
truly a gift to us and we should exploit
[SPEAKER_03]: it as that and have a lot of people
benefit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I've seen a lot of, not a lot,
a handful of kids go through using
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis with the ups and downs that Don
described and very excited to see more
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation here, but also concerned that
access has come down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are patients suffering again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Danny, this industry is incredibly
flexible and is remarkably able to pivot
[SPEAKER_04]: on a dime.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the regulations changed in 2017,
prohibiting your number one edible
[SPEAKER_04]: product, the thousand milligram edible,
you pivoted and were able to become
[SPEAKER_04]: currently the largest edible selling
company in the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would love to know how you did that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It wasn't easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, everybody's on an even playing
field right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And as hard as it was to see the high
potency go away, I mean, I had,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, medicinal patients that were
using high potency edibles to do things I
[SPEAKER_07]: get off of opiates.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I had, you know, even kids that,
you know, were using this stuff for very
[SPEAKER_07]: valid medical reasons.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I watched these people turn everything
around.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, unfortunately, I feel like they're
kind of forced into an illicit market or
[SPEAKER_07]: other ways of finding it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And even worse so, even for some of the
veterans that were helped by my high
[SPEAKER_07]: potency edibles, we can't even,
we don't even have a compassion program
[SPEAKER_07]: that I can give them even a hundred
milligram, you know, packages.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's a little unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, in this industry,
you have to be ready to pivot.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, I mean, you do a pivot on
January 1st, you do a pivot on July 1st.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know what kind of pivot we're
going to do on January 1st, 2019.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, you know, you just got to be,
you got to do your best to be ready for
[SPEAKER_07]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And same thing, like I was saying on the
July 1st things, you know, what everybody
[SPEAKER_07]: thought was compliant and then turned out
wasn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: By the time you're putting your tenth
sticker on a package to make it compliant,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, you're going to find a way to do
it right, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it wasn't easy.
[SPEAKER_07]: But we did it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adapt or die.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_06]: Adapt or die.
[SPEAKER_04]: Andrew, I have a tough question for you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I am going to preface this.
[SPEAKER_04]: What did I do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to preface this by saying that I
have nothing but eternal gratitude for
[SPEAKER_04]: Harborside.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am a patient and my father is the one
that convinced me to try cannabis as
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he drove me to Harborside and signed
me up for your CBD class almost five years
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I am, you know, I owe you like so much
for that.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, there's been a lot of industry
rumors and speculation about the CDFA
[SPEAKER_04]: issuing their programmatic EIR in 2017.
[SPEAKER_04]: Contained inside that report was an
implied one acre cap on cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Four days later, the state released their
emergency draft regulations and the one
[SPEAKER_04]: acre cap language was omitted.
[SPEAKER_04]: One month later, your brother published an
op-ed in Leafly arguing in favor of large
[SPEAKER_04]: scale cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it almost read like a confession.
[SPEAKER_04]: During the legislative session of 2017 to
2018, Flourish spent $210,000 lobbying the
[SPEAKER_04]: Department of Consumer Affairs,
the Department of Food and Ag and Bureau
[SPEAKER_04]: of Cannabis Control.
[SPEAKER_04]: Harborside spent another $257,500 during
that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's almost a half a million dollars in
lobbying.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can you tell me how much, if any,
of that money was used to lobby against
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: The one acre cap in the emergency
regulations?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, first let me tell you what we've
done for small farmers over the last 12
[SPEAKER_06]: years at Harborside, because I think a lot
of times when we get into the weeds of an
[SPEAKER_06]: issue like the one acre cap, and Steve has
written that op-ed and, you know,
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't have a whole lot to add to his
statement on the one acre cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're, you know, obviously Flourish is our
company and it does lots of different
[SPEAKER_06]: things besides grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what we've done for small farmers has
been really remarkable over the last 12
[SPEAKER_06]: years because we've been, you know,
as all of us understand, the retail is the
[SPEAKER_06]: end of the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in order for the upstream of the
supply chain to be healthy, you have to
[SPEAKER_06]: have some powerful engines downstream that
are sort of driving throughput,
[SPEAKER_06]: right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So we've done an enormously good job of
doing that with small farmers to the tune
[SPEAKER_06]: of about $200 million that over the last
12 years we've put in the pockets of small
[SPEAKER_06]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not big farmers, not giant companies,
not CVS, not big tobacco, not big alcohol,
[SPEAKER_06]: small farmers, $200 million.
[SPEAKER_06]: They've used that money to grow their
businesses, they've used that money to
[SPEAKER_06]: help their families, raise their kids,
put food on the table.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also have had a program where we've
issued microloans for over 10 years now to
[SPEAKER_06]: small farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not big farms.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't need microloans.
[SPEAKER_06]: Small farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: 10 years ago, that's all there was with
small farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even today, most of our cannabis,
only 10% of our menu is vertically
[SPEAKER_06]: integrated today.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we gave microloans to farmers up to
$50,000 so that they could improve their
[SPEAKER_06]: farms and scale up and grow more cannabis
for us.
[SPEAKER_06]: A lot of those loans were never repaid.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll let everybody know that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we say there's some conspiracy among
small farmers to rip Harborside off?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: We moved on to the next farm knowing full
well that if you're going to microloan,
[SPEAKER_06]: some of those loans are going to fail.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not because the farmer's trying to screw
Harborside.
[SPEAKER_06]: It just failed.
[SPEAKER_06]: It failed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Something happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: It failed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we didn't get paid back.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did we stop doing it?
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Still doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: We also had a program where we gave legal
protection to small farms, not just for
[SPEAKER_06]: transporting, transport docks,
but for the farm itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: To the tune of $25,000 if they got raided
and busted, we would send Henry Wieckowski
[SPEAKER_06]: down, give him $25,000 to protect those
farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: So Harborside's done a lot for the small
farmer.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't believe in the one-acre cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think that's the way to protect
small farms and keep arbitrarily high
[SPEAKER_06]: prices in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to help small farms?
[SPEAKER_06]: Wave the licensing fee for them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Don't charge them any tax or lower the
tax.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lower these barriers to entry where you
have to have a handicapped bathroom on a
[SPEAKER_06]: farm that hasn't had a handicapped person
on it for 50 years.
[SPEAKER_06]: Really?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's lower the barriers to entry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's have a fund.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd gladly give a certain portion of every
dollar that comes across the counter or
[SPEAKER_06]: every dollar that I send to a lobbyist to
answer your question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Gladly give a percentage of that to a fund
that can help small farmers so that they
[SPEAKER_06]: can get licensed or help them if their
farm burns down in a fire.
[SPEAKER_06]: Happens a lot right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: The whole state's burning down.
[SPEAKER_06]: We haven't taken care of our planet.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are the things we've done.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, we don't think the one-acre cap is
the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think we spent any money lobbying
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: It was not really something on our radar.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are only cultivating on three acres on
our farm right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Three acres.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there's more creative ways for
us to empower small farmers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We need a supply chain that has small,
medium, and large producers in it so that
[SPEAKER_06]: we can meet demand and that we can have
innovation.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've been advocating my entire career
for a level playing field, for fairness,
[SPEAKER_06]: and for small family businesses to be able
to keep buttering their bread with this
[SPEAKER_06]: plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I absolutely will continue to fight
for that in my role as among the board of
[SPEAKER_06]: directors of CCIA and as a thought leader
in the industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: And Harborside will keep sourcing from
small producers.
[SPEAKER_06]: We value artists and producers and local
producers, and we use them a lot.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a long-winded way of answering
your question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't feel that the question was
answered, actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea if any of that money went.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not my role at Harborside.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Andy?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes?
[SPEAKER_04]: So when I Googled you, the number two
result that came up was that you're a San
[SPEAKER_04]: Jose firefighter and you were raided in
Santa Cruz County?
[SPEAKER_08]: Monterey County.
[SPEAKER_04]: Monterey County.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: In early 2017.
[SPEAKER_08]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would love to know, you're now a
large-scale cultivator, a nursery owner,
[SPEAKER_04]: an edible maker.
[SPEAKER_04]: How has that arrest hindered you or helped
you to achieve where you're at today?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, first off, it was an arrest,
but I did get raided.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was right when we were in a big
transitional period from small scale
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivation going to large-scale
cultivation, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it was time for them to knock on some
people's doors who were successful in the
[SPEAKER_08]: industry and who were known in the
industry, really.
[SPEAKER_08]: Really, what got me in this industry,
to back it up a little bit, is yeah,
[SPEAKER_08]: I've been a firefighter here, right here
in San Jose downtown.
[SPEAKER_08]: This building is my jurisdiction,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it inside and out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Been a paramedic for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have never had a serious situation from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: 20 years as a paramedic.
[SPEAKER_08]: Alcohol, pharmaceuticals, that's why I
have a job, okay?
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's really what got me in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's an important thing for everybody
to know is 20 years running calls down
[SPEAKER_08]: here in San Jose, I remember one person,
bad experience, on an edible, not caroba,
[SPEAKER_08]: right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Took that patient to the hospital within
an hour, situation handled, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Alcohol, pharmaceuticals, I could go on
forever in regards to that.
[SPEAKER_08]: In regards to me getting raided,
it really allowed me to take it to the
[SPEAKER_08]: next level.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was successful moving forward with the
whole situation, educated myself,
[SPEAKER_08]: never had a charge on me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I had 200,000 square feet of cannabis at
the time in Monterey County.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was out there alongside with Harborside
and we fought that battle.
[SPEAKER_08]: And coming from the fire department,
I always had to hide.
[SPEAKER_08]: Hi, what's going on here?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it really allowed me to take it to the
next level, be on a panel like this and
[SPEAKER_08]: represent the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, in a really positive way.
[SPEAKER_08]: And educated a lot of people, you know,
in regards to what happened, why did I get
[SPEAKER_08]: raided, and how I overcame that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it really allowed me to push it to the
next level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sounds like we got a new social justice
warrior.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So everyone here represents some different
facet of the industry and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: we are in flux at the moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Regs are changing daily and I want to
know, with everyone's experience,
[SPEAKER_04]: what has been your greatest challenge in
2018?
[SPEAKER_09]: 2018, well, category one pesticides has
been a pretty big challenge.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not having an action limit, setting the
limits to be the limits of detection,
[SPEAKER_09]: which are going to be different from
different labs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Means that a really good lab with very
high sensitivities is going to detect
[SPEAKER_09]: those pesticides at much lower limits.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we have lost customers that go to
worse labs who don't detect at those
[SPEAKER_09]: limits.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I've talked to several other labs that
have that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's also an issue because at the limit of
detection, you have your worst signal to
[SPEAKER_09]: noise anywhere else on your operating
curve.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're operating at your limit of
quantitation, you have three or four times
[SPEAKER_09]: the signal to noise that you do at the
limit of detection.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the chance of making a false positive
or a false negative, for that matter,
[SPEAKER_09]: are significantly less.
[SPEAKER_09]: What most and every other analyte on the
list has an action limit.
[SPEAKER_09]: ISO and other accreditation requires that
the lab be able to quantitate at that
[SPEAKER_09]: action limit.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that means you got to have the right
signal to noise.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the way all the other analytes
are doing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the way that category one
pesticides should be.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we've had a battle after battle with
clients and regulators about why that
[SPEAKER_09]: really doesn't work in this kind of a
system.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so that's probably the number one that
I would list is to have an action.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that the state should have
regulated the labs prior to regulating the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, they did at the same time.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how you can do both.
[SPEAKER_09]: So regulators are in a tough position.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I understand so the Department of
Pesticide Regulation really wants to push
[SPEAKER_09]: those limits down as far as they can.
[SPEAKER_09]: Test and cannabis isn't the same as test
and spinach, I'm afraid.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so there's a little more dialogue and
a little less adversarial attitude would
[SPEAKER_09]: be much appreciated from the labs towards
the regulators for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: But in general, they're in a tough spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're learning on the fly.
[SPEAKER_09]: They got a lot of people talking in their
ears, telling them different things.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we're moving forward in a good
way.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I'd say that is probably the biggest
issue that is still on the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gene?
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking for the patients, I would say
their biggest concern is they're happy
[SPEAKER_03]: that regulation is happening so that they
don't buy THC thinking it's CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're upset that the shelves were empty
July 1st and that the transition wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: smoother.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're upset that there's a lot of people
talking about billions of dollars and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're suffering and there's no medicine
for them.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's hard to explain to an elderly person
who's heard about CBD why she can't find
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD on the shelves that's reliable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as she enters into a dispensary,
the staff knows everything about getting
[SPEAKER_03]: high and nothing about helping her
arthritis or her cancer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's tough times for patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: But on the other hand, it's good that
we're regulating.
[SPEAKER_03]: So good and bad.
[SPEAKER_04]: Growing pains.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Danny?
[SPEAKER_07]: I first off would have to defer to,
like the first panel was talking a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: about, the barrier to entry into retailers
and the confusion or whatnot of
[SPEAKER_07]: interpretation of the regs and what is
compliant and what is not.
[SPEAKER_07]: And put a lot of distributors or
manufacturers into a position of trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: give almost legal advice to a retailer
with an asterisk.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not an attorney.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that was tough.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then at the same time, a lot of the
labs, there's obviously been turnaround
[SPEAKER_07]: time issues.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's less than 20 operating in the
state for 500 or so retailers.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's tough.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then just the differences from one lab
to another.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's obviously issues with the
standards that each lab is getting as well
[SPEAKER_07]: as the methodology that each lab is using.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you'll have the same exact sample go to
two different labs, or the same lab for
[SPEAKER_07]: that matter, and get vastly different
results.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that has been the toughest in
this kind of transitional period that
[SPEAKER_07]: we're in has been the labs and the
compliance, you know, interpreting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Andrew?
[SPEAKER_06]: For retail, it's taxes, I would say,
is the biggest pain point for our
[SPEAKER_06]: customers, our patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And just for any heavy consumer of
cannabis, right now the taxes are pretty
[SPEAKER_06]: brutal and most heavy consumers are
probably not in the legal market anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's contrary to what we're all
trying to do here.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's been very counterproductive.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think the local people and the local
control has also been a big, big,
[SPEAKER_06]: big problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: The league of cities and counties,
if anybody is here from that group,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm coming after you, we're coming after
you.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we all are.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll join you in that fight.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wrong, okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't have all this power and all this
taxation and then don't license,
[SPEAKER_06]: don't create ordinances, create these
barriers to entries, and certainly don't
[SPEAKER_06]: do anything on the enforcement side.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think that's also been a very big
problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's probably many others I could
mention, but those two things,
[SPEAKER_06]: have really disrupted, you know,
I'll mention clones.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, clones, the limits on clones
have really torpedoed that business for
[SPEAKER_06]: retailers and that business has either
moved into the gray or black market or
[SPEAKER_06]: gone B2B.
[SPEAKER_06]: For the most part, we're still able to
carry a few for the home growers and for
[SPEAKER_06]: the patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we'll stay committed to doing that,
but it's tough.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's tough to be in the clone business as
a retailer right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say from a cultivation standpoint
is the unknown.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, out in Monterey County,
we started at a tax rate of $15 a square
[SPEAKER_08]: foot.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, a year later, it dropped to
five, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: But for two years, we paid $15 a square
foot, you know, and it really broke a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: of businesses out here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then all of a sudden, it changes to
reality.
[SPEAKER_08]: But in the first place, why did we start?
[SPEAKER_08]: Where did we get that initial number,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had to fight through it and it was
tough, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, testing obviously is tough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Batch testing is tough.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, a 10,000 square foot license,
which produces 2,000 pounds annually,
[SPEAKER_08]: we're having to do 50 tests on the same
batch that I run my same protocols on,
[SPEAKER_08]: my same integrated pest management on,
even the same strain, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: And when we're having to test that one
batch, at 10,000 square feet 50 times,
[SPEAKER_08]: it really creates a big bottleneck,
you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And getting product to market is important
because it has a shelf life, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: So testing variables there has been tough.
[SPEAKER_08]: The unknown's been tough.
[SPEAKER_08]: Connecting local and state regulations has
been tough.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, but we're all pushing forward.
[SPEAKER_08]: I appreciate events like this where we can
all talk about it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Monterey County, we got together.
[SPEAKER_08]: We showed numbers.
[SPEAKER_08]: We trials, tributes, and stuff.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we had to change, which is important
because we don't want to break this
[SPEAKER_08]: business.
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to create it, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And really get product to market,
which is the most important thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I actually do want to second Andrew's
tax comment.
[SPEAKER_07]: That is brutal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even from a manufacturer point of view,
you know, with local governments taking
[SPEAKER_07]: 10% of gross.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, there's not too many businesses
that can do that and sustain that on top
[SPEAKER_07]: of their license costs and everything
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: My biggest concern when the emergency
regulations came out was the July 1st
[SPEAKER_04]: deadline for the M&A marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was so hyper-focused on that that I
just didn't even see the testing
[SPEAKER_04]: bottleneck coming.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a consultant, I was, you know,
really worried that we were going to have
[SPEAKER_04]: an oversupply in the medical market and an
undersupply in the adult use market since
[SPEAKER_04]: that seems to be the way that this is
trending.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now my biggest fear is this December
31st of 2018 phase 3 testing requirements.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I've been really staying on top of the
labs and calling them every week and
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to figure out where the labs are
at.
[SPEAKER_04]: Currently we have 33 licensed labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Of those 33, 23 are conducting phase 2
testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: 11 of those are ISO certified.
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 of these 33 labs plan to have phase 3
labs by January 1st.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some are saying they may do some R&D
before then, but we are 124 days.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have 124 days left in the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not one single lab in the state is
currently conducting phase 3 R&D testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there is an intake cultivator or a
manufacturer in the state at the moment
[SPEAKER_04]: that can try to prepare for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is my biggest concern for the next
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Seeing that be implemented, I think,
is going to be a catastrophe.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also want to know if you guys agree
with me or if there's anything else that
[SPEAKER_04]: you fear for the next year of
implementation, starting with you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I keep hearing about labs being a
bottleneck.
[SPEAKER_09]: Steep Hill certainly is not in a
bottleneck right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: 70-something percent of our tests are
turned around in five days, 99% in less
[SPEAKER_09]: than 10 days.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're not turning anybody away.
[SPEAKER_09]: So but we do not yet have heavy metals
testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: And our history has shown that if it's not
required by the state, nobody wants to get
[SPEAKER_09]: it tested until, well, we had people
showing up in June to get ready for July.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so we're planning on being ready at
least by December, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we've only had a handful of people ask
us to do heavy metals testing at this
[SPEAKER_09]: point.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we do heavy metals testing in Maryland
and Pennsylvania.
[SPEAKER_09]: And Hawaii already.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we have the method.
[SPEAKER_09]: We actually have the instrument in place.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just a little infrastructure to put behind
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But we're not getting a whole lot of
requests for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we're not turning anybody away.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you can't wait 10 days for your
results, that's our 99% limit.
[SPEAKER_09]: But generally speaking, five days,
70% get done in five days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you feel that the December 31st
deadline should be implemented for phase
[SPEAKER_04]: three?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know why you would not.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the labs weren't ready, you can't
handle the entire state?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, we're not going to be the only
people that are doing heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_09]: for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: Every lab is in the same situation until
it's required.
[SPEAKER_09]: And believe me, I did testing when it
wasn't required anywhere in the world for
[SPEAKER_09]: many years.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you don't sell much testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So nobody was stepping up to pay extra for
pesticide testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: At Halent, we actually required you to get
pesticide testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: We put it in free with your potency test,
because nobody would buy it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we could only afford a single
quadrupole mass spec.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we didn't get the kind of sensitivities
you would need for the limits you have now
[SPEAKER_09]: at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: But at least we were doing some testing on
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so right now, I would say that every
lab is probably in the same situation.
[SPEAKER_09]: There might be one or two folks that want
to do a little R&D testing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Are you going to make the outlay for the
instrumentation and the people and the
[SPEAKER_09]: training and the infrastructure when
there's only a couple of people a month
[SPEAKER_09]: that are even talking to you about it and
much less offering to pay what it costs to
[SPEAKER_09]: do that kind of stuff?
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there's no reason to not implement
regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've been all about getting regulations in
place since the very beginning,
[SPEAKER_09]: because what do we know?
[SPEAKER_09]: We know that we used to see all the time
stuff claimed to have high CBD not have
[SPEAKER_09]: hardly any CBD at all.
[SPEAKER_09]: We saw that time and time again.
[SPEAKER_09]: We had people claiming they're not using
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we do these random tests with
somebody else's collecting samples in LA
[SPEAKER_09]: basin, 45 samples, 41 tested positive from
pesticides.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right?
[SPEAKER_09]: You tell me you don't need testing?
[SPEAKER_09]: I tell you, you do.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just saying regulation's the way to
go.
[SPEAKER_09]: Everybody needs to be on the same footing.
[SPEAKER_09]: People that are willing to cheat can't get
away with it.
[SPEAKER_09]: If people that are willing to cheat get
away with it, then the people who aren't
[SPEAKER_09]: willing to cheat are forced to cheat to
compete, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so you drive some people that would do
the right thing and to doing the wrong
[SPEAKER_09]: thing because they got to compete with
people doing the wrong thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I am a full supporter of regulation.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am too, but you know, it's also damned
if you do, damned if you don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: From the patient's perspective,
there's access, but the patient also needs
[SPEAKER_03]: to know if there's THCV in the product and
that's not required.
[SPEAKER_03]: A patient needs to know what terpenoids,
beta-karyophylline is an agonist,
[SPEAKER_03]: attaches to the CB2 receptor.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be critical for medical use,
not required.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there are issues with testing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't want to create a bottleneck,
but we also have to think about the safety
[SPEAKER_03]: of the patient as well as the efficacy of
the products out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And testing will help.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's important to realize that as part of
the, as we move forward.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I see the January 1st of phase
three, really that means heavy metals,
[SPEAKER_07]: as far as I can tell from my point of view
at least.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the thing with heavy metals is if
there was a lab doing heavy metals right
[SPEAKER_07]: now, I would be there tomorrow because
these grow processes are three months.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, here's September, you know,
you got to change things around.
[SPEAKER_07]: And most of the nutrients that I've seen
people using are heavy in arsenic.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I don't know, I don't, there's no data
that I can find about how much arsenic
[SPEAKER_07]: will be left in the final product at
different stages of growing.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in my opinion, the time is now to start
heavy metals testing.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if there's anything I think people
have learned about testing over the last
[SPEAKER_07]: eight months is that you got to be ready.
[SPEAKER_07]: And, you know, if you see shelves are bare
January 1st because, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: because all the, all the cannabis had
arsenic in it, obviously that's an
[SPEAKER_07]: exaggeration, but there's a good chance
that you'll see a lot of issues and a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: of cannabis being destroyed, just like
there was July 1st.
[SPEAKER_07]: So please, somebody start doing heavy
metal testing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do you think that phase three should be
implemented?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even though I see, even though it scares
me, I agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: I wouldn't have changed July 1st.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to, change isn't going to
happen until they make it, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: In my opinion, so I definitely do think it
should be implemented.
[SPEAKER_04]: Andrew?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I feel the same way as Danny.
[SPEAKER_06]: One thing that might help is if we can
have a little flexibility after these
[SPEAKER_06]: events occur and give maybe a little bit
more opportunity for remediation or other
[SPEAKER_06]: solutions so that it's not a total loss
for people.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, I agree with what Danny
said on this and I acknowledge it's hard.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we don't like it, but I do,
I do think that looking at both sides of
[SPEAKER_06]: the ledger, we're slightly better off if
we implement.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, definitely testing, you know,
a positive thing in this industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the products these days,
and a lot of it's just education is
[SPEAKER_08]: cleaner than ever, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I've seen it, I've been
cultivating for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_08]: And really getting out there and the
educational part of it, the cannabis is
[SPEAKER_08]: cleaner than ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are an enviro-organic certified farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we have 254,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have clean practices.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've run organic cultivation practices for
10 years and still get dings on testing
[SPEAKER_08]: that don't pass, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's inevitable, you know,
I've worked, I'm born and raised in Santa
[SPEAKER_08]: Cruz.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've worked with SC Labs since day one,
you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done stuff with Halent C-Pill,
all the above.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, it's finding that fine line
and consistencies, you know, because it's
[SPEAKER_08]: inconsistent right now, you know,
and it's a tough position you guys are in.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, when heavy metals come to play,
you know, we use an organic nutrient line,
[SPEAKER_08]: which we're going to have to regulate
that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to have to almost,
to be honest with you, go back to
[SPEAKER_08]: synthetics because that might be an issue
that we're considering right now,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of our teas, some of our sprays of
bacterias on it that help fight pests,
[SPEAKER_08]: test positive for micro, right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're held to such a high standard,
it's like our practices are changing when
[SPEAKER_08]: we're an enviro-organic certified farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're getting so strenuous and so
strict, we might have to back off that a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right, wrong, or indifferent, you know,
we'll adapt and do what we have to do,
[SPEAKER_08]: but we got to take all that into
consideration, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: The labs are changing, we're changing,
we need some leniency.
[SPEAKER_08]: The false positives are there,
you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: From a cultivator standpoint, we haven't,
in 10 years, anybody on my farm used
[SPEAKER_08]: something that is on that list,
but I've had negative tests, okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, for me to lose a batch for that
doesn't make sense.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's got to be a better false positive
retesting policy because, especially for
[SPEAKER_08]: the first year or two, because we're all
learning right now, every one of us up
[SPEAKER_08]: here, even though we have 20 years
experience across the board, it's reality,
[SPEAKER_08]: it's totally changed, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're trying to be above board with
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Leniency, in regards to that, is reality.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the cannabis is clean,
our farm's clean, we have the state coming
[SPEAKER_08]: to our farm, the county coming to our
farm, when we get a negative test and we
[SPEAKER_08]: say, hey, we don't even know what that is,
there should be a retest policy and not
[SPEAKER_08]: have our cannabis confiscated,
basically.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, and that's something that's a
reality out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, that's it, absolutely, we got to get
that done.
[SPEAKER_08]: We got to get that done, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, we have advocated, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to cut you off, are you
[SPEAKER_09]: still talking?
[SPEAKER_08]: No, I'm just saying, it's tight out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we're trying to produce a high
quality product, we're out there trying
[SPEAKER_08]: our best, we're taking it to a whole
different level and approach, and... Well,
[SPEAKER_09]: I agree, I think, so, the example I like
to cite, back in, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_09]: 2013, we came up with my super-duper
residual solvent test, right, my volatile
[SPEAKER_09]: organics test that we started applying,
we applied it to, I don't want to say
[SPEAKER_09]: whose cup it was, but you can guess it,
back in those days, we applied it to a
[SPEAKER_09]: cup, there were 140-something concentrate
samples, that were submitted, and all but
[SPEAKER_09]: three failed, and the three that didn't
fail were water hashes, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So, anybody who was using solvent wasn't
getting it out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Two years later, same cup, same test,
same number of entries, they all passed,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Once the industry was given the
information from testing that they could
[SPEAKER_09]: use, they knew it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, I'll tell you what, we see Chlordane,
Chlordane's been banned in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_09]: since 1988, we see Chlordane all over the
place, it's in the soil and it's in the
[SPEAKER_09]: water.
[SPEAKER_09]: We see it at really low hits, but it's
above our limit of detection.
[SPEAKER_09]: By the rules set in place, if we can see
it, we gotta call it a fail.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that's the way it should be,
there should be an action limit,
[SPEAKER_09]: and anything above that action limit is
failing, and everything below is not.
[SPEAKER_09]: The other thing we've advocated for is
multiple testing, we actually started out
[SPEAKER_09]: with two tests, and we were so pleased,
except that then we were told,
[SPEAKER_09]: oh no, you can't use this, we're not
publishing that second test, you just look
[SPEAKER_09]: at that, make sure it's okay, and then
throw it away.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, you got two tests, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: First of all, you look at a plant,
an outdoor plant or an indoor plant,
[SPEAKER_09]: depending on the lighting, but an outdoor
plant, even in the sunshine, the top of
[SPEAKER_09]: the plant is about 30% more potent than
the bottom of the plant.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so now you're mixing, you got 50
pounds, how many plants is that,
[SPEAKER_09]: 25?
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a huge range of true values,
you pick out any one bud, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So sampling is key, but certainly big
batches, you're gonna have more
[SPEAKER_09]: variability.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if we, in most testing industries,
the minimum number of tests you would do
[SPEAKER_09]: on some kind of failure like that would be
three.
[SPEAKER_09]: Because with three, you can get a standard
deviation, and you can look at the
[SPEAKER_09]: statistics and say, am I sure that this is
really over this limit?
[SPEAKER_09]: And you can use a statistical test to do
that, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the way that's done.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I would advocate for a minimum of three
tests.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now, people look at me, I'm a testing lab,
but you're just trying to get me right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm trying to get the money, I'm sorry,
I'm trying to get accurate results,
[SPEAKER_09]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Not a testing lab, but our research showed
that we needed eight samples to get.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, for the potency, yeah, for sure,
because it's so heterogeneous,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Three is the bare minimum.
[SPEAKER_09]: But people don't wanna pay for two,
so.
[SPEAKER_06]: Would you agree that the thresholds need
to be adjusted also?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think your mic's off us.
[SPEAKER_09]: The only thing I can say about the
thresholds is, so A, it shouldn't be a
[SPEAKER_09]: limit of detection, it should be an action
limit, so that's a limit of quantitation
[SPEAKER_09]: at the worst.
[SPEAKER_09]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right, but the thresholds, there is no
science to justify the threshold in an
[SPEAKER_09]: inhaled product, so people are guessing.
[SPEAKER_09]: The amounts that people consume are,
I don't know how those are estimated,
[SPEAKER_09]: so these things are estimates now.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know how to set those things.
[SPEAKER_09]: Usually there's data that you can rely
upon.
[SPEAKER_09]: In this case, there is no data,
and so I feel for the people that have to
[SPEAKER_09]: come up with those limits.
[SPEAKER_09]: Some of them work really, really hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm sure all of them work really,
really hard.
[SPEAKER_09]: But there is this tendency or attraction
to just be better safe than sorry,
[SPEAKER_09]: set the limits really, really low,
and not care that that makes it really
[SPEAKER_09]: expensive, and it makes it expensive to do
the test.
[SPEAKER_09]: It makes it expensive for the people that
are failing, right, and it makes it
[SPEAKER_09]: expensive for the patient, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And is there balancing the need for safety
and not being sued against the needs of a
[SPEAKER_09]: marketplace that has to move forward?
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm glad I'm not making that decision.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got to tell you that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And along the pesticide lines,
I had a lemon poppy cookie that I had to
[SPEAKER_07]: actually pull from the market and
everything and just not even put it out
[SPEAKER_07]: because I couldn't find lemon zest to pass
a cannabis pesticide test.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just couldn't find it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I tried sources.
[SPEAKER_07]: I sourced organic.
[SPEAKER_07]: I sourced everything, and it couldn't pass
a Cat 2 pesticide test.
[SPEAKER_09]: We've tested the extracted essential oils
of other herbs and found nasty stuff in
[SPEAKER_09]: it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Organic or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it's just a lemon extract, but the
lemon extract has a bunch of ethanol left
[SPEAKER_07]: in it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Limits for ethanol have gone up.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the standards for lemons are obviously
much different than the standards for
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis, and this is another issue,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Where cannabis is treated much
differently, even much differently than
[SPEAKER_06]: highly toxic substances like tobacco,
and yet you can't put lemon zest in the
[SPEAKER_06]: thing, and it's just, you know,
it feels like a quagmire.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a quagmire.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's crazy, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I'm really surprised to hear that
most of you agree that phase three should
[SPEAKER_04]: go into effect, and I really hope that the
state gives us at least six more months to
[SPEAKER_04]: get the labs prepared for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what I feel actually occurred
was the January 1st testing standards were
[SPEAKER_04]: almost ignored, and we had that 2017
clause, you know, so most of the product
[SPEAKER_04]: that ended up on the shelves for the first
six months was untested, and I think that
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of the labs sat around twiddling
their thumbs for that six months and
[SPEAKER_04]: probably burning capital because people
weren't being forced to.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely was not twiddling my thumbs.
[SPEAKER_04]: But because the industry wasn't being
forced to use you, and they had this
[SPEAKER_04]: loophole, and a lot of newer labs,
not yourself, were probably burning
[SPEAKER_04]: capital that they planned to use to
reinvest in phase two testing equipment,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then phase two hit, and we didn't get
that reprieve from the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of people thought we would,
and now what I'm seeing in the industry is
[SPEAKER_04]: labs that are actually asking their
clients to fund their expansion,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they, I know some people that have
actually done these deals, and they've
[SPEAKER_04]: said, you give me $250,000 and buy my new
equipment, and I will make sure that you
[SPEAKER_04]: have priority, and there are brands that
are signing up for this, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, Danny, you've been offered that as
well, and you turned it down, and,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, being in this type of
environment and understanding,
[SPEAKER_04]: like, why we are where we're at,
I think, is another reason I'm advocating
[SPEAKER_04]: for an extension.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, let the labs catch up.
[SPEAKER_04]: The labs, yourself excluded, were sitting
around twiddling their thumbs for six
[SPEAKER_04]: months of the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that waiting for the 33 licensed
labs to actually say that they have the
[SPEAKER_04]: equipment and are ready, but also giving
the industry another six months to utilize
[SPEAKER_04]: some R&D testing would be a good buffer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not in statute, but I still don't
know what the avenue is to sort of
[SPEAKER_04]: advocate for that, but maybe I'm alone in
thinking that this is a solution.
[SPEAKER_04]: What solutions do you see?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you see that the state or the
industry could advocate for to make this
[SPEAKER_04]: next year a little bit smoother than what
has occurred in the last eight months?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, so, first of all, if you tell me I
gotta buy my equipment in November of
[SPEAKER_09]: 2017, or, what is this, 2018, and nobody's
really gonna be required to buy that test
[SPEAKER_09]: from me until, I don't know, July of 2018,
2019, I'm not gonna sell anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm still in the position, I've got the
outlays, I've got the training of the
[SPEAKER_09]: people, I've got the infrastructure,
I've got the lease on the instrument,
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm paying all that, and I'm not getting
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's why the labs are waiting till,
right, nobody's asked, like, I tell you,
[SPEAKER_09]: there aren't that many people asking us
for heavy metals.
[SPEAKER_09]: We were doing some work with an x-ray
fluorescence, which you can't get down to
[SPEAKER_09]: the right limit, so it was only kind of
preliminary stuff.
[SPEAKER_09]: But the ICPMS, we've got it, we're gonna
get it set up, probably will be set up in
[SPEAKER_09]: just a matter of weeks.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like I said, we've got the method
operating in other locations, so it won't
[SPEAKER_09]: take long to get it going.
[SPEAKER_09]: But if there are people that really want
heavy metal testing now, come to us and
[SPEAKER_09]: prepay for your test.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not asking you, I think there was a
time when our sales department was trying
[SPEAKER_09]: to work deals with people where they would
buy their own machine and we'd run it for
[SPEAKER_09]: them or something, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got a client.
[SPEAKER_09]: He's over there waving at you right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did it take us up on him?
[SPEAKER_09]: No, but he did.
[SPEAKER_09]: I did not.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, these labs are in the same boat as
the rest of us.
[SPEAKER_07]: We can't just go to a bank and get a loan,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I fully understand that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wasn't gonna do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, plus there's kind of ownership
issues, and I don't really know what
[SPEAKER_04]: equipment donation means or if the Bureau
would not look at that as being an owner.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: We gave up on that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Obviously we're here because the 45-day
comment period just ended.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm pretty sure that most of you did
submit public comments.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you hoping and praying that the
Bureau ends up implementing out of the
[SPEAKER_04]: comments that you suggested?
[SPEAKER_09]: I already said the main one, which was the
category one, pesticides change to an
[SPEAKER_09]: action limit instead of a limited
detection.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_09]: The idea that labs are responsible for all
label claims in the language of the law or
[SPEAKER_09]: the regulation, I don't know what that
means.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if somebody claims that it's got a
calorie count on the label, are we
[SPEAKER_09]: responsible to verify that the calorie
count is right or the niacin levels?
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's written in such a way that it's very
difficult for the lab, so it's made the
[SPEAKER_09]: labs into the policemen.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to look at the label.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to understand the label.
[SPEAKER_09]: We have to understand what the terms on
the label are meant to mean and what legal
[SPEAKER_09]: ramifications there are for making those
claims.
[SPEAKER_07]: You have all of our businesses in your
hands.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, exactly, and we don't want that.
[SPEAKER_09]: We don't want to be deciding which label.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I didn't want to be the tax agent
either.
[SPEAKER_09]: We feel like we give you results.
[SPEAKER_09]: You tell us what tests we want.
[SPEAKER_09]: We'll give you the results, and you verify
that your label says what's on the COA.
[SPEAKER_09]: That should not be my job, and I don't
want to do it, and I'm not going to be
[SPEAKER_09]: very good at it because you could make any
claim on there, and we're not in that
[SPEAKER_09]: game.
[SPEAKER_09]: So that's the second big one, other than
the category ones, that I would like
[SPEAKER_09]: changed for labs, multiple tests,
but nobody here wants multiple tests
[SPEAKER_09]: because nobody wants to pay for multiple
tests.
[SPEAKER_09]: You don't want to pay for the tests you
need.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, you know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Gene, I know you were very involved in
issuing comments and suggestions to both
[SPEAKER_04]: all three agencies, I assume.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we were concerned that the gathering
of data on phyto-cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenoids is important, and maybe you
don't have to put every single one on the
[SPEAKER_03]: label, but the state should be gathering
that data because they're going to be
[SPEAKER_03]: kicking themselves for not doing it in a
few years once we discover that they were
[SPEAKER_03]: critical as medicine and not included as
something to collect.
[SPEAKER_03]: As well, the idea that patients who are
sick don't have money, and to make them
[SPEAKER_03]: jump extra hoops like get a state medical
card for no apparent reason, pay money for
[SPEAKER_03]: that, just still trying to figure that one
out, why the state really needed to charge
[SPEAKER_03]: them.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, I don't know that there's
necessarily something that I want to see
[SPEAKER_07]: go through, but eliminating the CRP
packaging thing and requiring exit bags,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think, is absolutely ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_07]: The exit bag requirement is doing nothing
but filling our landfill, and nobody puts
[SPEAKER_07]: everything back in the exit bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_07]: In reality, I don't know anybody that was
complaining about having to put stuff in
[SPEAKER_07]: CRP packaging.
[SPEAKER_07]: They took the one thing that everybody was
cool with and changed it for some reason.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would say, I mean, we could list 10
million things from being able to give
[SPEAKER_06]: care packages to low-income patients again
or just samples to each other so we can
[SPEAKER_06]: learn about each other's products and
figure out if we want to carry them or not
[SPEAKER_06]: or how to improve them and give each other
feedback like any other supply chain.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, generally, I want more
people in the legal market and less people
[SPEAKER_06]: in the black market, and that's consumers
and that's producers and that's growers,
[SPEAKER_06]: and we have to lower the barriers of entry
on all sides of the supply chain for all
[SPEAKER_06]: of us, and whether that be, you know,
making sure we're not overpackaging things
[SPEAKER_06]: or making sure that we're, you know,
having different thresholds for testing
[SPEAKER_06]: that are more reasonable or whether it is,
you know, having tax rates that make us
[SPEAKER_06]: feel good about contributing to the state
and to our communities but don't cripple
[SPEAKER_06]: our businesses and drive people
underground.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, and to take something pretty simple,
we've made it very complex.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now let's start moving back to simple,
and that's going to be a process over
[SPEAKER_06]: years of work, but, you know, eventually
it should be a pretty simple exercise for
[SPEAKER_06]: somebody to engage their endocannabinoid
system with external cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: It should be a pretty simple thing to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we got a bar over here serving
alcohol.
[SPEAKER_06]: We don't have a bar serving any cannabis
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a long way to go, okay?
[SPEAKER_06]: We got a long way to go, even in our own
event.
[SPEAKER_06]: And these conversations would probably be
10 more times productive if we could all
[SPEAKER_06]: take a few tabs before we come up here and
talk to each other instead of drinking
[SPEAKER_06]: alcohol, which is going to make us
probably a little more contentious.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, so that's the way the world
I'm trying to create, we're trying to
[SPEAKER_06]: create together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what I would say to that,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I agree with Andrew.
[SPEAKER_08]: Keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we're out here trying to
recreate this industry, take it to the
[SPEAKER_08]: next level, create clean products for
everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I could tell you right now,
someone who's done this for 20 years,
[SPEAKER_08]: we've done that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, the cannabis, the quality,
the cleanliness, it's changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's from the mindset of growers.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether it's even the black market,
unfortunately, we all know about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: But the cleanliness is better there,
and it's better all around, and it's all
[SPEAKER_08]: due to education and people trying to get
to that next level.
[SPEAKER_08]: But let's not create so many roadblocks
where we can't create this product to a
[SPEAKER_08]: patient where they can go to a collective
and be able to afford it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I was very big into high CBD
medicinal products from a CO2 extraction
[SPEAKER_08]: standpoint, and I couldn't keep that
company viable, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's one thing that gets me is the
emails I get from these patients who
[SPEAKER_08]: relied on this product.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we spoke before, they can't get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're from all up and down the state
wanting to drive to Santa Cruz to get that
[SPEAKER_08]: product from me, you know, because they
are not able to get it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's not our goal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Our goal is to allow them to get it,
give them whatever financial assistance,
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever we need to get them that product,
because they rely on it, they depend on
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we've created something where it's
very hard to get that product to these
[SPEAKER_08]: patients, and I get there's change,
but we've got to be a little bit more
[SPEAKER_08]: lenient and flexible, keep it simple,
until this industry is more established,
[SPEAKER_08]: because we're all learning.
[SPEAKER_08]: And me at the farm every single day right
next to Harborside, every single day,
[SPEAKER_08]: they're just curveballs thrown my way,
you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: It makes the fire service look like the
easiest job in the world.
[SPEAKER_08]: Seriously, and I work right here downtown,
you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's crazy, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: I never thought it would be like that,
you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And hey, I'm a firefighter and I do
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like helping people, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: I've helped a lot more people with
cannabis than the fire service.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people probably don't understand that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I've been a paramedic for 20 years,
frontline.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had more people been gratified by the
CBD, the medicinal cannabis than I ever
[SPEAKER_08]: have been.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've had more people than I have in the
fire service, straight up, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's enough said right there,
and that's why I can sit here as a fire
[SPEAKER_08]: captain here and be like, hey,
you know, I can finally stand up and have
[SPEAKER_08]: some pride in this industry, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's real, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And we're all here trying to make it real,
trying to create it, longevity,
[SPEAKER_08]: get it to the patients, and all we're
asking is for simplicity.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's not stereotype the industry,
you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's stand up and accept the change
that's going on, and it's not easy,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, it's, I could tell you,
you're more than welcome to come to my
[SPEAKER_08]: farm and see what's going on, but it's a
lot of work, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I can't even tell you.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, even, oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's, you can feel me.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can't wait to go back to the fire
station.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, it's all about the
patients, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: We want to keep it real with them and
allow them to be able to have access to
[SPEAKER_08]: this product, you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: And they don't right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's hard to get it to them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've got to fix that system,
you know, whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, the title of this panel is
called The Path Forward, and going into
[SPEAKER_04]: 2019, right now we're about to wrap up the
legislative session for the year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any bill that has not passed by Friday
will be dead, and we will be revisiting,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, some of those ones that failed
next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have what probably is going to be
considered a pipe dream, but it's a dream
[SPEAKER_04]: nonetheless, and that is that the industry
actually works together on an omnibus
[SPEAKER_04]: bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, everybody from patients to
employers to small growers to retailers,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, I would love to see our industry
actually mature and stop fighting each
[SPEAKER_04]: other at the Capitol.
[SPEAKER_04]: I work at a lobbying firm, and I've only
worked there for a year now, and I don't
[SPEAKER_04]: do the state lobbying, but I hear all of
the drama.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I really want to see our industry
actually come together and not waste their
[SPEAKER_04]: members' money fighting each other.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it just makes us look like
children.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I want to know, from each of you up
here, because you all have a lot more
[SPEAKER_04]: experience and a lot more time that you've
spent in this industry, is this a pipe
[SPEAKER_04]: dream, or can it become a reality?
[SPEAKER_04]: And if it can become a reality,
how?
[SPEAKER_04]: Help me.
[SPEAKER_04]: To you.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm going first again, huh?
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, so pipe dreams are common in this
room, I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've got a few of my own.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, so it'd be nice if everybody could
work together.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, unfortunately, politics are
politics, and when you have limited
[SPEAKER_09]: resources and humans competing for them,
it's politics.
[SPEAKER_09]: And man, I stay away from that as much as
I can, but I can't, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So ultimately, what I'd like to see is
maybe a little simplification,
[SPEAKER_09]: lower some barriers.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm also of the opinion that the barriers
now are so high, especially for the small
[SPEAKER_09]: growers, they're all just going to stay in
the black market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's going to be a struggle for
those that do go into the legal market,
[SPEAKER_09]: because now you're not on an even playing
field.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that the public is going to,
you know, have much appetite for guys in
[SPEAKER_09]: uniforms with guns busting heads of
20-year-olds again.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't think that's going to go down.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I don't think you're going to beat them
into the system with a stick.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think you're going to have to lower the
barriers, put a carrot out there,
[SPEAKER_09]: try and get people involved.
[SPEAKER_09]: And like you said, have a collaborative.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think having the regulators and the
department, there are, I got to say,
[SPEAKER_09]: there are some people in some of those
organizations who are not happy that
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis is going this route.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think that affects how they interact
with the folks that are trying to make
[SPEAKER_09]: this business work.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that I think that that can be done
better.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think there can be a more collaborative
approach to the people who are already in
[SPEAKER_09]: the system.
[SPEAKER_09]: There can be collaborative and not
adversarial to those people, because
[SPEAKER_09]: you're not being adversarial to the people
outside the system.
[SPEAKER_09]: It looks even worse to those people.
[SPEAKER_09]: You see people getting crushed and so on
publicly or whatever in the, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: when they're already in the legal system
and now they're outside of it looking in
[SPEAKER_09]: and saying, so I got to pay a bunch of
money, hire some lawyers to figure out how
[SPEAKER_09]: to do all this, pay all these fees.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then they're going to be crawling down
my throat in an adversarial situation when
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just trying to get up and running.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think the collaborative approach,
as much as possible, I think there are a
[SPEAKER_09]: lot of people in the cannabis industry who
do have good hearts and who do want to do
[SPEAKER_09]: what's right for everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: Unfortunately, you can't do what's right
for everybody.
[SPEAKER_09]: So how do you find that balance?
[SPEAKER_09]: So finding a balance somehow is what we've
got to work together on, but I agree.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm all for unity.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I don't think it'll work unless we
understand that there's two consumers
[SPEAKER_03]: here.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's the recreational consumer who's
concerned about smell and taste and cute
[SPEAKER_03]: names.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the medical consumer
that's concerned about milligrams,
[SPEAKER_03]: dosage, active ingredients, consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: If we're going to work together,
then we've got to really see that there's
[SPEAKER_03]: two different consumers here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if we can do that, then yeah,
we can work together.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unity is always best.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really, there are two paths.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, at the same time, I'm a big
proponent of all uses, medical use,
[SPEAKER_07]: whether you know it or not.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I definitely agree.
[SPEAKER_07]: There are those that are looking at one
way and those that are looking at another.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can we come together?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Will we?
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, I don't think the cannabis users
who voted Prop 64 who voted yes on it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it was non-cannabis users that
were probably just tired of hearing about
[SPEAKER_07]: it on his leave.
[SPEAKER_07]: But the amount of opposition to 64,
I however, felt a little bit different.
[SPEAKER_07]: I saw it as a step forward no matter what.
[SPEAKER_07]: And work out the kinks later.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's going to be real tough,
real tough to get everybody on the same
[SPEAKER_07]: page because everybody's not on the same
page.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, I think it can happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I won't hold my breath.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I certainly hope it happens.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think it's important for us to always
remember we're in the same community
[SPEAKER_06]: together.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're all on the same team.
[SPEAKER_06]: And what we do, there's an element of
commerce to it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And unfortunately, we live in a time where
greed is the organizing principle.
[SPEAKER_06]: And things are very competitive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And sometimes that leads people to treat
each other contentiously.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's very hard to get a state of this
size to agree on anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, we have one party rule in this
state, and the Democrats can't agree on
[SPEAKER_06]: anything.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's a very hard time right now for
unity in general in America.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm hoping that cannabis will solve
that problem.
[SPEAKER_06]: The more endocannabinoid systems that we
can trigger with this plant, hopefully the
[SPEAKER_06]: more unity we'll get over time.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, the medium is the message at a
certain point.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I hope we can stay connected to each
other and care and love one another and
[SPEAKER_06]: treat each other with respect and disagree
agreeably as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's very important.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, that's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just educating yourself on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: What are the pros and cons?
[SPEAKER_08]: Out here is huge transition.
[SPEAKER_08]: The black market of cannabis a year ago to
where it's at right now and all these
[SPEAKER_08]: people, including Harborside, who's really
set the standard and allowed us to really
[SPEAKER_08]: take it to the next level.
[SPEAKER_08]: Me as a small cultivator in Santa Cruz to
where I'm at now out in Monterey,
[SPEAKER_08]: we keep our same practices.
[SPEAKER_08]: We just took it to that level because I
felt like I could help more people that
[SPEAKER_08]: way and have a larger scale farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: I go to their farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what's going on.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know their practices.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know what they're doing at that farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's legit.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a great product.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if you buy that product, I know it's
good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's got to grow because we have to be
able to supply these guys like the Carrova
[SPEAKER_08]: who need product, who need good quality
product.
[SPEAKER_08]: And sometimes these smaller farmers,
he can't go around to eight different
[SPEAKER_08]: farms.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's when you get inconsistencies.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you can go to one farm and purchase
and run your product line off a farm,
[SPEAKER_08]: you're going to get more consistent
product.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to get a better quality
product.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can actually allow your self to
grow and create and take it to that next
[SPEAKER_08]: level.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there's a place for large scale and
small scale, just like any business out
[SPEAKER_08]: here.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people need to understand that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gone both ends of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think there's pros and cons to both
of them.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's just really understanding it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And no harm, no foul for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I had a joint in my paramedic drug box,
that would probably be the number one
[SPEAKER_08]: medicine I could use for these patients
out here who are taking.
[SPEAKER_08]: I walk into a house and they just drop 10
medications on me.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's like, why are you taking all
that?
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, this one helps this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I have to take this one because I take
this one.
[SPEAKER_08]: And literally, I look at them all.
[SPEAKER_08]: And cannabis could resolve it.
[SPEAKER_08]: No harm, no foul.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm not even a consumer of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's there.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_08]: And people just have to understand it and
accept it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the reality is it's the most
beneficial thing out there and the
[SPEAKER_08]: cleanest product out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Coming from a paramedic.
Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think also along your original
question, the coming together,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we do see a lot of people coming
together with a common goal when it comes
[SPEAKER_07]: to local municipalities right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the reason they're doing that is
because they had to.
[SPEAKER_07]: They knew they couldn't, without getting
their local government on board with what
[SPEAKER_07]: they were all trying to collectively do,
they can't be a part of the regulated
[SPEAKER_07]: market.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I did see a lot of retail alliances.
[SPEAKER_07]: And stuff like that coming together
locally, which was good to see.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think on a smaller scale,
we are coming together.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just a question of if you can go
larger scale than that.
[SPEAKER_04]: OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we're going to wrap it up with my
questions.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're going to open it up to the
audience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all have to go help make medical
cannabis work for a number of different
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have significant health challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have an opioid epidemic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical and adult use are going to be
working hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: The supplies, the way things work,
the way we interrelate, we're working with
[SPEAKER_00]: the same sort of compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have different customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just think about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be solving some big
problems here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody up here definitely has
contributed more than their fair share in
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to accomplish big things.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of this is entrepreneurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all trying to get our business
started.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're frustrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're all going through these catch-420s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep moving forward with the catch-420s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Raise the bar as much as you possibly can.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're eventually going to have patients
who are going to be relying on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's just the way it's going to be,
even if it is the adult use or if it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: very significantly serious patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess my question here is I'm very
interested in taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're trying to do is we're going
to try to figure out how we're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to subsidize some of these clinical
trials that we need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a drug developer, we have a problem
with essentially a billion dollars in
[SPEAKER_00]: order to develop one drug.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have a broad spectrum compound that
is going to be very much contributing to a
[SPEAKER_00]: reduction in our health care costs
overall, as well as really affecting some
[SPEAKER_00]: crisis that we're dealing in health care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the question is for each of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given your experience in the industry,
what do you think will be the best way for
[SPEAKER_00]: us to bring on the doctors, bring in our
scientists, get our folks that really have
[SPEAKER_00]: to dial into and take their expertise and
then come in and help this field?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do have a problem with getting patients
coming into this field and coming into a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary and being able to say,
yes, I need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's really a question that I have.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do we need to be doing in order to
make that happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's a lot of people suffering
and they're not walking in the dispensary
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're not accessing this medicine
the way they need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do we need to be doing to
encourage that process?
[SPEAKER_07]: I kind of feel like we are doing it
currently by legalizing and making it a
[SPEAKER_07]: little more socially acceptable,
even though to Andrew's point,
[SPEAKER_07]: we have a bar and not a dab bar.
[SPEAKER_07]: It is becoming more socially acceptable
and I feel like people are talking about
[SPEAKER_07]: it more than they were.
[SPEAKER_07]: It may not be where it needs to be,
but I do think that we're on a good path.
[SPEAKER_07]: However, I think that state combining
medical and adult use was the worst thing
[SPEAKER_07]: they possibly could have done.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we have no medical program and that is,
I think, the root of the problem in
[SPEAKER_07]: California.
[SPEAKER_07]: But as far as getting people to be okay
with using it, as a medicine, and going
[SPEAKER_07]: into a dispensary, I think we're on the
right path there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Got to make it affordable.
[SPEAKER_08]: You got to allow us to get those products
out there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I had to shut down my whole
medicinal line and all these emails we get
[SPEAKER_08]: is people can't afford it now because
insurance doesn't cover it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you got to come in there and pay for
it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And for what it costs us to get product to
market right now, unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_08]: it takes it out of the range for these
patients where they could go and get
[SPEAKER_08]: Vicodin for a $10 copay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's bang for the buck.
[SPEAKER_08]: Unfortunately, that's what drives people.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're going to go spend $60, $70 for a
gram of high CBD cannabis, or you go
[SPEAKER_08]: through your insurance, Medicare,
whatever it is, and here's 30 Vicodin.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just call a phone number and get a refill.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's getting that to the collectives
like the Harbor side.
[SPEAKER_08]: Emails all day every day right now is,
where's all the CBD?
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason is it costs a lot of money for
us to create CBD.
[SPEAKER_08]: It really does.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've done a lot of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And unfortunately, it's too much.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can't even get it to market right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD, a gram is a day's supply,
according to Rafael Majulam.
[SPEAKER_03]: So $60 a day is not doable for the
patients.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's got to drop tremendously to the point
where they are paying 20 cents for 100
[SPEAKER_03]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that comes from educating the
industry and having the industry advocate
[SPEAKER_03]: for increased growth to reduce the cost of
CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right now, CBD is more expensive than THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you require more of it than THC for
efficacy.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're not going to be able to do that
if we have something like a one acre cap.
[SPEAKER_06]: No.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not going to be able to do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're not.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot we have to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the things I'll remind folks,
at least at Harbor side, every product at
[SPEAKER_06]: every ratio that you could get before
January 1st, you can get right now at
[SPEAKER_06]: Harbor side.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want a transdermal patch?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have a transdermal patch.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want CBN?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have CBN.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want CBD?
[SPEAKER_06]: We have CBD.
[SPEAKER_06]: The products are still there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yes, they're a lot more expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that sucks.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the product is there.
[SPEAKER_06]: You could come in the Harbor side and you
could talk to one of our consultants for
[SPEAKER_06]: three hours and not buy anything and learn
anything you want to learn.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that access is there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's free.
[SPEAKER_06]: Come in.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll talk to you about cannabis all day
long.
[SPEAKER_06]: We love talking about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll show you lab reports.
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll give you materials from Steep Hill.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, it's all right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: The information is really quite accessible
for patients right now.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's confusing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Some of it contradicts each other.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is information.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's sativa and indica?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I go into every store and I see
sativa and indica.
[SPEAKER_03]: What is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that have to do with anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: Poor nomenclature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sativa is tall with narrow leaves.
[SPEAKER_09]: Indica is short with broad leaves.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the chemical content doesn't have
anything to do with the shape of the
[SPEAKER_09]: plant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why are we still selling it as sativa?
[SPEAKER_07]: I think every flower you buy should come
with a complete terpene breakdown.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the only way to know.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's stuff that looks like indica,
that treats you like a sativa,
[SPEAKER_09]: and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_09]: You cannot tell by looking at it.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's my tagline.
[SPEAKER_06]: Try to fit that on the display.
[SPEAKER_07]: Next question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for everybody for being here
tonight and teaching us a lot about
[SPEAKER_01]: product compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm actually here tonight to talk
about a different type of compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bit more important to my right side of
the panel here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's tax compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think it's actually a very
interesting thing for all of us to be
[SPEAKER_01]: thinking about because where the medical
aspect of the product is extremely
[SPEAKER_01]: important and it was an important thing
that helped us get it legalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the thing, the real motivator was
the money and the revenue that the state
[SPEAKER_01]: and the cities for California,
for instance, can make.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we know that the numbers that we're
getting are not reaching the revenue that
[SPEAKER_01]: they thought that they were going to be
getting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the one thing that is not
being talked about is the lack of tax
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance by the taxpayers within the
industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not due to a lack of trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that the state has made it so
difficult to follow the regulations that
[SPEAKER_01]: my studies have shown, at least on the
dispensary side of things, that a very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very, very small percentage of them are
calculating their taxes properly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's ending up shorting the cities and
the state.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: My question is really about what you guys
feel about the importance of tax
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance because it's not something
that's being talked about.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd also like to, before I finish,
invite Andrew to Long Beach on the 13th of
[SPEAKER_01]: September where the League of California
Cities will be meeting for their annual
conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Love to be there.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's talk after.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's exchange cards after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go down together and be educators.
[SPEAKER_06]: Love to.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, on your tax question,
I think the state kind of put certain
[SPEAKER_07]: operators in this position by making
distributors collect tax for other
[SPEAKER_07]: people's businesses.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I think a lot of people have probably
used that as capital, almost, have been
[SPEAKER_07]: basically trying to build themselves and
bring themselves to compliance on other
[SPEAKER_07]: people's money.
[SPEAKER_07]: And they are going to pay a brutal fee for
doing so.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's, what, 50% off the top plus
another 10 or something along those lines.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I feel for those guys.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I do kind of think that the way that
the state has laid out a tax and tax
[SPEAKER_07]: collection has kind of made that a
reality, has made that a thing,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yesterday was the first time that I
actually saw a compliant receipt from a
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary, one that was charging the tax
embedded in the item and not subtotaling
[SPEAKER_04]: the taxes out at the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, there is definitely a need for
tax compliance.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is also a need for the CDTFA to
actually be transparent with the fact that
[SPEAKER_04]: their projections are significantly lower.
[SPEAKER_04]: What they're reporting is a combination of
sales use tax, which was not a part of
[SPEAKER_04]: their estimates.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you want compliance from our side,
we need transparency from the state side,
[SPEAKER_04]: too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it kind of goes both ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Jim Coffas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm from Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're happy to help facilitate this event.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're Green Trade.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're a coalition of mostly small cannabis
operators in Santa Cruz County.
[SPEAKER_02]: To Jackie's point about the ability of the
industry to come together, we've seen it
[SPEAKER_02]: on the local level where we, for the last
year and a half, two years almost,
[SPEAKER_02]: have tried to bring players together,
manufacturers, resellers, distributors,
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's been difficult to show them where
their shared interests are.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've been able to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fortunately or unfortunately, the shared
interest right now is getting a license.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at the local level, that's depending
upon your jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that can be even more cumbersome,
more onerous than at the state level.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I encourage everybody to pay attention
to what's going on in their local
[SPEAKER_02]: jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_02]: Taking my hat off as an industry rep,
I'm a 50-year consumer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I never had a medical card.
[SPEAKER_02]: I purchased all my cannabis or received
all my cannabis through what some people
[SPEAKER_02]: call the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_02]: I prefer to, having grown up not too far
from here, I prefer to call it the
[SPEAKER_02]: traditional market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the traditional market, you know,
there were, sometimes you got bad product,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it was all built on trust.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for the most part, you know,
your trust was well-placed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't suffer any major
consequences, I don't think, from my
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption of untested, unregulated,
unlicensed cannabis for 50 years.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, since January, you know, the cost of
that same amount of cannabis is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing is that at age 71,
I'm now kind of looking at using cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: for therapeutic purposes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for those uses, I do want a tested,
I want to know what the dosage is,
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to know as much as I can about
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm wondering if there's a conflict
between the adult use market and the
[SPEAKER_02]: so-called medical market that is
unresolvable.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like your thoughts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think there is no medical market right
now, and that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all adult use right now, you know,
and the actual medical patients are
[SPEAKER_07]: suffering because of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they can still come in if they're over
21 and get the same products they could
[SPEAKER_06]: before, they're more expensive.
[SPEAKER_07]: At 100 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Capsules and tinctures, you have to go to
capsules and tinctures.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
Right.
[SPEAKER_06]: Understood.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's forcing the medical patients to
go to the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's outrageous.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's outrageous.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's outrageous.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're forcing the sickest of the sickest
people to consume the worst of the worst
[SPEAKER_04]: product.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we just need universal health care for
cannabis patients.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sounds easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, hopefully in our lifetime.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hopefully.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this has been great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you guys so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're definitely experts in your field
and pioneers paving the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I look forward to another year of working
with you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, thanks, Jackie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Jackie.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks, Peter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks for putting this together,
guys.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Education is fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all for coming and have a good
night.
Good night.
