[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Julie Crockett.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am from MMLG I'm the director of
compliance and I am here to moderate this
[SPEAKER_00]: panel discussion on track and trace metric
Track and trace I will say upfront that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure I'm near confident We're gonna
come out of this panel with more questions
[SPEAKER_00]: than answers about track and trace just so
you know because it is a giant question
[SPEAKER_00]: mark for the entire industry Right now
when is it gonna start?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: These are all big questions, but for any
operator Looking to the horizon and seeing
[SPEAKER_00]: this coming it the most important thing I
think right now to emphasize is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulations currently stipulate that
all of these record-keeping requirements
[SPEAKER_00]: that are outlined You're obligated to be
doing it right now on a minimum of pay
[SPEAKER_00]: Paper or some sort of you know records so
that record-keeping onus is already here
[SPEAKER_00]: and Really looking at those regulations
and when you look at these these track and
[SPEAKER_00]: trace elements and the things that are
going to have to be measured and the
[SPEAKER_00]: points of This of the supply chain that
are going to be tracked.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of The critical information
that you need to see and be incorporating
[SPEAKER_00]: into your compliance Programs in your
operations right now for anybody that
[SPEAKER_00]: hasn't taken a gander at it Here's a quick
list of some of the things you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have to enter into track and trace things
like the packaging of cannabis goods the
[SPEAKER_00]: sale of cannabis goods the transportation
of cannabis goods the receipt of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: goods the return of cannabis goods the
destruction of disposal of cannabis goods
[SPEAKER_00]: lab testing and results any other activity
that they may choose to require by any
[SPEAKER_00]: Licensing authority at any time you may
have to put in there you have to put
[SPEAKER_00]: information for every Activity for each of
those activities you have to put in the
[SPEAKER_00]: name and type the UIDs the amount of the
cannabis goods by weight or count the date
[SPEAKER_00]: and time the activity happened the name
and license number of whoever is involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in it at any level of the supply chain
whether they're being transported and So
[SPEAKER_00]: on and so forth the date and time the
arrival date the estimated arrival time
[SPEAKER_00]: and when it actually arrived and the
driver's License number of who's doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: so those are some of the ones from the BCC
The I'm not done Either there's more they
[SPEAKER_00]: just keep going, you know, if waste is
disposed who disposed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the employees name?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's their employee number?
[SPEAKER_00]: What was the reason that it was destroyed
or disposed and who's being collected it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you haul it did somebody else haul it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you drop it off?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much did away how much did away when
it was there and how much did away when
[SPEAKER_00]: you dropped it off and any any adjustments
that have to be made spoilage or fouling
[SPEAKER_00]: any event any other information they might
need and all of these transactions have to
[SPEAKER_00]: be put into Track and trace within 24
hours of them happening And that's just
[SPEAKER_00]: the BCC So that's just one agency's
requirement that doesn't go into the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation side of the cultivation
requirements for track and trace Which is
[SPEAKER_00]: that I mean luckily cultivators you guys
get three days to put it in the system So
[SPEAKER_00]: you got a little more time, but there's
every event or change In disposition of
[SPEAKER_00]: your plant material flowering destruction
disposal harvest processing storage
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging all of those have to be entered
in at many different points and In it back
[SPEAKER_00]: to the comments because we can't stop
talking about it They just threw in
[SPEAKER_00]: another point of having to weigh and enter
the wet weight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not just the dry harvest way So this is
why these things are important in other
[SPEAKER_00]: states people regularly bring on two to
three new employees whose sole job is to
[SPEAKER_00]: monitor track and trace and To keep your
system synced and to keep your physical
[SPEAKER_07]: inventory synced You know that exactly two
to three employees.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my company is gonna have multiple
distribution Cross-stocking locations
[SPEAKER_07]: around the state and I'm gonna have to
hire to the company's gonna have to hire
[SPEAKER_07]: two to three people just to run the track
and trace system and I'll get into this
[SPEAKER_07]: more but all those requirements you listed
are Really fall on the distributor Because
[SPEAKER_07]: we're ultimately before this product goes
to retail We're supposed to make sure all
[SPEAKER_07]: of that was put into the track and trace
system properly And we have to do that
[SPEAKER_07]: however When we've done the training for
track and trace, it's all about
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivation right now.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not a distribution track and trace
training for metric We have asked I have
[SPEAKER_09]: asked on behalf of my clients.
[SPEAKER_09]: It does not exist California being very
unique in that our distribution model and
[SPEAKER_09]: our distributors have a significantly more
responsibility including taxes Than any
[SPEAKER_09]: other state that metric is currently
working So Tim's point I tell my clients
[SPEAKER_09]: This is a line item in your budget when
you are thinking about who you're hiring
[SPEAKER_09]: when you were thinking about how you're
going to forecast Financials if you're
[SPEAKER_09]: talking about how you're going to get
investment This is the biggest piece of
[SPEAKER_09]: that it falls into compliance The
uncomfortable number that I generally tell
[SPEAKER_09]: clients is it's 20 to 30 percent of your
operating budget currently Moving forward
[SPEAKER_09]: that should be designated to specifically
compliance when I say that I do not mean
[SPEAKER_09]: legal I mean track and trace compliance
I'd like to chime in that from like the
[SPEAKER_04]: dispensary point of view because we're the
outlet that actually moves all the product
[SPEAKER_04]: and I know that a lot of people are
freaking out I mean you said it so
[SPEAKER_04]: comically, but it was scary as shit like
the stuff that we're gonna have to do But
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually excited about this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel like here in California We're
building the national platform for how we
[SPEAKER_04]: are gonna move This entire movement that
every single one of us is involved in and
[SPEAKER_04]: that we've been wanting this to be
national and international And we are the
[SPEAKER_04]: pioneers in this industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if this kind of shit scares you good
However, if it's gonna prevent you from
[SPEAKER_04]: doing it right get out of the industry
because we have no choice now comment when
[SPEAKER_04]: we have laws and regulations that we don't
want to see that are not guided by people
[SPEAKER_04]: that work in the industry or understand
the industry, but there's a lot of this
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff that's really important and that you
know having a system that's gonna be
[SPEAKER_04]: integrated having good software that's
gonna assist you along the way and Setting
[SPEAKER_04]: up good SOPs right now Last week last year
to get you prepared for what you're gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: do And if this is the kind of stuff that
like I have seen when they when I got at
[SPEAKER_04]: this industry Four years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were preparing for this and this is
what we have continued to do and we know
[SPEAKER_04]: that we are gonna have to continue to
fight if you're gonna be alive like over
[SPEAKER_04]: 90% of the companies that were on the
market two years ago are by like you're
[SPEAKER_04]: not here anymore and They're not on my
shelves and we're having to find new
[SPEAKER_04]: product and right now with what we just
went through with July 1st Like my stores
[SPEAKER_04]: were actually in really good condition
continue considering how the other ones
[SPEAKER_04]: were because we had foresight and
understanding that Brett's going on
[SPEAKER_04]: vacation the end of June and we're gonna
get this shit taken care of beforehand and
[SPEAKER_04]: that really what drove me to get it done
but honestly like we were sitting so much
[SPEAKER_04]: better than a lot of stores because they
just didn't understand how the regulations
[SPEAKER_04]: directly affected them because they don't
take a Stance and understand that they
[SPEAKER_04]: need to to read these regulations and
that's why we're hiring people on also to
[SPEAKER_04]: just hire just to handle compliance
because as the director of operations as
[SPEAKER_04]: the buyer for the store I can't do it all
I wear too many hats And I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_07]: sound pessimistic about track and trace
because I'm very excited The principal is
[SPEAKER_07]: very exciting to me when I worked at the
Board of Equalization.
[SPEAKER_07]: We talked about track and trace We talked
about what agencies were gonna be
[SPEAKER_07]: implemented.
[SPEAKER_07]: What type of data was gonna be
incorporated into a track and trace
[SPEAKER_07]: system.
[SPEAKER_07]: I believe track and trace Is a good thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just want to know Exactly from my angle.
[SPEAKER_07]: What is what I'm responsible for and you
know some timelines when it's gonna be in
[SPEAKER_07]: place when You know, there's been some
promises by the state that haven't come to
[SPEAKER_07]: fruition.
[SPEAKER_07]: So here we are So I'm very excited for
track and trace I think it's good for all
[SPEAKER_07]: the the legal compliant actors and it
Reinforces our place in the marketplace It
[SPEAKER_09]: also provides you Just from a economic
standpoint if you are prepared you're not
[SPEAKER_09]: going to suffer I think this is one of
those great examples in time where if you
[SPEAKER_09]: are an early adopter You are going to reap
those benefits.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's difficult I know from both the
operators on either of my side will tell
[SPEAKER_09]: you it is a heavy lift But it is one that
ultimately will position them in the
[SPEAKER_09]: marketplace to succeed They'll be
responsible.
[SPEAKER_09]: They'll be known as responsible operators
along the supply chain And from the retail
[SPEAKER_09]: perspective they'll be trusted by the
public to go in secure the type of
[SPEAKER_09]: medication or recreational product that
they want so as long as you are taking an
[SPEAKER_09]: active a proactive stance about imposing
what you believe to be What the state
[SPEAKER_09]: wants is we're starting to get that to be
crystallized if you have processes in
[SPEAKER_09]: place SOPs if you're using them if you're
sending your shipping manifest if you're
[SPEAKER_09]: using the Tools that the agencies have
given you thus far Correcting them won't
[SPEAKER_09]: be such a painful lift As what you hear
from others who are like this is gonna
[SPEAKER_09]: take out my business.
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, if you weren't planning for that
Unfortunately, that's the reality of what
[SPEAKER_07]: will happen and that's a great point I
mean a river that's what we've been doing,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know We've been sending our shipping
our invoices and our manifest into the BCC
[SPEAKER_07]: daily all the test results on products and
you know January 1st all have gone to the
[SPEAKER_07]: bureau and We are gearing ourselves up for
this We were gearing ourselves up for the
[SPEAKER_07]: for the transfer the July 1st deadline
Even though there was a lot of information
[SPEAKER_07]: like oh, they're gonna extend it.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're gonna extend it I'd never ever
once thought that they were gonna extend
[SPEAKER_07]: the July 1st deadline I just you know,
I know everybody in industry was like it's
[SPEAKER_07]: gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're gonna extend it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I Just being a regulator and being on that
side I knew that would never happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know being ready for this stuff
conditioning yourselves It's like,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know jogging in the morning.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're running trying to build up for a
race.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what this is So I would recommend
you do and that was a great point And what
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to add on to that is that as a
buyer I had so many companies that I have
[SPEAKER_04]: talked to you since January 1st in
February when we got our license that
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna be ready for July.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're gonna be you know, your packaging
is gonna be there your lab testing is
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna be there and I've had all Of these
companies swear to me up and down that
[SPEAKER_04]: they were gonna have their shit together
in a basket Ready to go and it was not
[SPEAKER_04]: anywhere close to the basket like nothing
was together We had where my entire one of
[SPEAKER_04]: my departments would be down to from 15
different brands or different You know
[SPEAKER_04]: varieties down to one item and I had
several companies that had their stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: together Like I'm gonna give props to
heavy hitters and dosis They were huge and
[SPEAKER_04]: some of these companies like up north and
island that Were able to give me a range
[SPEAKER_04]: of products to have on my shelf when no
other store really had it, you know That's
[SPEAKER_04]: something that we did not have the
foresight these companies did not and
[SPEAKER_04]: that's gonna stick on me as a buyer
Remembering that you swore to me that you
[SPEAKER_04]: would have it together and you did not and
right now I'm taking a lot of companies
[SPEAKER_04]: Without the maybe the background that I'm
searching for and want to have that time
[SPEAKER_04]: where we can sit down and have a dialogue
But that time will be over soon where it's
[SPEAKER_04]: like, you know Right now I need product
but here in the next few months things
[SPEAKER_00]: will be very different as companies move
forward and I do think I just like to sit
[SPEAKER_00]: as Painful as it is for operators to be
the guinea pigs during this period It is
[SPEAKER_00]: an incredible opportunity that we've
gotten to actually operate under emergency
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations and have the opportunity to
truly experience the issues and problems
[SPEAKER_00]: and hiccups so that we Can in this common
period before the regulations are
[SPEAKER_00]: permanent Have the opportunity to actually
test it out a little bit and then suggest
[SPEAKER_00]: it but there's no I mean it's not to
understate at all the impact that it has
[SPEAKER_00]: been on operators and how difficult it is
for them to try to remain compliant
[SPEAKER_00]: through the process because something that
might be as easy for a regulatory agency
[SPEAKER_00]: is changing some language has tens if not
hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of
[SPEAKER_00]: Impact on an actual operating business
that has to redesign their packaging or
[SPEAKER_00]: pivot or bring on all this extra Labor or
any just the the time that it takes where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're like you can put a sticker on it
and just the cost of labor To have a bunch
[SPEAKER_00]: of people put a sticker on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly that those aspects are you
know Incredibly difficult for the
[SPEAKER_00]: companies to be nimble, but it is
important to keep your eyes far away Far
[SPEAKER_00]: forward on the horizon of those
regulations to see what's coming the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Public Health said that in
the first five months of the new
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations post January 1st They got
almost zero questions about packaging and
[SPEAKER_00]: labeling in the transition period It was
only in that last few weeks before it
[SPEAKER_00]: kicked in that suddenly everybody was
like, oh shit You're serious like this is
[SPEAKER_00]: happening and it was very difficult for
the companies that were not Prepared to do
[SPEAKER_09]: that pivot the universal symbol in case
anybody is unclear at this point It shall
[SPEAKER_09]: be black if your packaging is black then
it can be well not on flower We're talking
[SPEAKER_09]: about manufactured goods.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very important Manufactured goods.
[SPEAKER_09]: It must be black on flower wherever you
want to put it but on Manufactured goods.
[SPEAKER_09]: It must be black.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can splash some white on the back of
it and Still put it on black packaging
[SPEAKER_09]: like if we spent less time Being upset
about that concept there were many
[SPEAKER_09]: solutions So if you again if you stay
ahead of it if you're talking to your
[SPEAKER_09]: other operators if you're going to your
trade associations There are so many
[SPEAKER_09]: solutions and as an industry I am always
constantly amazed at the ability to pivot
[SPEAKER_09]: and the creativity that comes from the
cannabis space if you were Willing to just
[SPEAKER_09]: engage in a conversation and it should not
go unsaid all of you that are here You're
[SPEAKER_09]: doing the first step in ensuring the
success of your business So you should
[SPEAKER_09]: feel very accomplished and proud of
yourselves for showing up That is
[SPEAKER_09]: basically what the cannabis industry as a
whole does it shows up?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean just going through this whole
process and being a compliance director
[SPEAKER_07]: for a distribution company so I mean
constantly on the phone with Brands that
[SPEAKER_07]: we represent and with the retailers we so
and we're talking about regulations We're
[SPEAKER_07]: talking about where that damn Universal
symbol is supposed to be and what color
[SPEAKER_07]: it's supposed to be and I like those
conversations I think that's healthy I
[SPEAKER_07]: think you know, we may disagree and you
know, and maybe we have a different
[SPEAKER_07]: reading of the regs, but I think that's
great We're all trying to get to this
[SPEAKER_07]: place this compliant place wherever the
state wants us to go and I know the final
[SPEAKER_07]: regs have different packaging Requirements
now, so pay attention to that,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know child resistant packaging
according to the proposed final regs is on
[SPEAKER_07]: the retailer now So we'll see if that
actually Actually happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah whiplash But I also want to say
that What we do know what we do know about
[SPEAKER_00]: track and trace if you have a temporary
license, you're not required to be on it
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on your locality.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to say because there are some
local There's some localities and up in
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt that have their own local track
and trace that you have to be functioning
[SPEAKER_00]: on already But as far as the state is
concerned and metric is concerned it will
[SPEAKER_00]: be with the issuance of your annual
license a clock starts ticking and you get
[SPEAKER_00]: your annual license and you have so much
time to onboard to get your designated
[SPEAKER_00]: account manager for metric track and trace
to be trained And it's a five-day window I
[SPEAKER_00]: believe in the regs right now from if we
have five days from getting your license
[SPEAKER_00]: to have that person do the training as
soon as they've done that training you
[SPEAKER_00]: have 30 days to input every product you
have at whatever stage that it's in into
[SPEAKER_00]: your track and trace everything has to be
input in that 30 days and After that
[SPEAKER_00]: period of time it's seed to sale Nothing
can enter the system that isn't existing
[SPEAKER_00]: in your system already at that point and
and this is where I would actually really
[SPEAKER_04]: like to see us making comments all of us
in the industry because as it comes to the
[SPEAKER_04]: operator side like again, we're the ones
moving your stuff and getting it into
[SPEAKER_04]: patients hands and getting it to customers
hands is that it would be wonderful and
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not Anticipating this is that we
really spend this fall and this this in
[SPEAKER_04]: this early winter into focus on what the
hell metric is and All of us learning
[SPEAKER_04]: about it all of going into multiple
training modules so that We can really
[SPEAKER_04]: master this so we have a smooth transition
because I don't know about y'all But none
[SPEAKER_04]: of this has been very smooth like this has
been just combated with questions
[SPEAKER_04]: constantly So I would really love for the
state to say hey guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody's gonna work on this this fall
We're gonna get everybody's licensing
[SPEAKER_04]: because you know, they've missed a lot of
marks the state has totally missed
[SPEAKER_04]: deadlines has left us in just waiting the
playing the waiting game just hurry up and
[SPEAKER_04]: wait and What I would love is for them to
say hey everybody on January 1st 2019
[SPEAKER_04]: that's when metric starts because I'm even
confused as an operator that when my
[SPEAKER_04]: stores are some of the first stores here
in LA that were licensed is I'm gonna be
[SPEAKER_04]: placed in a situation where am I only
gonna be able to buy product from
[SPEAKER_04]: distributors that are metric track and
trace well then there I go again with
[SPEAKER_04]: February when I couldn't buy product or in
July 1st when I don't have any product on
[SPEAKER_04]: my shelves that every time we do this This
is a huge expense.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, we've been in this game long
enough that we should have kind of had
[SPEAKER_04]: some foresight on This and some money in
the bank, but it is the situation Great
[SPEAKER_09]: comment point, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Excellent metric is a it's supposed to
start from zero I think what we've seen in
[SPEAKER_09]: other states that have had an easier time
is it has a beginning point Unfortunately
[SPEAKER_09]: as clunky as it was that didn't start on
January 1 here in California so for
[SPEAKER_09]: commenting that we have this opportunity
to start and that even Temporary licensees
[SPEAKER_09]: everybody January 1 2019 we do metric if
that's a universal comment We could be so
[SPEAKER_09]: powerful as an industry to ask for that
Just looking at what has happened in other
[SPEAKER_09]: states.
[SPEAKER_09]: We know I think there was a great article
and MJ business daily over the weekend
[SPEAKER_09]: about Maryland and the API that was part
of metric was trying to help Consumers
[SPEAKER_09]: which was a great thing right you as a
consumer Would want to know how much
[SPEAKER_09]: you've purchased and how much you can
purchase within your purchasing limits.
[SPEAKER_09]: Not everybody is a mathematician I know
I'm a lawyer my math skills probably not
[SPEAKER_09]: the best I would love if there was a
software that told me how much I still
[SPEAKER_09]: could buy as a consumer what that did
unfortunately was overload the system and
[SPEAKER_09]: Therefore even other states outside of
Maryland had an impact because metric
[SPEAKER_09]: wasn't able to keep up with the volume
What does that say to me?
[SPEAKER_09]: California is the highest volume of users
from an operational standpoint than the
[SPEAKER_09]: teeny-tiny state of Maryland So we
probably have more operators than they had
[SPEAKER_09]: both operators and consumers working So if
we take that into consideration and that's
[SPEAKER_09]: sort of the basis of your comment Then
maybe we can be effective to really use
[SPEAKER_09]: that time as Brett said to be prepared for
metric So as a distributor, this is what I
[SPEAKER_07]: want to see for metric So we have very
clear responsibilities according to state
[SPEAKER_07]: law and the regs.
[SPEAKER_07]: We collect the cultivation tax.
[SPEAKER_07]: We collect the excise tax We are
responsible for facilitating state
[SPEAKER_07]: certified testing producing a COA on the
product We also under the current metric
[SPEAKER_07]: system, we have to check and make sure
that everything's entered in correctly and
[SPEAKER_07]: right now from the training that my
company has has received from from metric
[SPEAKER_07]: and I'm not trying to I don't want to like
sound like I'm knocking metric or and
[SPEAKER_07]: maybe Also something we need to consider
too is maybe the state's kind of slow
[SPEAKER_07]: rolling this as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe it's not metric Maybe you know,
there's there's issues going on in the
[SPEAKER_07]: state with implementation So you have to
remember that but these are important
[SPEAKER_07]: issues that I need to see Where I can as a
distributor where I can track these issues
[SPEAKER_07]: where especially like taxes the
cultivation tax is a primary Example right
[SPEAKER_07]: now.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm supposed to collect cultivation taxes
on product that was manufactured into a
[SPEAKER_07]: candy bar and how am I supposed to know as
a distributor how much product how much
[SPEAKER_07]: flour or how much trim was actually put
into that product and Therefore remitting
[SPEAKER_07]: it to CDT FA California Department of Tax
and Fee Administration.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry for that acronyms I need to see I
need to see that information as a
[SPEAKER_07]: distributor, you know all that information
For the retailers when I send an invoice
[SPEAKER_07]: to a retailer, you know the excise tax I
need to make sure that that's in the track
[SPEAKER_07]: and trace system I need to make sure that
all this data that's put in is entered in
[SPEAKER_07]: there so as a distributor I can properly
check this and make sure that one I get it
[SPEAKER_07]: to a retailer that it's you know compliant
and everything and also it needs to be
[SPEAKER_07]: expeditious We don't need to be slowing
down.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's already slow right now You hinted at
a lot of the brands not being on board and
[SPEAKER_07]: we were we were there too a lot of our
brands Just didn't believe us and so
[SPEAKER_07]: they're catching up.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know making this process as
expeditious as possible It's already slow
[SPEAKER_07]: with that and testing and everything.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know, that's that's what I want to
see as as a distributor and I want to get
[SPEAKER_07]: this product out to the retailers as quick
as possible And so they can sell it and
[SPEAKER_07]: put it in the consumers hands So,
you know my company makes money the
[SPEAKER_07]: retailer makes money and the consumer gets
the product that they ultimately want so
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, that's the That's kind of my
view of it and I haven't had a lot of
[SPEAKER_07]: those questions answered from about
metrics So and you know, one of the other
[SPEAKER_09]: thing that's important is and we're
missing in these conversations is the
[SPEAKER_09]: local jurisdictions the more confused they
are the less likely they are to adopt an
[SPEAKER_09]: ordinance we're still at what 30% of the
the state's 482 cities and 58 counties
[SPEAKER_09]: that are regulating When I go out part of
what I do for clients is open up cities I
[SPEAKER_09]: served as the special city attorney for
the city of Hollister drafting their
[SPEAKER_09]: regulatory ordinance one of the biggest
questions they asked was what was going on
[SPEAKER_09]: with track and trace because it was
important for them to know that their
[SPEAKER_09]: operators were going to be adapting into
that similar to what Julia was talking
[SPEAKER_09]: about with Humboldt and SIPA some people
are carrying two tags because it was so
[SPEAKER_09]: important for that county or that city
that jurisdiction To have some semblance
[SPEAKER_09]: of track and trace when the state wasn't
able to answer those critical questions So
[SPEAKER_09]: it's also understanding that so you can
engage with your municipalities For those
[SPEAKER_09]: of you that are going through the planning
and building process that haven't opened
[SPEAKER_09]: yet.
[SPEAKER_09]: These are real critical questions They'll
also come back to how you pay your local
[SPEAKER_09]: taxes Because they're gonna want to look
at your track and trace to make sure that
[SPEAKER_09]: you're paying the appropriate amount So
this is really a systemic issue It's a
[SPEAKER_09]: bedrock issue for me and one that
everybody needs to be able to speak
[SPEAKER_09]: eloquently on because you're gonna have
questions from your retailer from your
[SPEAKER_09]: distributor from your cultivator from your
city from the state Investing in this and
[SPEAKER_09]: really starting to understand it even
though it's complicated and difficult is
[SPEAKER_09]: going to be How you are successful?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're all spending a lot of money on
point-of-sale systems and ERP's and we
[SPEAKER_07]: have no idea How those are gonna tie into
the track and trace system?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I would and this is very this is huge
because this is if they do not tie in
[SPEAKER_07]: properly You're gonna be doing a lot of
manual entry which is gonna increase your
[SPEAKER_07]: operations cost So it's gonna hit your
it's gonna hit your pocketbook.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I believe you will see the marketing
points for POS systems radically transform
[SPEAKER_00]: with the launch of track and trace where
it's gonna go from its Beautiful and iPad
[SPEAKER_00]: interface to does it talk to track and
trace and does it talk to it in an?
[SPEAKER_00]: Automated way or a manual way which I
would say when you are talking to your POS
[SPEAKER_00]: companies is a number one question to ask
because a lot of them will be like sure it
[SPEAKER_00]: Interfaces with track and trace but what
they mean is it at the end of the day?
[SPEAKER_00]: You can download a CSV file that you're
gonna spend hours formatting the columns
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you're gonna try To upload it to
track and trace and 98% of the time it's
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna fail and you're gonna rip all your
hair out and it's not actually Updating
[SPEAKER_00]: track and trace in an automated way.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's the point as I work I have a
client who's a very well-known POS
[SPEAKER_09]: provider track and trace provider And one
of our biggest issues right now is that
[SPEAKER_09]: it's not the API with metric doesn't work
So it's not that they can tell you that
[SPEAKER_09]: they can do something.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's that it doesn't Compute so you do at
the end of the day with several of these
[SPEAKER_09]: almost all of the POS systems Will have to
do some manual data entry and those are
[SPEAKER_09]: important questions to ask and I don't
think there is that Widget or that fix
[SPEAKER_09]: that's been made yet to make that API work
So I just want to like kind of jump on
[SPEAKER_04]: that one too about POS systems is
obviously at any retail business that is a
[SPEAKER_04]: cornerstone of how you stay compliant and
able to be successful and getting people
[SPEAKER_04]: in and out of your store and So we we
formerly had bio track and we were ready
[SPEAKER_04]: to try something that was gonna be a
little bit more Modern and that was gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: have some better abilities for us And so
we had tried out we had talked with
[SPEAKER_04]: several companies and we made a decision
to go with the company trees I've heard
[SPEAKER_04]: multiple different things from multiple
different companies one of the companies
[SPEAKER_04]: that I highly recommend As well as green
bits every time I've worked with them
[SPEAKER_04]: They've been amazing like their team is
and from everything that I've being told
[SPEAKER_04]: as well that they are metric compliant and
And integrated and they will be fully
[SPEAKER_04]: working with that because at the end of
the night I'm gonna be paying all this
[SPEAKER_04]: extra payroll and be going through
managers quite rapidly when they're gonna
[SPEAKER_04]: have to be staying there late uploading
and making sure that when that distributor
[SPEAKER_04]: dropped off that product at my store that
we entered in that 24-digit pen or if not,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's gonna Kick back the entire damn
report and that is gonna be Bad staff
[SPEAKER_04]: morale and that's honestly one of my most
important things that I look for in my
[SPEAKER_04]: store is making sure that my staff is
happy because of a staff is happy they're
[SPEAKER_04]: productive and that metric is really gonna
slow things down and that's why we need to
[SPEAKER_04]: streamline this stuff as much as possible
so that's why you're very much you urge
[SPEAKER_04]: you to please Comment and and speak about
how we need to postpone maybe metrics so
[SPEAKER_04]: that we all jump on at the same time so
that we're all on the same page and on
[SPEAKER_04]: that is please If you're in the industry
and we get that allowance do not take it
[SPEAKER_04]: for granted Actually do like do your
homework and I think there's a gentleman
[SPEAKER_00]: over here that actually had a question
just summarizing the question it was that
[SPEAKER_00]: this gentleman has multiple license types
he's gonna get hit from cultivation retail
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution and manufacturing in the
Track-and-trace requirements therein and
[SPEAKER_00]: has been approached by many different
out-of-state operator Consultant saying
[SPEAKER_00]: you know we can help you with training In
advance of this system and how useful that
[SPEAKER_00]: may or may not be and what do you do to
prepare now?
[SPEAKER_09]: For that system it's important to remember
that California is unique I think this is
[SPEAKER_09]: a tried-and-true issue sometimes
out-of-state consultants are great right
[SPEAKER_09]: am I gonna knock that but when you're in
California you've got Resources all around
[SPEAKER_09]: you we are all going through this
together.
[SPEAKER_09]: I don't know if any of you are on
bandwatch But Jackie McGowan site is great
[SPEAKER_09]: it will network you with others who are
going through and suffering through some
[SPEAKER_09]: of the same trials and tribulations that
you are going through and together like I
[SPEAKER_09]: said before California is very resilient
and as an industry we tend and and now
[SPEAKER_09]: need to Lean on each other more because we
have different license types problem with
[SPEAKER_09]: outside Consultants is they come in and
they tell you oh, so you're a myth No,
[SPEAKER_09]: you're not you're a manufacturer And
you're a type 6 type you're a type 7 type
[SPEAKER_09]: 6 type n type p right you're different And
now you're not just different in semantics
[SPEAKER_09]: You're different in what you're allowed to
do and how the product moves through the
[SPEAKER_09]: supply chain So you're a vertically
integrated business there are other
[SPEAKER_09]: vertically integrated businesses go to
your community your cannabis community and
[SPEAKER_09]: Ask what those problems are as we go
through it together I know CCIA will wind
[SPEAKER_09]: up doing a lot of metric training and
there will be a committee on that go to
[SPEAKER_09]: your trade Associations that are local and
pull from your local community because it
[SPEAKER_09]: is true I've seen outside consultants come
in and do an application and don't realize
[SPEAKER_09]: that a local application is the equivalent
of another state state level application
[SPEAKER_09]: and I all of a sudden have to clean up a
mess for a client that maybe got ousted
[SPEAKER_09]: from a Jurisdiction that they should have
been in so it's it's a tagline of be
[SPEAKER_09]: cautious Beware be your best advocate if
somebody tells you that they can tell you
[SPEAKER_09]: how metric is gonna work in California Ask
them to show you first the proof is in the
[SPEAKER_09]: pudding who else have you done this for I?
[SPEAKER_00]: also think that the like I was reading the
list before where this is where you're
[SPEAKER_00]: practicing your internal programs and
building them around the stated regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: requirements for record-keeping is the
best thing that you can look at is What is
[SPEAKER_00]: it saying in the regs are these?
[SPEAKER_00]: Checkpoints of when do I have to weigh it
when do I have to report it when do I have
[SPEAKER_00]: to write a data?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do I you know all of these transfer
points the shipping manifest is already
[SPEAKER_00]: something?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a document.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna be in track and trace That's
already been released by the agency that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are supposed to be using now I
don't know how many of you guys are
[SPEAKER_00]: actually using a shipping manifest to move
product from one locate good for you Bcc
[SPEAKER_07]: .ca.gov you send it to the basic BCC
website do it every day That's great And
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's the good thing about this period
before track and trace is kicked in is
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's practice It's paper practice
because you do not want to be trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure this out when the 30-day clock is
ticking To actually enter it all in there
[SPEAKER_00]: for real you want to be able to
Troubleshoot and test drive these systems
[SPEAKER_00]: and have your staff be confident and know
what they're doing and informed about the
[SPEAKER_00]: checkpoints and not have it all be This
incredible load that's dumped on them in
[SPEAKER_00]: this very short window and in working I
mean it's the big catchphrase now
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody talks about culture of
compliance and a culture of compliance But
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hugely important because it's very
important and from every level of your
[SPEAKER_00]: employees To understand why they have to
do this and not think that it's just some
[SPEAKER_00]: Ridiculous rigmarole that you're making up
to make their lives difficult that it is a
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory legal requirement that could
result in tremendous amounts of fines in
[SPEAKER_00]: the loss of your license if somebody
doesn't fill out the form and I know Julie
[SPEAKER_09]: does this we do this at my In my companies
we can come out and audit you there are
[SPEAKER_09]: Compliance services that will come out and
we will work through that with you and
[SPEAKER_09]: we'll say oh You know what?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hey your seller's permit's not out You
know that nifty little temporary license
[SPEAKER_09]: that you got that's sitting in the back
office that has to go out in a conspicuous
[SPEAKER_09]: place for everybody To see and we'll go
through and look at your shipping manifest
[SPEAKER_09]: and see that you're doing it correctly Now
that is a great expense that has a huge
[SPEAKER_09]: ROI for your company So hire an outside
person before BCC DFA or DPH come out and
[SPEAKER_09]: do an on-site audit So there are companies
out there that do that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You just need to look for them and I know
this gentleman has been so patient I am
[SPEAKER_02]: the California market manager technology
Yes,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was 100% correct California is a lot
more complex.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are acting as a country With our laws
and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would interject and tell some of my
clients.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess you guys here Asking from out of
state how they did things.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have resources in my classes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Give my card afterwards They have plenty
of SOP that people have dealt with metric
[SPEAKER_02]: The three biggest things that I would say
about metric is gonna suck Number one,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's not to be a punchline or anything
like that bad data in is bad data out You
[SPEAKER_02]: have to have your smartest people on that
system or you're gonna be fucked I agree
[SPEAKER_04]: with that 100% Couldn't have said that
better Something that I've been blessed
[SPEAKER_04]: with is colleagues and friends in this
industry that have helped me along the way
[SPEAKER_04]: and I do kind of want to give a shout out
to One of my closest colleagues and I
[SPEAKER_04]: consider a true friend is Cassie Walker in
the back and she is the SOP Queen She is
[SPEAKER_04]: the one that comes through and make sure
that every all the eyes are dotted the T
[SPEAKER_04]: are crossed and has gotten our inventory
on point with our stores because that is
[SPEAKER_04]: something in our industry as people just
took No responsibility for where there was
[SPEAKER_04]: their inventory was the only time you
counted it is if you needed to order the
[SPEAKER_04]: product And then I was like, yeah,
it's a little off like that's not gonna be
[SPEAKER_04]: acceptable like everything has to be on
point and that was what I was really
[SPEAKER_04]: excited this morning is when I was in the
store over at Green Cross and Cassie comes
[SPEAKER_04]: through and like all the flowers on point
and I'm like, that's amazing because that
[SPEAKER_04]: is what we have to work to you like
metrics not gonna be that bad if your
[SPEAKER_04]: Inventories are on point and your SOPs are
on point and you actually have protocols
[SPEAKER_04]: and this is what's forcing us to
professionalize our industry I come from
[SPEAKER_04]: emergency veterinary medicine where we
have controlled drugs like shit that
[SPEAKER_04]: actually kills people and you know unlike
cannabis, you know, and so it's like we
[SPEAKER_04]: have to count our fentanyl every month we
have to count our morphine and our
[SPEAKER_04]: hydromorphone and and ketamine and We have
to actually count this stuff and actually
[SPEAKER_04]: provide this to the state and to the
federal government on where this is going
[SPEAKER_04]: and so when I got into cannabis I was so
shocked because we had no accountability
[SPEAKER_04]: whatsoever people would just show up with
a trash bag full of weed and Then you know
[SPEAKER_04]: it sell it to the store and it's now we're
in this system where it's like you have to
[SPEAKER_04]: take responsibility for where you're at
and a lot of people that are griping about
[SPEAKER_04]: it they just don't want to change the way
that they're doing things but this is
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna make us better and You'll have
somebody on your team that knows how to
[SPEAKER_04]: write SOPs and knows how to adapt to when
we get a new regulation instead of sitting
[SPEAKER_04]: there and wasting all this energy bitching
and moaning about it like actually put
[SPEAKER_04]: that energy into it and I have been
blessed with the people around me in this
[SPEAKER_04]: industry that share the same level of
integrity and the philosophy of the
[SPEAKER_04]: movement of cannabis and want to see this
to be successful and that's what I'm very
[SPEAKER_00]: thankful for and to echo what the
gentleman from Baker was saying one of the
[SPEAKER_00]: most tremendous resources that I've had
For really getting a glimpse into how
[SPEAKER_00]: metric and track and trace works and what
it looks like is doing demos with POS
[SPEAKER_00]: companies in other states because you can
go look at look at the other states that
[SPEAKER_00]: have track and trace the other states that
have metric who are the top what are the
[SPEAKER_00]: POS companies working there and call them
up and they have been the most helpful
[SPEAKER_00]: people and I have done walkthroughs and
Demos and they've showed me what the forms
[SPEAKER_00]: look like and how it looks like to enter
it and how it interfaces with that and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're they're a tremendous resource and
then what's great is you can ask them for
[SPEAKER_00]: references of what companies are they
working with there and then have those
[SPEAKER_00]: companies help you understand how's that
process what's it like and that that
[SPEAKER_00]: community is available that we're not the
first while there are Distinctions and
[SPEAKER_00]: complications to California.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not the first ones going into this
track and trace system So there are other
[SPEAKER_00]: people who have experience to share and
that's a difference Between a consultant
[SPEAKER_09]: and a company so a company that's gonna
walk you through a POS system or if you
[SPEAKER_09]: call a cultivator or a manufacturer you
meet somebody an upcoming NCIA Who is in
[SPEAKER_09]: another metric state and you ask them
those questions that is very different
[SPEAKER_09]: than a consultant So I just want to make
sure that that was said because I think
[SPEAKER_09]: that was a great point and thank you for
raising it The other thing I will say is
[SPEAKER_09]: start reconciling your inventory every 14
days You got to do it when you come
[SPEAKER_09]: online.
[SPEAKER_09]: It should be something That as soon as you
get the temp permit before you do because
[SPEAKER_09]: now everybody that's getting temp permits
is starting day one Right day one you do
[SPEAKER_09]: your inventory 14 days later.
[SPEAKER_09]: You reconcile that inventory make it a
pattern in a practice It'll be a habit
[SPEAKER_09]: that you will just automatically you and
your staff will know how to do and the 14
[SPEAKER_07]: days is a requirement and BCC reg so
that's just not just the number she was
[SPEAKER_07]: making up that's actually like a
requirement so We're practicing that too.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if you're you know, you have to be
within 2% So it's kind of a fine kind of a
[SPEAKER_07]: fine line.
[SPEAKER_07]: So, you know practice that My only we
mentioned about other states now others a
[SPEAKER_07]: lot of other states don't have a
distribution model So so this is where
[SPEAKER_07]: track and trace kind of worries me and I
can't really look to another state on What
[SPEAKER_07]: I need is a distributor from metric and
what what I can expect I mean,
[SPEAKER_07]: we'll figure it out whatever it is,
but it's a little tough for us But I am
[SPEAKER_07]: glad that you know for retailers that you
know, they have some examples.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Rico Sorry for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anybody didn't hear me we work with a ton
of POS systems across the across the
[SPEAKER_01]: nation a ton of track and trace systems
and Bottom line is California is more
[SPEAKER_01]: complex.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more volume than everywhere else.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have different channels than everywhere
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to suck Is a platform chosen by
the state whether it's biotech whether
[SPEAKER_01]: it's Metric there's other systems as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't know what they're doing They
get chosen by the state They get a
[SPEAKER_01]: contract and it's gonna crash a bunch of
times whether it's metric whether it is
[SPEAKER_01]: your POS you're using So this is why I was
saying I wasn't trying to joke or anything
[SPEAKER_01]: get your smartest people on the system
because your business is on the line
[SPEAKER_01]: Number one, you need a backup person as
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You need a great great SOPs for backups As
well you need truth in data as well our
[SPEAKER_01]: company we try to connect all your system
so everybody has The same data work with
[SPEAKER_01]: with Rick companies that work with other
platforms as well because you're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: need those backups You're gonna need that
integrity from your backup system and then
[SPEAKER_01]: your backup to your backup system I know
it sounds like a lot and it is a lot but
[SPEAKER_01]: these are things you need to do to operate
in this business Alright, so when you go
[SPEAKER_01]: out and you have a lot of POS system
saying that oh, yeah We're POS compliant
[SPEAKER_01]: or we're a metric compliant in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a lie They've applied And
they've passed the tests, but they're not
[SPEAKER_01]: compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody's using the system yet So what you
should do there's some systems that are
[SPEAKER_01]: working.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some POS is that are working out
of state They're compliant with metric ask
[SPEAKER_01]: them questions It doesn't mean they're
gonna have all the answers because nobody
[SPEAKER_01]: is doing it in California If you have a
POS that is that is approved by metric ask
[SPEAKER_01]: them a ton of questions ask their Clients
a ton of questions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't jump in because it's a new shiny
object and it looks good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Make sure that it works And then you
always keep the other guys phone number
[SPEAKER_01]: handy because something will fail And if
they're not giving you the service you
[SPEAKER_01]: need move.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I gotta say All right,
I want to leave a little time for
[SPEAKER_09]: questions does anybody have any questions
Make sure that you're working with
[SPEAKER_09]: companies that are willing to interface
together If you're not compliant in what
[SPEAKER_09]: respect You could lose your license your
license could be revoked and then you
[SPEAKER_09]: could be precluded From then going into
another jurisdiction.
[SPEAKER_09]: We can look no further than our neighbor
Colorado who lives to try to come into
[SPEAKER_09]: California Sweet leaf is a good example,
right looping that was an issue that and
[SPEAKER_09]: this that's a great example actually sweet
leaf because let's let's think about it
[SPEAKER_09]: break it down the issue was looping right
and They were asking whether or not you
[SPEAKER_09]: could buy more than one ounce in one day
So you just went to the back of the line.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that a good SOP practice in general?
[SPEAKER_09]: If you were a retail operator and somebody
told you oh, yeah, you could do that Don't
[SPEAKER_09]: worry the rigs they say that they're just
ambiguous in that area Does that seem like
[SPEAKER_09]: you would be diverting product?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is there a reason that one person would
need to purchase an entire pound of
[SPEAKER_09]: marijuana in one day for themselves and
wasn't going to spread Around to other
[SPEAKER_09]: people if it sounds like a bad idea It
probably is because now that company will
[SPEAKER_09]: have to because in both local
jurisdictions in California and the state
[SPEAKER_09]: if you have any violation same or similar
within a marijuana industry you have to
[SPEAKER_09]: disclose it and if you think that with the
high level of competition in this state a
[SPEAKER_09]: local jurisdiction is going to select an
operator who had 29 26 licenses Revoked in
[SPEAKER_09]: the city of Denver because they were
providing too much product without
[SPEAKER_09]: Tracking and tracing and ensuring that
there wasn't diversion Then that is it and
[SPEAKER_09]: that will never happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: So compliance today is Your livelihood
tomorrow because this happened what four
[SPEAKER_09]: or five years later They don't hair once
these agencies said the dust settles and
[SPEAKER_09]: they have nothing better to do they have
five years To audit you here in
[SPEAKER_09]: California.
[SPEAKER_02]: What you do today will harm you tomorrow
And I think that that goes like back to
[SPEAKER_04]: what Pamela was saying here is that your
SOP is in place So staying compliant
[SPEAKER_04]: should be how you make sure that every day
you're going through that but also having
[SPEAKER_04]: integrity on how you run your business So
it's not just about staying compliant Like
[SPEAKER_04]: there's always gonna be loopholes to every
single one of these regulations Like I
[SPEAKER_04]: don't know like having mobile billboards
that run around with medmen on them and
[SPEAKER_04]: they sit them in your back parking Lot of
your business so that whenever you're low
[SPEAKER_04]: on product, it's a mobile billboard for
their company That's the kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: that does not gain you respect in this
industry So maybe you're finding a
[SPEAKER_04]: loophole to be compliant But you are not
gaining the respect of your brothers and
[SPEAKER_04]: sisters that have fought their asses off
to pioneer this industry And that does not
[SPEAKER_04]: gain our respect.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care about competition competition
drives us to do better But when you are
[SPEAKER_04]: going to find loopholes to stay compliant,
but you're just Bullshit with it that
[SPEAKER_04]: upsets me because we're in this I'm in
this for the medicine I care that adult
[SPEAKER_04]: you should be totally legal for people and
we need to stay compliant to make sure
[SPEAKER_04]: that happens But I'm fighting for the
medicine that has saved my life and that
[SPEAKER_09]: has saved so many others So notice they
will come back and get you The cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: industry is a community so every time
there is an issue where License is revoked
[SPEAKER_07]: because of non-compliance That hurts us
all that just doesn't it doesn't hurt just
[SPEAKER_07]: the business that got their license
revoked It hurts us all because when I'm
[SPEAKER_07]: trying to go into another city and they're
like, well I read this article about this
[SPEAKER_07]: company that did this you're probably
gonna do the same, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: You're pretty they lump you all in
together.
[SPEAKER_07]: They lump us all in together And so this
is a community kind of effort too.
[SPEAKER_07]: We all need to be compliant because we're
just hurting everybody else We're keeping
[SPEAKER_07]: another another locality from opening up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you know how many cities there are in
the state of California?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's about 482 cities and 58 counties
and special jurisdictions on top of that
[SPEAKER_07]: this is this is a nation and when we have
a bad actor and One part of the state it
[SPEAKER_07]: could be in the smallest little city.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could affect us all and this it's
important to think of Track and trace is
[SPEAKER_00]: not just some horrible record-keeping Onus
that was came out of thin air.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's an antidote to fear.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an antidote to demonstrating a
comprehensive system of accountability and
[SPEAKER_00]: transparency that does something
unprecedented in Industry, there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: other industry that has ever had to have
this level of rigor From seed to sale and
[SPEAKER_00]: the thing that gets me excited is if we
can do this Then we get to turn around and
[SPEAKER_00]: ask it of other industries to say I want
to know Campbell's soup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where did this tomato come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to know as a consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to see this chain I want to see
where everybody else is doing tomfoolery
[SPEAKER_00]: because they don't have to do this so that
we are pioneering this incredible system
[SPEAKER_00]: of consumer protection of market
protection of transparency of information
[SPEAKER_00]: that everybody on the chain who is a
Compliant operator who cares about
[SPEAKER_00]: patients who cares about what people put
in their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know where did it come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know the legacy of this
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to know what it contains We want
to know what the test results are and so
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not just Some horrible thing that's
happening to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an amazing and comprehensive system
and it also provides federal protection
[SPEAKER_00]: because what we're Demonstrating is that
there is not diversion in our system that
[SPEAKER_00]: these operators are compliant They are
operating compliantly under the state
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much feds You can stay
over there because we are willing to
[SPEAKER_07]: expose this information Yeah, this
gentleman asked how are we submitting our
[SPEAKER_07]: reports to the BCC, correct?
[SPEAKER_07]: So we submit our shipping manifest and our
invoices every day to the BCC before they
[SPEAKER_07]: go out for delivery and then we also
Submit any testing results that we have
[SPEAKER_07]: from product in fact any state certified
tests That come from a lab are submitted
[SPEAKER_07]: to the BCC.
[SPEAKER_07]: So they'll if it passes is no problem If
there's a fail for like a label claim THC
[SPEAKER_07]: CBD or pesticides, which doesn't happen
very often They will inform us what your
[SPEAKER_07]: remediation method will state our
remediation method if it's just a label
[SPEAKER_07]: claim fail distributors in the state of
California can relabel Those those and
[SPEAKER_07]: that's pretty easy as long as they're not
over the limits So yeah, we simply paper
[SPEAKER_07]: records Yeah, we just we just scan them
and and And email them to the BOE or still
[SPEAKER_07]: BCC.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry now Billy Yeah, just PDFs yeah,
just yeah what type what percentage of
[SPEAKER_07]: retailers pay river distributing the taxes
that's a hundred percent Because we
[SPEAKER_07]: collected COD Because we are responsible
for remitting that tax and we have 90 days
[SPEAKER_07]: from whenever that transaction takes place
So we're not gonna float the excise tax
[SPEAKER_07]: There's just no way any distributor in the
right mind shouldn't be doing that You
[SPEAKER_07]: know, I'm sure there's a lot of honest,
you know retailers that would pay those
[SPEAKER_07]: taxes and pay that but honestly in the
position We're in now we collect that COD
[SPEAKER_04]: and you cannot and you actually can't Do
full consignment anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: You actually have to take the excise tax
at the time of delivery So that there's no
[SPEAKER_04]: there is no consignment on excise tax and
I think that that's also something that we
[SPEAKER_04]: need to let patients and customers Know
now it's like this whole I go to events
[SPEAKER_04]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: They keep talking about this 15% I'm like
what 15% are you talking about because
[SPEAKER_04]: this is on Like on the fair market value.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is a 24% tax that patients these are
actual patients So I deal with mothers
[SPEAKER_04]: that spend $1,500 a month before all this
happened to provide seizure medication for
[SPEAKER_04]: their children And now they are getting
hit not just at with excise tax But also
[SPEAKER_04]: with sales tax and then 5% medical tax and
they can't go Get a medical card because
[SPEAKER_04]: the city is so fucked with the way that
they hand these things out that it takes
[SPEAKER_04]: them months to be able to get their actual
card the way that they're supposed to
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're getting denied every time
they go to the office or the Appointments
[SPEAKER_09]: aren't available The sales and use tax
which take to Julie's point earlier,
[SPEAKER_09]: how is that not a lawsuit you are
imposing?
[SPEAKER_09]: taxes adult use taxes for medicine We have
at the but I mean and sorry, you know to
[SPEAKER_07]: bust everybody's bubble But cannabis is
not considered a medicine by the state of
[SPEAKER_07]: California.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't get a recommendation You can't
get a prescription.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can get a recommendation You we had
this issue come up at BoE all the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: In fact, we you know, there was
legislation to basically for medical
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis before prop 64 to have a sales
tax exemption from those products
[SPEAKER_07]: considering a medicine, but it's
considered a Recommendation not a
[SPEAKER_07]: prescription.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not considered a medicine and it's
not You're not relieved of any sales tax
[SPEAKER_07]: liability other than if you're a qualified
medical patient with a card from your
[SPEAKER_05]: county It depends on the business
arrangement so he's asking He's asking if
[SPEAKER_07]: the distributor is required to collect the
excise tax No, and yes, so yes in the
[SPEAKER_07]: sense if it's an arms link transaction and
when I say arms link transaction That
[SPEAKER_07]: means that I'm a distributor and I have no
Absolutely no relationship ownership in
[SPEAKER_07]: the retail arm of that company now There's
a lot of micro businesses out there where
[SPEAKER_07]: they have distribution and retail
manufacturing or cultivation whatever they
[SPEAKER_07]: can have three of those license so If I do
have that relationship then the excise tax
[SPEAKER_05]: is collected at the point of sale on
whatever that product sold for That's a
[SPEAKER_07]: it's an arms link transaction so take for
simple layman's point of view yes that I
[SPEAKER_07]: wouldn't if I didn't own any part of that
retailer.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's an arms links transaction I apply the
state the markup the 60% markup which that
[SPEAKER_07]: you get to your 24% you get to your 24%
number and then I Charged the excise tax
[SPEAKER_07]: and it's on the invoice The dispensary
remits it to the distributor and then we
[SPEAKER_07]: take it and then we remit it to California
Department of Tax and Fee Administration
[SPEAKER_07]: We made up our own invoices that are
compliant We ran them by BCC so he's asked
[SPEAKER_07]: there are some kind of sample invoices out
there sample manifest I just want to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sure we have time to get to all because I
will go deep in the weeds on tax questions
[SPEAKER_00]: That is its own tangled mess of hell so
the gentleman in the back has a question
[SPEAKER_07]: So the question was can you set up a
sandbox to enter the metric system and
[SPEAKER_07]: kind of play around with it?
[SPEAKER_07]: We have entered a sandbox River has But
there's really not much on distribution.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all about cultivation So even though
we're in the sandbox there's really
[SPEAKER_00]: nothing for us to see yeah I mean Fran
well the company that created metrics my
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding was made to track
blueberries in Florida I mean that was
[SPEAKER_00]: what this software was created for It was
never intended to be a cannabis tracking
[SPEAKER_00]: software, and it certainly never
envisioned the maturity and complexity and
[SPEAKER_00]: ingenuity of a California cannabis
marketplace, so There's so many aspects of
[SPEAKER_00]: this software being pushed to do things
that it was not necessary I mean it
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely was not designed to do and it
has not been contemplated yet It's amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: when the regulatory agency were first
releasing some of their application
[SPEAKER_00]: materials like they had no idea how
complex just the product outputs were I
[SPEAKER_00]: think the first thing they had it was like
concentrates shatter vapes That was it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just like they're like what else do
you do with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's just the learning curve that
we're in and I have a lot of empathy for
[SPEAKER_00]: the agencies as well They thought they had
a three-year period Of time to roll out a
[SPEAKER_00]: medical plan and then prop 64 happened,
and it was like oh by the way January you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to do this So it's been a rush job on
all levels And in the active people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are the operators having to navigate that
system with them are the ones who are the
[SPEAKER_00]: guinea pigs and suffer the consequences of
all of these changes That's a really good
[SPEAKER_07]: point.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know when when prop 64 came along I
was working for the BoE and I was thinking
[SPEAKER_07]: hey we just Worked on these medical laws.
[SPEAKER_07]: We got them passed.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna let these roll out.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're gonna get right regulations We're
gonna see how they work and then all of a
[SPEAKER_07]: sudden, you know prop 64 and then we're
like, oh shit, it's gonna pass And so
[SPEAKER_07]: we're gonna have two separate systems
We're gonna have a medical and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_07]: have the adult use system Which we did for
a while until they merged them all
[SPEAKER_07]: together in the Senate bill 94 And then
some other trailer bills So yeah here we
[SPEAKER_04]: are and that's where I would like to see
us stop focusing on the competition that
[SPEAKER_04]: we've definitely Been the business game
for so many years and really rely on each
[SPEAKER_04]: other right now To really move forward
there is gonna be enough business for all
[SPEAKER_04]: of you I promise as an operator like
there's enough for all of you and we need
[SPEAKER_04]: to work together To make this happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you because it truly is our It's a
big issue right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Stop beating each other up I work in
Sacramento and I see these freaking wars
[SPEAKER_07]: we have with one another and like I mean,
it's just ridiculous come on like let's
[SPEAKER_03]: Get over it and work together this
gentleman over here Don't be this guy I
[SPEAKER_03]: don't know if anybody recognizes the guy
in the front of this shirt.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, who is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's this guy's name Yeah, don't be that
guy trying to push all your competition
[SPEAKER_03]: off the cliff while everybody is in this
very perilous situation I mean med men is
[SPEAKER_03]: going around they're handing out cards in
front of every other they're going on to
[SPEAKER_03]: Weed maps and Leafley and basically seeing
which competition is low on products and
[SPEAKER_03]: they're sending street teams to basically
swarm those dispensaries and Hand flyers
[SPEAKER_03]: out drive their med men Distribution
trucks around to basically take their
[SPEAKER_03]: business while they're at their weakest
point that is a fucking shitty practice
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm calling it out and don't any of
you do what they do Compete fight,
[SPEAKER_00]: but do it in the right way so The question
was can we provide clarity as to sampling
[SPEAKER_07]: along all of the supply chain I can give
you an example what we do at River as far
[SPEAKER_07]: as sampling so and we ran this by the
regulators by the taxation officials and I
[SPEAKER_07]: say taxation officials because there's tax
Implications to samples.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we do is we sell samples not for
resale to retailers for a very discounted
[SPEAKER_07]: price and We've gotten clarification from
California Department tax and fee
[SPEAKER_07]: administration that those products are not
under the excise tax regime So they're
[SPEAKER_07]: under the sells and use tax regime So we
charge them sells and use tax whatever
[SPEAKER_07]: that is whatever locality they're in So
that's how we handle samples essentially
[SPEAKER_07]: at River No, but in that situation because
we're making the sell to the retailer as
[SPEAKER_07]: the distributor We're responsible for
collecting that sells and use tax and
[SPEAKER_07]: remitting it to the state So that was a
very that was one of the issues that came
[SPEAKER_07]: up right away It's like hey, we provided
samples to retailers like hey,
[SPEAKER_07]: this is our new latest brand You know,
we want to promote them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, you can't give away cannabis goods
for free anymore, so You know,
[SPEAKER_07]: I think we kind of divide I'm not gonna
say it was you know, the we were the first
[SPEAKER_07]: people thought of it We thought of this
idea of discounted sample products not for
[SPEAKER_07]: resale with a clear sticker And you know
getting on track and trace that we're
[SPEAKER_07]: gonna be able to do that I don't know is
there gonna be a queue for not not for
[SPEAKER_04]: resale and that's the situation for us as
as a buyer for stores as how the days of
[SPEAKER_04]: samples like We're not there anymore Which
is also great though because we also have
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what your lab testing is you I know
what your pesticide testing all of these
[SPEAKER_04]: things that before You know, I I knew a
guy that knew a guy, you know And so it's
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot more respectful as far as how
they're coming at it in the industry Yes,
[SPEAKER_04]: everything is coming into me in sample
form But it's coming into me and an
[SPEAKER_04]: invoice because everything has to be track
and traced If not, then these companies
[SPEAKER_04]: would just be like it's diversion in
itself like oh We're gonna make all this
[SPEAKER_04]: product and call it samples and we're just
not gonna enter into our metric track and
[SPEAKER_04]: trace That's not gonna float because how
are you gonna take all this product and
[SPEAKER_04]: eventually move it down here?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then some of it's gonna have to be
moved into samples You're not gonna know
[SPEAKER_04]: what that is from the beginning So it
needs to come into me with an invoice and
[SPEAKER_04]: so that I can I just go ahead and enter it
into my system right now as Sample,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know floor cowl this, you know when I
get it from River so that I'm able to just
[SPEAKER_04]: go ahead and allocate that out it moves
through my track and trace and BAM It is
[SPEAKER_04]: now sold and out of my system and it has
been paid its taxes the whole way through
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's how we have to move forward
with samples in it's not a bad system It's
[SPEAKER_04]: a way for us to track and trace everything
It's just not the old days where they
[SPEAKER_04]: could just throw down some eights and some
joints and and a vapor cartridge and
[SPEAKER_04]: edibles I use it I Mean that's what
cannabis is for sir like No, and that's
[SPEAKER_07]: the whole purpose we want the we want the
buyers and we want the bud tenders we want
[SPEAKER_07]: To use that product so they can convey
that experience with but back to our
[SPEAKER_00]: original theme I would say that this is an
excellent area begging of your comments
[SPEAKER_00]: during this comment period the agencies
have admitted They had a tremendous blind
[SPEAKER_00]: spot in oversight in terms of any
comprehension of the back-end Actual sales
[SPEAKER_00]: process of what happens and how products
get to the shelf No free samples was
[SPEAKER_00]: intended as a consumer facing issue They
never considered well, how does anybody
[SPEAKER_00]: know what they want to buy?
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially in a system where a retailer
cannot get their money back for a product
[SPEAKER_00]: that they buy and doesn't sell well They
even cannot if the retailer sells a vape
[SPEAKER_00]: cart to a consumer And then they find out
it doesn't work the retailer is supposed
[SPEAKER_00]: to destroy it They can't send it back to
the manufacturer distributor for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: say well I don't know let's find out what
was wrong with it, and let's do some more
[SPEAKER_00]: research, and why are our cartridges
failing?
[SPEAKER_00]: As it's written right now in the regs the
retailer would destroy a defective product
[SPEAKER_00]: Not be able to get return it for a
replacement to the distributor So there's
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of holes in that area to look at in
terms of how should the sales process
[SPEAKER_00]: work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you would think in a
track-and-trace system.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that hard to have a product
category That's listed not for resale
[SPEAKER_00]: these are samples these are for education
these are for R&D like those things,
[SPEAKER_00]: but they but you have to articulate The
need for those solutions as an operator
[SPEAKER_07]: from the back end and one of the issues on
samples is so right now Every sample I
[SPEAKER_07]: give you has to be state certified tested
so it has to go through the whole process
[SPEAKER_07]: of state certified testing You know I
mean, it's like this is one of the on the
[SPEAKER_07]: comment period.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is a huge issue and thanks for
bringing that up I mean, that's that's a
[SPEAKER_07]: huge issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: We need to deal with how are we going to
promote these products?
[SPEAKER_07]: We have to we can't just like I can't just
like drop off A bunch of product at your
[SPEAKER_07]: dispensary and say here or sell it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't work that way We want to know
what the products like the experience.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know the quality.
[SPEAKER_07]: What does it look like?
[SPEAKER_07]: What does the flower look like?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, and you're you're absolutely right
There's only a certain amount of products
[SPEAKER_07]: that can be given back to a distributor
return and that's manufacturer products
[SPEAKER_07]: that are defective That's it.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't return flour.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's very very limited I Believe
that's almost all the time we have do we
[SPEAKER_00]: have any more burning questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: From some oh, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_00]: I see you up front.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm just shielding myself from this bright
light The biggest issue that I found they
[SPEAKER_00]: quit the question was from the
manufacturer's perspective Is there an
[SPEAKER_00]: amount that you're required to charge?
[SPEAKER_00]: The biggest issue is the taxes they don't
care if you sell it for a penny it all
[SPEAKER_00]: depends on how the taxes are brought
through the Process and it might be
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on who you talk to at the CDT FA
You know there's been different versions
[SPEAKER_00]: of this so for a full-size Sample that's
exactly the same thing as a retail sample
[SPEAKER_00]: They may want to see the full excise tax
carried through for that product So it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really important to clarify with the
tax agency What they are gonna want to see
[SPEAKER_00]: and to and to run that by them to make
sure that you're doing that in a compliant
[SPEAKER_00]: way Because the agencies will be like sure
penny programs go for it But but it's the
[SPEAKER_00]: tax piece because if you're doing that
wrong The CDT FA has stated they're gonna
[SPEAKER_07]: consider that tax fraud CDT FA is also
Implementing their own regulations as
[SPEAKER_07]: well.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you got to watch those we're talking
about BCC and all these other three the
[SPEAKER_07]: three main regulating agencies well CDT
CDT FA at this time is also Working
[SPEAKER_07]: through their regulatory process because
they are under an emergency regulations
[SPEAKER_07]: process right now And they're adopting
their final regulations on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: So pay attention to that as well before
warned I had a client that had CDT FA show
[SPEAKER_09]: up for an audit So they are doing that as
well the other agencies you always want to
[SPEAKER_09]: be thinking about if you're a cultivator
the water boards and the California
[SPEAKER_09]: Department of Fish and Wildlife are
chomping At the bit they have been waiting
[SPEAKER_09]: impatiently to regulate this industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they're they're off to the races if
you're a cultivator Make them your friend
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, thank you You You You
