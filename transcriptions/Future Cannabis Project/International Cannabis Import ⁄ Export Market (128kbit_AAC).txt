[SPEAKER_01]: What about international?
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of Canada?
[SPEAKER_01]: International.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what part of international are we
talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's so much talk about
cultivation in Canada right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you and I were down in Mexico not
long ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're confronted with a lot of people from
Colombia, from Mexico, talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation at very low cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's all these deals happening
right now in the space in Canada where
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a volume play for cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we think there's a future there?
[SPEAKER_01]: How long is that going to last?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm concerned with the climate in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I mean, you can cultivate outdoors
for a very small portion of the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everything's going to have to be indoor
or greenhouse, which, again, raises the
[SPEAKER_01]: cost of cultivation, cost of production.
[SPEAKER_01]: But also, let's talk about Colombia having
an export license for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once that comes into play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colombia, Jamaica, Mexico, as we talked
about, it's about shortcoming.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also Europe, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada's exporting a ton of stuff to
Germany, for example.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you also have Portugal and you have
Macedonia also doing a lot of cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the things we need to
consider is where the majority of our
[SPEAKER_00]: produce is coming from currently in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that belt of where that produce is
coming, there's going to be a change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody's going to figure out,
hey, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can grow tomatoes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or I can grow hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have all the installations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have all the logistics.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have all the import and export
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just different seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the United States is very well
positioned right now to benefit more so
[SPEAKER_01]: from industrial hemp legalization than
from cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think cannabis is going to be a very
small segment of the money being made.
[SPEAKER_01]: And well, sorry, consumable cannabis as
opposed to industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think industrial hemp will be the lion's
share of the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the U.S.
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer could really use this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes down to cost as well,
though.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of that produce is from the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: is being kept in the U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: and how much is really imported from
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to follow that same path.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get a lot of our produce from South and
Central America, Mexico for produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so cheap.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the climate and the soil is so
fertile.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do we produce here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: Subsidized soybeans.
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we ever think we'll see a subsidy for
cannabis for hemp?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The farm bill is pretty favorable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, sugar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the sugar.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sugar is a mafia of its own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be interesting to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: But anyway, we're talking international.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, for us, it's really interesting
from a software perspective, having to go
[SPEAKER_01]: in and internationalize everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: That should be that's going to be a fun
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've been through this sort of thing
before.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what an undertaking that is.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also a sign of the times and what
things are happening internationally.
[SPEAKER_01]: What stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: What have you been hearing about
internationally now that's interesting?
[SPEAKER_00]: On our end, we've been dealing with
obviously a lot of people with Canada.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: China, believe it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: China simply because China has a lot of
the hardware that's currently being built.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're trying to make a statement and
saying, hey, not only can we sell it at
[SPEAKER_00]: wholesale, but you can buy direct.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And not only that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think most people don't realize,
but I believe China is the world's leading
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp cultivator and CBD exporter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then there's also this interesting
mindset in the industry that CBD from
[SPEAKER_01]: China is dirty CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not as high quality as what you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am not involved in that world.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know either.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I mean, China is definitely well
positioned to take advantage of this new
[SPEAKER_01]: found enthusiasm around the hemp space.
[SPEAKER_01]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm excited about when we can start seeing
hemp do something other than CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone keeps talking about CBD and hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I had someone come put a deck on
my desk the other day talking about hemp
[SPEAKER_01]: production and CBD extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, that's all fine and good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what are you going to do with the
fibers?
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like that's for me almost more
interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we start doing composites?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we start doing fibers?
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we start doing hemp as nutrition?
[SPEAKER_01]: True.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like hemp seeds.
[SPEAKER_01]: High in protein.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an ever expanding population in
this world.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to feed them somehow.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm telling you, it's going to go down
that gluten free world where it's going to
[SPEAKER_00]: be like hemp without blah, blah,
blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever that one component that they find
that's like negative towards humans.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know what that is yet.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The isolation, the exclusion of other
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Something.
Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be a branding thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be a marketing thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, buy this hemp because it's free in
this and free in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
