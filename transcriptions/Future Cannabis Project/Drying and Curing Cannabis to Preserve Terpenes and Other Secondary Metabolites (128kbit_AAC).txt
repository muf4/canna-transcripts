[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome, everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Adrian Giovenco, Inspire's CEO.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really excited to kick off today.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're really excited to share this content
with you and be part of contributing to
[SPEAKER_03]: the collective knowledge that's out there
in the field.
[SPEAKER_02]: Today, we're going to talk about what
happens when we cut mature cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: flowers down and take the months of hard
work and love we put into nurturing these
[SPEAKER_02]: plants into finished product full of the
compounds, patients, need, and consumers
[SPEAKER_02]: want.
[SPEAKER_02]: The compounds I'm talking about are
cannabinoids, terpenes, and flavonoids,
[SPEAKER_02]: collectively referred to as secondary
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_02]: These compounds often serve as defense
mechanisms by the plant, but have been
[SPEAKER_02]: bred over centuries to bring out unique
characteristics that humans find useful
[SPEAKER_02]: for medicines, flavorings, and
recreational drugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of the parameters that are at play
when the plant is photosynthesizing are
[SPEAKER_02]: still at play in the curing stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we'll learn about more later,
curing cannabis is all about strategically
[SPEAKER_02]: managing these parameters to get the very
best cannabis to market.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are common practices taught by
generations of successful cultivators that
[SPEAKER_02]: are widely used at scale at work.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as science makes its mark on the
industry, are there lessons to learn?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there more efficient, less
labor-intensive ways to dry and cure that
[SPEAKER_02]: allow us to capture more of the valuable
secondary metabolites?
[SPEAKER_02]: Our exploration has opened up questions at
the same time it's provided answers,
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're excited to take a closer look.
[SPEAKER_02]: The pilots of today's presentation are
Inspire's CTO, Robbie Bass, and Inspire's
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis business strategist, Jesse
Porter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what is curing cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the process that controls against
product loss and degradation to add value
[SPEAKER_04]: and brand recognition, but it's so much
more.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an art.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a science.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an expression, a signature,
and a sign of quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: The end user wants a product that smokes
clean, tastes great, and reflects the
[SPEAKER_04]: potency and effects of the genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: The craft cultivator wants a product that
reflects all the thought, passion,
[SPEAKER_04]: and hard work that went into cultivating
the genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see curing as a choke point and an
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Controlling the curing process creates
consistent results and predictable product
[SPEAKER_04]: flow.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we always wonder, do you know how much
product you lost during curing,
[SPEAKER_04]: the temperature degradation, the handling
to bud rot, to light exposure?
[SPEAKER_04]: Could you put a number on it?
[SPEAKER_04]: It can have significant financial impact.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's an aspect of cannabis production
often overlooked, mismanaged, or
[SPEAKER_04]: misunderstood by entrepreneurs and
cultivators alike.
[SPEAKER_04]: Appropriate curing will increase your
price per pound and extraction yields.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will reduce the amount of product loss
to bud rot and pathogens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Curing will increase shelf life.
[SPEAKER_04]: And importantly, curing cannabis is better
medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: The desired effects, potency, and flavor
are all directly tied to the secondary
[SPEAKER_04]: metabolites produced during that flowering
phase.
[SPEAKER_04]: These flavonoids, terpenes, and
cannabinoids combine to create the true
[SPEAKER_04]: entourage effects that make you love a
strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And in order to protect those secondary
metabolites, it's important to understand
[SPEAKER_04]: the science of what is happening when we
cure cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll be honest.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're all trying to understand the science
behind curing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we admit the research on the topic is
lacking.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've spoken with molecular biologists,
atmospheric physicists, chemists,
[SPEAKER_04]: research scientists, cannabis cup winners.
[SPEAKER_04]: I even talked to some guy with a particle
accelerator.
[SPEAKER_04]: We talked to cheese makers, dry age meat
producers, wine makers, and culinary herb
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_04]: We pulled data from licensed cannabis
producers around the US and we're doing
[SPEAKER_04]: our own research as we speak.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are still some unknowns,
some variables that need to be controlled,
[SPEAKER_04]: and some tests that need to be done.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we've collected some useful data that
we'd like to contribute to the discussion
[SPEAKER_04]: on curing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we do know is that cured cannabis is
more desirable and understanding the
[SPEAKER_04]: process will increase yield and produce
cannabis cup winning results.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's the difference between drying
and curing?
[SPEAKER_04]: We get this question a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: I usually say, you can dry in the oven,
but you cure with care.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I mean by that is trying is part
of the curing story, but it's not the
[SPEAKER_04]: whole story.
[SPEAKER_04]: Drying cannabis is about removing enough
moisture so the product can be smoked or
[SPEAKER_04]: otherwise processed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, throw it in the oven at 200
degrees for an hour and it'll be dry,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it won't be enjoyable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Curing cannabis is a controlled process
that protects secondary metabolites,
[SPEAKER_04]: furthers chemotype expression,
and creates an enjoyable smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Curing cannabis accounts for the time and
conditions required to maximize expression
[SPEAKER_04]: and preserve the product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when it comes to talking about the
best product, it's important to know when
[SPEAKER_04]: to harvest to get the most out of your
efforts.
[SPEAKER_04]: This part of the process does have some
art involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: As trichromes develop, they go through
three distinct phases and after the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: is harvested, the development continues
for a short period of time.
[SPEAKER_04]: The trichromes develop a stem and a head
that I sort of think resembles a mushroom.
[SPEAKER_04]: It begins clear and the head swells,
matures, and becomes cloudy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cloudy trichromes are at the peak of
ripeness and the goal is to harvest as
[SPEAKER_04]: many of them as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: When the trichromes begin to degrade,
they turn amber and signal an eminent
[SPEAKER_04]: harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what's a trichrome and what's in it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, here's a drawing of one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has around 30 flavonoids, 200 terpenes,
and 140 cannabinoids, give or take a few.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't want to lose any.
[SPEAKER_04]: That bulbous mushroom had we developed in
flower contains the majority of the good
[SPEAKER_04]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: The secretory cells have the terpenes and
the secretory vesicles have the
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to make sure that they are fully
developed and protected through the entire
[SPEAKER_04]: packaging pipeline.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once harvested, the plant stops
transpiring, begins respiring,
[SPEAKER_04]: and needs to be managed to protect the
product.
[SPEAKER_04]: The handling of the product must be done
with care in order to make sure delicate
[SPEAKER_04]: trichomes heads are not destroyed.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that brings us to factors of
degradation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Handling is a factor of degradation,
but as Brian mentioned earlier,
[SPEAKER_04]: all 10 cardinal parameters of plant
influence impact curing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Light, humidity, temperature, CO2,
airflow and atmospheric conditions,
[SPEAKER_04]: water, oxygen, microbes, nutrients,
they're all at play.
[SPEAKER_04]: Understanding how each influences each
other and the cannabis product during
[SPEAKER_04]: curing is an important step in the
refinement of the process.
[SPEAKER_04]: First, let's talk about temperature as it
drives the timeline associated with
[SPEAKER_04]: moisture removal.
[SPEAKER_04]: The hotter the ambient temperature,
the faster the product dries.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that if we dry a product too
quickly, however, the result will crumble
[SPEAKER_04]: to a powder and lack appeal.
[SPEAKER_04]: One reason for this is that the
temperatures above 68 degrees Fahrenheit
[SPEAKER_04]: can volatize terpenes and degrade
secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Temperature will also impact the speed and
completion of enzymatic reactions within
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: So raising temperatures 10 degrees will
double the speed of enzymatic reactions.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when temperatures are too cold,
enzymatic reactions halt.
[SPEAKER_04]: In order to uniformly cure cannabis,
temperature should be consistent and below
[SPEAKER_04]: 68 degrees at all times to drive enzymes
and protect secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while low temps, slow pathogen
development, it can also cause
[SPEAKER_04]: discoloration and susceptibility to decay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Temperature and time are a balancing act
when we think about curing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Light's also a major factor in curing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know that if light is present,
plants will continue to produce
[SPEAKER_04]: chlorophyll, which is unwanted for the
next phase.
[SPEAKER_04]: But light also negatively affects oils.
[SPEAKER_04]: Visible light triggers the auto-oxidation
process, and UV light causes
[SPEAKER_04]: photo-oxidation, both of which degrade
oils, especially those mono-terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mono-terpenes have been shown to degrade
rapidly under the presence of light and
[SPEAKER_04]: high temperatures, like in a matter of
hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think this is one area where fresh
frozen processing is fantastic.
[SPEAKER_04]: It allows for the capture of more
mono-terpenes that would otherwise be lost
[SPEAKER_04]: in the curing process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Moving forward, another major influence on
the curing process is humidity.
[SPEAKER_04]: Humidity is about the moisture in the room
as well as in the bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we know buds are between 80% to 95%
water weight at harvest, and most of that
[SPEAKER_04]: moisture needs to be removed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So one core concept of curing is that we
migrate the moisture from the interior of
[SPEAKER_04]: the bud to the exterior of the bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while high moisture content
facilitates pathogen growth in bud rot,
[SPEAKER_04]: studies have shown that reducing moisture
content of the bud below 20% prevents
[SPEAKER_04]: microbe growth and increases shelf life.
[SPEAKER_04]: The slow and controlled progression of
moisture facilitates chemical enzymatic
[SPEAKER_04]: reactions and allows the water to pull
more unwanted materials from the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: But slow, controlled moisture removal
requires more than just some fans.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes an understanding of pressures,
engineering, and controlled measurement.
[SPEAKER_04]: And speaking about controlled measurement,
we need to reduce the moisture content of
[SPEAKER_04]: the bud below 20%.
[SPEAKER_04]: But precision is important.
[SPEAKER_04]: The difference between 19% moisture in the
bud and 14% moisture in the bud is,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, 5%, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: But that 5% of water weight could easily
be worth millions of dollars at scale.
Millions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take some time to digest that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thinking about time, when it comes to
curing time, there's a balancing act
[SPEAKER_04]: between terpenes loss and the completion
of the enzymatic processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes to terpenes, time is the
enemy as they degrade every single day.
[SPEAKER_04]: For enzymes, time is a friend who allows
for the completion of the enzymatic
[SPEAKER_04]: processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: With limited time, enzymes do a limited
job in the breakdown of starches and
[SPEAKER_04]: chlorophyll, leaving the final product
harsh and tasting like alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_04]: Take too long and risk the exposure to
microbial outbreaks, breakdown,
[SPEAKER_04]: and degradation of secondary metabolites,
which will destroy bag appeal.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a delicate touch to balance
terpene loss and enzymatic processes
[SPEAKER_04]: needed to make for a superior consumable.
[SPEAKER_04]: Atmospheric conditions, like gases in the
room, will influence the curing process as
[SPEAKER_04]: well.
[SPEAKER_04]: One effect of atmospheric conditions is
oil oxidation, which accelerates with the
[SPEAKER_04]: concentration of dissolved oxygen and
depends largely on the oxygen pressures in
[SPEAKER_04]: the headspace as well as the ambient
temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oil oxidation is an undesirable series of
chemical reactions involving oxygen that
[SPEAKER_04]: degrades the quality of oil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oxidation eventually produces rancidity in
oil and acrimonious flavors and smells.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while all oil is in a state of
oxidation, you can't stop it completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are ways to reduce it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Modified atmospheric packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: MAP, MAP, is a useful system which makes
it possible to regulate the composition of
[SPEAKER_04]: atmosphere in the headspace and thus
control the rate of respiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: Respiration is one of the basic processes
of deterioration, and it's highly
[SPEAKER_04]: influenced by the atmospheric composition
of CO2, oxygen, ethylene, and water vapor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's driven by temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: During respiration, oxygen is consumed and
CO2, ethylene, and water vapor are
[SPEAKER_04]: generated.
[SPEAKER_04]: MAP allows you to control atmospheric
conditions that impact curing so you can
[SPEAKER_04]: slow down or speed up respiration and
other metabolic processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: This also allows you to reduce sensitivity
to ethylene, reduce the development of
[SPEAKER_04]: disorders, and inhibit pathogen
development.
[SPEAKER_04]: Air exchanges in the space and the control
of atmospheric conditions are imperative
[SPEAKER_04]: for the control of the curing process.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, it's important to note we need
enough oxygen long enough to trigger those
[SPEAKER_04]: reactions, but we need to limit dwell time
in order to protect the oils.
[SPEAKER_04]: MAP allows us to control these variables.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what in the plant makes it harsh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Chlorophylls, lipids, sugars,
carbohydrates, amino acids, water,
[SPEAKER_04]: fertilizers, and heavy metals can all make
the smoke harsh.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we're curing, we're essentially
trying to remove or otherwise process out
[SPEAKER_04]: as much of that other stuff as possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our plants work hard to create this
biomass and flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enzymes work hard to remove it afterwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: Plants create chlorophyll, which give the
plant its green color and undesirable
[SPEAKER_04]: grassy flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fats and sugars are also created during
the growth process and become energy
[SPEAKER_04]: sources for the reactions as the plant
dries and cures.
[SPEAKER_04]: But excessive nitrogen and heavy metals in
the fertilizers can also impact curing and
[SPEAKER_04]: cause auto oxidation and long-term
storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: So proper plant nutrition during flower
and appropriate cultivation techniques
[SPEAKER_04]: lead to better cured product that is less
susceptible to deterioration.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something that makes the cured product
less harsh is respiration that we
[SPEAKER_04]: mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_04]: Respiration is the process in which
organisms convert biochemical energy from
[SPEAKER_04]: stored food, like the sugars and starches
from photosynthesis, into adenosine
[SPEAKER_04]: triphosphate or ATP for ripening.
[SPEAKER_04]: During respiration, plants take oxygen
from the air and give off carbon dioxide,
[SPEAKER_04]: moisture, and heat, the opposite of
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And respiration continues until the stored
starch and sugar reserves are depleted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Temperature dictates the speed of
respiration and is the most important
[SPEAKER_04]: factor in influencing post-harvest life
and quality of a given product.
[SPEAKER_04]: The oxygen in the surrounding environment
is above most importance because it's the
[SPEAKER_04]: primary gas to use during respiration.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lowering oxygen in the air allows you to
lower the respiration rate.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if there's not enough oxygen,
the product goes into anaerobic
[SPEAKER_04]: fermentation and will produce alcohols
that impart unwanted flavors.
[SPEAKER_04]: Enzymes also play a role in respiration,
and there are four enzyme groups
[SPEAKER_04]: facilitating the curing process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Proteases, amylases, lipases, and
cellulases.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they all break down different stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: These enzymes use stored plant energy to
break down unwanted plant materials,
[SPEAKER_04]: like proteins, nucleic acids, starches,
fats, phosphate esters, and other
[SPEAKER_04]: macromolecules.
[SPEAKER_04]: High temperature drives enzymatic
reactions and affords protections against
[SPEAKER_04]: microbial growth, but high temperatures
will also negatively affect secondary
[SPEAKER_04]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Temperatures that are too high or too low
will denature enzymatic activity,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that cannot be restarted.
[SPEAKER_04]: These enzymes need plant material,
heat, proper pH, and moisture to activate,
[SPEAKER_04]: and they need time to work.
[SPEAKER_04]: But their process creates longer chain
molecules that have unique flavor and
[SPEAKER_04]: amplified effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the case of water, in the case of
curing, water is both a preservative and a
[SPEAKER_04]: solvent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It plays a critical role as a catalyst to
enzymes and is a vehicle for removing
[SPEAKER_04]: unwanted products from the bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hydrolysis is a chemical reaction in which
the interaction of a compound with water
[SPEAKER_04]: results in the decomposition of that
compound.
[SPEAKER_04]: This process breaks down chemical polymers
into simpler units, and an example of that
[SPEAKER_04]: is turning starches into sugars.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hydrolysis is one of the most important
processes that improve the quality of
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis as it cures.
[SPEAKER_04]: As water migrates out of the plant,
it will remove byproducts from the
[SPEAKER_04]: breakdown caused by enzymatic activity and
further the development of secondary
[SPEAKER_04]: metabolites.
[SPEAKER_04]: If water moves too quickly, there will not
be enough time to effectively complete the
[SPEAKER_04]: processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: If the process is too slow, you risk mold
and other biological contaminations.
[SPEAKER_04]: Water activity drives microbial activity,
and that's why we need to remove it for
[SPEAKER_04]: long-term storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in controlling water migration through
the plant, we allow it to homogenize
[SPEAKER_04]: development, stimulate processes,
and produce a cleaner smoke.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thinking about post-harvest diseases,
curing and storage products are subject to
[SPEAKER_04]: a variety of rots and decay caused by
fungi and bacteria.
[SPEAKER_04]: Some known fungi that can develop in the
curing phase are Botrytis and Fusarium,
[SPEAKER_04]: and some of the bacteria are Pseudomonia
and Aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_04]: These diseases can cause color change,
degradation, and will certainly result in
[SPEAKER_04]: a failed microbial test.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's important to note that many
infections of diseases start before
[SPEAKER_04]: harvest, and when these products are
transferred to storage, infections
[SPEAKER_04]: continue to develop.
[SPEAKER_04]: So proper environmental controls,
product handling, and SOPs are required to
[SPEAKER_04]: prevent post-harvest diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: The curing space should have appropriate
biological filtration in place to prevent
[SPEAKER_04]: contamination and the growth of yeast,
bacteria, and molds.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sanitation and biological filtration are
also important to handlers to protect
[SPEAKER_04]: products from post-harvest diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: People carry pests.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have about 10,000 microbes on each
hand, and we lose 40,000 skin cells every
[SPEAKER_04]: minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: These are things to consider in order to
protect the final product.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what makes cannabis great?
[SPEAKER_04]: Turns out time is a factor in chemotype
expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: The process of polymerization is magical.
[SPEAKER_04]: Studies show us that when cannabis is
cured over time, we do not see an increase
[SPEAKER_04]: in the quantity of terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: We see a measurable difference in terpene
profile.
[SPEAKER_04]: Terpenes marry, commingle, and continue to
develop and homogenize.
[SPEAKER_04]: The polymerization process takes what are
fantastic individual terpenes and
[SPEAKER_04]: harmonizes them in a way specific to the
genetics involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like going from mono to stereo in
flavor and effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we know that during the curing phase,
secondary metabolites reconnect to create
[SPEAKER_04]: new compounds not present at harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is when the product becomes unique
and stands out in the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this is also a very important
aspect of medical viability as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: When my mom was sick with cancer,
we tried every strain we could find,
[SPEAKER_04]: and the results were inconsistent.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the curing was inconsistent too.
[SPEAKER_04]: When cured correctly, the terpene and
cannabinoid expression has fully developed
[SPEAKER_04]: and is more capable than the individual
metabolites.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cured cannabis is better medicine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Curing creates a better recreational
product too, but better yet,
[SPEAKER_04]: polymerization allows for the true chemo
of our expression of strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we really want to know the medical
viability of each genetic, we need to make
[SPEAKER_04]: sure that we cure it appropriately in
order to capture the symphony of
[SPEAKER_04]: polymerized secondary metabolites and not
just a few standout notes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do we consistently achieve great
results?
[SPEAKER_04]: Understanding the factors we just talked
about, there are a variety of approaches
[SPEAKER_04]: that we have seen have success in the
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: First is the legacy burden.
[SPEAKER_04]: This classic process has been refined for
generations.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has a rich history of success.
[SPEAKER_04]: The core concept here is to harvest the
plant, remove the fan leaves, hang it
[SPEAKER_04]: upside down, blast it, with air until it's
crispy to the touch, then buck it,
[SPEAKER_04]: put it in an airtight container,
burp it, and monitor it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Many iterations of this method exist.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone has a different opinion on how
long and how often to burp, and even how
[SPEAKER_04]: long to cure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it seven days, 14 days, 30 days,
six months?
[SPEAKER_04]: Depends on who you ask.
[SPEAKER_04]: What we do know is that this system works.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we don't fully understand why.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even at the highest level of academia,
they're studying this legacy method to
[SPEAKER_04]: better understand the science behind the
results.
[SPEAKER_04]: Understanding what happens to these buds
scientifically while they're in this
[SPEAKER_04]: airtight environment should prove to be a
very strong breakthrough in curing
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis science.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another method we've explored is freeze
drying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll admit, at first I thought it was
a gimmick.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then I experienced the nose and bag
appeal of products that had been freeze
[SPEAKER_04]: dried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stunning.
[SPEAKER_04]: Important to note that this level of
freeze dried curing is not something you
[SPEAKER_04]: do with a harvest right survival freeze
dryer.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a precision machine built and
operated by professionals.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oversight and understanding is needed.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the core concept here is that we
vacuum purge the water from the product,
[SPEAKER_04]: remove the water from the chamber,
then freeze dry the product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Freeze dry is one of the best ways to halt
the degradation process to protect THC and
[SPEAKER_04]: the secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, this process does require
delicate hands to not damage the product
[SPEAKER_04]: and a fundamental understanding of
timelines to make sure that appropriate
[SPEAKER_04]: enzymatic activities can occur.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are all excited to follow the evolution
of this technology and see where it leads
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of technology, I'll let our CTO
take it from here and talk about how we've
[SPEAKER_04]: been refining the process of drying and
curing in the same room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob?
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over at Inspire, we delved into providing
these environments control systems for
[SPEAKER_01]: drying and curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We went to the best and we went to the
worst and we looked at all the different
[SPEAKER_01]: parts in between.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we came to the realization that the
most specialized and efficient effective
[SPEAKER_01]: combined drying and curing chambers on the
market have the following features.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can accurately control temperature
and humidity in a wide range, and they can
[SPEAKER_01]: have a substantially high airflow rate
relative even to the cultivation rooms we
[SPEAKER_01]: were designing at around 20 to 30 air
changes per hour.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we were still being asked to design a
large scale drying room in one part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: facility and a curing room in the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this naturally led us to wonder,
what's the point of drying in one room and
[SPEAKER_01]: then curing in another specialized device,
be it a jar, a Tupperware container,
[SPEAKER_01]: or a cardboard barrel?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why can't we dry and cure cannabis in the
same space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this might end up being one of those
game changer ideas that flies in the face
[SPEAKER_01]: of conventional wisdom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse was just describing that
conventional technique earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: The drying step and the curing step,
they happen in two different rooms.
[SPEAKER_01]: While this is a tried and true approach,
it brings with it this extra incurred cost
[SPEAKER_01]: of labor, equipment, and real estate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, you have a risk of damaging the
product in the transfer from one spot to
[SPEAKER_01]: the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why take up two different areas in a
facility anyways for drying and then
[SPEAKER_01]: curing?
[SPEAKER_01]: If instead it can be done quickly and in
the same space, why not use that freed up
[SPEAKER_01]: floor area for bigger and better things?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know, growing more plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to design a dry cure room
and handle this in one fell swoop,
[SPEAKER_01]: let's talk about some of the ideas that
might serve you well.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first place to start is with
confidence that you've got consistent
[SPEAKER_01]: airflow around the product in the room
you're trying to cure.
[SPEAKER_01]: We consider this to be a task for the CFD
modeling software we employ, and it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: good way for us to provide a strong
validation to our curing room physical
[SPEAKER_01]: layout suggestions.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're also going to want to have a
strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: For moisture removal over time,
you want to understand whether it's going
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a 10-day linear drying rate with the
same amount of moisture removed each and
[SPEAKER_01]: every day, or some other strategy but this
is going to form the basis for your
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment selections.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, if you want to take it to the next
level, you'll want to start talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: what those actual set points in the room
are going to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll probably want to target a specific
temperature for product quality
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance and a humidity level that
allows you to realize the strategy you
[SPEAKER_01]: came up with on the previous slide.
[SPEAKER_01]: To maintain the balance of that highest
level of terpene retention, a reasonable
[SPEAKER_01]: curing and polymerization rate,
and a satisfactory level of enzymatic
[SPEAKER_01]: activity, then that temperature is
probably going to be around 65 degrees
[SPEAKER_01]: Fahrenheit and humidity anywhere from 50
to 65%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, the most advanced way to approach
this task is to automate the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is possible to feed back moisture
removal from the product back into your
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity control scheme.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've seen a number of systems do this,
but the most accurate way seems to be
[SPEAKER_01]: tracking the weight of the product through
time in the curing room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best data we have tells us that
the rate of moisture removal changes over
[SPEAKER_01]: time at a given temperature and humidity
set point in the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if instead of fixing your temperature
and humidity, let's say we just fixed the
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature, we could manipulate the space
humidity to change the vapor pressure on
[SPEAKER_01]: the moisture content of the plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this directly controls the rate of
drying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, again, manipulating the room vapor
levels controls the moisture removal and
[SPEAKER_01]: gives you the ability to slow down or
increase moisture loss over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Allowing for the polymerization and curing
to happen at the same time as the drying
[SPEAKER_01]: step.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the best way to achieve a
hands-off approach to the curing process
[SPEAKER_01]: and also deliver consistency through
benchmarking from batch to batch.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't expect curing strategies to be
fixed over time, and neither should you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even the differences in bud structure of
different crop genetics will be
[SPEAKER_01]: influential in determining a signature
curing methodology that you can attach to
[SPEAKER_01]: your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flexibility in the conditions you can
maintain might be even more important in
[SPEAKER_01]: this regard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as you get into the actual room design,
keep the following ideas in mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: First, if you're going to turn your room
into a big curing jar, you really need to
[SPEAKER_01]: think about sealing your room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tight construction and sealed concrete
floors are some of those considerations.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to prevent gases from
getting into and out of the room without
[SPEAKER_01]: your control.
[SPEAKER_01]: To that end, you'll probably want to break
the seal every once in a while.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should consider a mechanism to
ventilate or burp the room just like you
[SPEAKER_01]: would in the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: To do this effectively, you'll need a way
to bring atmospheric air into the space to
[SPEAKER_01]: dilute the buildup of gases.
[SPEAKER_01]: And be sure you've got at least nerve-13
filters on this mechanism.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the room exhaust, be a good neighbor
and consider an odor remediation system so
[SPEAKER_01]: that you're not exhausting air that other
people in the neighborhood might find
[SPEAKER_01]: offensive when you release it into the
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lastly, consider a sensor array for
determining when and how often you'd like
[SPEAKER_01]: to ventilate or burp the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sensing systems for ethylene are readily
available, as well as for CO2.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we heard from Jesse, these gases
provide real indications of the stage of
[SPEAKER_01]: curing you've achieved.
[SPEAKER_01]: Monitoring them will help you hone your
curing strategy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the future, I think we'll see
electronic monitoring of other specific
[SPEAKER_01]: gases, so make sure you've got a system
flexible enough to incorporate what might
[SPEAKER_01]: be coming.
[SPEAKER_01]: By way of example, we're finding out that
the pathogens we're trying to avoid in the
[SPEAKER_01]: rooms actually generate gases that usually
can't be detected by humans with a
[SPEAKER_01]: background of all the other smells that
are in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Currently, chloroanisoles and thiols are
compounds of interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're as curious as you are to see
what ours and others' research leads us to
[SPEAKER_01]: in the study of the gas-sensing arena.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, Jesse, you there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, Rob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to you to wrap up this puppy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that sort of brings us to the end of
our presentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wanted to take a moment to say that I
really think we're all in this together.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sharing knowledge and going down the path
of education is only going to improve the
[SPEAKER_04]: curing process.
[SPEAKER_04]: But even when we have enough data to talk
objectively, there's going to be an
[SPEAKER_04]: artistic touch that sets many people
apart, a signature that's a byproduct of
[SPEAKER_04]: experience and feel.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we just hope that this webinar gives
you some information you need to refine
[SPEAKER_04]: your signature and paint your masterpiece.
[SPEAKER_04]: So thanks again for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Please give us a few minutes to organize
the questions from the audience and for me
[SPEAKER_04]: to get a few sips of tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we'll jump into the Q&A here.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first question is, can you achieve
decarboxylation through curing?
[SPEAKER_02]: And it may be worthwhile to quickly
explain what decarboxylation means.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So decarboxylation is essentially the
process that cannabis goes through to
[SPEAKER_04]: become psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_04]: Traditionally, we associate that with
heat, a certain heat requirement that
[SPEAKER_04]: changes the polymers that allows them to
be more psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that product thing can be used directly
to manufacture edibles or even consumed
[SPEAKER_04]: directly to still get the effects,
whereas fresh bud that's not
[SPEAKER_04]: decarboxylated won't get you that
psychoactive effects.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think an interesting note here is
something we're still discovering.
[SPEAKER_04]: Alice and Justice and Outco did a study on
curing hemp and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what they found was that over the
process of a 30-day cure, right around day
[SPEAKER_04]: 30, they actually achieved
decarboxylation, which is a dramatic
[SPEAKER_04]: breakthrough because that's not something
that's been proven to be achieved through
[SPEAKER_04]: the curing process in the past.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wonder what the elements involved are.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, it's important to understand the
parameters and the conditions,
[SPEAKER_04]: the heat that was, in fact, impacting that
shared isolated space, but also the
[SPEAKER_04]: pressures and the gases.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are a lot of things going on in that
airtight space that could actually
[SPEAKER_04]: contribute to decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think pH is another one, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, there's a handful of things in
there that could affect decarboxylation to
[SPEAKER_04]: actually make it happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now it's been proven on paper.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it's something we need to
explore more.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's an interesting note that we've
actually seen through a study that it can
[SPEAKER_04]: be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Turpene-rich psychoactive raw cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something new to chew on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That could be pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: No pun intended.
[SPEAKER_01]: One application for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another question coming in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: At what point is it no longer considered
drying the curing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, you know, drying is a fundamental
aspect of the curing process.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you harvest the product,
you immediately make a decision on whether
[SPEAKER_04]: or not you're going to dry it or cure it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I mean by that is that drying is
a route where you just try and add heat to
[SPEAKER_04]: remove moisture.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's only one small component of the
curing process that must account for all
[SPEAKER_04]: the other things that are happening.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can try without curing,
but you cannot cure without drying,
[SPEAKER_04]: if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's sort of my perspective on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know we have some differential opinions
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But my feeling is that appropriate curing
will involve drying, whereas you can dry
[SPEAKER_04]: any way, shape, or form.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the curing process starts immediately
upon harvest.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the decisions you make from that
point moving forward that allow for this
[SPEAKER_04]: progression and polymerization to happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the conversations Jesse and I have on
this are long and usually go right into
[SPEAKER_01]: the night.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm convinced that the drying,
through Jesse's persuasion, I'm convinced
[SPEAKER_01]: that the drying and curing can happen in
one short period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traditionally, we see all sorts of things
being asked of us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Design a drying room here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to leave it in there for 10
days.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're going to design a curing
room over here, put the things into jars
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever containers, and move it into a
curing room in its own conditions,
[SPEAKER_01]: and let it cure in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's usually also a 7 to 10 day process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it goes into bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we see the continuation of curing when
we've got NAP systems involved in the
[SPEAKER_01]: storage of the product over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, Jesse's convinced that we can
do otherwise.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're starting to see the data come
back that, yes, you can do drying and
[SPEAKER_01]: curing and polymerization control,
curing control.
[SPEAKER_01]: This can all be done in one area.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the room that you're doing it in,
you have to be able to control different
[SPEAKER_01]: levels of gases, whether it's the water
content of the air, whether it's the
[SPEAKER_01]: content of ethylene in the air,
whether it's the content of CO2 in the
[SPEAKER_01]: air.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be able to independently
control some of those variables.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that becomes a challenge, especially
at scale in a large room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're looking at those designs right
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing our own tests.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't wait for part two of this
webinar.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can come out and kind of reveal some of
the data that we've got.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: When do you know when curing is finished?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think there's a subjective
aspect of interpreting that product.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you'd like to sort of listen to that
new book by Max Montrose and his ethos on
[SPEAKER_04]: how you determine whether or not cannabis
is good or bad or the level of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's some interesting touch
points in there that really give us an
[SPEAKER_04]: idea on how we judge cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But let's be honest, there's two factors,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: There's the test results and then there's
the customer experience and sell through
[SPEAKER_04]: numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: And both of those things sort of need to
line up and justify that higher price
[SPEAKER_04]: point.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how we tie it back to, oh,
yeah, we're going to get those numbers and
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to achieve cleaner smoke and
we're going to get better sell through
[SPEAKER_04]: numbers and better brand recognition
through curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no better answer, Jesse.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no better way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, we measure all sorts of things in
terms of product quality and the KPIs are
[SPEAKER_01]: like grams per square foot or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the fact is it comes down to bag
appeal and it comes down to does it move
[SPEAKER_01]: through the stores?
[SPEAKER_01]: If it's going towards the smoking process,
people have got to see it, smoke it,
[SPEAKER_01]: want it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's almost as much brand and marketing as
it is the actual physical curing of it,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great point, Rob.
[SPEAKER_04]: Something I want to add to that too is
that there's an ideal time or product that
[SPEAKER_04]: we want to get, but it's important to
understand the market pressures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe this doesn't quite apply to the six
plant grower or the craft consumer that's
[SPEAKER_04]: growing cannabis for themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: But a lot of times I think, Rob,
you can back me up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we have conversations at scale on
curing, there's a timeline that doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: necessarily correlate to the curing
process that needs to be met.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a timeline to get products into
a space, out of a space and onto the
[SPEAKER_04]: shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the more that we master that
process at the high commercial level,
[SPEAKER_04]: the more we'll see high quality products
come out of those commercial facilities on
[SPEAKER_04]: a consistent basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: What's happening now, I think,
just an opinion here, is that there's a
[SPEAKER_04]: race to market.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a need of product in the market
and that sort of demands that these
[SPEAKER_04]: products get pushed to market more
quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about getting them out of the room in
seven days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Burping them in three, bagging them and
moving them, rather than fundamentally
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding how we're gonna get 2% more
THC, 1% more terpene and more flavonoid
[SPEAKER_04]: expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, there's a pressure that goes on
there too that needs to be considered
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's a real market pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to work within these certain
frameworks.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of times when is it ready is a
matter of when can I get my money?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that limits some of the data that
we've been able to collect as we pursue
[SPEAKER_04]: more can of sewer products, we see that
yeah, that curing process takes a little
[SPEAKER_04]: bit longer.
[SPEAKER_04]: The product has better shelf life and gets
more money at the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a long winded and maybe didn't
perfectly answer the question,
[SPEAKER_04]: but there's a little bit of insight there,
I think.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think we can also use this topic
to address Alexander's question,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is having separate rooms for dry
cure has been used to support perpetual
[SPEAKER_01]: grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you address this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the reason that a separate room for
drying and curing have been used for
[SPEAKER_01]: perpetual grows is because I've got two
weeks in between harvest and I have a
[SPEAKER_01]: drying room and a curing room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if I do anything to throw off the
balance of my harvest, I've got to be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to move product through my facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think where we're going with this is to
advance the state of the art.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why aren't we drying and curing in seven
days?
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse just mentioned seven day dry,
three day cure, three day bag,
[SPEAKER_01]: that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to compress the drying and
curing process by manipulating variables
[SPEAKER_01]: and minimize the infrastructure and
facility you need to take care of this
[SPEAKER_01]: process.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's going to be the next step.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is where we're trying to push
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're just going to be talking about
having a separate room for drying and a
[SPEAKER_01]: separate room for curing, sure,
you can go down any path you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: achieve the net effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, you will be
better served if you can hone these
[SPEAKER_01]: processes and really optimize the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what you're working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks very much.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would encourage everybody that's
more interested in some of the financial
[SPEAKER_02]: impacts that this can have, go to the
revenue calculator and play with some of
[SPEAKER_02]: those variables and see how much revenue
or drop in operating costs you might be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to achieve by getting more dollars
per pound on better cured cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lowering your operating costs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on top of that, if you have any more
questions about curing and you want to
[SPEAKER_04]: take a deeper dive, reach out to Rob and
I.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe we won't talk to you until two in
the morning like we talk to each other,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we'll definitely get back to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we'd love to hear questions and
contributions from the community.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another question has come in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have recommended temperature and
humidity?
[SPEAKER_02]: Conditions for storing cannabis after it's
been dried and cured?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've been asked that question quite
a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So after after it's been dried and cured,
you know, I think you mentioned Jesse
[SPEAKER_01]: mapped and that's that's a really good way
to maintain the quality and the
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental control of a product in one
specific aspect, which is moisture control
[SPEAKER_01]: in the container, which is storing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those things, there are secondary
gases that are also being controlled in
[SPEAKER_01]: the levels being controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know enough about map
systems, but they seem to do a very good
[SPEAKER_01]: job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, Jesse, you tell me,
is that the typical way to do things on
[SPEAKER_01]: the market today?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can touch on nitrogen flush
and what that's all about.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I mean, that brings up a whole other
ball of wax.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think for the most part,
we know the cardinal factors that
[SPEAKER_04]: influence the plant and cause degradation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once that process, the enzymatic
process is halted and we removed enough
[SPEAKER_04]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really sort of about light and
temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: So putting it in a container where light
doesn't penetrate and temperature doesn't
[SPEAKER_04]: have a direct impact will be beneficial.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think we've seen a lot of people
look to commercial agriculture and
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial packaging for solutions here,
which is why we tend to have a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: conversations about nitrogen purging,
essentially bringing in into gas into a
[SPEAKER_04]: controlled space like a 55 gallon drum,
which will essentially displace the oxygen
[SPEAKER_04]: so that oxidation process won't continue.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea is that now that will hold in
that state for a long period of time and
[SPEAKER_04]: it can be shipped overseas or wherever it
needs to go or just held on site to
[SPEAKER_04]: appropriate processing time.
[SPEAKER_04]: The issues we see with that are that we're
not exactly sure if there's a degradation
[SPEAKER_04]: associated with that nitrogen gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: But what we do know is that in these
holding cells, these 55 gallon drums,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's call them for conversation,
usually they're done in metal drums for
[SPEAKER_04]: good long-term holding.
[SPEAKER_04]: For safety, those drums are lined.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as those drums are impacted by
atmospheric conditions and temperature,
[SPEAKER_04]: the terpene sweat and get absorbed by the
liner.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now in a long-term holding environment,
you have to smoke the drum to get high.
[SPEAKER_04]: That tends to not have a lot of market
viability.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one of the situations we've seen
come with long-term holding and nitrogen
[SPEAKER_04]: purging in large spaces, especially metal
drums that are lined.
[SPEAKER_04]: But really it's about halting that
oxidation process.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you can stop photo oxidation and
auto oxidation by preventing light
[SPEAKER_04]: penetration, that's a huge first step.
[SPEAKER_04]: Secondarily, if we can continue to control
the temperature, we'll have much less
[SPEAKER_04]: volatilization and evaporation of those
secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a correlation here or a
corollary between weed and wine,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to hold on to wine for a long
period of time, you put it in an opaque
[SPEAKER_01]: bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: You use a coravin to seal the thing with
nitrogen on top so that after you've
[SPEAKER_01]: opened it, you purge that oxygen out,
you prevent oxygenation, and you store the
[SPEAKER_01]: thing in a cool place.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the same thing applies to weed
here, if you're trying to maintain those
[SPEAKER_01]: same flavor profiles in weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see, let's move on to a question
about the mechanical side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do you determine the mechanical needs
for a drying room?
[SPEAKER_02]: There's been several questions similar to
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is a good one, too,
because I see Nadia, and Nadia's asked a
[SPEAKER_01]: question about moisture removal in the
first 24 or 48 hours, that kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's him to Andy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to start off by saying that every
traditional drying room we go into,
[SPEAKER_01]: the impression is the people who are doing
the drying will want to remove the most
[SPEAKER_01]: amount of moisture in the first 24 or 48
hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to remove 40 to 50% of the
moisture in the first 48 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's two things here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think people are seeing that their rooms
are under designed, and as such,
[SPEAKER_01]: they can't maintain a temperature and
humidity anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: They set the set points on the thermostat
and the humidistat, but they end up losing
[SPEAKER_01]: control because they don't have enough
moisture removal capacity, which means
[SPEAKER_01]: that if they don't have independent
temperature and humidity control,
[SPEAKER_01]: the humidity levels go way out of whack,
and then the temperature control goes with
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one thing to say you want to remove
most of the moisture in the first 24 or 48
[SPEAKER_01]: hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think that's a necessary step.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think if you can control temperature and
humidity, you can do a very linear
[SPEAKER_01]: moisture removal over time, and that's
going to lead to a consistent moisture
[SPEAKER_01]: profile inside and through the bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what we're trying to go for here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to avoid pockets of wet
product inside the bud that can lead to
[SPEAKER_01]: the pathogen buildup that we're trying to
avoid in the first place to maintain
[SPEAKER_01]: product quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we size these systems?
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to go back to what does the
grower really want to do, or what does the
[SPEAKER_01]: harvester or processor really want to do
with the product?
[SPEAKER_01]: If they had their way, could they control
the product quality over time by doing a
[SPEAKER_01]: very linear moisture removal?
[SPEAKER_01]: The same amount of water gets taken out of
the plant every single day in the 7-day,
[SPEAKER_01]: 10-day, 3-day drying period.
[SPEAKER_01]: That comes with sensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes with control.
[SPEAKER_01]: It comes with sizing correctly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do have our own product input sheets
that we can have you fill out and then
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about the process after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a matter of understanding that
influence of temperature and humidity on
[SPEAKER_01]: product weight over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jess, do you have any comments about that
linear drying graph?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it sort of speaks to a couple of
different processes that cost a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: energy to restart or re-energize once they
slow down.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I mean by that is that when you have
a big spike in moisture removal,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's usually associated with a spike in
elevated temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which can have debilitating effects on
those secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I think it really comes down to is
precision control and putting this wet
[SPEAKER_04]: weight in there and knowing how much
you're going to remove over the course of
[SPEAKER_04]: time allows you to sort of game plan for
how long it's going to take with the
[SPEAKER_04]: appropriate temperature and humidity set
points.
[SPEAKER_04]: The spikes in temperature and humidity,
either too high or too low, do things to
[SPEAKER_04]: enzymatic processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you speed up the enzymatic process
early on and then you denature the process
[SPEAKER_04]: later, you're not going to have completion
of enzymatic processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: That linear line that Rob talks about is
really sort of the concept of curing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have water pressure that pushes the
oils to the outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have the enzymatic process,
which is fundamentally driven by water and
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we have spikes, we can have enzymes
just sort of go crazy and then die off.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need them to all sort of work together
with enough time in the appropriate
[SPEAKER_04]: environment to break down the things they
need to break down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen this technique applied with a
little bit higher temperatures to remove a
[SPEAKER_04]: lot of moisture.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inevitably, the smoke is a little bit more
harsh and tends to test a little bit lower
[SPEAKER_04]: on the THC and terpene scale relative to
the biomass.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's still stuff remaining in the bud
that compromises that test result.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although it's a wonderful conversation,
especially talking about retarding microbe
[SPEAKER_04]: growth and getting down to that 20%,
but if we do it in a linear fashion that
[SPEAKER_04]: doesn't allow moisture to be reconsumed by
the cannabis, then we know that we are
[SPEAKER_04]: moving to a finish line and not moving in
a circle, if that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: To your point about curing being an art as
well as a science, I have a feeling you
[SPEAKER_02]: probably have some specific methods in
your sleeve to bring a fantastic finished
[SPEAKER_02]: product to market that involve different
set points along the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know that's loaded, Brian.
[SPEAKER_04]: You've been a part of these conversations
where I've been screaming and yelling
[SPEAKER_04]: about five different ways that I think are
great to do it and win a cannabis cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we talk about whether or not
those are possible and the real science
[SPEAKER_04]: involved.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still in the mode of discovery.
[SPEAKER_04]: The proof is in the pudding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really good weed is really good weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's undeniable.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think interpreting is a big factor here
and really determining what good weed is.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the market will tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Price point, use sell through numbers and
brand recognition are a big factor because
[SPEAKER_04]: they're tied directly back to the product
you produce.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, word has it you've won a cannabis
cup in your day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Back in my day, I may have won many others
with genetics that I bred that I didn't
[SPEAKER_04]: actually compete with, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a fun game to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Got another question here about terpings.
[SPEAKER_02]: What percent terpings would you call high
terpings content?
[SPEAKER_04]: Man, it's interesting, you know,
because we see a lot of different test
[SPEAKER_04]: results.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, you know, I think I saw some
granddaddy purple tests at like four
[SPEAKER_04]: percent one time, which is sort of a real
high mind blowing number and somewhere
[SPEAKER_04]: around two percent as far as a mass mass
collection of terpings usually is pretty
[SPEAKER_04]: good.
[SPEAKER_04]: But again, I think that the quantity of
terpings, although very important and
[SPEAKER_04]: measurable, the symphony that's created
through polymerization has been shown to
[SPEAKER_04]: just be more medically effective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or more psychoactively viable for
recreational products.
[SPEAKER_04]: The quantity of terpings is important,
but more important is the quality of each
[SPEAKER_04]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_04]: As I talked about the trichrome heads,
they need to remain intact because they
[SPEAKER_04]: have the secretory cells and the secretory
vesicles that contain cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, it's all important in there.
But.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a lot of ways to get it
done.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that we're just sort of trying
to figure it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think when you're when you're testing
terpenes, you get just a overall an
[SPEAKER_02]: overall percentage, but you don't get may
not always get the full the full profile
[SPEAKER_02]: or spectrum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's quantity, but also quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, maybe we should think about having a
conversation about why we should talk
[SPEAKER_04]: about spectrum.
[SPEAKER_04]: And cannabinoid profile in the same vein
that we talk about 40 percent THC test
[SPEAKER_04]: results and 4 percent terpene results.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, what about that could cost me?
[SPEAKER_04]: What if I'm way more high off a bud to
test at 18 percent than 28 percent?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's happened.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was it bud to bud variability or was it
the polymerization process that made me so
[SPEAKER_04]: much happier at 18 percent?
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of considerations there and
subjective as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it makes good sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of implications for for therapeutic
uses and medicinal uses as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's shift gears back to the mechanical
side.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have recommended specific airflow
velocities for curing?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of velocity, tons of velocity.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've seen we've seen some data for
different herbs that dry out and even
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've started to see the numbers that if
you're maintaining consistent temperatures
[SPEAKER_01]: and humidity, it's the condition of the
air that matters more than the velocity of
[SPEAKER_01]: the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to that end, it's important that you
get the conditioned air to this to the
[SPEAKER_01]: product that you're trying to cure and
dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the quality and quantity rather
of humidity in the air, the temperature of
[SPEAKER_01]: the air that's going to affect the drying
out process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just make sure you have airflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't matter if you go faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what the data showed us.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have way too much air, that's not a
bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have way too little, that's a very
bad thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just get enough air to the product so that
you can homogenize the atmosphere inside
[SPEAKER_01]: the room and not develop pockets of
moisture retention inside the bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think something that we're still
exploring here, too, and I think Rob and I
[SPEAKER_04]: have seen a little bit of differential
data here is that you're really not going
[SPEAKER_04]: to blow the trichromes off the plant with
air velocity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just something I want to bring up
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't worry about applying so much air
that you think the trichromes are going to
[SPEAKER_04]: volatize or blow away.
[SPEAKER_04]: That mechanical process isn't what's
causing the evaporation of trichromes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just wanted to put that out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anyone knows you, they know it's a
blast with air.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my move.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some questions coming in about different
molecules in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe we can combine a couple here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Question from Noah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there any benefit to drying or curing
in a more inert environment to limit
[SPEAKER_02]: exposure to O2 like an argon or CO2
atmosphere?
[SPEAKER_02]: Would this inhibit enzymatic activity?
[SPEAKER_02]: And maybe we can also address the concept
of ethylene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I think great question.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great question, Noah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that one of the reasons we
talk so much about MAP is that we know the
[SPEAKER_04]: importance of these environmental
conditions and that they need to be
[SPEAKER_04]: controlled.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think you nailed it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You alluded to it, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: The lack of oxygen in the space or not
enough oxygen in the space is going to
[SPEAKER_04]: slow down respiration, prevent enzymatic
activity, and could lead to anaerobic
[SPEAKER_04]: fermentation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's important to control that
environment.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's also important to know what's in
the air, because there's an amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: oxygen that's probably acceptable that
doesn't have a huge negative impact that
[SPEAKER_04]: still facilitates the process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Might even be necessary for the process,
right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I do believe it is necessary, although
there's oxygen within the plant and the
[SPEAKER_04]: cell tissues.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that oxygen in the environment is
also of critical importance, and studies
[SPEAKER_04]: show that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm scared to get too far down the road of
ethylene.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because it's such a fun topic for me to
think about.
[SPEAKER_04]: My experience in growing cannabis is more
than 15 years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I first started growing after I
graduated from Cal, I found that the
[SPEAKER_04]: knowledge was legacy authors and tomato
studies.
[SPEAKER_04]: So white papers on tomatoes and books by
guys like Ed Rosenthal and forefathers of
[SPEAKER_04]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that information, you know,
it was in its infancy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've come a long way since then.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I laugh because I rarely think about
tomatoes anymore when I cultivate
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when this ethylene conversation comes
up, I can't help myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, in commercial tomato production,
we know that ethylene is a popular
[SPEAKER_04]: solution to packaging and creating
deliverables.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, ethylene is a hormone and they
usually deliver it as an external gas.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't know, you know, tomatoes are
picked green and then basically gassed
[SPEAKER_04]: before sale in order to change the color,
change the texture and change the flavor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Further development of this product and
give it more market share and value.
[SPEAKER_04]: So my question always sort of comes down
to, well, in tomato production,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's 100 to 150 ppm of ethylene over the
course of a 24 to 48 hour period with high
[SPEAKER_04]: humidity levels.
[SPEAKER_04]: 85% or so.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that triggers that enzymatic reaction,
chemical reaction within the tomato to
[SPEAKER_04]: make it a better product.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as I go further down this path,
I'm intent on studying the effects of
[SPEAKER_04]: ethylene, the buildup of ethylene in the
space, specifically in airtight
[SPEAKER_04]: environments under pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it can have a dramatic influence.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to say that we're still exploring
it, although it is a very popular approach
[SPEAKER_04]: in commercial agriculture.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of quote unquote tomato
data to look at.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just don't have anything on cannabis
yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: But also on a side note, you know,
we've talked to facilities and this is
[SPEAKER_04]: third party data that we've collected just
from conversation, but have expressed
[SPEAKER_04]: concern for ethylene leaks in their
facilities or greenhouses because they've
[SPEAKER_04]: had situations where they've tested high
levels of ethylene higher than normal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And their entire harvest, you know,
will be two weeks early with cloudy to
[SPEAKER_04]: amber trichromes, two weeks before they
expected.
[SPEAKER_04]: Lack of biomass, lack of development,
nightmare in harvesting because now you're
[SPEAKER_04]: pulling down every single bay rather than
a week by week staggered approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we know ethylene has an impact on
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're still trying to figure out how it
impacts the curing process.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know it's a byproduct, but we don't
know the effects of the PPMs and pressures
[SPEAKER_04]: associated with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're still sort of exploring that.
[SPEAKER_04]: If that makes a little sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terrific, terrific.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you've made a comment here about
greenhouse tomatoes being picked vine
[SPEAKER_01]: ripened, of course, because everything's
better than greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: And vine ripened tomatoes are better.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a guy who has tomatoes in his backyard,
I will preach, let the tomato ripen on the
[SPEAKER_04]: vine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It has more access to sugars and products
to develop.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to be better.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I'm bringing up here is just simply
the market pressures of producing tomatoes
[SPEAKER_04]: at scale, which are now starting to impact
cannabis production as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think it's important to look at some
of those.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's have the craft grower that,
you know, cures for 60 days and gets a
[SPEAKER_04]: better product without any ethylene and
complete control.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that would be a superior product,
but market factors might not allow that to
[SPEAKER_04]: happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we might need to look for appropriate
organic, natural elements to help us
[SPEAKER_04]: influence that product and make it a
better product for final use.
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally understand what Nadia is saying.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just saying that there's a
differential application here that might
[SPEAKER_04]: be applied to someone in a certain level
of scale with a certain style of
[SPEAKER_04]: cultivation and distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully that helps answer the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: A couple more on the mechanical side.
[SPEAKER_02]: In your opinion, are steam humidifiers a
requirement for a dry room?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, are you recommending HEPA
filtration on supply side to protect
[SPEAKER_02]: plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are steam humidifiers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that what you said?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, are steam humidifiers a requirement
for a dry room?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I would say absolutely not,
unless you're doing this in the desert and
[SPEAKER_01]: you've ended up over-drying your product
and need to get moisture back in.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even then, you could be able to just,
still won't do it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: I would definitely not use a steam
humidifier.
[SPEAKER_01]: You might as well use a, you know,
adiabatic cooler inside your space to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that, get the same effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you're trying to rehydrate
your product, you might run into a
[SPEAKER_01]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have the right mechanical
equipment, you don't have to worry about
[SPEAKER_01]: going below the dew point in the room and
then over-drying your product because
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got the right systems in place to
make it all work.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the end of the day, there are going to
be systems that are fighting each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: You should have enough water in the
product itself and not have to take so
[SPEAKER_01]: much of it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to put some back in, which just
conflates the whole process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in terms of HEPA filtration,
I'm not sure that HEPA filtration is
[SPEAKER_01]: necessarily a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, HEPA filters are so good.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to take out some of those
VOCs out of the air as well as the
[SPEAKER_01]: particulate you're trying to avoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the pathogens we're worried about are
generally captured with a really good MERV
[SPEAKER_01]: 13 filter that hasn't become gummed up
and, you know, started letting more
[SPEAKER_01]: particles through because it's blown out
because the filter hasn't been changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just use a really good MERV 13 filter
and avoid the extra energy penalty and
[SPEAKER_01]: first cost and ongoing cost of replacing
those HEPA filters, just somewhat onerous.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: What kind of diffusers would you recommend
for a combination drying in your room?
[SPEAKER_02]: Any thoughts there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I'd say that any diffusers that get
air moving through the room will work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, we can make recommendations on
that, but at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'd like to model every room that we're
in because I can make a recommendation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but if I can't actually see it happen,
either with a smoke test or with a CFD
[SPEAKER_01]: model, I don't really trust it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seeing is believing for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've just seen a lot of rooms get
designed with the best of intentions that
[SPEAKER_01]: did not work out so well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we like to think about that before we
start making recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things I've seen that I thought
was a great idea, counterintuitively ended
[SPEAKER_01]: up not being a great idea, was those
linear type diffusers on one wall
[SPEAKER_01]: supplying air and then a return grill
basically making up the other wall and you
[SPEAKER_01]: have this very linear airflow through the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that sounds like a great idea
because you'd have good laminar flow
[SPEAKER_01]: through the entire space.
[SPEAKER_01]: The question becomes, where do you put the
temperature and humidity sensor for that
[SPEAKER_01]: space?
[SPEAKER_01]: As you go through the room, that air
quality will change as it either picks up
[SPEAKER_01]: or in other ways changes the air quality
of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: The air quality changes as it goes past
the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a very tough thing for me to
recommend using one of those type systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: I prefer a room that mixes well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want a room that's mixing the air
constantly so I have a homogenous
[SPEAKER_01]: atmosphere around all of the product
that's inside that room as opposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that linear airflow across it where
I only know based on my temperature and
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity sensors, I only know the
temperature and humidity and can control
[SPEAKER_01]: the one spot in the room essentially.
[SPEAKER_01]: So mixing is better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of sensors in a well-mixed
environment will give you a pretty good
[SPEAKER_01]: idea if you've got the mixing you need and
helps you achieve that homogenous
[SPEAKER_01]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I hope that answers the question.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you took that one over and above.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the ideal moisture content and
water activity for a final product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Each of their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which coast are you on?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The idea is though, and I think this has
been proven in a couple of studies,
[SPEAKER_04]: is that we have to reduce that water
activity and we have to get the moisture
[SPEAKER_04]: content of the bud below 20%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Otherwise, there'll be enough energy and
activity to stimulate microbial growth and
[SPEAKER_04]: pathogens and bud rot and all that stuff
that's going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there are some thresholds that we need
to abide by, but I think this is a great
[SPEAKER_04]: point.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had mentioned that the difference
between 5% water weight is worth millions,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also that water weight might lead to a
product that's not as well received in the
[SPEAKER_04]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: That additional water weight is going to
have lower test results for THC and
[SPEAKER_04]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these are all factors of consideration
that need to be taken into account,
[SPEAKER_04]: although you might be able to cap your
more money weight by selling that water.
[SPEAKER_04]: People are not going to appreciate it as
much as a smoke that burns cleaner,
[SPEAKER_04]: burns easier, and doesn't have those
remnants in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that this is a big portion where
you get to define your signature.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about timeline.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about balancing of terpene loss and
enzymatic activity.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about how much water content you want
to leave in that product.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're at 20%, the likelihood of
winning a cannabis cup is low.
[SPEAKER_04]: The product won't smoke well in a joint or
the traditional testing methodologies,
[SPEAKER_04]: and when vaporized, there are other
flavors that you might pick up from that
[SPEAKER_04]: water vapor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas a lower product around 10%
moisture in the cannabis bud is much more
[SPEAKER_04]: likely to be received as a premium
product.
[SPEAKER_04]: So again, it's a signature balancing act
and market pressure aspect where you have
[SPEAKER_04]: to understand how much it's worth to get
better test results and better product
[SPEAKER_04]: relative to product weight biomass.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another one related to humidity,
relative humidity.
[SPEAKER_02]: What effect is raising the relative
humidity temperature remains constant on
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes and terpenes late in the cure to
prevent over-drying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it, Rob.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go for it.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think we'll get maybe two different
opinions here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The vapor pressure of a particular gas is
independent of other gases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're worried about moisture
content inside your plant, you can
[SPEAKER_01]: decrease the vapor pressure by increasing
the humidity in the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if all you're doing is hoping to get a
moisture content reading that is
[SPEAKER_01]: consistent at the end of the drying and
you don't over-dry, you need to raise the
[SPEAKER_01]: relative humidity inside your space to
keep the moisture in the plant and keep
[SPEAKER_01]: the pressure off the liquid water in the
product from evaporating into the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is something that I need to see
testing on, and this is part of what we're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing here at Inspire.
[SPEAKER_01]: I need to see that if I increase the
terpene, the terpenes in the air,
[SPEAKER_01]: that it also applies the same vapor
pressure back to the terpenes that are on
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant that we're trying not to
volatilize.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if the question is strictly on what is
the effect on terpenes and THC inside the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant, I don't have a very good answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the question is what's the effect on
moisture content of the product,
[SPEAKER_01]: the huge, huge effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Increase the relative humidity to decrease
the vapor pressure on the water,
[SPEAKER_01]: keep the water in the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do not put yourself in a position where it
says high humidity and completely
[SPEAKER_01]: unchecked that you have this pathogen
building up that you can't control.
[SPEAKER_04]: I totally agree with you, Rob,
and I just want to add a historical side
[SPEAKER_04]: note that I think a lot of people that
cure in the small batch jar philosophy,
[SPEAKER_04]: we all prize that jar because we know
something magical happens in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: One conversation is about the relative
moisture in that space, the humidity in
[SPEAKER_04]: that space rising up through respiration,
evapotranspiration in that product,
[SPEAKER_04]: which actually might have an influence.
[SPEAKER_04]: The only reason I bring that up is that I
know that high humidities, certain gases
[SPEAKER_04]: are going to change and have different
atmospheric, they're going to impact the
[SPEAKER_04]: bud differently.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that also high humidity is going to
dramatically change the effects of
[SPEAKER_04]: ethylene or the effects of oxygen.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of variables there that
really need to be controlled, and that's
[SPEAKER_04]: what I was glad you nailed on.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about precision control and
understanding rather than just a simple,
[SPEAKER_04]: hey, this is the number and this is how
you get there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's about understanding all those
influences and impacts that go into that
[SPEAKER_04]: process and monitoring them and measuring
them throughout the entire curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thoughts on HVLS ceiling fans,
high volume, low speed ceiling fans in the
[SPEAKER_02]: dry and cure space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does the model tell you?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can put it into a room and show
that, look, I've got good air velocity and
[SPEAKER_01]: good air mixing around the product,
great.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a question in here that I saw
about, how do you get air mixing when you
[SPEAKER_01]: have all these tight baker's trays and
hanging racks and all that other stuff?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I'd be worried about.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I've got air just coming from one
direction and I'm counting on a somewhat
[SPEAKER_01]: linear laminar airflow off of this fan
pushing down constantly on the product,
[SPEAKER_01]: is the air going to make it into each and
every tray that I'm drying product on?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know the answer to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd need to see it born out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show me a CFD model, show me something,
smoke test in a room that tells me it
[SPEAKER_01]: works and if that's the case, get after
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there might be better ways to
handle that though.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think those fans are interesting,
but they're a huge surface to clean if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to use some sort of
aerosolized cleaning solution or system in
[SPEAKER_01]: between your drying and curing stages.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a fact to keep in mind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, got it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have some questions coming in about
freeze drying and the cryogenic curing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesse, maybe you can just address a little
bit more your thoughts on freeze drying
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis versus a longer cure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think that it's a technology that's
not in its infancy, but it's still in its
[SPEAKER_04]: early application stages for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm lucky enough to know the guys over
there at CryoCure and they've been a great
[SPEAKER_04]: resource for me in just sort of
understanding what they're doing and how
[SPEAKER_04]: they're doing it and the obstacles and
pinch points and how they're getting
[SPEAKER_04]: better.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think for the most part, I really like
the idea of processing and curing as
[SPEAKER_04]: quickly as possible, knowing that the
mono-terpenes are going to disappear
[SPEAKER_04]: within hours and that the other terpenes
and secondary metabolites will basically
[SPEAKER_04]: degrade on a day-by-day basis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, I'm excited about a process
that can get us to the finish line quicker
[SPEAKER_04]: while still producing a premium product.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll be honest, the products I've seen
from freeze drying have incredible bag
[SPEAKER_04]: appeal and some of the best no's that I've
ever experienced.
[SPEAKER_04]: My question is that the quality of smoke
doesn't lie just in those two things.
[SPEAKER_04]: It lies in the cleanliness of the burn.
[SPEAKER_04]: It lies in the test results.
[SPEAKER_04]: It relies in the usability.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's where we're still trying to
refine the freeze drying process.
[SPEAKER_04]: When it comes to vacuum purging water in
that environment, we're just not sure if
[SPEAKER_04]: it's a 12-hour period or a 48-hour period.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sure if you give the guys at CryoCure
a call, they'll actually talk to you about
[SPEAKER_04]: the options and paths that they've gone
down with exploration.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have some incredible scientists on
staff doing discovery and research and
[SPEAKER_04]: refinement.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's the idea that we don't exactly
know how long we're going to vacuum purge
[SPEAKER_04]: the product.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's important because once we freeze
dry, we denature everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: We stop the degradation.
[SPEAKER_04]: We stop the enzymatic processes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a hard handbrake.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we need to make sure we're at a point
in that vacuum purging process where the
[SPEAKER_04]: enzymes have broken down, the other
unwanted stuff, and the hydrolysis has
[SPEAKER_04]: occurred to remove those products from the
bud that allow us to freeze dry it at the
[SPEAKER_04]: right moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's one of the real artistic aspects of
freeze drying is that making sure that the
[SPEAKER_04]: product's going to be clean after you
freeze dry it because there's no going
[SPEAKER_04]: back, reenergizing the enzymes,
and restarting that process.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great in that sense, and it's
terrifying in that sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's applications for sure for
this product as the technology grows.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it will take a mastery of
understanding what's going on in that
[SPEAKER_04]: vacuum purging process, the effects of
pressures, and basically really close,
[SPEAKER_04]: concise monitoring.
[SPEAKER_02]: This one's related to more of the
chemistry in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any technologies to monitor the
chemistry continuously during the curing
[SPEAKER_02]: process?
[SPEAKER_01]: None that I know of.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's some work being done on
visual photographic evidence-based curing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that when we get further down the
line with the testing, we'll realize that
[SPEAKER_01]: we can use certain gases as a corollary to
the curing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for example, when we monitor CO2 in a
room that's for general commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: occupancy, we don't actually care about
the CO2 level.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're using it as a surrogate to tell us
how many people are inside this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think there's going to be some gas
we can measure as a surrogate that tells
[SPEAKER_01]: us, hey, you're this far along in the
curing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that's something to keep in
mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, I don't really know of those
two different methods that I just
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned a way to do that in situ as it's
happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jesse, do you have any ideas here?
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to take it a different way.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's some great companies out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Filter comes to mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my buddy Jason over there is always
feeding me really good information.
[SPEAKER_04]: He always talks about how we're moving
forward and how we collect information in
[SPEAKER_04]: these growth spaces and curing spaces.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've had some great conversations
about how they're moving forward to
[SPEAKER_04]: basically sample the air in this space for
microbial contaminants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it takes a collection of petri
dish and sending it off the lab and some
[SPEAKER_04]: interpretation.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that's an important thing to
consider, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Rob, you touched on basically having a
mechanical nose in this space to tell us,
[SPEAKER_04]: elucidate some of the pathogens as they
come about.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think this could also be a tool that
could be incorporated even into the shared
[SPEAKER_04]: spaces or the hallwayed spaces,
thinking about the pressures in the curing
[SPEAKER_04]: room and what might be sucked into them
and the sort of tracking it back to where
[SPEAKER_04]: those pathogens might be born or starting
from.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the first place, and also just having a
system like that in the space where you
[SPEAKER_04]: can sample and send it off and get real
lab results.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not exactly the answer to the
question that came up here, but I think
[SPEAKER_04]: it's an interesting point.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen some great companies explore
that filter, like I said, sort of comes to
[SPEAKER_04]: mind.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a handful of others out there
that I've talked with as well pursuing
[SPEAKER_04]: some similar approaches.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we'll take the opportunity to wrap
it up here.
[SPEAKER_03]: As mentioned, there's opportunity to reach
out for additional questions and specific
[SPEAKER_03]: follow-ups.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we got to the vast majority of
those question topics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really want to appreciate and thank
everybody on the line for joining us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And just a quick plug for our next monthly
webinar that's planned for a month from
[SPEAKER_03]: now, Thursday, July 2nd.
[SPEAKER_03]: Same time, same place.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've been talking quite a bit about these
10 parameters, these 10 cardinal
[SPEAKER_03]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can review our first webinar
that's available online if you missed that
[SPEAKER_03]: one.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's sort of this concept of,
okay, great, let's do it in the best
[SPEAKER_03]: possible way, scientifically and making
sure that our plants are really going to
[SPEAKER_03]: thrive and on and on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we'll wait a second.
[SPEAKER_03]: What does that now do to our overall cost
of this facility, both CAPEX and OPEX,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is such a significant factor that
needs to be considered in this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So really excited to sort of do a deeper
dive in our next one to really start to be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to balance cost, benefit,
and that relationship together to make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure that these decisions that are being
made really are the best possible
[SPEAKER_03]: decisions for your business and your
business model and your profitability.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with that, really want to thank the
guys, Jesse and Rob, particularly for
[SPEAKER_03]: spending the time on this and doing this
deep dive.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been great.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're excited to hear from the
community with more.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, have a great day and talk
to you guys soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you all.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
