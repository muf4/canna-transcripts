[SPEAKER_00]: So what happened last Friday, just to ruin
all of our weekends, is that the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Public Health clarified to
somebody that in the new regulations,
[SPEAKER_00]: when they said that the universal symbol
has to be printed on, if the packaging is
[SPEAKER_00]: separable from the outer packaging,
the universal symbol has to be printed on
[SPEAKER_00]: inhalable products, parenthetical,
shatter, dab, wax, things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we all went, sure, okay, that makes
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're going to print it on the
little container that's holding the
[SPEAKER_00]: shatter dab wax inside of a box.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it, get it, good, everybody's doing
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they said, oh, no, no,
no, we meant that it needs to be printed
[SPEAKER_00]: as well on vaporizer cartridges,
on the vaporizer cartridge itself,
[SPEAKER_00]: calling the cartridge the package of the
oil, not the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of these guys have already heard
my rant about the use of an Oxford comma
[SPEAKER_00]: in the regulations, which is in the
regulations, it says, cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates, you know, suppositories,
capsules, whatever, vape cartridges,
[SPEAKER_00]: comma, inhalable products, parenthetical,
shatter dab wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they put it in that second part
in the regs, they didn't put vape
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridges, comma, inhalable products,
shatter dab wax, they just put inhalable
[SPEAKER_00]: products, shatter dab wax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the argument happening now is that
might be what you mean but Department of
[SPEAKER_00]: Public Health, that is not what you said.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're trying so hard to read and
understand in the English language and the
[SPEAKER_00]: use of commas and all of these things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Julie's get the comma woman and I love
it because I use that argument in our
[SPEAKER_01]: letter.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then my argument is that there is a
difference between a product and a
[SPEAKER_01]: container of that product.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot use the oil that is in the pen
without the vape cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cannot, and the BCC tells me,
I cannot bulk oil, test the oil before it
[SPEAKER_01]: goes into the vape cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I must test what?
[SPEAKER_01]: The final form of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So unless the product is bulk oil and then
the container is the vape pen cart,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is not at all the way that it is set
up in the regulations, then there is no
[SPEAKER_01]: way that that vape pen cart is deemed to
be a container.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I'm going to get out my crystal
ball, I'm just going to tell you guys,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, that's where it's going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we're going to have to put universal
symbols on cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no doubt they're going to bring
back the little stamp maker is going to
[SPEAKER_00]: lobby to put the stamps back on the edible
so you know the difference between a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis chocolate and another chocolate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to go all the way down the
rabbit hole because especially since if
[SPEAKER_00]: people in Laguna Beach are getting CUPs to
open a CBD store and they're going to sell
[SPEAKER_00]: vapes, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Your law enforcement is going to want to
know on visual perception, is that a CBD
[SPEAKER_00]: vape or is that a THC vape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because now we're starting to fork into
CBD good, THC bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what's happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't have the CBD in the THC stores,
but the CBD stores, they can just go
[SPEAKER_01]: wherever they want.
[SPEAKER_01]: Doesn't matter that they're selling real
CBD or snake oil to people that they never
[SPEAKER_01]: mind.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you just go right ahead with the FDA
says that you can't have CBD.
[SPEAKER_01]: And food products, but that doesn't seem
to matter in the city of LA where the DCR
[SPEAKER_01]: stay in your lane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's something I like to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Issued guidance that you should as a CBD
business register so that you can pay the
[SPEAKER_01]: taxes to the great city of Los Angeles,
but put yourself on notice.
[SPEAKER_02]: None of this makes sense to me because
it's like, okay, at a certain point in
[SPEAKER_02]: time, you have to know as a regulator or
as a business owner or whoever that you
[SPEAKER_02]: start just a rabbit hole issue.
[SPEAKER_02]: You hear it's like, okay, so you want to
stamp the cartridge with the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: warning label.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then so people just get covers for
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we just create another industry
of vape cart covers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, you know how easy it is to take
a sticker off a glass cartridge into joy.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, just put like a slip on over it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like every coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the thing is, is that people are
going to use cannabis and people are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to buy cannabis and people are going to
sell cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so why are we getting caught up in
this is not even all of it from the CDPH
[SPEAKER_02]: and the BCC and the DCR.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's more information and it,
it just creates this where the industry
[SPEAKER_02]: that is growing the fastest, isn't the
cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the cannabis regulation industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we went from a state that did not
embrace it to the extent that they should
[SPEAKER_02]: had, even though we are the largest
producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now they're seeing the tax dollar
revenues from this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm going to be honest with you on the
political side of all of this stuff is
[SPEAKER_02]: there is neither party is after our true
like goal here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that when politics get involved,
it just means that more money goes to
[SPEAKER_02]: bureaucracy in this right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I was excited to see some
big wins this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know at a moment's notice,
we could find out that cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, the president said that cannabis
is fine now because Lord, I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: we hear rant more ridiculous stuff every
day, every day, every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so you live in a very volatile
industry, but that's also why a lot of us
[SPEAKER_02]: are in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like we can't do redundancy other than our
records and any other thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think it's important also to go
back to the inconsistency in the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations with the vape pen issue is
that also there was no reconciliation of
[SPEAKER_01]: the size or the color.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're going to put it on a vape pen,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That half an inch by half an inch.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you want to look to where D.P.H.
[SPEAKER_01]: says, well, Oregon does it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oregon gave a very specific, I would dare
say one of the best visual guidance about
[SPEAKER_01]: what they want their packaging and
labeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they downsized the sticker that they
would put on a vape pen card because it
[SPEAKER_01]: was smaller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And D.P.H.
[SPEAKER_01]: has no way to say that they don't know
what is currently happening in this
[SPEAKER_01]: industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have been to manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have been to dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have sent them pictures on behalf of my
clients of their products to clear
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when we talk about the inconsistencies
in the regulations and to Julie's point,
[SPEAKER_01]: no, this is where we're going to end up.
[SPEAKER_01]: What we're fighting over today is the
grace period, is the amount of time that
[SPEAKER_01]: it will take to ensure that one of the
largest growing segments of this industry
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't shut out, that all of a sudden
consumers don't get vape pens because
[SPEAKER_01]: there is no access to the vape pen market
because no vape pen on the market today in
[SPEAKER_01]: this state is compliant because we didn't
know the intention of D.P.H.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really, I think, important to
note when you're looking at this issue is
[SPEAKER_01]: where we're going, where we are,
and why we have to continually fight and
[SPEAKER_01]: on a united front be consistent in our
messaging as an industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because as Brett said, you know,
the political powers are not there to help
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we as an industry are so fractured
that we're fighting one another and on
[SPEAKER_01]: some issues, some parts of the industry
are aligning with law enforcement and
[SPEAKER_01]: League of Cities, and then others are not,
we look weaker as the whole.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't ever say it enough,
high tides raise all ships.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we want everybody in this industry
to succeed, then we have to be kind to one
[SPEAKER_01]: another and not be throwing one another
under the bus when there is more than
[SPEAKER_01]: enough problems that we can share in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is important too, because we are,
like you're saying, one of my favorite
[SPEAKER_00]: recent stories is, I don't know if you
guys know Cody Bass up in South Lake Tahoe
[SPEAKER_00]: who runs a dispensary and recently got
elected to his city council.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the kind of change when stuff
gets interesting is rather than just say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, I don't know, the politicians aren't
on our side.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can be the politicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's when the interesting change starts
to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can show up at the city council
meetings.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can show up at the town halls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can take the seats on those advisory
councils.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is how we affect change is not by
sitting around and complaining and
[SPEAKER_00]: watching what's happening and having it be
something that's happening to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a living evolutionary process that
we are part of and we can change it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I liked it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was a mic drop.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Does anybody have any other regulatory
questions?
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of gave you a very high level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love her statement here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what she's saying is something that I
harp on all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Pamela, you were just discussing here
is that if you see another company that's
[SPEAKER_02]: making a competing product, no,
they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's enough space for all of us here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody has a space in cannabis right
now, as long as you do it within
[SPEAKER_02]: compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it drives me nuts to see this breaking
each other down and putting each other's
[SPEAKER_02]: business all out there.
[SPEAKER_02]: When everybody has business, everybody's
trying to do their best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And which is frustrating because we know
that they could come back on any of us in
[SPEAKER_02]: five years and say, oh, well, you weren't
doing it back then.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I appreciate you saying that because we
all need to work together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's something I say a lot as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody in the cannabis space is your
enemy, is your competition.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are all your allies.
[SPEAKER_00]: The fight that we have right now is if the
people who built the cannabis industry and
[SPEAKER_00]: are from the industry get to participate
at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: My perception of the enemy is Pfizer is
the enemy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's who gets to do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're fighting for.
[SPEAKER_00]: That my understanding of Prop 64,
a deeply imperfect regulatory document,
[SPEAKER_00]: was because people were ready to
decriminalize cannabis activity,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were ready for social justice,
and they wanted to preserve access.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those are the things that we are
having to fight the hardest for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is for those core principles to still be a
part of this while everybody's gone into
[SPEAKER_00]: the opposite reefer madness of corporate
money insanity of how do I race fastest to
[SPEAKER_00]: burn down all the houses around me so that
I can be the first unicorn in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: space?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say all the time, the thing that
gets me out of bed in the morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have so little interest in one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have one guy making a billion dollars in
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a hell of a lot of interest in
thousands of people having well-paying,
[SPEAKER_00]: highly skilled, technical jobs,
lab technicians, growers, transporters,
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturers, reintroducing a viable
middle class to American economy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's interesting to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: That gets me out of bed in the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because 20 years ago, I could live in New
York City and work at a bookstore
[SPEAKER_00]: part-time and be an artist, and that was
that reality, that economic reality has
[SPEAKER_00]: been eviscerated from the face of our
planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what I view the cannabis industry
as is an opportunity to re-stabilize the
[SPEAKER_00]: economy in these much needed ways and to
treat the pain and the suffering,
[SPEAKER_00]: the economic pain, the classist pain,
the racist pain of a nation that was built
[SPEAKER_00]: on suffering and exploitation,
and we are standing at the crossroads
[SPEAKER_00]: being like, okay, so is this gonna be like
a cure and a treatment for this suffering
[SPEAKER_00]: of where we came from, or is it gonna be
the next corporate bullshit that's gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: go the same way as everything else and
continue to add to the suffering of the
[SPEAKER_00]: world?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is the choice that we have to
make.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which one do you wanna be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Julie, I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we get to have dinner soon or
something, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we get to do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there more questions?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I definitely agree to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, our enemies are so many
different things, but oftentimes our
[SPEAKER_02]: enemies are just purely judgment.
[SPEAKER_02]: Judgment of other people's life actions
here, and it doesn't have to do with this
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis or any other thing like that,
is that humans, we need to do a lot better
[SPEAKER_02]: job of not giving a shit what our neighbor
is doing.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they're not hurting anybody,
then at a certain point in time,
[SPEAKER_02]: we're losing our middle-class economy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're losing our education.
[SPEAKER_02]: All these different areas is being cycled
back into just because it's highly
[SPEAKER_02]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_02]: The things that we have to do,
we're spending tax money in areas that we
[SPEAKER_02]: didn't think we were being taxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: They say that here in the US, we have
cheaper taxes and we have cheaper stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you pay for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the price of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just going to pay for all these other
regulations that take to get you there.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to support the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the consumer is the person in the
room that legitimately is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: marginalized.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you go into a store just to buy an
eighth of cannabis, it is upwards of $90.
[SPEAKER_01]: $90.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is taxed at 30 to 50 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is one of the highest tax commodities
that there is and higher than cigarettes
[SPEAKER_01]: and alcohol, which kill you, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis does not.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is legitimately medicine for some
people that they cannot get and they
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot afford.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vicodin and opiates, they're $5.14 when
you go to the pharmacy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your medication is $5.14 and you'd
rather get off of it and get onto
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, but your insurance company won't
cover it and it's $90 for an eighth,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's $100 to get CBD like cannabis,
CBD, 18 to one pills are $90 for a count
[SPEAKER_01]: of less than 60.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incorrigible that the industry is out
for this $125 million payday that we're
[SPEAKER_01]: bringing in capital and we're not
screaming from the rooftops that the taxes
[SPEAKER_01]: are too high because there is nobody to
sell it to if they cannot afford to buy
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you are not spending as much time
supporting these legislative efforts,
[SPEAKER_01]: then you will have no market share to
speak of because nobody will be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: afford it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we've seen the true medical
market in cannabis be decimated.
[SPEAKER_02]: I worked with parents that were already
spending $1,200 a month for their child
[SPEAKER_02]: who has epilepsy and now it's over $3,000
or $3,600 a month when they can find it
[SPEAKER_02]: and it's not the same as it was before.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have lost the medical market and that's
why I got into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cannabis saved my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had epilepsy for years and I haven't had
a seizure in four years now because of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget that at times, this is why you
got into this industry is to help patients
[SPEAKER_02]: and to work with doctors in bringing down
stigma and that is a huge part of what
[SPEAKER_02]: we're still fighting here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stigma is going down but at what cost?
[SPEAKER_01]: Recreational people can't afford it
either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Medical is so important and I have
migrants so I'm with you Brett.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can find my medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have clients that I'm able to procure a
product from but that's not everybody's
[SPEAKER_01]: situation clearly but I'm not just talking
about medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: The medical market is truly suffering but
if the recreational market, if the adult
[SPEAKER_01]: use market can't afford to pay,
then the entire system collapses.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sometimes gets cast in a way because
medical is so important and it's suffering
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want you to understand that if you have
no customers, the rest of the supply chain
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is your problem because I have
operators that will say, or I've heard
[SPEAKER_01]: operators say, well, that's not really my
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: My problem is running my business.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have a market and we will have
a resurgence of the illicit market if we
[SPEAKER_01]: are not careful in protecting the taxation
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also just fun little facts.
[SPEAKER_01]: If a city charges you a tax to operate,
that is not then a tax that you assess to
[SPEAKER_01]: the customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is your tax to operate your business
that allows you to make money.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a real important issue that
when CDTFA comes and starts doing these
[SPEAKER_01]: audits, it is actually not lawful to pass
on that tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you write a receipt, and I have
seen this happen, there is a sales and use
[SPEAKER_01]: tax, the excise tax that somehow is
applied at the retailer, which it's
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to already be in the cost of the
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got sales and use tax,
excise tax, an additional city tax and
[SPEAKER_01]: then the final cost.
[SPEAKER_01]: That last item, that last like,
oh, they charged me 5% gross sales
[SPEAKER_01]: receipts tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's your company's tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not the consumer tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be forewarned, we're going to see lawsuits
surrounding that either from the public to
[SPEAKER_01]: those operators or fines from CDTFA.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, cannabis ninjas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have work to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have food to eat, music to listen to,
people to talk to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thank you so much to Future Cannabis
Project for having us come and speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: We wish you great things in life ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
Thank you.
