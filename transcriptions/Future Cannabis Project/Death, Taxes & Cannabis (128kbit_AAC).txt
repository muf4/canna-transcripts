[SPEAKER_00]: This is us to do with the CDTFA and the
tax, excise tax regulations, and this is
[SPEAKER_00]: very nuanced.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in a non-arms length transaction,
you tax on the wholesale price and there
[SPEAKER_00]: is not a clear differentiation,
although in their new round of proposed
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations, they are suggesting an option
for those.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I believe that when there is a
calculation of the average wholesale price
[SPEAKER_00]: of cannabis, which is what it says in the
law, it should just be the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of the calculations are being
made based on the product, which means the
[SPEAKER_00]: entire cost, which means the hardware,
the packaging, all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that all of that needs to be
exempt and there needs to be two separate
[SPEAKER_00]: invoices and the excise tax needs to just
be paid on the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what it says in the law and that's
what should be reflected in the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a big one.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the luxury tax that I've had
other retailers complain about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Taxing the tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, well, taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: The taxing the tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are layers and layers of
your local, your sales, your excise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the way that you break it down is
you're actually the excise is put in
[SPEAKER_00]: first.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your local taxes is being calculated
with the excise tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Already incorporated into the amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tax on a tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sales, because you're adding in the
excise tax first and then all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes is includes the excise tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the calculation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the reason that this exclusion of the
of the parts of the product that is not
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis as legally defined cannabis or
cannabis products so that and that means
[SPEAKER_00]: the oil or whatever cannabis accessories,
a very specific definition, which means
[SPEAKER_00]: packaging and hardware and all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That increases the value significantly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're already paying a lot of money
for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every this is very expensive stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for vaporizers specifically on the
China, the tariffs on China, there is
[SPEAKER_00]: actually I've received emails and I've
seen this.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is going to become a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because the taxes on vape pens is
going to go up because most of these vape
[SPEAKER_00]: pens come in from China, that means the
price of the product is going to go up,
[SPEAKER_00]: which means and if they are including
these vape pens, the hardware and the
[SPEAKER_00]: price of the hardware, including those
tariffs into the product price that's
[SPEAKER_00]: being calculated for the excise tax,
that's going to be a big hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's 25 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hardware is one of the most
expensive parts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the cannabis is expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so that is that is the big reason why
I say especially and because packaging is
expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive to making sure things are
child resistant and following all the
[SPEAKER_00]: other regulations that have to do with
packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you remove those costs, then your
taxes that you're calculating is a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, those taxes go through to the
consumer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's another situation where the
consumer has a potential class action
[SPEAKER_01]: complaint against the state for overtaxing
against the mandates of the law against
[SPEAKER_01]: the provisions of the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure an argument probably could be
made for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your first folks, three non lawyers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's pretty clear that,
yeah, I mean, cannabis, there's very clear
[SPEAKER_00]: definitions for cannabis, cannabis
products and cannabis accessories.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the CDTFA, to their credit,
are giving an option for that for
[SPEAKER_00]: distributors to market separately.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on invoices.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I know that there's been a lot of
disagreement because there's concern of
[SPEAKER_00]: exposing certain price agreements with
vendors on hardware.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not really sure what the deal is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't do manufacturing or so.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do know that at some point you are
ordering hardware and at some point you
[SPEAKER_00]: are ordering weed and they are separate
and then you put it together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know what the cost is and the
weight and the transfer is all in metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it should be easy to calculate.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's so that's something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just think because everything is so
expensive, any possible way that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: reduce the taxes and then that we're
moving as the cost to the consumer is
[SPEAKER_00]: something that we need to be exploring
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, well, the state doesn't even want to
lower the excise tax in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far, it sounds like there's not a lot
of enthusiasm for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, what's left of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the economic sweet spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we got Berkeley to cut their taxes
in half and very early on, which was great
[SPEAKER_00]: and very helpful, but not not where it
should be.
Thank you very much.
