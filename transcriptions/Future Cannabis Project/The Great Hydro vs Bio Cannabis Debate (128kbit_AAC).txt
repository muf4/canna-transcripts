[SPEAKER_00]: Arian.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kyle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We haven't actually sat down together with
a microphone in front of us in almost 25
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no idea which year it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it was 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's 19 years then.
[SPEAKER_00]: 19 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's make it 20.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, round it up to 20.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm good with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know neither of us were thinking
about legalization back then.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you remember we had the discussion at
that time in the Positronix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: The hydro versus bio.
[SPEAKER_00]: It became known as the great hydro versus
bio debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole High Times magazine issue,
or even two or three, were about that
[SPEAKER_01]: whole thing, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember you won the competition
with 51% against 49%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we did a blind test.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we had like 100 blind samples.
[SPEAKER_01]: Half of them were hydro and half of them
were bio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we were going to say,
OK, the people have to figure out which
[SPEAKER_01]: one was hydro or which one was bio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was 51% against 49%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because Werner was there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was, of course, the bio man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember Werner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we set it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: But still, until now, it's funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're sitting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I still am completely bio and hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you look at my nutrient company,
half of it is completely organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other half is minerals,
which is not completely hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my menus are still half bio,
organic, and half hydro.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always been 50-50.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have numerous reasons for that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Main reason is that personally,
I love bio.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think organic is the way to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because on the long run, it's very,
very good for our planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are some situations where we
have to feed a lot of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where it can be also environmentally
friendly when we recycle all the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And where we can also do a good hydro job.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's very, very well put.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's how it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to debate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know we have big, serious problems in
Africa with food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where we can feed more people.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we technically have to do maybe
some situation to a hydro system.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm in favor of that to save lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where I come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're very smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love to be able to debate, but that was
so well put.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because water is the most precious
resource of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the most important thing on our
planet.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So congratulations on the new organic
line, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you like it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm not 50-50.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go, no thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I usually turn it away.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a very picky palate.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a little bit of a weed snob.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't mean to disrespect anybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just have a very sensitive palate.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, listen, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I used to be a chef in the old days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have three Michelin star friends.
[SPEAKER_01]: So organic food for me is by far the
better food in the world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also when I smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also like to play with hydro in the
grow room.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to blow up that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to play with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's also a hobby.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like to do both.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you come to my factory now in Cremor,
we have this huge factory with Canopy
[SPEAKER_01]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cremor, Toronto in Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are going to produce next year
between 10 and 15 tons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And half of the factory is hydro,
and the other half of the factory is bio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And even farther, half of the factory is
HPS.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the new half of the factory is LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: You make it sound so harmonious,
the way you blend these things together.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't favor one over the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's pros and cons in life to
pretty much everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And same thing goes with cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me, I'm stuck with just poor old veganics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it's a little bit the same with
sativas and indicas.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we had this debate with so many
people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like all my friends, including our friend
Franco passed unfortunately away.
[SPEAKER_01]: Totally indica, indica, indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: All day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm a sativa guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to be high.
[SPEAKER_00]: All day long?
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica?
[SPEAKER_01]: He was?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't like the sativa at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: Occasionally.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe to make me feel happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh huh.
[SPEAKER_01]: But no, no, Ariane.
[SPEAKER_01]: Listen, we have red wine and we have
whiskey.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want the whiskey.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, okay, I want the red wine,
but I like the whiskey also.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a sativa guy too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, but at night you smoke the
indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But why are you a sativa guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the cerebral high or the taste?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, because of that I can work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I also like the taste much more than
the indica to be honest.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, I find, I don't find that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about real sativas.
[SPEAKER_01]: 15, 16 weeks.
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not the ones you get in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you have, you smoked my
strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's only 10 weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, but that's 40% indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's 25% indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's more.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm talking about longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, you're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that plan, by the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is a great plan.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still my favorite sativa.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's 40% indica.
[SPEAKER_01]: You think?
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Be fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come on, be fair.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cannot have a 10 week plan that's 25%
indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me ask you, you don't watch a lot
of television.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't watch a lot of television.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't have time unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_00]: I did, I recently did a really interesting
episode of explained on Netflix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was, they were asking me about the
labeling issue, you know, about people
[SPEAKER_00]: going into the shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And wanting to buy indica and being able
to say that this is, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's such a, such an issue.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I ended up getting into was
talking about how a plant, because it's,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything's so mixed up nowadays that a
plant can have just like, almost like
[SPEAKER_00]: human sexuality.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the range is as wide as,
as can be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have an indica plant with
sativa growth characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or a sativa plant with indica growth
characteristics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you just agreed with me that I could
have a sativa that has 10 weeks growth
[SPEAKER_00]: characteristics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I can even tell you even more crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, yeah, yes and no.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to tell you something that you
probably don't know what I just figured
[SPEAKER_01]: out like 10 years ago when I made my India
movie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of seeds growing us in
the Milan and Provati Valley in India from
[SPEAKER_01]: us because of my background, you know,
you know, I'm from Africa.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember I know 92, I opened the first
coffee shop where you were always guests
[SPEAKER_01]: and all the hippies came from India with
the Malani and the charas and whatever,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, the same seeds that I grow down
in the valley on, let's say a thousand
[SPEAKER_01]: meter, 1200 meter that were indica seeds,
indica plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: I grew them up on 2,400 meters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It turned out to be sativas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is completely flabbergasting and we
still, we cannot put our finger behind.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did that test three times and the plant
just changed and this is not documented
[SPEAKER_01]: nowhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, sometimes I speak about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I said yes and no to your
story.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't that crazy?
[SPEAKER_01]: That is really crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a word for that in plant biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something morph.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I can't put my finger on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Morpho diet or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I've never went to college.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably you also not.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I haven't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're all like, we're natural born
growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have to say I did two years with,
you remember the clone guy, Jaap Boeri
[SPEAKER_01]: Jaap in Holland.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was the supplier of Werner,
by the way, with clones.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: You remember when Werner had all those
clones?
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were all from Boeri Jaap.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with him together, I went two years to
the Haas, the H-A-S, that was the higher
[SPEAKER_01]: agraric school.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there we did tissue culture and
protoplasm fusion.
[SPEAKER_01]: So actually it was the only two years that
I went one day a week to school.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long, what year was that?
[SPEAKER_01]: I was, I was 30 years old.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's 23 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it served you well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was fun to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was fun to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
