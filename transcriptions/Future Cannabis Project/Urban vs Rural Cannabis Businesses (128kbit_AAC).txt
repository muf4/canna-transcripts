[SPEAKER_01]: We talk a lot about, you know,
sungrown versus indoor in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: different types of policies, but I think
we also need to start talking about rural
[SPEAKER_01]: versus urban.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a whole set of barriers for
rural cannabis businesses that urban
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis businesses do not have to deal
with, but yet we are put up against the
[SPEAKER_01]: same processes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So things like having things affixed to
the ground or having ADA accessibility if
[SPEAKER_01]: you have employees or having separate
areas for everything or having,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a paved road to and from your
facility if you have employees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Two hours a day every day of the week.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we need to start thinking about
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe next legislative session,
we need to come with a bill that is
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically addressing issues for rural
cannabis businesses and not just farmers,
[SPEAKER_01]: just, you know, manufacturers and retail
and anybody that has to exist in a rural
[SPEAKER_01]: area where you don't have good internet,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And your micro businesses can't all be on
the same page.
[SPEAKER_01]: No one else does it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the wineries grow grapes here and make
wine here and have a tasting room here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so why are we being subject to a very
urban centered policy structure?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just not fair to the people that are
the legacy producers in this industry.
No,
[SPEAKER_02]: there wasn't a shift in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a shift in the number of pricing
tiers for almost all of the licenses
[SPEAKER_02]: within the BCC.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything from testing labs to self
distribution, micro businesses and also
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis event organizers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I thought that was pretty fascinating.
[SPEAKER_02]: But a couple of things that I thought,
like speaking of rural farmers,
[SPEAKER_02]: I think about seasonal farmers,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you're in an urban area, you are more
likely to have electricity or resources
[SPEAKER_02]: available, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That flat area that allows you to maybe
cultivate year round or develop in that
[SPEAKER_02]: manner.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rural farmers often haven't developed in
that manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they're not those kind of
cultivators.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still don't have the ability to utilize
light deprivation in the outdoor tier.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like that didn't happen
either.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it seems like there's some concern
about whether or not if you're in a
[SPEAKER_02]: structure, say like a hoop house or a
greenhouse, but you don't use depth tarps
[SPEAKER_02]: and you don't use lighting, it looks like
you might get forced into the ML1 tier.
[SPEAKER_02]: In that structure.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then I also, there was a series of
recent inspections.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we've been told is if you are
licensed under the mixed light one tier
[SPEAKER_02]: and you have say, I don't know,
9,000 square feet in light depth hoops,
[SPEAKER_02]: but a thousand square feet of it is open
air for your 10,000 square feet of canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But those need to be two separate
licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't cultivate your full term outdoor
crop under your ML1 license and bundle
[SPEAKER_02]: those together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's going to have exponential
impact for separate premises and separate
[SPEAKER_00]: operations and separate license fees and
separate surety bonds.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's definitely something that came up
when we were talking to the Board of
[SPEAKER_01]: Supervisors in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they were not aware at all that you
could not be outdoor and have one license
[SPEAKER_01]: if you were pulling a tarp or having a
hoop house.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think people thought that they could
have 10,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as you said you were mixed light.
[SPEAKER_00]: That included outdoor or mixed light and
you could include it under one license.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess we're going to have to go smoke
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I was just going to say.
