[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to read you three quotes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're fast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of you in the house are familiar
with some of these people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Diane Goldstein from LEAP, which is law
enforcement, used to be law enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: against prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's law enforcement action
partnership.
[SPEAKER_00]: Diane made an interesting comment here.
[SPEAKER_00]: She said the Greek playwright,
Aeschylus, once wrote, in war,
[SPEAKER_00]: truth is the first casualty.
[SPEAKER_00]: His president's summary of the nature of
conflict and power has played out on
[SPEAKER_00]: American soil over the last 40 years as we
have strived to make our country
[SPEAKER_00]: drug-free.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clear that the industry needs to
recognize that they are not just
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurs, but that they are drug
policy reformers and advocates as well and
[SPEAKER_00]: can help by continuing to support drug
policy reform organizations that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: instrumental in rolling back the harms of
the drug war while protecting all of our
[SPEAKER_00]: civil liberties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lynn Lyman, state director for Drug Policy
Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're walking in today to this whole nice
legal world where everybody can wear a
[SPEAKER_00]: name tag that says they're with some
cannabis association.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas five years ago, even people were
still doing federal time for having a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advice I give to all of those people
who's coming into the cannabis industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the history.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the sense that people are just
waltzing in as if it's just any other
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to discourage that and remind you
that a lot of people have died.
[SPEAKER_00]: People have been incarcerated.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've had their families destroyed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Making sure you're a good neighbor and
you're working with the community that you
[SPEAKER_00]: are based in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, Kristen Nevadal, who some of
you may know in the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kristen is the chair of the International
Cannabis Farmers Association in NorCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kristen wrote, donations from cannabis
businesses in Humboldt have built a
[SPEAKER_00]: community center, KMUD Radio, the Civil
Liberties Monitoring Project, local
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteer fire departments, technical
rescue and sports and art programs at our
[SPEAKER_00]: rural schools.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a farming community for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: She encourages folks to get involved with
their local community by supporting and
[SPEAKER_00]: volunteering.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our schools, fire departments,
parks and so much more need time and
[SPEAKER_00]: donations.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are strong as a group, but we need
to continue further onto that.
