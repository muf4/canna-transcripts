[SPEAKER_00]: With the passage of AB 2020, raise your
hand if you've read AB 2020 from front to
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God, we have Pam Epstein in the
house who's gonna be doing a legal deep
[SPEAKER_00]: dive into temporary licenses, cannabis
events, something that happened fairly
[SPEAKER_00]: often in 2017.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2018, a lot of the consumption events you
all know and love came to a screeching
[SPEAKER_00]: halt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pam's here to explain why, but to explain
why things are about to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And on our panel we have a whole bunch of
cannabis event operators in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm gonna turn it over to Pam.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's gonna do a little legal deep dive
with everyone and then I'm gonna do the
[SPEAKER_00]: business side of running events with the
panel.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Pam.
[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's interesting to set up the
conversations you're gonna hear from the
[SPEAKER_01]: operators up here who have lived through
the challenges, who have learned
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the implementation period of
what is now the MAUCRSA and have
[SPEAKER_01]: persevered through that and are going to
kind of take us through that journey
[SPEAKER_01]: through what living this ever-changing
legal landscape was with a lens on what we
[SPEAKER_01]: have to look forward to in 2019 and why it
may seem like a small victory,
[SPEAKER_01]: it is going to be a watershed moment to
get us back to the events culture that
[SPEAKER_01]: California was known for under Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to set us up for that, California was
the first state to take decriminalized
[SPEAKER_01]: action in 1996 with the Compassionate Use
Act that then became the medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: program with SB 420.
[SPEAKER_01]: That gave you the cooperative collective
model in the 2008 Attorney General
[SPEAKER_01]: guidelines and we lived under that system
for quite a long period of time until late
[SPEAKER_01]: 2015 when there was a trio of bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting to note there were over I
think 80 legislative bills this past
[SPEAKER_01]: session so we've come a long way and that
gave us MAUCRSA which then gave birth to
[SPEAKER_01]: what statutory structure we currently
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: And under that structure, predating that
structure under the 215 model,
[SPEAKER_01]: you would simply have an event and you
would check recommendations, patient
[SPEAKER_01]: recommendations, and you would have brands
that showed up because they were properly
[SPEAKER_01]: formed collectives and people would join
the collectives and they were able to have
[SPEAKER_01]: this robust interaction with cannabis and
the operators and the manufacturers that
[SPEAKER_01]: were truly engaged in this process.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened when we had infrastructure
come into play is you had the creation by
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the three regulatory agencies,
the Bureau of Cannabis Control,
[SPEAKER_01]: developed an event organizer licensee and
special event licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when the MAUCRSA came into effect,
it said a very specific precedent about
[SPEAKER_01]: where these events were allowed to be
located.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were allowed to be located on
agricultural district agricultural
[SPEAKER_01]: associations and county fairgrounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: District agricultural associations,
there are 58 throughout the state and they
[SPEAKER_01]: are state agencies.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, these state agencies,
these are like little state agencies are
[SPEAKER_01]: housed within other jurisdictions and
because when we had the MAUCRSA come into
[SPEAKER_01]: effect, you had to have local
authorization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Local authorization was given to you by a
local jurisdiction that was defined as a
[SPEAKER_01]: city, county, or city and county.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that did not include a district
agricultural association.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as these event organizers went to go
get their license and engage in a
[SPEAKER_01]: compliant activity, they went to where you
naturally think that you would go as you
[SPEAKER_01]: are a state agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll hear I'm sure about the trials
and tribulations with Chalice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I in fact worked with the 28th DAA because
they believed that they had the
[SPEAKER_01]: jurisdictional control over their borders
to regulate what events took place there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's an important distinction,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You would think that they don't pay city
tax.
[SPEAKER_01]: They get all of their permits from the
state that now all of the sudden where you
[SPEAKER_01]: are located, where this district
agricultural association is located,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's in the name, they serve a larger
district.
[SPEAKER_01]: They serve everybody in the state of
California to the means of granting them
[SPEAKER_01]: access to agricultural activity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are in fact in cannabis an agricultural
product, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is in the wheelhouse of what these
district agricultural associations are
[SPEAKER_01]: used to doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They put on events.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have liquor licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't go to the jurisdiction at any
other point to ask for permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: And why is this so critical?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because you may have a favorable DAA who
has had positive experiences with cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: operators that then have to go and ask a
city for permission.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that city may be unfavorable to
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that then creates a conflict that was
unresolvable until we got to 2020.
[SPEAKER_01]: So an event organizer goes, they go
through the disclosure process,
[SPEAKER_01]: they get their license, and then they have
to go and get that event license,
[SPEAKER_01]: that temporary event allowance.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when we run into the problems at
the fairgrounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And moving forward, as we talked about,
2020 gives you the right, gives these
[SPEAKER_01]: operators the right to be able to hold
events not on DAAs or county fairgrounds,
[SPEAKER_01]: but anywhere where they can get local
authority and local authorization.
[SPEAKER_01]: At first that seems like you're gonna be
able to have an event anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: What this does is it allows for events to
take place, not at those two specific
[SPEAKER_01]: locations, but you have to gain permission
to do so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And once you give the right to regulate,
you will see cities and counties stepping
[SPEAKER_01]: up and wanting to regulate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to have to get some sort of
permit?
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I always advise and what I know that
these operators will likely do is to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: those cities with a request.
[SPEAKER_01]: Know what kind of event you wanna have,
know where you wanna have that event,
[SPEAKER_01]: know whether or not there is alcohol
that's going to be served at that event,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that is a critical component of
the events culture that is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to experience pain points,
is how do you have an event where you have
[SPEAKER_01]: two substances that are heavily
controlled.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've seen the state and the governor
take a very specific position,
[SPEAKER_01]: A, that you cannot infuse cannabis with
any alcohol.
[SPEAKER_01]: More to the point than that, the
regulations flushed out that you cannot
[SPEAKER_01]: even have de-alcoholized beer or wine or
anything that would confuse the consumer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see that we're gonna have
strategic pain points to learn how to
[SPEAKER_01]: navigate between having a premise and what
that premise means and whether or not
[SPEAKER_01]: you're at a facility that serves alcohol
and whether or not that facility could
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially be jeopardizing their liquor
license or their insurance policies or any
[SPEAKER_01]: other business license that they currently
have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is the difference, you may be
thinking, between a consumption event and
[SPEAKER_01]: an event that you can consume at where you
can also purchase cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's sort of also what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we've seen in the last year to two
years these pop-up events that occur where
[SPEAKER_01]: you see vendors that are there that are
exchanging products.
[SPEAKER_01]: If that product has not gone through a
retailer, if that event is taking place in
[SPEAKER_01]: a non-private residence even then,
with the track and trace coming online,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not going to be able to hold those
events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are non-compliant.
[SPEAKER_01]: California says there is no, or the city
of Los Angeles says there is no
[SPEAKER_01]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do not have time yet to regulate
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are no consumption lounges that
are regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are no consumption on site with a
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are things that need to be flushed
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Southern California, the only people
that are, the only city jurisdiction that
[SPEAKER_01]: is moving in that direction is the city of
West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are issuing specific consumption
licenses and dispensaries that are allowed
[SPEAKER_01]: to consume on site and sell.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see the more they have the
bandwidth to regulate, these jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_01]: will start to do so and they will regulate
events in the same manner and practice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because West Hollywood is looking at the
events issue now that they want to get
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead of it because they are a progressive
city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other cities you're going to see in
Southern California move much faster,
[SPEAKER_01]: unfortunately, than the city of Los
Angeles will be out in the desert where
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to see Coachella,
Palm Springs, Desert Hot Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all going to issue events.
[SPEAKER_01]: Up north, you're going to see this play
out much quicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: As Oakland and Sacramento already have
said, we're just going to process events
[SPEAKER_01]: in the same and similar fashion.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know Davis, the city of Davis,
is also very much looking into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you want to support these event
organizers, I say please be responsible
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're at the events.
[SPEAKER_01]: These is, you know, we're learning to
walk, crawl, run it out here in
[SPEAKER_01]: California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as we want to develop the ability to
curate events where you're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: able to see demonstrations of cannabis
products being made and then ingest them
[SPEAKER_01]: without having to have final form products
through the quality assurance and quality
[SPEAKER_01]: control mechanisms that we have,
the best way to do that is to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: compliant attendee at these events.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would ask you to do that and really
listen and support these operators as they
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you how they traverse these very
tumultuous waters over the last two years.
Thank you very much.
Thank you.
