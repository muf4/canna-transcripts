[SPEAKER_01]: So they just gave me this topic and said,
this is what you're going to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I spent some time really locking it
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is open source?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that apply to what we're doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we really open source?
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't tell, but that's what we're going
to call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check, check, check, check,
check, check.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right, let's try again.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was never a war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always been a war on people.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the little guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: This war.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right in the middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we'll go back.
[SPEAKER_01]: So took the government a whole long time,
but we keep the people, the
[SPEAKER_01]: non-centralized defensive guerrilla force,
have the ability to change at a moment's
[SPEAKER_01]: notice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Point, point made.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because this time, the people have a tool
more powerful than any government
[SPEAKER_01]: corporation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time, we have the ability to freely
communicate at a global scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time, we have the open source model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't take my word for it, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's take a look at Microsoft circa 1990s
and early 21st century.
[SPEAKER_01]: Executives at Microsoft were terrified of
Linux and the open source model for good
[SPEAKER_01]: reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: They claimed that it was a cancer to their
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Internal memos at the company acknowledged
open source as a methodology capable of
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting or exceeding proprietary
development methodology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, their entire system that
they built this company on was that threat
[SPEAKER_01]: of losing to this wild open source thing
that they couldn't even put a pen on.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're non-centralized, didn't know who
was running it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we stop this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Balmer called this new threat communism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft developed intricate strategies
to lock customers into proprietary
[SPEAKER_01]: software.
[SPEAKER_01]: Embrace, extend, extinguish was their
model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Conquer all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Flash forward 20 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Linux is the backbone of the internet and
most of your smartphones.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft still makes plenty of money and
not only owns, but is the number one
[SPEAKER_01]: contributor to GitHub, one of the largest
communities of open source software on
[SPEAKER_01]: earth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And nobody's living in communes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, that's a different speech.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what happened?
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft realized that they couldn't
compete with shared development.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flexibility and capability of a global
network of contributors far outpaced their
[SPEAKER_01]: ability to keep up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When they accepted this, they also
switched a good portion of their business
[SPEAKER_01]: model to mirror this more successful
model.
[SPEAKER_01]: Microsoft now makes far more money on
Linux-based cloud services than they do on
[SPEAKER_01]: proprietary Windows software.
[SPEAKER_01]: Adapt or die, as it were.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's software, not cannabis
processing, formulation, or science.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what does open source actually mean to
us?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me tell you about Skunk Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once upon a time, I was just a guy in
the garage doing my black market thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to figure out how to extract
cannabis oil without killing myself,
[SPEAKER_01]: like all the people on the news.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of my friends had a really successful
edible company in Washington, Captain
[SPEAKER_01]: Cosmix, in the good old medical days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that was the good stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: These brownies, holy cow, you get 2,000
milligram brownie.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was like a, we were just
guessing, we weren't even testing
[SPEAKER_01]: everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was probably about 2,000 based on last
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were strong.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we needed to refine our extraction
method and he put me in charge of figuring
[SPEAKER_01]: out what does that mean, how do we do
that?
[SPEAKER_01]: So as anybody at the time could tell you,
you search anything extraction on the
[SPEAKER_01]: internet, you're gonna come across Skunk
Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I scoured Skunk Farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent, I got this weird thing,
that's where the data dump came from,
[SPEAKER_01]: where if I get onto a track, I'm just in a
wormhole for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I spent weeks refining my craft based
on Skunk Farm, used that to build that
[SPEAKER_01]: company into something great.
[SPEAKER_01]: Move ahead a couple years and I've bought
land out in the middle of the woods to be
[SPEAKER_01]: my bug out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm done with society.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've gone off the deep end on conspiracy
theories and I realized that there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: point thinking about them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm just gonna go and find my own
personal liberty.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna grow food and I'm just gonna be
done with it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six months later, this little bum fuck
town I moved to is where the first 15
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses in the legal market in Washington
come.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my partner and I looked at each other
and said, hey, here's a sign, we should
[SPEAKER_01]: get into this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I become the general manager of a shop
and I get positioned to set up the lab,
[SPEAKER_01]: of which I know nothing about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, this is a little while ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first thing I do is go to Skunk Farm
and find how to contact them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I give them a call and I said,
hey, do you guys do consultation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you come set up a lab?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, surely we cost a whole
bunch of money, but if you really need us
[SPEAKER_01]: to hold your hand, we'll come and do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right there is like one of my major
pivoting points, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like, oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you give away the information,
people are willing to pay you whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: because you're the guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they ended up poaching me out of that
position and I go start working for Grey
[SPEAKER_01]: Wolf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I wasn't big on ICMAG, so I wasn't
really sure who it was.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was Joe that poached me.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I end up working directly under the
old grumpy bastard for 18 months.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I learned more than you could ever
imagine.
[SPEAKER_01]: And one of the most important things I
learned from him is all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: information that he'd been sharing for
free, all of this how to build extractors,
[SPEAKER_01]: how to do all of these things safely and
effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had also started a business selling
those exact things he was giving out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that was another pivotal point for
me was, okay, how is it that this guy is
[SPEAKER_01]: giving out everything for free and is not
only getting paid to be this source of
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge, when people need their
handheld, but he's also started a business
[SPEAKER_01]: selling the things that he just told you
exactly how to make, piece by piece,
[SPEAKER_01]: where to buy the parts, everything,
because people will pay for the
[SPEAKER_01]: convenience.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's kind of a core model here where
you can give everything out for free and
[SPEAKER_01]: still make a lot of money because people
always pay for the convenience.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the open source Linux platform in
Microsoft, great example.
[SPEAKER_01]: They still put in the work and their
customers still pay them because the
[SPEAKER_01]: customer's not gonna go out and build
their own Linux-based web server that runs
[SPEAKER_01]: on Windows.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work for Skunk Farm under FarmGold.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have their own issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: I left that because of management
disagreements and the way that the Skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: Farmers were getting treated.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from that, I took those lessons and
that's when we got into pesticide
[SPEAKER_01]: remediation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started looking and listening really to
what are the problems.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as I was coming down to California for
work, I started seeing more and more
[SPEAKER_01]: people with stockpiles of distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I started asking around, why do you
guys have so much distillate?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they said, oh, because there's poison
in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we can't sell poison anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's full of myclobutanol.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, oh, wow, you got a million dollars
worth of myclobutanol distillate right
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet if I figured out a way to get that
out, you'd probably pay me a decent amount
[SPEAKER_01]: of money to turn unusable product into
usable product.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I partnered up with Nug Farms and
Photon and got a little bit of help from
[SPEAKER_01]: some other people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put that into trials and discovered
pesticide remediation through what is
[SPEAKER_01]: novel to cannabis, but what is really
elementary chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not a chemist, so I always walk
through, what is chromatography?
[SPEAKER_01]: How does that work?
[SPEAKER_01]: But what I retained through all of that
was the IP to the entire tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I went through this little moral
dilemma.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do I keep this tech to myself and sell it?
[SPEAKER_01]: If I do, how long till someone just
bootlegs it and gets rid of it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe I should just release it out because
really the goal, my goal always has been,
[SPEAKER_01]: how do we get people more high for
cheaper, safer, with better products?
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are kind of like core tenets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I released the pesticide
remediation, wrote up an SOP, some little
[SPEAKER_01]: half-assed scientific journal entry,
and let it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was really when the flood wave
came.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was my first interaction with the
open sourcing of information based on
[SPEAKER_01]: these lessons I had learned.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it worked to a T.
[SPEAKER_01]: My social media following exploded.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of a sudden, I was getting calls left
and right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even though I had given out all this
information completely for free,
[SPEAKER_01]: the people with the money, they didn't
care.
[SPEAKER_01]: They wanted their hands held.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were willing to pay whatever it was
that I would charge to come down and do it
[SPEAKER_01]: for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we took that model and applied it to
ethanol extraction, falling film
[SPEAKER_01]: evaporators.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this all culminated in the form that
Travis had mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: So future4200.com, has anybody in the room
never heard of future4200.com?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe?
[SPEAKER_01]: No?
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't want to say?
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe you, but all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The forum has become really the number one
place on earth for the open communication
[SPEAKER_01]: of ideas revolving around cannabis
processing, a platform for people to
[SPEAKER_01]: present refined ideas with their peers,
a symbol of how an open source of data can
[SPEAKER_01]: thrive and empower its contributors.
[SPEAKER_01]: Several industry-changing revolutions have
occurred there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first big one in my eyes is the OTSS
crystallization.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the early days of the forum,
I get hit up by a crowd of guys,
[SPEAKER_01]: and he had identified all these models
that I just told you, which as a
[SPEAKER_01]: permaculturist, I love, because it's all
about identifying successful natural
[SPEAKER_01]: patterns and repeating them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of the blue, this guy says,
hey, we're making these diamonds that all
[SPEAKER_01]: these big companies are making,
and I'll tell you exactly how to do it if
[SPEAKER_01]: you put it up on your forum and give me
the credit for being the guy that told you
[SPEAKER_01]: how to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he sends me like a 2,000-word run-on
sentence and says, here's the SOP.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, oh, my goodness.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we spent like a week or four finding
it, and we let this out, giving him full
[SPEAKER_01]: credit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're the first group I've ever told that
I proofread that run-on sentence.
[SPEAKER_01]: And man, did it work.
[SPEAKER_01]: The model repeated itself beautifully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the information for free.
[SPEAKER_01]: 90% of the people went, grabbed the
information, went home and made diamonds
[SPEAKER_01]: on their own.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that 10% that wanted to have their
hands held made Bob a rich man on his free
[SPEAKER_01]: information.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traps.
[SPEAKER_01]: The next really big one, and this one is
huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one is one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Color remediation cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, novel to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some really basic chemistry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chromatography using a different solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing crazy there.
[SPEAKER_01]: But nobody, I guess, people had been
applying it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody was talking about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was the big thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same with the diamonds.
[SPEAKER_01]: He didn't invent the diamond tech.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was just the first guy to tell you how
to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And same with this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a combination of Indofabs and
DreadPirate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we get a lot of input from Murphy
Murray.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're watching this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This time it's much bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Last time Bob was really the only one that
came out of that as a paid man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're seeing companies formed out of
open source technologies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Multiple people have formed very lucrative
consulting businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're teaching classes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because people are willing to pay for this
open source knowledge.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is bigger than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like a holistic thing that we're
facing right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of getting back into what
the hosts of this venue were talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: before I got up here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This open source model is a community
thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is forcing us to interact with each
other, which is really the true nature of
[SPEAKER_01]: being a human.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm a capitalist to the core.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I believe that we need ethical
capitalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe that we need permaculture based
capitalism.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your capitalism has to be based on taking
care of the earth and taking care of
[SPEAKER_01]: people first.
[SPEAKER_01]: And trust me, if you do that, you're going
to be more successful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So more importantly than the creativity
and innovation open source thinking can
[SPEAKER_01]: inspire is the defense against a closed
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we allow closed systems to rule the
world, we give away our freedom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Inevitably, closed systems control
information and data.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with data, you can control people.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the money you can derive from this
data, you can control the government.
[SPEAKER_01]: When one company controls both the people
and the government, we have serious
[SPEAKER_01]: issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Closed systems allow power to consolidate.
[SPEAKER_01]: Closed systems are why the majority of
existing cannabis patents are currently
[SPEAKER_01]: held by a few large companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: Companies that don't give a fuck about the
plant or you or any of the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: we've built over the last 70 years of
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_01]: Patents that were acquired during the
depths of that prohibition for the long
[SPEAKER_01]: play.
[SPEAKER_01]: Before any of us were even thinking about,
before a lot of us were born, but before
[SPEAKER_01]: any of us were even thinking that this was
going to be something legal that we might
[SPEAKER_01]: build businesses and put our whole entire
lives into, these companies were
[SPEAKER_01]: consolidating power.
[SPEAKER_01]: They acquired these patents knowing that
it would be nice to control that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't suggest to have the answer to
the serious problems that face a cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment manufacturer regarding open
source.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same way I couldn't have answered the
music industry's problem with Napster at
[SPEAKER_01]: the turn of the century.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do know that Chinese companies are going
to steal your ideas, replicate them,
[SPEAKER_01]: ship them back to the US for cheaper than
you can imagine, regardless of what model
[SPEAKER_01]: you take.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure, you can fight the Chinese,
maybe even leverage the government to shut
[SPEAKER_01]: down trade with them, not that any of the
other multi-billion dollar industries have
[SPEAKER_01]: had any luck with that approach,
but good luck.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just like shutting down Napster led to
Kazaa, Limewire, and much worse,
[SPEAKER_01]: Torrance, fighting the theft of
intellectual property in the 21st century
[SPEAKER_01]: feels like a short-sighted approach.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perhaps if we focus on the things that we
can control, things we can leverage
[SPEAKER_01]: through the same internet channels that
seem to be leading to our destruction,
[SPEAKER_01]: we can tap into what people really desire.
[SPEAKER_01]: Corporate trust, transparency,
and personal relationships with customers,
[SPEAKER_01]: things no foreign company can provide.
[SPEAKER_01]: By building community within, we can all
level up together.
[SPEAKER_01]: See, that's the real solution here.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only way to protect the plant and our
economic futures involving said plant is
[SPEAKER_01]: to work together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Open source is probably the wrong term for
this idea, but the point is that we need
[SPEAKER_01]: to open up to each other to build a better
future for cannabis professionals,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the cannabis plant, and for society as
a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, Dustin.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to take a couple quick
questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If anyone wants a show of hands,
anybody has a question for Dustin?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're getting a free question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Usually it costs you a truckload of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody?
[SPEAKER_00]: In the back there?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, and I never will.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't sell equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: He asked, are you selling CRC tech or the
equipment right now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll say the tech if you need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't need your handheld, but no,
the equipment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's multiple manufacturers in the
industry right now that are selling the
[SPEAKER_01]: Enviolar, Indofabs, Bizzy will probably
jangle you something together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really any of the stainless manufacturers
can put you together a cartridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think open source steel is still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also think Glacier Tanks is probably
still around.
[SPEAKER_01]: Killa on the forum will put you together
one really cheap if you want China parts.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, you're going to probably be
getting China parts for wherever you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not me.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's lots of people.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you need me to repeat any of that,
feel free to hit me up.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know how to find me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anybody else?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks again, Dustin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
