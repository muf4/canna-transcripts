[SPEAKER_00]: We're just gonna kick it off with some
breeding talk and genetics and then in
[SPEAKER_00]: about 45 minutes we'll shift gears and get
legal and talk plant patents and IP and
[SPEAKER_00]: fun stuff so Trevor The stage is yours
right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, Peter So yeah, I'm sitting here
with two incredibly Well-versed
[SPEAKER_03]: individuals who have been engaged in this
Industry and you know before it was an
[SPEAKER_03]: industry really have their roots going
back to when it was a community Got Josh D
[SPEAKER_03]: on my left Hello everybody For those who
don't know Josh D is one of the people who
[SPEAKER_03]: brought us all the og and we're all
greatly appreciative out here on the west
[SPEAKER_01]: coast Well, thanks for everyone out there
to keep growing or as much as she needs it
[SPEAKER_03]: cuz LA needs og Indeed and on my right
I've got Mojave Richmond and Mojave he's
[SPEAKER_03]: got Incredible experience as well Breeder
of the sage long time experience both here
[SPEAKER_03]: in the states and also internationally
which gives him a unique perspective on
[SPEAKER_03]: everything that's going down so Right on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pleasure to be here everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you So, yeah I was hoping that we
could just get into a discussion about the
[SPEAKER_03]: current state of Cannabis genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's talk about where we've been Where
we're at right now What is the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: genome as it currently the state of the
cannabis genome right now?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to kick that off I think it would
probably be good for Mojave to go first
[SPEAKER_03]: just because Mojave Mojave for anybody who
doesn't know works with Rob Clark.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got lots of experience in terms of
talking with one of the foremost experts
[SPEAKER_03]: and learning and understanding this plant
from somebody who really Knows the deep
[SPEAKER_03]: history of the plant and so yeah,
you want to start us off sure right on
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I guess to really address where the
cannabis genome is today We got to talk
[SPEAKER_02]: about where it was in the past and where
it came from Cannabis is you know quite
[SPEAKER_02]: possibly the most the most significant
Human plant relationship is that between
[SPEAKER_02]: humans and cannabis it dates back,
you know over 6,000 years and Pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: evolved from Central Asia found its way
down into India and Afghanistan and
[SPEAKER_02]: Thailand and from those regions spread
throughout the world and initially it was
[SPEAKER_02]: a land-race based genetics, which means
population of seeds that come from a
[SPEAKER_02]: specific region that are bred for a
particular use by those people in that
[SPEAKER_02]: region over time and land-race genetics
had to be Incredibly dynamic so it had to
[SPEAKER_02]: be a diverse genome with the dynamic
enough dynamism that it could respond to
[SPEAKER_02]: the ever-changing environmental stresses
So those land-race genetics that evolved
[SPEAKER_02]: over hundreds possibly thousands of years
eventually spread around the world and
[SPEAKER_02]: They went to Mexico and Africa and South
America and Thailand and everywhere,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they were predominantly narrow leaf
varieties that had a fairly specific
[SPEAKER_02]: targeted genome because they were selected
as since Amia single plants, so
[SPEAKER_02]: essentially a farmer would grow a plant
and Select the best seeds from those
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and that was the way people
selected cannabis for thousands of years
[SPEAKER_02]: and Eventually those seeds got spread out
and then after prohibition when the US,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know Imparted its grand wisdom on the
world and decided that people shouldn't
[SPEAKER_02]: smoke cannabis or consume cannabis or use
it for a fiber or for food Those
[SPEAKER_02]: populations became ever more secluded and
Harder to get to and eventually they all
[SPEAKER_02]: found their way more or less to California
because California For better or worse is
[SPEAKER_02]: an exceptional place and the people here
fell in love with cannabis in an
[SPEAKER_02]: exceptional way and Those land-race based
genetics those narrow leaf varieties.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a very specific genetic makeup
and We could talk about that a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: more as we go along but they pretty much
made up what cannabis was up until the 80s
[SPEAKER_02]: when Prohibition had driven cannabis into
the small grows and small underground
[SPEAKER_02]: gorilla grows out in the in the hills of
California and the hills of Oregon and
[SPEAKER_02]: people needed smaller more compact Easier
to sell cannabis that could be could
[SPEAKER_02]: evades law enforcement, you know and to be
grown indoors So at that point was a
[SPEAKER_02]: critical juncture in the cannabis genome
in that these land-race based genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: that were from all over the world and were
predominantly narrow leaf got married with
[SPEAKER_02]: This one very specific population of
genetics, which was Afghani based genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: and those Afghani based genetics that more
or less joined the rest of the world in
[SPEAKER_02]: the 80s kind of came to shape what the
genome the cannabis genome is today
[SPEAKER_02]: because we all had to grow indoors and In
order to grow indoors, you need a small
[SPEAKER_02]: plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need a plant that finishes relatively
early and you need You know something that
[SPEAKER_02]: you can pull off indoors And you can't do
that with narrow leaf varieties narrow
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf varieties are big giant Christmas
trees that take a long time and yield very
[SPEAKER_02]: low So something very specific happened to
this cannabis genome in the past 23 years
[SPEAKER_02]: and it was probably not predominantly
driven by law enforcement and then it was
[SPEAKER_02]: championed by us by us cannabis breeders
and enthusiasts and then specifically
[SPEAKER_02]: championed and distributed around the
world from the Dutch seed banks and when
[SPEAKER_02]: the Dutch seed banks in the 90s got a hold
of the these new Afghani narrow leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: hybrids They were distributed everywhere
and everyone had the same issue They
[SPEAKER_02]: needed something that grew fast and they
needed something that was short and they
[SPEAKER_02]: needed something that was potent Needed
something that they could sell for top
[SPEAKER_02]: dollar because it was really dangerous and
risky to grow cannabis So that is really
[SPEAKER_02]: driven us to where we are now and we're at
this kind of crossroads now We're in post
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition and we're now looking at what
is this new cannabis genome that we have
[SPEAKER_02]: now and people are thinking about well,
what's the future of Cannabis going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: and what are these selections going to be
that that drive the market as the years go
[SPEAKER_02]: by and so we're at a kind of a Interesting
crossroads where we no longer have the
[SPEAKER_02]: selective forces that were imposed on us
by prohibition But we now have a very
[SPEAKER_02]: broad palette to work with but at the same
time Cannabis genome is nowhere near as
[SPEAKER_02]: diverse As it once was because all those
land-race based varieties Even though we
[SPEAKER_02]: got we got some great unicorns from them
and we bred with them the populations are
[SPEAKER_02]: gone and when the population is gone and
the people that Bred those populations.
[SPEAKER_02]: You no longer have the diversity in the
gene pool So now we have amazing plants
[SPEAKER_02]: that came from those populations But we
don't have the genetic diversity to move
[SPEAKER_02]: the needle left and right in the way that
we once have Even though we're way further
[SPEAKER_02]: ahead than ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're still compromised by that So now the
challenge is us as breeders is to figure
[SPEAKER_02]: out what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Society demands from cannabis and what the
industry demands from cannabis and how to
[SPEAKER_02]: achieve that with a somewhat limited gene
pool Yeah, I think that brings up a really
[SPEAKER_03]: good point in terms of how There are
cultural implications and cultural
[SPEAKER_03]: pressures and selective pressures that go
on in terms of what we as a community of
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers and cultivators Select for and
what we're trying to do and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: culturally dependent you look at the South
Asian cultures where it was predominantly
[SPEAKER_03]: selecting for flowers you look at the
hashish cultures of Central Asia and then
[SPEAKER_03]: the hemp cultures that have also
proliferated around the world and every
[SPEAKER_03]: single culture throughout time has gotten
a hold of this plant and figured out how
[SPEAKER_03]: to adapt it to their own region and to
their own purposes and we need to
[SPEAKER_03]: recognize that and Most baffling thing
it's been both a double-edged sword You
[SPEAKER_03]: know, there's positives and negatives
about it one here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are now and cannabis has sort of
survived the great Bottlenecking that we
[SPEAKER_03]: have Seen in every other agricultural crop
because of prohibition but we've also seen
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of forces where we had to operate
and make selections and Work with
[SPEAKER_03]: populations that were tiny and that brings
up something that I think Josh D knows a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot about and that's the proliferation of
these elite cultivars the OG's the chems
[SPEAKER_03]: and Some of the things that predate those
the hazes the northern lights and the
[SPEAKER_03]: skunks these elite cultivars that really
have formed the basis of our genetics and
[SPEAKER_03]: from I would say the 80s to the present
are what we know of as The cannabis genome
[SPEAKER_03]: and what we're all trying to strive for
and do and reproduce We're all chasing out
[SPEAKER_03]: after that next OG that next skunk that
next new new and you're somebody who's
[SPEAKER_03]: brought something into the community kept
it going and Helped us keep these heirloom
[SPEAKER_03]: varieties Of elite genetics and can you
speak to that and how we keep those going?
[SPEAKER_01]: I?
[SPEAKER_01]: Mean I think after all this time there was
at a certain point after like four years
[SPEAKER_01]: and I was like wow this OG kush thing like
Everybody loves it, you know, and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing really special that we did You
know, it was just the indoor scene was
[SPEAKER_01]: coming ahead and I remember Back when I
was young if you had indoor that meant it
[SPEAKER_01]: would smell like hay and nobody wanted it
You know that was it's like oh you got
[SPEAKER_01]: that crap indoor and it was like oh do you
have that Mendo or Humboldt or like some
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, somebody was growing it that had
some skills and Even with the
[SPEAKER_01]: transportation of smuggling down here,
you know, it still was the very best when
[SPEAKER_01]: I was Probably coming, you know a huge
cannabis enthusiast in my you know as a
[SPEAKER_01]: teenager, you know and it was interesting
because you know all of a sudden this
[SPEAKER_01]: indoor thing happened and og kush comes on
the scene and You know, I'm I'm basically
[SPEAKER_01]: lucky enough that it crosses my path right
so everybody knows I didn't create this
[SPEAKER_01]: and Now that we discovered recently this
year that the guy that did create it did
[SPEAKER_01]: it by accident You know, this wasn't
something that he had, you know done some
[SPEAKER_01]: sort of like real work on And I think
that's interesting how those things come
[SPEAKER_01]: about So here we are and I just felt like
I Started growing og in 96 But in 91 is it
[SPEAKER_01]: Sherry yeah 91 I think is when we found
out that this accidental pollination
[SPEAKER_01]: Moment happened in TK and og were created
That happened in 96 Yeah, and so I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge fan of this one cultivar so It
was easy to just focus and stop growing
[SPEAKER_01]: everything else It was Really kind of a
spindly plant that doesn't didn't produce
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot with the techniques we had at the
time But it was so good that we were like,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, we're gonna figure this out It doesn't
matter, you know if it gets half of what
[SPEAKER_01]: we're getting with nl or whatever else we
were growing That was a good move,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, and there are a lot of people at
some point At some point that actually
[SPEAKER_01]: left my hands and thank God I gave it to
my guy Ian up in the Bay Area and Ian is
[SPEAKER_01]: really kind of like the guy godfather of
of good weed in the San Fernando Valley
[SPEAKER_01]: and For a lot of reasons and nobody knows
who he is.
[SPEAKER_01]: He doesn't get any credit He's very
humble.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if it wasn't for him, thank God he was
holding on to Some cuts of that and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: easy.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was like, hey, and I'm coming up and
grab some cuts, you know But these are
[SPEAKER_01]: strange things because now I see you know
in hindsight.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had no idea that this would become Much
bigger than you know, it was like a change
[SPEAKER_01]: the game This is because it became the
genetic backbone almost of it all the
[SPEAKER_01]: flavors.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love today You know in og as it's
found.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a cornerstone, you know variety
that will always probably remain like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, but Now I see it's the diversity in
cannabis I was always attached to the og
[SPEAKER_01]: when people want to punch like a little
kick to my favorite flavor and you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's interesting and fascinating when
Mojave says about not having that much of
[SPEAKER_01]: a of a gene pool to choose from to take it
to the next Level it seems like we really
[SPEAKER_01]: all just jumped in in the last Decade or
15 years and just mixing everything up and
[SPEAKER_01]: now it's hard to pull back Unless you have
original stock, you know, which is hard
[SPEAKER_01]: now because you have had to have it stored
properly Number one that person still has
[SPEAKER_01]: to be alive and out of prison,
you know But it's cool to think because
[SPEAKER_01]: guys like Mojave and Rob Clark I know that
they have a good stash like we put we all
[SPEAKER_01]: know that
[SPEAKER_02]: Long ago we we I I can't speak for Rob,
but a long ago I was born in Big Sur,
[SPEAKER_02]: California 1969 and My family had already
been in the cannabis industry for a few
[SPEAKER_02]: years and the The the land that we lived
on a place called Plaskett Ridge in Big
[SPEAKER_02]: Sur It was in 1965 a few years before I
was born that my my mother and father
[SPEAKER_02]: invited a friend of theirs to come and
stay with us and He ended up we ended up
[SPEAKER_02]: moving and he stayed there and he became a
grower and his name is Patrick Cassidy and
[SPEAKER_02]: Patrick Cassidy coined the Big Sur holy
weed and Patrick Cassidy started the first
[SPEAKER_02]: Harvest parties ever in the new world.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were called the California Harvest
Party and every year a Shitload of hippies
[SPEAKER_02]: you can go online.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can find a little bit information
about this But like a sea of VW buses
[SPEAKER_02]: would descend upon Big Sur and we'd have
these big harvest parties I can vaguely
[SPEAKER_02]: remember them up until around eight years
old is when I think they ended and It was
[SPEAKER_02]: a big pagan cannabis Festival at the end
of every at the end of the night They take
[SPEAKER_02]: the biggest and best plant and burn it on
the bonfire where all the naked people ran
[SPEAKER_02]: around and It was it was a real cannabis
community and that's what Big Sur and and
[SPEAKER_02]: Mendocino and Oregon and a lot of these
places on the west coast were doing
[SPEAKER_02]: heavily in the 70s and but right around
the end of the 70s in the early 80s when
[SPEAKER_02]: the Afghani genetics Came in and started
mixing there was something that happened
[SPEAKER_02]: something something That you could put
your finger on which was that everything
[SPEAKER_02]: changed So at that moment the community
reacted the community said hey what
[SPEAKER_02]: happened To our cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean it was I mean I can literally
remember people saying how come we don't
[SPEAKER_02]: have the weed from last year, you know,
and that was like 1982 1983 and at that
[SPEAKER_02]: moment every the genome kind of merged
between these two big populations of these
[SPEAKER_02]: narrow leaf and these broadleaf plants and
we came up with all the hybrids of today,
[SPEAKER_02]: so When I moved to Amsterdam in 1993 and
was fortunate enough to have some
[SPEAKER_02]: old-school, California genetics to work
through I Was very fortunate to find
[SPEAKER_02]: something that was indicative of those old
Flavor profiles and those old effects that
[SPEAKER_02]: came with the old-school land-race based
stuff So at that moment I decided that I
[SPEAKER_02]: would spend my life working that line And
I've bred that specific line over and over
[SPEAKER_02]: again and never tried to deviate too much
except After meeting this gentleman over
[SPEAKER_02]: 20 years ago And being introduced to og
cush which is the world's most impactful
[SPEAKER_02]: plant and Josh said something really
interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: He said It wasn't a big breeding
experiment that produced og cush We're
[SPEAKER_02]: talking about breeding right and everyone
wants to think about breeding as being
[SPEAKER_02]: this new big industrial commercial thing
But it was a couple beans from an
[SPEAKER_02]: accidental cross That pulled out the most
impactful plant that we've ever known so
[SPEAKER_02]: It's luck when when and it's luck in a
vision, you know when people know good
[SPEAKER_02]: weed and they can pull good beans out of
good weed they come up with amazing things
[SPEAKER_02]: and That was just a moment in time and it
happened and that's why we have og cush
[SPEAKER_02]: and I just just want to applaud that that
it was could have could have not happened
[SPEAKER_02]: easily Could have easily not happened
Anyway, so I crossed my stuff with og that
[SPEAKER_02]: was the one thing that I crossed it with
and actually came Out bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It did because it added exactly what it
needed was punch.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was the truth Yeah, and that's
something that we also as We move into
[SPEAKER_03]: more of a corporate cannabis and when
margins and bottom lines make the decision
[SPEAKER_03]: on everything is The next og going to be
selected and kept.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Don't know, you know if it doesn't yield
and doesn't wonk for the people who are
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to pull weight The og will get
pushed to the side.
[SPEAKER_03]: But instead because people saw value in
something In Florida of all places,
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean Florida in the early 90s y'all I
thought the same thing that was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah When man burger was like man,
we got this stuff in Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like bro.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the best shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: You ever smile.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm like, there's no fuck We're like in
California man.
[SPEAKER_01]: We know Matt's from Florida.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like we're in California now man,
like come on You know, I got mad respect
[SPEAKER_03]: for everybody who I grew up in this shit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I grew up in I Was in commune off the
grid totally backwoods everybody I knew
[SPEAKER_03]: grew weed I was literally growing weed as
a home school It's like student as a 16
[SPEAKER_03]: year old and I was handed Marijuana botany
and told here you go kid figure it out Now
[SPEAKER_03]: that right there was some shit where it
was easy And we we went through so many
[SPEAKER_03]: plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: We never saved any cuts We were all seed
based and we saw gene flow going all over
[SPEAKER_03]: the place But cats back East we're doing
some crazy shit under some serious
[SPEAKER_03]: Prohibition and risk and they were holding
on to some stuff and we all have to be
[SPEAKER_03]: very thankful of all the cats back East
the you know the sours the chems the og's
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it all comes back at all
genetics come back to California
[SPEAKER_03]: thankfully, but We're we're very lucky and
blessed for the fact that people made
[SPEAKER_03]: selections not based off of what was the
most heavy yielding what was the most
[SPEAKER_03]: vigorous plant but instead what was the
most unique and most desirable plant and
[SPEAKER_03]: that they then went around and shared this
and saved it and held it and you know
[SPEAKER_03]: people held things closely in their
circles and If we didn't have that
[SPEAKER_03]: cultural dynamic and didn't have our own
culture operating, you know with the
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibition bullshit on the top of it like
We wouldn't be where we are now and so
[SPEAKER_03]: thank you to all of you have saved
collected and persevered through this
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition bullshit Yeah, it was um
living in Amsterdam in the 90s was an
[SPEAKER_02]: interesting experience in that My my my
best friend from childhood owned a seed
[SPEAKER_02]: company Adam Dunn I've known him all my
life and my girlfriend at the time was the
[SPEAKER_02]: Girl who sold seeds at the sensei seed
bank.
[SPEAKER_02]: She was the one who took your ticket at
the hash museum And she's the one who sold
[SPEAKER_02]: you seeds So I fell into this community
where where everyone from around the world
[SPEAKER_02]: would come to open up so all these insular
communities in Florida and Arkansas and
[SPEAKER_02]: Indiana and and California they all
everyone was hush hush and in that hush
[SPEAKER_02]: hush thing kept those Gene pools alive as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that's why we had those Plants and
that's why we had the diversity back then
[SPEAKER_02]: is because when everyone found a plant
that they loved they didn't share it
[SPEAKER_02]: Another group had to find the plant that
they loved another group had to find the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant that they loved It wasn't just hey,
let's all share the same plants So in
[SPEAKER_02]: Amsterdam everyone would show up and share
their stories and share their genetics and
[SPEAKER_02]: it was like this kind of open community
and That's why you know and then the Dutch
[SPEAKER_02]: seed companies they absorbed those
genetics and then in turn Brought them to
[SPEAKER_02]: the world but it was this fact that for a
one there was one place where these little
[SPEAKER_02]: insular communities could come and share
that they were their their common
[SPEAKER_02]: experience and That was a that was a time
that was a unique time and that's when you
[SPEAKER_02]: know if you look back You know those of us
who've been doing this for a while if you
[SPEAKER_02]: think back about the cannabis genome in
the late 90s in the early 2000s there was
[SPEAKER_02]: a lot of amazing plants around a lot Of
them and they were all different All of
[SPEAKER_02]: them and some of them came from little
groups that had no relations to anything
[SPEAKER_02]: else like hey I've been over here in
Indiana doing our bubble gum and I've been
[SPEAKER_02]: over here in Florida doing our TK and
stuff like that and And it was that
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition Dynamic that allowed for that
to happen and we don't have that anymore
[SPEAKER_02]: You know now we have you know,
we can all just buy clones at at a shop So
[SPEAKER_02]: it's once again, we're at a really
interesting crossroads When we're talking
[SPEAKER_02]: about the the genome about breeding about
what people want from the plant and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: we almost have as breeders a a
responsibility to explore that and then to
[SPEAKER_02]: provide that provide the outcome that
facilitates what people want and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: Challenging because we also have to pay
the bills so
[SPEAKER_02]: The driving force now is bag appeal
Initially was what what puts what sells
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis out of dispensary?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah Yes, yes, we'll take questions at the
end I think is what we'll do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you very much But no it is and now
well, it's interesting that you know bag
[SPEAKER_02]: appeal and smell and flavor and
Presentation of the flower was what drove
[SPEAKER_02]: the market for a number of years,
but now It's brands because now we have
[SPEAKER_02]: packaged cannabis So we can't look at it
smell it and engage it in the same way,
[SPEAKER_02]: but the plants that sold themselves for
years Became the brands So now people are
[SPEAKER_02]: have those memories of where what what
that plant was so now they don't have to
[SPEAKER_02]: think well What's going to be in this jar?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know do the price to enter the
cannabis space right now is you know
[SPEAKER_01]: obnoxious?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know so it's like if you were at an
era of time where everybody was in a band
[SPEAKER_01]: We're all playing music and the music was
rich and everybody got a chance to come up
[SPEAKER_01]: on stage and play and Then it's shifted to
well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can only play if you pay You know and
you can only play for all these other
[SPEAKER_01]: stipulations and all the best hungriest
most talented Musicians usually can't
[SPEAKER_01]: function that well under such structure
and this is like this is mega structure
[SPEAKER_01]: right now This is like uber structured
very opposite of what we're all about so
[SPEAKER_01]: it feels like these two worlds are meeting
and you know so the result is The cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: genome and diversity will be limited to
the only the people that could enter the
[SPEAKER_01]: space So when you go to a shop all you get
is whatever was the highest seller in BDS
[SPEAKER_01]: analytics And you know you have everybody
knows that bullshit is so you know I can
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you the five top strains and you know
varieties, and you'll be like well I hope
[SPEAKER_01]: then in a year from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's more Than that available But
people do follow that way right so to
[SPEAKER_01]: enter the space expensive most of those
guys coming into this Space they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand how it works or the culture You
know they and so it becomes a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: more difficult to navigate through so they
jump back to hey We'll just follow
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever is popular And then there's too
much of that going on and creates a flat
[SPEAKER_01]: market, and I've seen it in other states
I've been involved with and it takes time
[SPEAKER_01]: to mature and you hope that guys stick
into it and find a way to Get through you
[SPEAKER_01]: know the three-year moment, and then you
can start getting back to your craft again
[SPEAKER_01]: and Start focusing on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know new varieties and such Yeah,
no, that's one thing We're in a major
[SPEAKER_03]: culture clash right now the culture that
we come from and the cultural dynamics
[SPEAKER_03]: that we've historically had are totally
but up against some highly capitalized
[SPEAKER_03]: people who don't have a lot of respect for
the culture and so Right now the main
[SPEAKER_03]: thing that we're all trying to figure out
is how do we who have historically been
[SPEAKER_03]: involved in this and in whatever capacity
we need to figure out how to link up
[SPEAKER_03]: together and build cultural resilience so
that the Josh D's of the world the Mojave
[SPEAKER_03]: is and the you know the Trevor Wittke's
the kids who are just Totally backwards
[SPEAKER_03]: and off the grid how do we all figure out
how to get through this?
[SPEAKER_03]: because we've got a lot of cultural
knowledge and expertise that could get
[SPEAKER_03]: lost and If it's all just about margins,
and there's no Culture there then what's
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna happen like we've seen Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've seen that we've also heard everybody
saying oh Craft is the way craft will save
[SPEAKER_03]: us But is craft just saying craft and just
being like oh I produce quality is that
[SPEAKER_03]: sufficient or do we have to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: More in terms of figuring out how to
Develop strategies for moving forward in
[SPEAKER_02]: this you know new capitalized world we're
in Well you you mentioned craft which I
[SPEAKER_02]: think is a really interesting analogy to
make is a lot of a couple years ago There
[SPEAKER_02]: were some groups.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not mention names, but there are
some groups that are going around,
[SPEAKER_02]: California saying hey everyone's gonna get
to stay in the cannabis business and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's 50,000 people who grow and provide
cannabis and there's 50,000 people who
[SPEAKER_02]: work in the craft beer and and Boutique
wine industry and there's room for
[SPEAKER_02]: everyone you know and that was this false
sense of security that every that was
[SPEAKER_02]: spread around and in order for us to move
this industry forward and I understand why
[SPEAKER_02]: those groups did that because they wanted
to legalize cannabis and God bless them
[SPEAKER_02]: for it, but the reality is is there's not
room for everybody and craft beer if you
[SPEAKER_02]: want to draw a comparison is kind of
interesting because After prohibition
[SPEAKER_02]: prohibition wiped out all craft alcohol
completely just decimated it especially
[SPEAKER_02]: distilleries and small brewers and It took
a long time for craft to reemerge and the
[SPEAKER_02]: reality is that it reemerged from one
brewery There was one brewery in San
[SPEAKER_02]: Francisco called the anchor steam brewery,
and they were the last man standing They
[SPEAKER_02]: were the last craft beer company that
survived prohibition People think craft
[SPEAKER_02]: beer is a new thing craft beer was how
beer was made forever and then came
[SPEAKER_02]: conglomerate alcohol and Then it took a
long time of a lot of shitty beer For
[SPEAKER_02]: people to say gee wouldn't it be nice if I
could have something that was decent and
[SPEAKER_02]: so anchor steam was the one survivor and
there was one rich benefactor the Maytag
[SPEAKER_02]: blue cheese air who reinvigorated Anchor
steam and then when anchor steam got
[SPEAKER_02]: momentum Sierra Nevada jumped in and then
came Laganitas and yada yada and then you
[SPEAKER_02]: hear we are today We're all drinking craft
beer.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great But it took 60 years or so or
40 years of shitty beer Okay, so That's
[SPEAKER_02]: what we're facing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're facing a lot of years of shitty weed
To get back to craft, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and if you look in California specifically
where we had a really robust craft
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis industry They were called grow
rooms and small, you know illegal gross
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all gone and now we have
commercial cannabis and there's very few
[SPEAKER_02]: people who can produce that much Like Josh
does on a commercial scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very rare and especially when you're
exporting that same concept around the
[SPEAKER_02]: world It's kids even rare people in
Macedonia are not gonna learn how to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: craft cannabis They're gonna grow learn
how to grow commercial cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Let's just be cognizant of the way big
industry takes over and how long it takes
[SPEAKER_03]: to get back in the door No, and for us in
California, particularly Northern
[SPEAKER_03]: California that means Calaveras County we
had wineries that operated all the way
[SPEAKER_03]: through prohibition But once legalization
of alcohol happened the repeal of
[SPEAKER_03]: prohibition rather it was impossible for
all those wineries to continue operating
[SPEAKER_03]: because the cost of licensing we're all
experiencing that exact same dynamic now
[SPEAKER_03]: and So for small communities that rely on
this we Absolutely have to be cognizant of
[SPEAKER_03]: what the implications are and if we want
to spend the next 40 years Fighting the
[SPEAKER_03]: good fight to you know have local craft
industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of that's one possibility or
Another possibility is getting together
[SPEAKER_03]: making local changes politically staying
organized and Actually making sure that we
[SPEAKER_03]: can shape this industry and we also
there's a policy Political strategy that
[SPEAKER_03]: has to be implemented, but there's also
commercial strategies.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to link up together and figure out
how to build brands build things like Josh
[SPEAKER_03]: D is built like Mojave is built and so
When we come together at these events,
[SPEAKER_03]: we need to network We need to meet each
other and really look at strategies This
[SPEAKER_03]: is not just about getting together and
talking or having people on panels,
[SPEAKER_03]: but it's about developing strategies For
cultural resilience and moving this
[SPEAKER_03]: community forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah Absolutely and and let me jump in
there real quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think The the thing is there's a
lot of fantastic growers that I know in
[SPEAKER_01]: this state or in the West Coast I mean or
at least in the areas I've had you know
[SPEAKER_01]: time spending in and I was first of all,
I love the diversity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think like during the medical days When
you could walk in and there was you know a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more to choose from it was much more
hands-on It was like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it felt like inclusive, you know in those
days of having Just having an opportunity
[SPEAKER_01]: to see all that diversity up in Washington
and then During the medical days and when
[SPEAKER_01]: I went when it went wreck and they had
promised the whole entire medical
[SPEAKER_01]: community in the state It was part of the
reason it got voted in Was because they
[SPEAKER_01]: were not gonna touch medical, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So Luckily, I moved up there about five
years ago and got to experience what LA
[SPEAKER_01]: was like probably 12 years You know
probably 16 years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really cool, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So then rec comes in and they bring a
couple lobbyists in and they squash it and
[SPEAKER_01]: complete dismantle medical and it became
so Disconnected from the community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely, but you were saying something
earlier as well That first of all,
[SPEAKER_01]: it doesn't have to be like that like and
I'm here to make sure like I'm gonna do my
[SPEAKER_01]: best So the day I die to make sure that we
put out like the best weed We can we hope
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's happy and wants that,
you know, like to continue to support us,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know We've had some bumps in the road,
but you know like any new industry this
[SPEAKER_01]: happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're a startup the direction starts
changing though when The investors want
[SPEAKER_01]: the money faster than it's like humanly
possible regulations are you know on You
[SPEAKER_01]: and then it's like how come you don't grow
gorilla glue, you know that kind of thing
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's like I swear to God we don't want
any more gorilla glue, you know and You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, even if it's not og we diversify and
we change and if the public says,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know They want something different.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice to go after it But to not be
able to and then you get the handcuffs on
[SPEAKER_01]: you and then people start looking at us as
a company Like how come you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're not providing anything special
anymore, you know, you have to provide
[SPEAKER_01]: something special This is like a specialty
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a commodities market And you
know, there's it's not just the people in
[SPEAKER_01]: this room I mean California really like
respects and enjoys fine cannabis fine
[SPEAKER_01]: wine fine music all the best shit,
you know I mean we're lucky to be out here
[SPEAKER_01]: in the West Coast and it reflects the rest
of the world the whole industry I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the whole world looks at the
California industry in the market and we
[SPEAKER_01]: dictate the trends here we do a lot of the
times and if like we fold in and don't
[SPEAKER_01]: fight for genetic diversity and something
special Then it really will go away like
[SPEAKER_01]: and it and I've seen that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you ever been in Colorado?
[SPEAKER_01]: It happens there a lot as well Like I
watched that where the grows got so large
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we go try to find good weeded
shops And it's really hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really far and few between and but I
think out here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not at that point We're really at a
great point for this discussion to happen
[SPEAKER_01]: so we can go ahead and produce fine
product and brand yourself and with your
[SPEAKER_01]: merchandise and your marketing to really
staying genuine to what you're About and
[SPEAKER_01]: have a distribution network where you
know, you can get your product out there
[SPEAKER_01]: Which is what you need to be successful as
well So all these different components
[SPEAKER_01]: that I think people don't recognize what
they are and sometimes I think they sound
[SPEAKER_01]: a little bit more Like difficult to
achieve than they really need to be like a
[SPEAKER_01]: couple of us guys with a little bit of
money like I know for sure we can come up
[SPEAKER_01]: with a Distribution plan that makes a lot
of sense and speaks to like all the
[SPEAKER_01]: different shops in California,
right and the bottleneck right now There
[SPEAKER_01]: isn't a lot of shops in California There's
a lot of cultivation and it's about
[SPEAKER_01]: probably in 12 months from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna be so saturated with people
coming online that they're gonna drop
[SPEAKER_01]: their price and This is like that whole
race to the bottom thing that you hear
[SPEAKER_01]: about people talk about all the time It's
like I can't sell my product next thing,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know It's a dollar a gram and people
are flipping for 450 a pound and that
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes really difficult to have a
business like that but it doesn't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: be like that and The problem is is when
the weed goes down to 450 and people are
[SPEAKER_01]: selling Ounces for 60 bucks or 80 bucks at
a shop the black market kind of goes away
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where you lose like a lot more
diversity You know, so it's just there's
[SPEAKER_01]: this like cycle that's gonna happen But I
think really there's enough like talented
[SPEAKER_01]: fun people here that really believe in
this they put their but they're like I
[SPEAKER_01]: guess efforts together and their resources
You know easy distribution chain
[SPEAKER_01]: merchandising marketing fucking bomb
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can it can work, you know Yeah on that
level we've got people OG's in Every
[SPEAKER_03]: single point in the supply chain and we
just need to link up together We have
[SPEAKER_03]: people who are have distributing licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have people with dispensary licenses We
have people who have nursery and
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation licenses and the key is to
figure out how we Normalize the supply
[SPEAKER_03]: chain and actually not just normalize.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do we optimize that?
[SPEAKER_03]: the supply chain so that all of the people
who have been historically operating are
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of operating on a premise of like oh
You've been historically operating you've
[SPEAKER_03]: been producing fire and you come from the
culture So I'm gonna work with you and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: not gonna work with these fucking chads
That seems like a fucking pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: reasonable Like can't we all get down on
that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you're a distributor and you're
like buying from the dude who wears like
[SPEAKER_03]: shorts to hear that are pastel colors stop
Just don't
[SPEAKER_02]: Know it's true is That is very good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to admit though.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm still not quite sure what a Chad is.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know What is it Chad?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a hanging Chad.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it Yeah, no, it's true and I have a
corny thing that I like to say sometimes
[SPEAKER_02]: which is you know us OG's our roots run
real deep and Like trees in the wind we
[SPEAKER_02]: have to stand together if we don't want to
get Blown over because they will blow us
[SPEAKER_02]: all over You know that the problem is is
that we're all a bunch of different
[SPEAKER_02]: species of trees We've got a redwoods and
eucalyptus and cypress and shit like that
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're all trying to figure out how to
work together and it's hard it takes it
[SPEAKER_02]: takes you know what it is is it requires
the guy from the outside who understands
[SPEAKER_02]: how to connect us all and it hasn't
happened as fluidly as the pre-existing
[SPEAKER_02]: guys would have liked but That's because
there wasn't enough business-savvy cats
[SPEAKER_02]: involved in the business, you know,
you know Unfortunately, unfortunately or
[SPEAKER_02]: accountants and lawyers and all that shit
that we trusted and could work with,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know Yeah, we've got way too much
stove piping so to speak like we're all in
[SPEAKER_03]: our own little niches and our own little
worlds and it's like we got to move away
[SPEAKER_03]: from the like closed circle and I mean
closed circles are good.
[SPEAKER_03]: We got to keep our our trust in our
community and stuff together, but we also
[SPEAKER_03]: have to have a networked community where
part of it is recognizing people who have
[SPEAKER_03]: been doing this historically and who are
really trying to make the transition both
[SPEAKER_03]: commercially and otherwise because a lot
of this is also about individuals who are
[SPEAKER_03]: out there cultivating and we need to I
want to see a like autobahn Society for
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, but instead of being like
birdwatchers we got people growing their
[SPEAKER_03]: six plants and maintaining that diversity
because people who pursue their passion
[SPEAKER_03]: and plenty of other plants species have
this where like you look at pumpkins or
[SPEAKER_03]: other things people who are backyard
breeders are really doing real work and
[SPEAKER_03]: preserving the plant and if we build
institutions to support that then it will
[SPEAKER_03]: just build more of a culture in a new
context for us to develop these sorts of
[SPEAKER_02]: dynamics Yeah, like apples for instance
are a good example.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was at one point I think there are
7,000 apple cultivars in the world and
[SPEAKER_02]: apples were generally since apples are are
not stable they're they're heterozygous
[SPEAKER_02]: crop so you can't just plant an apple seed
and get a similar plant as you from the
[SPEAKER_02]: parent.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were cloned.
[SPEAKER_02]: So an apple tree was a family thing a
family apple tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So apples were generally named after
people's last names.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in the US after the Johnny Appleseed
era we had thousands of thousands of Apple
[SPEAKER_02]: varieties available all over the country
just like cannabis cultivars in the 90s in
[SPEAKER_02]: the early 2000s where there were these
little groups and this is my apple and
[SPEAKER_02]: then when industrial agricultural happened
they said well that doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't have 7,000 choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have to focus what we can sell and what
we can market and people want red apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you ended up with red delicious which
dominated the market for decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a shitty Apple with bitter skin and
very little sugar and crappy acid content.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is the blue dream of apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh ouch.
[SPEAKER_02]: But people love red apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then came Fuji's and Honeycrisp and
Braeburn and all these amazing apples that
[SPEAKER_02]: actually taste good and are sweet and have
good shelf life and once again it took
[SPEAKER_02]: decades for it to reemerge.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know industrial agriculture gets a
hold of a crop and they homogenize it and
[SPEAKER_02]: they stream line it and they turn it into
a widget.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what industry that's what it does
and then people get a hold of it and craft
[SPEAKER_02]: people and people who love heirloom plants
and heirloom things and small cool little
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff and then they turn it into something
new and that's why we now have good apples
[SPEAKER_02]: to eat.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for decades I don't know if any of you
guys are over 40 you remember you go to
[SPEAKER_02]: the market what you have.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had Granny Smith.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had red delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: You maybe had yellow delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Macintosh if you were in a nice
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean that was like a fancy apple back in
the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you know so that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a little different.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a little.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I mean apples don't get you high
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well they did in the day because when the
apple diversity it was actually alcohol.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what spread the apple population.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was for all for some hard cider.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it didn't happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there wasn't diversity in the effect
of the high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's a big part about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a big part about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The genome is that it doesn't it's all
different things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every different genome provides a
different effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's difficult to navigate that because
there's no other crop that works that way
[SPEAKER_02]: where where they're all different and we
have to pick.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think this also brings up another
point like clearly elephant in the room
[SPEAKER_03]: doom and gloom legalization is kind of
shitty and moving into this new regulated
[SPEAKER_03]: world has been a difficult transition for
all of us.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are large capitalized douchebags
out there that are looking to try and take
[SPEAKER_03]: over the entire industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're in a situation like I don't
think apple farmers were in the same
[SPEAKER_03]: situation or breeders as we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think corn farmers in the 1980s
are in the same situation that we are like
[SPEAKER_03]: they were crop commodity producers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They were producing huge amounts of
acreage of land and had tiny tiny margins.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when Monsanto in the 1980s decided
that they were going to make a move into
[SPEAKER_03]: making hybridized corn I don't think that
those farmers were positioned the way that
[SPEAKER_03]: we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're actually aware of a lot of this
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're talking about this stuff today
before all of this is happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes we're in this transition but federal
legalization has not happened.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so because of this there isn't a full
Monsanto is not 100 percent in the
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're looking at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Others like them are looking at it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we have the opportunity right now to
figure out how to preserve and protect
[SPEAKER_03]: this without having to experience all the
fuckery that we've seen in every other
[SPEAKER_03]: industry and other crop and commodity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody went to jail for growing apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: No no but not at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not at all.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the gravity of the situation in
cannabis is a lot heavier.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot heavier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: And apples don't save people's lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: And cannabis does save people's lives.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's commoditized.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean they're apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're apples.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the comparison is the clonal
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Washington first went legal after the
first year I think there were only it
[SPEAKER_01]: seemed like there were only four varieties
on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you guys remember what that was.
[SPEAKER_01]: Blue Dream.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't think it was Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was just oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh Jack.
[SPEAKER_01]: Two other.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like what the fuck.
[SPEAKER_01]: What just happened here man.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was like it was a really awesome
pleasant shock to go up to Washington
[SPEAKER_01]: after being a grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know indoors only in L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: hydro the whole time and go up there and
see the skill set of the people in the
[SPEAKER_01]: Pacific Northwest.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know a lot of people let me into their
you know grows and I was fortunate enough
[SPEAKER_01]: to you know makes those relationships and
get to really see what to me that was like
[SPEAKER_01]: oh shit this is craft cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know like wow you know and I think
Oregon to a lot of skilled growers there.
[SPEAKER_01]: NorCal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was always scared that NorCal was going
to get the O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like oh shit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like hey you can have the clone but you're
not going to bring it to Mendo right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Headband.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks Mojave.
[SPEAKER_01]: Headband.
[SPEAKER_02]: Headband doesn't exist.
[SPEAKER_02]: Josh gave.
[SPEAKER_02]: Josh gave me O.G.
Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll tell the story now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the camera rolling.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you turn it off for now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Josh gave me O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush and I brought it up to the Bay Area
and and I requested I mentioned I said you
[SPEAKER_02]: know don't call it Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just call it something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was the same thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sour Diesel crew and they called it
headband and they sold it as headband and
[SPEAKER_02]: they also sold Sour Diesel as headband and
they also were growing Sour Diesel and O
[SPEAKER_02]: .G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush in the same grow and Sour Diesel as
we all know puts off nanners at the end
[SPEAKER_02]: and pop beans were in both flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So people pulled beans out of those
flowers and called those headband.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is a good phylos bridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go on phylos if you dare.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at the galaxy and you'll see what is
headband.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's either O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush or it's Sour Diesel or it's something
else which is a seed that came off of O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kush or Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ask him how O.G.
[SPEAKER_01]: made it to Amsterdam.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I but I but I do remember when Sour
Diesel showed up in Amsterdam very
[SPEAKER_02]: specifically and I assisted those guys
with setting up a grow in Amsterdam and it
[SPEAKER_02]: was the stinkiest weed in town at the
time.
[SPEAKER_02]: As we know there's something about O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kim and Sour Diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's something in there that fuely
turpy thing that is unique and was a game
[SPEAKER_02]: changer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I remember the nice lady next door was
like I have no problem with cannabis at
[SPEAKER_02]: all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Grow as much as you guys want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it smells so strong.
[SPEAKER_02]: I come home it smells like weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I go to sleep it smells like weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: My family comes over it smells like weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It smells like home.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah that was and that was a really
interesting time because those plants that
[SPEAKER_02]: Kim, Triangle Kush, O.G.
[SPEAKER_02]: and Sour Diesel changed the game in a big
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from that point on everything had
those three things in it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's hard to find things that don't
have or that aren't that don't have those
[SPEAKER_02]: one of those three plants in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to transition in a couple
of minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I want to get each of you to talk
about what kind of mad science you're
[SPEAKER_00]: doing right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what are you dorking out on right
now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I troll the Internet.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I got it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I live in a shitty county.
[SPEAKER_03]: Calaveras County has a ban right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully that's going to change in the
upcoming months.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know that they're bringing the they're
drafting the ordinance to bring back
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations now.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you know my my science is all about
fucking with phylos and trolling my
[SPEAKER_03]: county.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't cultivate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean I have a micro business license
here in Los Angeles but I haven't flowered
[SPEAKER_02]: a plant in over two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I've been geeking out at going over my
seed library and salivating over when I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: going to be able to have the time and the
space to start germinating seeds and what
[SPEAKER_02]: could come of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my main geek moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice man.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can pop them at our place anytime.
[SPEAKER_01]: We hope so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm currently working on a facility in
Carpinteria, Santa Barbara County.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe some of you have seen some pictures.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's my first greenhouse we've worked on
as a team and it's exceeding my
[SPEAKER_01]: expectations.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely different growing in a
greenhouse than an indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's indoors you know I miss indoor of
course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm blown away like literally.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know we're just kind of ramping up
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a you know we have like kind of a
hot rod we've built there but there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of parts that are super you know need
to be changed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's always challenging up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of regulations that are like
kind of trying to keep us down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Square footage is an issue there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody knows land use permits.
[SPEAKER_01]: It goes on and on the list.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you see us out there you know we're
doing our best to put out you know the
[SPEAKER_01]: very best product we can.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a lab type seven extract lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be putting out all kinds of fun
stuff, vape cards, sauce, that kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna probably force us to do
distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: That wasn't my choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if anybody sees vape cards out there I
am not a fan of distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you know distillate is just you know
everybody just stop buying it so we can
[SPEAKER_01]: get back to like full spectrum extract you
know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so I mean just getting in places open
and trying to function you know trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: create you know a business you know with
you have to have a lot of money behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot of pressure and the actual
science behind it like the fun stuff is
[SPEAKER_01]: yet to come but we have a pretty sick lab.
[SPEAKER_01]: My chemists are in the audience right now
and really stoked and excited to start you
[SPEAKER_01]: know pulling some turps and doing all
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: you you you you
