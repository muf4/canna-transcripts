[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Amanda Chicago-Lewis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm a journalist.
[SPEAKER_09]: I write a column for Rolling Stone.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what we're going to do is I'm going to
introduce each person on the panel.
[SPEAKER_09]: And as I introduce them, I'm going to ask
them a specific question that I've come up
[SPEAKER_09]: with, mostly out of my own curiosity,
because I'm a curious person.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's start with Assemblymember
Jones-Sawyer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Reggie Jones-Sawyer, very prominent vote
for cannabis in the California
[SPEAKER_09]: legislature, represents parts of South Los
Angeles.
[SPEAKER_09]: Assemblymember, my question for you is,
are you satisfied with the pace that the
[SPEAKER_09]: city of Los Angeles is moving at
cannabis-wise?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good morning.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a resident of South Los Angeles and a
former veteran retired city employee,
[SPEAKER_01]: I worked 25 years with the city of Los
Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a recovering bureaucrat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I actually know probably why the
city moves at its pace.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one of the reasons why I ran is
because elected officials like me,
[SPEAKER_01]: I can talk about me now, used to come up
with laws and then voice it on
[SPEAKER_01]: bureaucrats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a lot of times we didn't give them
enough resources, enough money,
[SPEAKER_01]: and sometimes it was just a stupid-ass
idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we would have to make it happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think in this case, a lot of times,
elected officials come up with ideas and
[SPEAKER_01]: then put it out there, and then they hire
a cat packer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they hire other people to make it
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they should have done was talk to the
bureaucracy and say, how do we make this
[SPEAKER_01]: happen?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we ensure that we get it at the
right pace?
[SPEAKER_01]: But more important, that we do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: The city of Los Angeles is struggling
between making sure we do it right and
[SPEAKER_01]: getting it actually done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think what happens with not just LA,
any law that comes out, we ultimately have
[SPEAKER_01]: gridlock, or things don't get done,
or money sits in accounts somewhere,
[SPEAKER_01]: or people saying that the bureaucracy too
onerous.
[SPEAKER_01]: When in fact, what we probably need to do
is step back, the city of Los Angeles
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to step back, talk to the
individuals here who have to implement
[SPEAKER_01]: that law, and those who will have to
ultimately make it happen, and have
[SPEAKER_01]: another conversation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's not moving as fast as it
should.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, it's not moving as fast as it
should.
[SPEAKER_09]: If you're not aware, the city of Los
Angeles, biggest and most important
[SPEAKER_09]: cannabis market on the planet,
moving very slowly with licensing
[SPEAKER_09]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_09]: You heard it here first, Assemblymember
Jones-Sawyer, we're doing the best that we
[SPEAKER_09]: can.
[SPEAKER_09]: He understands the bureaucracy and the
reasons why it's moving slowly,
[SPEAKER_09]: but we should be moving faster.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our next panelist, Hezekiah Allen,
third generation cannabis grower from
[SPEAKER_09]: Humboldt County, has spent the last five
years fighting for his community in
[SPEAKER_09]: Sacramento, first on behalf of the Emerald
Growers Association, now on behalf of the
[SPEAKER_09]: California Growers Association,
key to note, neither association is only
[SPEAKER_09]: for growers, industry-wide, California
Growers Association, biggest industry
[SPEAKER_09]: group in California.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hezekiah has announced he is leaving his
position at the end of the year to move
[SPEAKER_09]: into business.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hezekiah, did I misread that announcement,
or did you say nobody should replace you,
[SPEAKER_09]: question mark?
[SPEAKER_08]: I did say that.
[SPEAKER_08]: To use Mr. Jones-Sawyer's, we as staff of
associations are sort of like your
[SPEAKER_08]: bureaucracy.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have a matrix management structure that
puts board and staff in more constant
[SPEAKER_08]: contact with more touch points between the
two.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think a slightly hybrid management model
will serve the organization and the
[SPEAKER_08]: industry, and allow us to really maintain
our triple mandate to the businesses,
[SPEAKER_08]: but also to the communities and to the
places that we're in.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need more folks to step up into
leadership positions, so encourage every
[SPEAKER_08]: one of you to get involved with your
friendly association, whether it's ours,
[SPEAKER_08]: Aaron's, or any of the other ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all need you guys, so you did read
that, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: All right, Hezekiah, one of a kind,
never forget.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our next panelist, Aaron Smith,
executive director of the National
[SPEAKER_09]: Cannabis Industry, Association,
more of a Colorado DC person than a
[SPEAKER_09]: California person, but we'll forgive him
for that.
[SPEAKER_09]: Aaron, what do you know about Trump's
Washington and cannabis that we don't?
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm a native Californian, by the way.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, I apologize.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, like anything that you're reading
with the Trump administration,
[SPEAKER_05]: there's a little bit of schizophrenia
there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're seeing sort of a revolt with the
staff on a myriad of issues, if you've
[SPEAKER_05]: read any of the recent articles,
or anonymous sources.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that pretty much comports with what
we're hearing out of the White House,
[SPEAKER_05]: which is that there is a very concerted
effort on the part of White House staff to
[SPEAKER_05]: undermine the industry, led by Attorney
General Jeff Sessions, who is not really
[SPEAKER_05]: in the president's favor right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: That said, we are confident that at least
the president is, is philosophically more
[SPEAKER_05]: in alignment with the state's rights
approach on this issue, as he has said,
[SPEAKER_05]: in his support for the state's act,
and of course, throughout the campaign
[SPEAKER_05]: prior to that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's continuing to educate those at the
staff level, that if we're going to really
[SPEAKER_05]: look at the cannabis issue as their
recently announced commission,
[SPEAKER_05]: or uncovered the commission that is
looking at the cannabis issue from a very
[SPEAKER_05]: negative perspective on how to undo the
facts, they call it the messaging,
[SPEAKER_05]: but the facts that regulation works,
is that they need to be looking at the
[SPEAKER_05]: whole picture, and looking at this,
at how this is beneficial to the
[SPEAKER_05]: community, as well as maybe some of the
negative impacts that are out there that I
[SPEAKER_05]: would say are clearly outweighed by the
positive.
[SPEAKER_09]: Gotcha.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Aaron, of course, referring to the
secret commission that we discovered
[SPEAKER_09]: existed at the Department of Justice
recently, looking into the cannabis
[SPEAKER_09]: industry and how to undermine it,
and letting us know that, yes,
[SPEAKER_09]: there are people in Washington who hate
cannabis, but maybe the White House is too
[SPEAKER_09]: much of a mess to really do anything about
it.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our next panelist, Max Michaelonis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Max was a staffer, yes, I say correctly,
okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Max was a staffer for Assemblymember Rob
Bonta when the original, many,
[SPEAKER_09]: many three years ago, version of the rules
of legalization was being put together in
[SPEAKER_09]: Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now he works as a lobbyist slash
consultant.
[SPEAKER_09]: I got confused about those words.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're all kind of meaningless.
[SPEAKER_09]: Max is a very deep, policy wonk,
and I want to ask you, Max, since you
[SPEAKER_09]: understand everything that's going on in a
lot of detail that people don't
[SPEAKER_09]: necessarily understand themselves,
what is the biggest confusion that you are
[SPEAKER_09]: seeing?
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the biggest misunderstanding that
people have about what's going on in
[SPEAKER_09]: California?
[SPEAKER_07]: Very good question.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think the biggest confusion that is out
there that's still out there is,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I don't think we have an answer to
this, is what's going to happen on January
[SPEAKER_07]: 10th, 2019?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going to happen when the collective
model finally gets phased out?
[SPEAKER_07]: And what is enforcement going to look
like?
[SPEAKER_07]: What is the medicinal market going to look
like?
[SPEAKER_07]: What will the adult use market look like?
[SPEAKER_07]: And how have we moved?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because, you know, Senate Bill 420 will go
in lapse one year after the Bureau issued
[SPEAKER_07]: a notice, and that day is January 9,
2019, is when the Senate Bill 420
[SPEAKER_07]: collective protections will expire.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's going to happen then,
and without any legal protections from
[SPEAKER_07]: prosecution for medicinal operators that
have been in the legacy market,
[SPEAKER_07]: in the grain market, how will the state
respond?
[SPEAKER_07]: And for those folks, what plans and what
steps have they been taking over this last
[SPEAKER_07]: year to enter the regulated market and try
to work with their local governments and
[SPEAKER_07]: get licensed?
[SPEAKER_07]: So I think that there's a lot of people
hoping, and even last week I heard people
[SPEAKER_07]: saying, we're going to get that pushed
back, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That that's not going to happen,
right?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's happening.
[SPEAKER_07]: And how the industry deals with that,
how law enforcement deals with that,
[SPEAKER_07]: and what steps are taking between now and
then, I think, are critical?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So in case you weren't clear on that,
Max referring to the fact that we have all
[SPEAKER_09]: of these cannabis dispensaries in
California that are not technically
[SPEAKER_09]: licensed by the state, that are operating
under what will soon be obsolete legal
[SPEAKER_09]: protections as quote unquote collectives.
[SPEAKER_09]: They aren't supposed to be for profit.
[SPEAKER_09]: Whether that's actually true obviously
depends on the store in question.
[SPEAKER_09]: But what is going to happen when we sunset
those protections as thin and as they are,
[SPEAKER_09]: are we going to see a huge wave of
enforcement crackdown?
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And now finally, former California
attorney general and current something
[SPEAKER_09]: high up at C4 Distro, a distribution
company.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sorry, Eric.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Bill Lockyer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Lockyer, do you regret being part of
the war on drugs now that you are
[SPEAKER_09]: profiting off of legalization?
[SPEAKER_03]: As someone who used to burn about 20
million plants a year, and of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: most of the burners wanted to be downwind
from the event, that was the job.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it came with the office now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Of course, I also, as a candidate who
supported 215, when I ran for attorney
[SPEAKER_03]: general, I had all the narcs opposing me
because that was my view, and of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: support of Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_03]: So my views haven't changed over the
years, but my responsibilities have.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I'm happy to be part of with Eric
Spitz, the distribution center of this
[SPEAKER_03]: particular enterprise.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm enjoying our political answers this
morning, which are everybody who works in
[SPEAKER_09]: government is just doing the best with the
responsibilities they've been given.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, guys.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I want to do, I think, a good question
that I think everybody can answer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Maybe let's max these answers out at like
one sentence just so we can sort of like
[SPEAKER_09]: pull the crew on this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm wondering, what is the biggest
challenge for cannabis legalization in
[SPEAKER_09]: California right now?
[SPEAKER_09]: What is the biggest single challenge we
are facing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Cracking down on the illegal market.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cannabis still isn't legal in most of the
state.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the underlying problem is that
cannabis is not legal at the federal
[SPEAKER_05]: level.
[SPEAKER_07]: Lack of sufficient retail access for the
license supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, since everyone popped something that
came from their particular expertise,
[SPEAKER_03]: maybe as a government teacher long ago,
the one I ought to say, because of the
[SPEAKER_03]: snarky comments about government,
that most people don't understand we have
[SPEAKER_03]: a governmental system designed not to
work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's why there's three branches of
government, three levels of government,
[SPEAKER_03]: all the vetoes and overrides and all that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very slow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Examples would be women's right to vote.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of other examples.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it takes a long time to move it all in
the same direction.
[SPEAKER_03]: And partly it takes the community here and
outside to work together in a unified way
[SPEAKER_03]: to make progress, whether it's enforcement
or banking or the other issues that people
[SPEAKER_03]: have mentioned.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: And also, I'm equal opportunity snark.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm in a snark industry, too.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're talking a little bit here about
the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think most of us in this room are
aware that, especially in Southern
[SPEAKER_09]: California, we've got illicit businesses
outnumbering licensed businesses 10 to 1.
[SPEAKER_09]: Since this is a very Sacramento-oriented
panel, I think I'm curious, is there
[SPEAKER_09]: anything the state can do about the
illicit market?
[SPEAKER_09]: And if so, what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Regulate it.
[SPEAKER_09]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_09]: I need more information.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give them licenses.
[SPEAKER_08]: The only difference between an illegal
business and a legal business is a
[SPEAKER_08]: license.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's incredibly pretentious of those
of us who have licenses to condemn the
[SPEAKER_08]: rest of us to jail.
[SPEAKER_09]: So are you saying make it much easier for
people to get licenses?
[SPEAKER_09]: Make it cheaper?
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Reduce the barriers to entry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let people in.
[SPEAKER_08]: Deal with it as a civil matter.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you can't run a business, you're going
to fail.
[SPEAKER_08]: This market's incredibly saturated.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's way too much product.
[SPEAKER_08]: Most businesses won't make it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But a failing business should not be a
jail cell.
[SPEAKER_08]: It should not be civil forfeiture,
asset forfeiture.
[SPEAKER_08]: Three years ago, we were all illegal
businesses.
[SPEAKER_08]: 20 years ago, we were all really,
really illegal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And guess what?
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what it took for us to get here.
[SPEAKER_08]: That was all of the hard work that went
into this.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to reduce the barriers to entry.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to bring more businesses in.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to support Aaron at the federal
level so that we can have an actual real
[SPEAKER_08]: market.
[SPEAKER_08]: California is the global powerhouse in
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_08]: We supply the world with so many
commodities.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you told California almond growers that
they could only sell in state,
[SPEAKER_08]: it would be a disaster.
[SPEAKER_08]: Olives, tomatoes, whatever crop it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to follow through on this fight.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we need to not lock people up in the
meantime.
[SPEAKER_08]: The war on drugs, as Senator de Leon
mentioned, impacted poor people and poor
[SPEAKER_08]: people of color, specifically.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those are exactly the same people that are
getting impacted now.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I represent 850 unlicensed businesses.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are hardworking folks that have been
engaged in this process for several years,
[SPEAKER_08]: and they're still unlicensed.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're poor, and they are minorities.
[SPEAKER_08]: That is who is going to get swept up into
this nonsense exactly the same as they
[SPEAKER_08]: always have.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to reduce the barriers to entry.
[SPEAKER_08]: We need to push hard on local control.
[SPEAKER_08]: Make sure there are permits everywhere so
that we can bring the market.
[SPEAKER_08]: Regulation needs to come to the market.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't need to start over and build a
new regulated market.
[SPEAKER_09]: Assemblymember?
[SPEAKER_01]: So as someone that represents individuals
where the war on crime was on board,
[SPEAKER_01]: people who look like me and Latinos,
as the chair of public safety,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I've been in more prisons than
everyone in this room put together and
[SPEAKER_01]: probably outside this room, and all I've
seen is African Americans and Latinos.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of them were put in jail because of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree we need to work real hard to
ensure we get more people into the system,
[SPEAKER_01]: that we get more legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what I work for.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I did the bills on medical
marijuana, and I worked to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: it was legalized for adult use because I
honestly felt that individuals from my
[SPEAKER_01]: community who were on the streets selling
marijuana, then they were selling in the
[SPEAKER_01]: city, statewide, some became national,
some became international cannabis dealers
[SPEAKER_01]: without a degree from USC or Harvard or
Wharton.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't have a business degree,
but they understood marketing,
[SPEAKER_01]: accounts receivable, payable, all of that
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that you want to be legal,
and a lot of you wanted to be legal,
[SPEAKER_01]: that means you're coming into my world.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when you come into my world,
you come into the government world,
[SPEAKER_01]: and as Mr. Locklear said, that's a
different world.
[SPEAKER_01]: To protect you as you come in,
the reason I said the biggest,
[SPEAKER_01]: largest problem we're going to have is the
illegal market because if that market can
[SPEAKER_01]: still undercut you because they don't pay
taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, you guys told me you wanted this
to be legal, and you were really willing
[SPEAKER_01]: to pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're jumping up and down saying,
as long as we get in, we'll pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, most of you sound like Republicans.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're paying too much taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You turn Republican overnight,
and I understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But understand, when you let the fox into
the chicken coop and a couple of chickens
[SPEAKER_01]: are missing, don't come complaining to me
because a couple of chickens are missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Government taxes, that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Democrats, unfortunately, we're not
really good with tax credits and tax
[SPEAKER_01]: breaks and all that, so we still need to
work on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I even had a bill to give your
businesses tax breaks so you can thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what will ultimately undercut,
because what I'm hearing is the illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: business across the street can sit there
and set their price below you because they
[SPEAKER_01]: know they're not paying taxes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you think you can thrive,
and we can just let these businesses just
[SPEAKER_01]: stay open, and like in LA, was it 130 to
over 1,100 illegal?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you think you can outdo those illegal
without us doing something to actively
[SPEAKER_01]: shut them down, then you're living in that
fox in the chicken coop analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think it through.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to do something to shut them
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I tried to get $75 million into the
budget this year, which Jerry Brown said
[SPEAKER_01]: no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said no because he's waiting for
the profits to come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which comes first, the chicken or the
eggs?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm trying to tell them, for you to
thrive, we've got to give you tax breaks.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to do some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But most important, we've got to make sure
you can compete not only against each
[SPEAKER_01]: other, but ultimately, you also got to
compete with the illegal market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've got to be able to make sure that
you are able to do that and not have to
[SPEAKER_01]: decide to disadvantage because they can
sell their products much cheaper than you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can go across the street and get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: If nobody's going to bother me,
guess where I'm going to go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Across the street to get the same product
you got.
[SPEAKER_01]: So please, think this thing through,
or at least give us help.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want to throw a whole bunch of
African-American, Latino men, women in
[SPEAKER_01]: jail.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is not the purpose of shutting them
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's ways we can shut them down without
filling our prisons.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you work with us, you work with the
government, we can do this right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think two very valid answers.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: My sense is that there's some,
the inconsistency is really are the people
[SPEAKER_09]: who are in the illicit market there
intentionally, or are they trying to get
[SPEAKER_09]: into the legal market?
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think those are probably two
different populations, but I think what
[SPEAKER_09]: both of you said is valid.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does anyone else want to add to the
illicit market conversation?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, just to touch on the two points
made previously, two speakers previously,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, with, you know, 1100 unlicensed
retailers in city of L.A., I think his
[SPEAKER_07]: number you said, there's only 135 licensed
retailers in city of L.A.
[SPEAKER_07]: So before we go and say shut down the
1100, we need to give them a shot to come
[SPEAKER_07]: into the marketplace and figure out which
ones of those actually want to make it,
[SPEAKER_07]: which one of those are bad actors,
are not trying to comply, things like
[SPEAKER_07]: that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's just the merger of both
comments.
[SPEAKER_07]: So whatever incentives or support the
state can supply to the cities or to them,
[SPEAKER_07]: whether it's a carrot or a stick approach
on support, on revenue, on whatnot,
[SPEAKER_07]: because, you know, just you, I think,
you know, Jackie uses this parable.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't go turn off one faucet without
turning on another.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't just shut down the legal market
without providing a pathway forward into
[SPEAKER_07]: the legal market.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think, you know, the latest numbers
to clarify there, what I've seen is we're
[SPEAKER_09]: at 164 licensed retailers in the city of
Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_09]: The city controller has said there are
1700 illicit retail operations,
[SPEAKER_09]: obviously very difficult to track.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in case you aren't aware, there's not
a timeline yet for when illicit
[SPEAKER_09]: dispensaries in the city of Los Angeles
will even be able to apply for licensure.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's not even a timeline for when
that's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_09]: So let's move on to another fun question.
[SPEAKER_09]: Max and Bill, this might be more for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think we all saw a very interesting
thing happen in Sacramento with delivery
[SPEAKER_09]: statewide this year.
[SPEAKER_09]: And we don't need to get into that
argument too much, but I do want to
[SPEAKER_09]: summarize what happened in terms of there
was a bill moving around the legislature
[SPEAKER_09]: around will delivery operations be able to
deliver to every municipality,
[SPEAKER_09]: regardless of whether they have a
commercial sales bank.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then after that bill fell out of the
legislature, we saw the bureau add that as
[SPEAKER_09]: a rule in their latest proposed rules.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just curious as someone who sometimes
finds Sacramento very confusing,
[SPEAKER_09]: is there a way for people to understand
better in the future what is the
[SPEAKER_09]: legislature's responsibility and what is
the bureau's responsibility?
[SPEAKER_09]: The Bureau of Cannabis Control,
of course, is what we're referring to
[SPEAKER_09]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, just not going to as many of the
details there, but with the legislature,
[SPEAKER_07]: the responsibility to pass laws,
enact laws, get them approved,
[SPEAKER_07]: have them be voted on by Reggie and then
be signed by the governor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or something over Joan Sawyer,
sorry.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then be signed by the governor.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then it's up to the agencies to
implement those laws.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so when the bureau came out with
regulation 5416D, which was, as we're
[SPEAKER_07]: terming it, delivery freedom, it
essentially says that delivery services
[SPEAKER_07]: have the ability to deliver into any
municipality in the state of California,
[SPEAKER_07]: they are viewing that as a clarification
of existing law.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so that's why they felt, well,
SB 1302, the Lara bill that was trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: go and make it explicit in state law,
and that would then have directed the
[SPEAKER_07]: bureau to make that clarification.
[SPEAKER_07]: The bureau then felt they had enough
authority within existing law to make the
[SPEAKER_07]: clarification on their own accord.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you're trying to force the
regulators to do something, a law will
[SPEAKER_07]: make them go and do that.
[SPEAKER_07]: But they do have flexibility within their
own administrative regulations.
[SPEAKER_09]: Love me a wonky answer.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Max.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think, yes?
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.
[SPEAKER_09]: Please.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll give you, you asked about the
legislative process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as many of you know, I was one of the
five legislators, we call ourselves the
[SPEAKER_01]: founding five, that helped write the rules
for medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the founding five, I'm not going to
mention names, believed in local control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since we're all males, I can say,
and he was passing around that bill to try
[SPEAKER_01]: to get it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he wanted to start with the founding
five, because if you know or don't know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if all five of us sign onto something,
there's a pretty good chance that it will
[SPEAKER_01]: be made into law.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was the one that said BS.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is stupid.
[SPEAKER_01]: If your city doesn't want cannabis,
but they want to deny individuals who need
[SPEAKER_01]: it for medical marijuana, for medical
purposes, from having it delivered,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not down with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I refused to sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you could see it start to lose some
steam and ultimately go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: The governor, too, believed in local
control.
[SPEAKER_01]: But he also believed that we need to get
it to as many people medically as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he didn't want to interrupt that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that might be why some movement was
made administratively, which the governor
[SPEAKER_01]: has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's kind of the checks and
balances where if we're all working
[SPEAKER_01]: together on the same wavelength,
we can get something done quicker through
[SPEAKER_01]: the administrative process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or we can take that long, laborious
process that I have to go through,
[SPEAKER_01]: which takes a year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's enacted three months later.
[SPEAKER_01]: We can do that long process.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's both.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: That's very helpful.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you want to add?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just quickly say, you know,
just the original question, the agencies
[SPEAKER_08]: may not break the law.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously, they are responsible for
implementing the law and they have a lot
[SPEAKER_08]: of wiggle room within what they do to
implement the law.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, think about some of the things
that have been achieved through regs,
[SPEAKER_08]: the type S shared license, distro
transport, transport only.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there are a lot of relatively
big pieces that have come out of the reg
[SPEAKER_08]: process.
[SPEAKER_08]: If it doesn't break the law and it doesn't
break any other law, but it will help them
[SPEAKER_08]: implement it, they can do it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, you know, three years ago we were all
legislative.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're going to need to learn more about
regulatory affairs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting, interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Assemblymember John Sawyer made a
little reference to the governor earlier.
[SPEAKER_09]: And the fact, I think someone said that we
have a bill waiting on the current
[SPEAKER_09]: governor's desk, but we also all know
there is an election happening very soon.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think most people are sort of assuming
at this point that we are expecting a
[SPEAKER_09]: governor Gavin Newsom in our future.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious for all of our folks on the
panel, what is going to change once we
[SPEAKER_09]: have a presumably Gavin Newsom as our
governor?
[SPEAKER_09]: Or do you not think he's going to be
governor?
[SPEAKER_09]: But what's going to change for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I'm never shy, I guess.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I don't know that much will
change.
[SPEAKER_08]: The checks and balances that Mr. Lockyer
outlined are still present.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are still a lot of steps in the
process.
[SPEAKER_08]: The governor certainly holds a lot of
influence over Sacramento, but,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, the five are still there.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are still a lot of lawmakers.
[SPEAKER_08]: There are agencies.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I think what we can say with
certainty is that Mr. Newsom did support
[SPEAKER_08]: Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_08]: You can read his own words.
[SPEAKER_08]: He supported it largely through,
you know, he doesn't want his kids around
[SPEAKER_08]: it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He doesn't like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: He wants it regulated and controlled.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's sort of a synopsis of a handful of
his quotes, but he's not a real
[SPEAKER_08]: pro-cannabis, free the weeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: He's sort of a guy.
[SPEAKER_08]: That said, he's also a pretty reasonable
guy who recognizes that the past policy
[SPEAKER_08]: regime has failed us pretty grandly.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that we can expect no
backsliding.
[SPEAKER_08]: Things will continue to progress.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think if Cox were to pull the
votes together, that we'd probably expect
[SPEAKER_08]: to see some really, some regress.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so, you know, I think we can expect
solid stability at the very least.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know that we should be expecting
any big, structural changes to regulation
[SPEAKER_08]: in the next few years, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that, you know, the concrete is
setting up on the foundation, and now
[SPEAKER_08]: we're gonna build it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So any big changes, you probably need to
go back to the voters if you have those in
[SPEAKER_08]: your imagination.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right now is a good time to build with
what we have.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's been set, and I expect the next
administration will largely follow through
[SPEAKER_08]: on that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And probably Mr. Lockneger probably has
more experience of that than about being a
[SPEAKER_01]: candidate, or being an activist,
sitting out in the audience and saying
[SPEAKER_01]: what you should do, being a candidate and
saying what you will do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you finally get into a
statewide office and do what you're
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to do, it's completely different.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you have all these different hats.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm hoping that when Governor Newsom
gets in, that because he has a good
[SPEAKER_01]: business background, because he's been
progressive on a lot of issues,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially this, and that he has a concern
for protections and making sure that we do
[SPEAKER_01]: this legally, that when we bring tax
breaks, I'll give you an example.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we bring tax breaks forward for this
industry, he will have a better
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding of how if you give someone a
tax break, that will bring in,
[SPEAKER_01]: that's an investment in that industry,
which should bring back more money into
[SPEAKER_01]: the general fund.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of times, elected officials
are reticent to do that because they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know how much money is going in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'd rather see how much money come in
first before the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, which comes first, the chicken or
the egg?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're a business person,
you look at tax breaks as incentives to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring in more money to make your business
thrive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think sometimes, elected officials,
I'm not going to pick on any one party,
[SPEAKER_01]: but sometimes elected officials don't see
it that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They see the general fund going down every
time you give a tax break.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not always that way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes you can spur an industry on.
[SPEAKER_01]: The one I'm thinking of is the Internet
and our whole, you know, the things we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about, net neutrality and all of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to start coming in after we let
that industry thrive with little or no
[SPEAKER_01]: government intervention.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we're coming in on the back end to do
some things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think right now with this industry,
we want to do it right and at the right
[SPEAKER_01]: pace, and that's the struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm hoping that Mr. Newsom,
will really take the tax incentive part
[SPEAKER_01]: and run with it like crazy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Hoffman, do you want to add anything?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I first of all think Gavin Newsom
will be the next governor that he clearly
[SPEAKER_03]: understands and participated in writing
the new law and is an advocate for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So whether it's robust enforcement or
protecting small entry players or those
[SPEAKER_03]: that have been in the business a long
time, those are all stated goals,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I don't expect the law to change a
lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's really going to change is the
marketplace.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm surprised to hear you mention that
Governor Newsom or Lieutenant Governor
[SPEAKER_09]: Newsom might be protecting small players.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Aaron, do you want to add something?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, I just wanted to add on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that I'm hopeful anyway that we'll
see more advocacy for California at the
[SPEAKER_05]: federal level.
[SPEAKER_05]: And not to say that Governor Brown hasn't
advocated for California and defended
[SPEAKER_05]: California on cannabis and a myriad of
other issues in D.C., but I think because
[SPEAKER_05]: of future Governor Newsom's role in the
development of Prop 64, that we will see a
[SPEAKER_05]: more steadfast advocate in the governor's
office as we work to change federal laws.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think it's really notable that we're
seeing, and this will be the case in I
[SPEAKER_05]: think Colorado and other states that have
developed cannabis markets where we're
[SPEAKER_05]: seeing pro-cannabis governors likely to be
elected.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's really notable that in an
election year, it used to be really hard
[SPEAKER_05]: to get anybody on the record to talk
about, you know, supporting reform,
[SPEAKER_05]: and they, well, wait until next year.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, this was just a couple years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's how it was.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now, we're seeing members of Congress who
never supported the issue, senior minority
[SPEAKER_05]: leader Chuck Schumer, for example,
coming forward with comprehensive
[SPEAKER_05]: legislation to curry favor with millennial
voters, 70% of which support our issue and
[SPEAKER_05]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And becoming an issue, as we saw recently
in the debate with Ted Cruz and Beto O
[SPEAKER_09]: 'Rourke, it's more of a thing.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, yeah, please, Max, I didn't want to
leave you behind.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, it's okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just one last point here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I anticipate that Newsom's actions as
governor on cannabis will be oriented more
[SPEAKER_07]: towards the national stage.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's got a long career ahead of him,
and there is an office higher than
[SPEAKER_07]: governor of California.
[SPEAKER_09]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, I think we've seen him be a
little more vocally pro-cannabis than
[SPEAKER_09]: Governor Brown.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So we're going to do one more question,
and then we're going to do Q&A in like
[SPEAKER_09]: five minutes if people are getting excited
about their questions, if I haven't asked
[SPEAKER_09]: enough questions for you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Should we do regrets or should we do
Canadian money?
[SPEAKER_09]: Where do you guys want to go with this?
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do regrets.
[SPEAKER_09]: All right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Great.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I'm curious, in the past three years,
what each of you have seen, you know,
[SPEAKER_09]: from each of your experiences,
if there was one thing you could change
[SPEAKER_09]: about how legalization has played out in
California in the past three years,
[SPEAKER_09]: whether it's something you did,
something, you know, the legislature did,
[SPEAKER_09]: whether it was this one rule that was in
Prop 64 that you wish was different.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's the one thing that you really wish
you could go back and change?
[SPEAKER_08]: Starting to be a pattern here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Still not shy, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think the bottom line is that we needed
a longer timeline.
[SPEAKER_08]: We had 25 years of unregulated criminal
marijuana spelled with an H.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then we had 20 years of legal marijuana a
la Prop 215.
[SPEAKER_08]: Then these five got together and passed
regulation.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, all 80 of them passed it ultimately,
but 120 of them passed regulations for
[SPEAKER_08]: medical.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we threw an initiative right on
top of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we tried to get everything done
by January 1st, 2018, which is completely
[SPEAKER_08]: impossible for bureaucrats without a
budget.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's why everything's falling on its
face.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ta-da!
[SPEAKER_08]: I was a big supporter of a, you know,
let's get medical regulated by 2018.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's make sure our patients are safe.
[SPEAKER_08]: Let's make sure compassionate care is at
the core of the industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then let's build into and grow into
adult use.
[SPEAKER_08]: The status quo wasn't working under Prop
215 by any means, but I'm not convinced
[SPEAKER_08]: that what we're going to end up with is
going to be better in the short to
[SPEAKER_08]: midterm.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we rushed it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think that ultimately we should have
taken the time to implement the MCRSA and
[SPEAKER_08]: then implement Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I also think it would have been nice
if the protections for small businesses in
[SPEAKER_08]: Prop 64 were actually enforced.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, this isn't, I wouldn't say regret,
but one thing that I'd like to remind
[SPEAKER_05]: regulators and lawmakers and even the
industry is that what the intent was
[SPEAKER_05]: behind regulating cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't, it wasn't, voters didn't come
to the ballot box because they wanted to
[SPEAKER_05]: go and buy legal cannabis for the most
part.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was because we promised that we would
replace the criminal market with a
[SPEAKER_05]: regulated one and offer all of the
societal and economic benefits that come
[SPEAKER_05]: with that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we're doing it.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I think that we could do a better job
at always looking at everything,
[SPEAKER_05]: especially at the regulatory level.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of these issues that we're talking
about are actually creating barriers for
[SPEAKER_05]: us to be able to replace that criminal
market.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: So the ongoing criminalization of the
unlicensed market, you feel like we've
[SPEAKER_09]: sort of lost track of what the goal was
here.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that we, we need to just continue
to remember and keep that in mind as the
[SPEAKER_05]: vision behind what we're trying to do.
[SPEAKER_05]: And there will always be a criminal market
until we have interstate and international
[SPEAKER_05]: commerce and we can export cannabis out of
California like they're starting to do up
[SPEAKER_05]: in Canada now.
[SPEAKER_05]: But always keeping that goal in mind is
that that is the purpose and the intent
[SPEAKER_05]: behind the establishment of these,
these modern cannabis laws.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Probably the greatest regret is as we were
going through how we're going to make this
[SPEAKER_01]: law happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the legislature, one of the key things
that we needed was local control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that, that's how we were able to get,
you know, 60 something votes in the
[SPEAKER_01]: assembly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I regret that we didn't come up with a
formula whereby cities that do not want
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis, I'm sorry, elected officials who
do not want cannabis in their cities that
[SPEAKER_01]: we didn't devise a way, maybe limited
licensing in districts that don't want it,
[SPEAKER_01]: but we needed to get some way to get the
nose, the camel's nose underneath the
[SPEAKER_01]: tent.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, we didn't, we didn't think of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now, my, my, my, the reason I
backed off is because I still firmly
[SPEAKER_01]: believe that when we have the next
recession in California, the cities that
[SPEAKER_01]: have legalized cannabis will be able to
continue to operate with limited or no,
[SPEAKER_01]: no problems while the others will
structure have to fire, fire police,
[SPEAKER_01]: reduce government.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the people will say, my neighbor
next door is not doing the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is the difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they'll see that as the revenue from
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that again, to what others are saying,
that's a long, that may take five years
[SPEAKER_01]: from now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We needed to do something where we gave a
statewide license that may have provided,
[SPEAKER_01]: that may have guaranteed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm just making up a number,
even if it was just one or five cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: operations in any city.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then at least you could, you could do the
experiment in that city, make sure it's
[SPEAKER_01]: done right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then hopefully the elected officials
get that comfort level or the citizenry
[SPEAKER_01]: get that comfort level to say,
you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's move on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I liken that to same as liquor stores.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't want over proliferation of liquor
stores in my area, but I'm not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: say we should be no more liquor stores in
the city of Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there's a way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just couldn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just didn't at the time we were going
so fast, we just want to get it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we said we would come back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe that's something we could look
at later on this next session,
[SPEAKER_01]: how we can statewide make it mandatory on
a limited basis.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Max, Mr. Locker, would you like to add a
regret?
[SPEAKER_07]: I just like to echo a bit on what the
Senator said.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, cities and counties they could
not handle local control.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was so big and coming at them so fast,
especially with a constantly changing
[SPEAKER_07]: state framework, which gave them the
excuse of the regulations aren't
[SPEAKER_07]: permanent.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in the MRSA regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in the MCRSA regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: We're in the emergency regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're proposed.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, now they're proposed.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now we're working on the draft final
regulations.
[SPEAKER_07]: Just kick the can down the road
repeatedly.
[SPEAKER_07]: But going back to the point, the previous
point, you don't ban cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: You ban legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: And all these cities with all these bans
and refusal to license has just gone and
[SPEAKER_07]: left that and see that area to the illicit
market.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so, you know, there was too much local
control and the ability to ban,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, should not necessarily have been
on the table.
[SPEAKER_07]: And the problem is, especially going back
to the very first bills, one of the very
[SPEAKER_07]: first bills had a draft in error.
[SPEAKER_07]: That drafting error went and said,
if you do not regulate by March 1,
[SPEAKER_07]: 2016, regulate cultivation, then you lose
your local control over cultivation.
[SPEAKER_07]: That caused, you know, what's been termed
ban of Palooza.
[SPEAKER_07]: And where, you know, vast 80, 90% of the
jurisdictions in the state banned all
[SPEAKER_07]: those medical cannabis activity because of
drafting error that was replaced by
[SPEAKER_07]: February.
[SPEAKER_07]: So the amount of damage done between
signing the bills in October and repealing
[SPEAKER_07]: that part in February or March,
we haven't gotten back from that to a
[SPEAKER_07]: degree.
[SPEAKER_07]: We haven't gotten back from those bans.
[SPEAKER_07]: And between that drafting error and local
control, those were things that,
[SPEAKER_07]: you know, hindsight says we should have
avoided.
[SPEAKER_09]: For sure, for sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: And of course, as everyone who is here
probably already knows, the vast majority
[SPEAKER_09]: of municipalities in California is banning
commercial cannabis sales.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mr. Walker, is there something you want to
add?
[SPEAKER_09]: We're almost ready for our Q&A otherwise.
[SPEAKER_09]: You got a regret?
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you regret?
[SPEAKER_03]: I would only kind of have to agree with
the comments made that we could have taken
[SPEAKER_03]: more time on the front end, although there
was some urgency that had developed over
[SPEAKER_03]: the years to kind of get it right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the local control agreement was an
absolutely essential part of getting
[SPEAKER_03]: something done.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't going to happen without it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so over the future years, there'll be
a re-debate and re-discussion and
[SPEAKER_03]: fine-tuning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it'll take a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I think Reggie's right when he says,
my neighbor is buying it down the street
[SPEAKER_03]: and lives in this town.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why can't I buy it here?
[SPEAKER_03]: So ultimately, the economic logic
prevails.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: So friends, this has been really fun.
[SPEAKER_09]: Let's do some questions.
[SPEAKER_09]: I think Susan would like it if you line
up.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that what works for you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Amanda, great panel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everyone, thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of heavy hitters up here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really appreciate everybody's work.
[SPEAKER_04]: My question is for Lockyer.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you're aware of a story
that just happened two and a half weeks
[SPEAKER_04]: ago about a licensed transporter that had
Department of Homeland Security seize
[SPEAKER_04]: $230,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a case that Mark Wasserman and Matt
Cuman are representing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're going to be filing an injunction
against the CHP who made the initial call.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now that you're a licensed distributor,
are you going to advocate on behalf of
[SPEAKER_04]: distributors to ensure that the federal
government does not continue to make this
[SPEAKER_04]: a new reality for the license industry?
[SPEAKER_04]: Or are you going to wait until you're the
next victim?
[SPEAKER_03]: Sort of a Hobbesian choice, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm an advocate for the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I change the federal government?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: The voters hopefully will.
[SPEAKER_11]: First of all, my name is Michael Howard.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm with 3C Cannabis Consulting.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I'd like to say that you're the best
moderator I think I've ever seen.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll take that.
[SPEAKER_11]: So that was not a question.
[SPEAKER_11]: My question is,
[SPEAKER_11]: I've heard rumors that there's going to be
a second comment period for California for
[SPEAKER_11]: the regulations to become permanent.
[SPEAKER_11]: So what would you say is one or two
things, particularly Aaron and Hezekiah,
[SPEAKER_11]: one or two things that really are sort of
out of place or that you'd like to have
[SPEAKER_11]: tweaked to make permanent?
[SPEAKER_08]: So the answer is yes, she is the best
moderator ever.
[SPEAKER_08]: If there is a second comment process on
the rules, it will be limited in scope.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the only reason that a second comment
period would be triggered is if
[SPEAKER_08]: substantial significant changes are made
to the rules that we all commented on
[SPEAKER_08]: before.
[SPEAKER_08]: And while it's not actually statutorily
required that comments be focused on those
[SPEAKER_08]: changes, it's generally viewed that a
second 15-day supplemental comment period
[SPEAKER_08]: would be focused on changes that have
already been made.
[SPEAKER_08]: The consideration of a next round of
changes is likely to be deferred until the
[SPEAKER_08]: next rulemaking process.
[SPEAKER_08]: So comment on whatever you like.
[SPEAKER_08]: But really, when we see the next draft of
the regs, look at what's changed.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that should be the focus for those
supplemental comments.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we don't know what those things are
yet because we haven't seen them.
[SPEAKER_09]: 15-day, one, five?
[SPEAKER_08]: 15, one, five day is the supplemental,
I believe.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, Dale.
[SPEAKER_08]: Reggie, Bill, you guys might know these.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's a 15-day supplemental if they
make substantial changes.
Thanks.
[SPEAKER_09]: Just clarifying.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jonah Irvine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sponsor tech.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do online youth safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: You were talking about delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is really for Bill and Reggie.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just recently, there was a campaign,
Stop Wandering Weed, by the California
[SPEAKER_00]: Police Chief Association and the League of
Cities that are trying to use youth.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a cartoon with kids in front of,
and I have a copy of it at our booth,
[SPEAKER_00]: kids in front of a school and a marijuana
truck there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is coming out from the police
chief's association.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it that you two can be doing to
help them stop youth fear-mongering around
[SPEAKER_00]: youth, recognizing that nobody in this
industry wants youth to come into their
[SPEAKER_00]: store and be delivering to youth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I saw that, I said, I mean,
I just couldn't believe that they did
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that this industry needs
to do, because you can't stop law
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement from spreading what they
believe is right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some of it can be pretty drastic,
what you see.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they have to do that to catch your
attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: This industry needs to fight back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think MedMen now has an ad, and I'm
advertising for MedMen, where they show
[SPEAKER_01]: regular people who use adult-use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wish they had a politician in there,
too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they show nurses and doctors and
teachers we need to let people know
[SPEAKER_01]: regular people use it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But more important, for medical cannabis,
we need to let people know it's for
[SPEAKER_01]: veterans with PTSD, for seniors with
arthritis and medical ailment,
[SPEAKER_01]: and for people with cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to get that message out,
and we need to put our own money,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's probably not my money,
but at least you put your money in some
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of advertising campaign to show the
benefits of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Otherwise, the only way of voice they hear
is that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could make an unbelievable counter
to their argument that would just squash
[SPEAKER_01]: them to no end.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even an ad showing that this industry is
not into having ice cream trucks running
[SPEAKER_01]: through the neighborhood selling cannabis
to kids.
[SPEAKER_09]: So if anyone from MedMen is here,
sounds like the assembly member's offering
[SPEAKER_09]: to star in a political campaign for you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, guys, doing thank you guys for coming
and talking to us.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know you very well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see you on Facebook.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're a good man.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Jason David.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm Jayden David's father, the first child
on national television to ever use medical
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: Started the worldwide medical marijuana
movement for children.
[SPEAKER_06]: A few things she said was pretty good,
except for kids do need it, and I do want
[SPEAKER_06]: kids in my dispense.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said education.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I ever do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I do support groups every single month for
our veterans, but not just that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Also, we feed them.
[SPEAKER_06]: We give them medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have doctors, chiropractors and
everything, and we're educating people
[SPEAKER_06]: about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: I came here and I wanted to talk to you
guys about two different things.
[SPEAKER_06]: First thing is about regulations.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been a nightmare, of course.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you guys need to talk to more of
the dispensaries and who's living it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not just that.
[SPEAKER_06]: The extraction facility has been a
nightmare with the testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our patients need the medicine.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's life and death.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not a joke.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is not a vape pin.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is life and death for children.
[SPEAKER_06]: My youngest patient is two months old.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had a 10-month-old baby sitting out
front of my store about three weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: We couldn't get the Jayden juice fast
enough because of testing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Having a seizure in front of the store,
I had one last bottle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I had to drive home half an hour,
pick it up, come back, give it to a child
[SPEAKER_06]: because the testing and rules and
regulations have ruined it for these
[SPEAKER_06]: families that are desperate for
life-saving medicine.
[SPEAKER_09]: Sir, I think we all appreciate what you're
doing.
[SPEAKER_09]: Do you have a question?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yes, I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, my first thing was a statement.
[SPEAKER_06]: Second thing is a question.
[SPEAKER_06]: Who's going to remember the patients?
[SPEAKER_06]: As we've been changing from 215 to 64,
the patients have been forgotten.
[SPEAKER_06]: Patients need medicine and it's getting
very expensive.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I came here, not just for the
complaints about the medicine,
[SPEAKER_06]: but who's going to help out the patients?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is anyone going to come out there and help
us out, become a hero for the patients who
[SPEAKER_06]: need the medicine and can't afford it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_07]: This year I worked with Operation EVAC,
a veterans camps organization.
[SPEAKER_07]: Along with the Cannabis Compassion
Coalition on Senate Bill 829 by Senator
[SPEAKER_07]: Scott Weiner.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the compassion bill.
[SPEAKER_07]: Senator Weiner is going to be here today
to go and give his talk on that in more
[SPEAKER_07]: detail, but essentially we want to be able
to allow retailers and allow all through
[SPEAKER_07]: the supply chain to be able to provide
cannabis products to patients that have a
[SPEAKER_07]: recommendation, not just an ID card,
and allow them to be provided tax-free so
[SPEAKER_07]: that you would not be taxed on the
cultivation, you would not be taxed on the
[SPEAKER_07]: excise, you would not be taxed on the use
tax.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you wanted to give the product away,
and that would be at a loss for the
[SPEAKER_07]: retailer, but you would be able to do that
without the government penalizing you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that was the first step on compassion,
and I think it was the first time really
[SPEAKER_07]: since, we regret that in the MCHRSA there
wasn't strong protections for compassion,
[SPEAKER_07]: and this bill is a very good step,
but also a very first step on bringing
[SPEAKER_07]: compassion back to the legal regulated
cannabis market.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll say, same as Max, working on that
bill demonstrated that patients aren't
[SPEAKER_08]: forgotten.
[SPEAKER_08]: There was a vote out of the legislature in
both houses, there was a signature,
[SPEAKER_08]: and so I think the political will is
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know Mr. Jones-Sawyer and his colleagues
very much do want to see patients have it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Part of the frustration that I feel is
this sort of rush to establish a
[SPEAKER_08]: profitable market when there are literally
children dying for want of clean products,
[SPEAKER_08]: and so I'm not going to be that hero.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know how I can do it, but every
one of you, if you're investing in,
[SPEAKER_08]: if you're operating in, if you're
supporting the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_08]: you have to not forget.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's up to every single one of us to
remember what this plant has been for for
[SPEAKER_08]: the last thousands of years we've used it.
[SPEAKER_08]: The advancements, I mean, you know it more
than me.
[SPEAKER_08]: You see it every day.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is literally life or death for
children, and we all need to remember
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: We all need to step up.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you're investing, put 1% into advocacy.
[SPEAKER_08]: The businesses can support their own
advocacy.
[SPEAKER_08]: They can pay for their own associations.
[SPEAKER_08]: Invest in compassion.
[SPEAKER_08]: You need to do it, or else we're going to
keep talking shit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the first elected official to smoke
cannabis in public with Melissa Etheridge.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Elon Musk did the same thing and
caught hell.
[SPEAKER_01]: The point I'm making is the reason I did
it because I did it leading with medical
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Melissa Etheridge has cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: She uses it for cancer treatment other
than the pharmaceutical industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's what we were promoting,
and I think that's why I didn't catch any
[SPEAKER_01]: grief from that other than I think my
district is kind of cool with that,
[SPEAKER_01]: but that's a whole other discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think if we lead with the victims
or the people who need it, we will be able
[SPEAKER_01]: to get other people, even elected
officials and others to say, you know
[SPEAKER_01]: what, this is not a bad industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if you do set aside 1%,
lead with medical.
[SPEAKER_01]: Show the victims, not the victims,
show the patients that actually need this
[SPEAKER_01]: and show how the family members are much
happier now.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think we will move a lot faster once
we get rid of that cannabis, that
[SPEAKER_01]: marijuana madness kind of feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we do that, we'll be far ahead of
anybody else.
[SPEAKER_09]: So I think the question was, does anyone
want to be a hero?
[SPEAKER_09]: Max said, sure, me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Hezekiah said, not me.
[SPEAKER_09]: Assembly member said, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think we're at 10.30.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our next panel is, do we want to do one
more question?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there a pathway forward to develop on
banking in California yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: The board of directors of banks that I
speak to are operating out of fear.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do not want to take on a target on
their back from a federal agency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the simple response to me is,
why on earth would I put my bank at risk?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is there an update?
[SPEAKER_02]: Secondly, on the prior conversation,
about maybe Governor Newsom, how do we
[SPEAKER_02]: avoid this issue becoming the poster child
for the polarization that now exists
[SPEAKER_02]: throughout all politics?
[SPEAKER_02]: The people on the other side of this
issue, Governor Newsom rolls in to start
[SPEAKER_02]: advocating nationally for this,
easily can displace the real issues and
[SPEAKER_02]: get into just inflamed partisan
politicking.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm very concerned that even a
well-meaning Governor Newsom is just going
[SPEAKER_02]: to create what is an ignorant firestorm
about what this issue is.
[SPEAKER_05]: On the banking front, you're absolutely
right that this is one of the symptoms of
[SPEAKER_05]: the conflict between federal and state law
that everybody in this room probably deals
[SPEAKER_05]: with every day on some level.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have seen that there is bipartisan
support in Congress, in both chambers,
[SPEAKER_05]: but for reforming banking, laws,
the money laundering statutes,
[SPEAKER_05]: as well as Bank Secrecy Act, to carve out
an exception for state-licensed
[SPEAKER_05]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_05]: But as General Lockyer said, government
doesn't work very quickly.
[SPEAKER_05]: I am of the opinion now that the banking
issue will probably be resolved in a more
[SPEAKER_05]: of a comprehensive package, like the
States Act, at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_05]: But looking to states, and maybe
Assemblymember Jones-Sawyer can speak to
[SPEAKER_05]: the state, the progress happening here in
the state.
[SPEAKER_05]: But again, like has already been said,
everybody here, if you care about this
[SPEAKER_05]: issue, it's time to invest in the policy
reforms that aren't happening by
[SPEAKER_05]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_05]: The reason that we took the banking issue
from something that hardly anybody knew
[SPEAKER_05]: about in Washington, D.C., to something
that has bipartisan support in its front
[SPEAKER_05]: and center is because of the relationships
that all of the responsible businesses
[SPEAKER_05]: allowed us to develop in D.C.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll just say quickly, in addition to I
share Aaron's confidence at the national
[SPEAKER_08]: level.
[SPEAKER_08]: For the first time in several years,
I think that things are going to move.
[SPEAKER_08]: Kudos to NCIA for moving in that direction
and getting us in that position.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've got hope on the horizon at the
federal level.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also want to point to State Treasurer
John Chung's efforts with the Cannabis
[SPEAKER_08]: Banking Working Group over the previous
year.
[SPEAKER_08]: Those have resulted in a couple of
exciting things.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that maybe Tim will update you all
on that a little bit later in the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: But two things that came out of that
process that give me a lot of hope.
[SPEAKER_08]: First and foremost, the State Treasurer's
Office is moving forward with a
[SPEAKER_08]: feasibility study on a special state
charter institution.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll say that it is already legal for
banks to bank us.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're just choosing not to because of a
risk calculation, as you've mentioned.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that hopefully this state charter
will not create a state bank per se,
[SPEAKER_08]: but will give banks a higher confidence,
lower risk profile, and moving into the
[SPEAKER_08]: space.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or better yet, maybe a group of
entrepreneurs will seize the opportunity
[SPEAKER_08]: and create a bank through that charter
process specifically for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: Secondly, there is now a multi-state
consortium that brings together local
[SPEAKER_08]: governments, state governments,
industry, as well as the financial
[SPEAKER_08]: industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Aaron and NCIA are working with that
group.
[SPEAKER_08]: We are working with that group as
treasurers from Maine, Illinois,
[SPEAKER_08]: a bunch of different states.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the goal is specifically to set legal
states up to help that effort in DC.
[SPEAKER_08]: And both of those things, I think,
are new alignments of influence that
[SPEAKER_08]: didn't exist before.
[SPEAKER_08]: To the second piece, your question about
polarizing.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't see cannabis as a polarizing
issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gotten high in West Virginia.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gotten high in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've gotten high in Louisiana.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I tell you what, the reddest of the
red counties and parishes, they're getting
[SPEAKER_08]: high, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I actually see this is probably more of
a high-falutin political pundit
[SPEAKER_08]: polarization.
[SPEAKER_08]: The American people aren't polarized on
this issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if they are, that generation's passing
on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Polls are consistently showing over 90% of
the country supports medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I don't think it's a polarizing
issue anymore.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's getting less so every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think the real problem is fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I sleep with a banker.
[SPEAKER_01]: She wears a Wells Fargo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know how bankers think.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't lend you money unless they look
at your credit report because of fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't take a chance on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't lend you money for a house
unless you have collateral.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're shown because of fear,
the fear that you will fail.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I get why banks don't want to move
forward with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because in their nature and their business
practice, it's based on risk and reward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the risk is you lose everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can just seize everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And no individual banker wants to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know if I'll let you count it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a discussion with about four
or five Western states about starting a
[SPEAKER_01]: bank of their own and then have the
federal government try to shut down a
[SPEAKER_01]: multinational state bank.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we fight them as a group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're all in the West.
[SPEAKER_01]: Washington, Oregon, California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let's do that and see what happens and
see if we collectively push back on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it's our money.
[SPEAKER_01]: We put in our money from different states,
investors who are willing to take that
[SPEAKER_01]: risk to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is discussion.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to pull the trigger is still F-E-A-R.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not just a book.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's real.
[SPEAKER_09]: Friends, thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Our next panel is the realities of
California's cannabis economy.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
Thank you.
