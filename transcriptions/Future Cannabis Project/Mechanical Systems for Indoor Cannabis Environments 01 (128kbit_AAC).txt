[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't we get started here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks everyone for joining us today.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Brian Hesterman with Inspire,
and I'll be hosting today's webinar and Q
[SPEAKER_00]: &A session.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're here today to talk about mechanical
systems for indoor plant environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the title suggests, growing cannabis
inside a sealed room is a highly complex
[SPEAKER_00]: interdisciplinary challenge that bridges
engineering with biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're adding and removing energy inside
these cultivation rooms to balance and
[SPEAKER_00]: optimize the growth of living organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case, cannabis plants, whose needs
are constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through the lens of increased
competition, price compression,
[SPEAKER_00]: and shifting consumer preferences,
carefully designing a facility will
[SPEAKER_00]: determine the success or failure of
today's cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It truly takes a village to build a
high-performing cultivation facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: and for that reason we have a diverse
audience in attendance today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Architects, engineers, contractors,
cultivators, owners, investors,
[SPEAKER_00]: consultants, and the network of channel
partners we collaborate with every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's presentation is part one of a
two-part series and will be focused on the
[SPEAKER_00]: biology side of the equation, the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: This will be new content for some and
review for others, and we'll do our best
[SPEAKER_00]: to lay a solid foundation to plant science
concepts, dynamics of a sealed grow room,
[SPEAKER_00]: and HVACD system sizing and selection with
the overall goal of building better
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities and growing better cannabis
more efficiently.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of quick housekeeping items.
[SPEAKER_00]: Part two will be on the mechanical systems
and cannabis-specific sequence of
[SPEAKER_00]: operations that we apply to optimize the
plants inside these cultivation
[SPEAKER_00]: facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll also talk through setting baselines
and expectations for an application that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't currently have any.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today's webinar will be presented by
Inspire's Cannabis Operations Specialist,
[SPEAKER_00]: Anders Petersen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inspire's Adrian Giovenco will be joining
for Q&A after the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And without further ado, I'll pass the mic
over to Ders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take it away, my man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Brian.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for joining me today in today's
discussion.
[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Anders Petersen, affectionately
referred to as Ders by a lot of my friends
[SPEAKER_02]: and colleagues.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a biologist and have been working in
the cannabis industry for almost 12 years
[SPEAKER_02]: now with a focus on indoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_02]: In part one of this webinar, I wanted to
share with you some of the core concepts
[SPEAKER_02]: about mechanical systems for indoor plant
environments that I wish I knew as a
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivator at the beginning of my career.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's really no easy way around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these are complicated topics,
and there's even going to be a little bit
[SPEAKER_02]: of math.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to try my best to simplify
everything and break it down over the next
[SPEAKER_02]: 30 minutes or so.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I encourage you to reach out to us
here at Inspire if you have follow-up
[SPEAKER_02]: questions or want to learn more about a
particular topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So setting the stage a little bit,
this talk is going to focus on
[SPEAKER_02]: environmental control for indoor
cultivation, not greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many of the concepts still apply to
greenhouses, but they have their own
[SPEAKER_02]: unique considerations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Keep in mind, too, as we go through this
talk that these are tightly sealed grow
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms with no outdoor air being introduced
to normal operation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything is fully recirculating because
we are also supplementing CO2 into these
[SPEAKER_02]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: And finally, our talk today will focus on
the cultivation of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, these concepts can apply to
pretty much any crop grown indoors with
[SPEAKER_02]: their own unique specie considerations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's quickly review the main
parameters of plant growth that we are
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to control in these facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: In one way or another, your HVAC system
impacts everything you see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the shoot zone, we have light,
temperature, humidity, CO2, and airflow.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the root zone, water, oxygen,
root zone temperature, and nutrients.
[SPEAKER_02]: Microbes as well, while not essential for
plant growth, they should be considered
[SPEAKER_02]: with their ubiquity in our environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And last but not least, running down the
center of that plant is genetics,
[SPEAKER_02]: the foundation of everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Genotype plus environment equals
phenotype.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or in other words, the genetics just
represent the potential of a certain
[SPEAKER_02]: variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: The better the environment to control,
the better the phenotypic expression at
[SPEAKER_02]: the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to learn more about phenotypic
expression, we actually have a whole
[SPEAKER_02]: webinar dedicated to this topic on our
website.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I believe Brian is going to drop it
into the chat if you'd like to check it
[SPEAKER_02]: out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, none of these parameters exist in a
vacuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: They all work synergistically.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant's health, growth rate,
and yield depends on which of these
[SPEAKER_02]: parameters is its greatest limiting
factor.
[SPEAKER_02]: This concept is called the law of the
minimum and is often depicted by this
[SPEAKER_02]: barrel here leaking water or yield on the
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, you are only as strong as
your weakest link, like the shortest stave
[SPEAKER_02]: in the barrel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for each species of plant,
there are optimum targets and ranges for
[SPEAKER_02]: each of these parameters to maximize the
plant's growth rate and yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these optimum conditions change as the
plant develops, from a young vegetative
[SPEAKER_02]: plant to a mature flowering plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And some of these parameters, the optimum
condition can change on an hourly or
[SPEAKER_02]: minute-by-minute basis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compared to growing plants outdoors or in
greenhouses, a grower's ability to control
[SPEAKER_02]: and optimize these parameters indoors is
exponentially greater, and you can really
[SPEAKER_02]: push plants to their limit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, cannabis is quite an amazing
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: It will grow like a Toyota Camry if you
treat it as such, or it can perform like a
[SPEAKER_02]: V12 Ferrari, depending on how hard you
push it and can dial in and control these
[SPEAKER_02]: parameters.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so much like this law of minimum for
plant growth, the productivity of an
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor facility is determined by its
greatest limiting factor as well,
[SPEAKER_02]: or its most underperforming system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in my experience, the greatest
limiting factor for most indoor facilities
[SPEAKER_02]: today is their mechanical systems,
or their ability to control the
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature and humidity of their rooms.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not very long ago, I would have said the
greatest limiting factor was lighting,
[SPEAKER_02]: but with the advances in LED technology,
I just don't think that's the case
[SPEAKER_02]: anymore, and that the improvement of
mechanical systems presents the greatest
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity to maximize the productivity
of indoor cultivation businesses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is exactly why Inspire was
founded, to develop purpose-built systems
[SPEAKER_02]: and controls that are assets and tools for
growers and not a liability.
[SPEAKER_02]: So to maximize the growth rate of a plant,
we must maximize the rate of two main
[SPEAKER_02]: plant processes, photosynthesis and
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's pretty safe to assume that
most of you are familiar with
[SPEAKER_02]: photosynthesis, the conversion of light
energy into chemical energy in the form of
[SPEAKER_02]: sugar.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to focus a bit on transpiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So transpiration is the movement of water
and nutrients from the roots, through the
[SPEAKER_02]: shoots, and then to the leaves,
where the water then evaporates from the
[SPEAKER_02]: liquid to a gaseous vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: About 97% to 99% of the water a plant
absorbs through its roots is lost through
[SPEAKER_02]: transpiration and gets added to the air as
water vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: So therefore, transpiration is the primary
source of humidity being generated in a
[SPEAKER_02]: sealed grow room that a mechanical system
must remove by dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And transpiration and photosynthesis are
separate processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: But are intrinsically linked, since they
are both regulated by the opening and
[SPEAKER_02]: closing of the stomata, which are little
pores found on the underside of the leaves
[SPEAKER_02]: that have the ability to open or close
depending on the environment, and are
[SPEAKER_02]: where all the gas exchange occurs.
[SPEAKER_02]: So CO2 enters while oxygen and water vapor
escape.
[SPEAKER_02]: As water evaporates from this stomatal
cavity, there is what's called a net
[SPEAKER_02]: cooling effect.
[SPEAKER_02]: As these molecules evaporate, they are
taking heat energy with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the result is a cooler leaf surface
than the air around it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can measure the leaf surface
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if the leaf temperature is cooler than
the air around it, it generally means the
[SPEAKER_02]: plant is actively transpiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, in LED flowering rooms,
the leaf temperature is generally three to
[SPEAKER_02]: five degrees cooler than the air around it
during the lights on period, because of
[SPEAKER_02]: this net cooling effect of transpiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the rate or speed of transpiration can
change.
[SPEAKER_02]: It can be fast, slow, or stop altogether,
depending on pest pathogen pressure,
[SPEAKER_02]: the amount of light, how much water is in
the root zone, if the stomata are open or
[SPEAKER_02]: closed, and the combination of temperature
and relative humidity, or what's called
[SPEAKER_02]: VPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: So transpiration, this process of water
going upwards into the plant, is not going
[SPEAKER_02]: to happen on its own.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's no magical plant pumping mechanism
to force water up through its stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instead, the water is actually drawn up
through the plant by the environment and
[SPEAKER_02]: the vapor pressure deficit around the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: VPD, typically measured in kilopascals,
or KPA, is the pressure the environment
[SPEAKER_02]: places on the leaves to draw water and
nutrients to the upper part of the plant,
[SPEAKER_02]: where it can then escape from the stomata
as a vapor.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think of this VPD pressure like the
pressure you create with your mouth when
[SPEAKER_02]: you are drinking through a straw.
[SPEAKER_02]: Technically speaking, VPD is the
difference between the amount of moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: in the air and how much moisture the air
can hold when it is 100% saturated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can visualize this on what's
called a psychrometric chart, like the one
[SPEAKER_02]: here on the bottom left, by plotting the
room conditions and the leaf temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: and then subtracting the associated vapor
pressures of each condition to get the
[SPEAKER_02]: deficit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's an optimal range for VPD depending
on the stage of growth the plant is in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And generally for cannabis, from
propagation to harvest, we are talking a
[SPEAKER_02]: range of between 0.5 and 1.5 KPA,
shown in that table there in the center.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with a high VPD, the air is really dry
and has lots of room to accept more
[SPEAKER_02]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the water in the stomata will want to
evaporate to an area of lower
[SPEAKER_02]: concentration, and the transpiration rate
and water demand on the plant will
[SPEAKER_02]: increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a low VPD, the air around the leaf is
really humid, and there isn't much
[SPEAKER_02]: pressure being placed on the leaf to
transpire.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the transpiration rate and water demand
decreases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Research shows that the tighter you can
control VPD and reduce fluctuations during
[SPEAKER_02]: a plant's life, the more productive it
will be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And significant yield increases can be
achieved.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the appropriate mechanical systems,
24-7 VPD control is possible and can lead
[SPEAKER_02]: to these significant yield increases.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lastly, there seems to be a lot of
confusion around VPD amongst growers that
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to try and address, and it
surrounds leaf temperature, VPD charts,
[SPEAKER_02]: and getting an accurate VPD measurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in touring facilities, I often see a
VPD chart printed off the internet and
[SPEAKER_02]: taped up to the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grower then checks the temp and
relative humidity from the sensors in
[SPEAKER_02]: their room and uses the chart to figure
out their VPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: The problem with a static chart like that
is they almost always assume that the leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature equals the air temperature,
which we know is not always true given the
[SPEAKER_02]: evaporative cooling effect of
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they get an approximate VPD,
but this can be pretty misleading.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, most growers are not
measuring their leaf temps and factoring
[SPEAKER_02]: it into the equation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's fine if you are in a
greenhouse, for example, where the
[SPEAKER_02]: environment fluctuates so much more on a
daily basis than a modern day indoor grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: that an approximate VPD is good enough.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with the highly optimized indoor grows
with good environmental control,
[SPEAKER_02]: we are pushing these plants' transpiration
rates to the limit, which increases that
[SPEAKER_02]: evaporative cooling effect of
transpiration and drops the leaf temp to a
[SPEAKER_02]: greater degree.
[SPEAKER_02]: So look at these two example calculations.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the bottom, the one on the left assumes
the air temp equals the leaf temperature,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you get a 1.2 VPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the right, the leaf temperature is
factored in at five degrees lower than the
[SPEAKER_02]: air temp, and now you get a VPD of 0.7.
[SPEAKER_02]: So without factoring in leaf temp,
you might think you are providing your
[SPEAKER_02]: plants a good condition for mid-flower,
when in reality, your plants are feeling a
[SPEAKER_02]: VPD more conducive to vegetative growth.
[SPEAKER_02]: A difference of 0.5 is significant in VPD
terms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so somehow this kind of confusion
around using leaf temp or not resulted in
[SPEAKER_02]: the terms air VPD and leaf VPD being
coined, where a VPD does not factor in
[SPEAKER_02]: leaf temp and the LVPD does.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in reality, LVPD is the true VPD and
the true pressure that the plant feels a
[SPEAKER_02]: transpire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I highly suggest all indoor growers
measure leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really quickly, same type of example,
but on a VPD chart.
[SPEAKER_02]: This VPD values on this chart assume leaf
temperature equals air temp, and the blue
[SPEAKER_02]: region is a target range of 1.0 to 1.5.
[SPEAKER_02]: And our example room is sitting at 80
degrees, 60% relative humidity in that red
[SPEAKER_02]: box with a VPD of 1.4.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now look, room is still at 80-60,
but the value is on the VPD chart have
[SPEAKER_02]: been recalculated, taking a negative 5
leaf temp offset into account.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look how the blue region has shifted,
and instead of a 1.4 VPD, we are actually
[SPEAKER_02]: at 0.9.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, just highlighting the importance
for indoor cultivators that leaf temp
[SPEAKER_02]: should be measured and tracked and help
dictate your set points in your room.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, moving on.
[SPEAKER_02]: With indoor growing, we have all these
growth parameters and plant processes
[SPEAKER_02]: going on within a very tightly sealed box,
and this creates a highly dynamic space
[SPEAKER_02]: with a lot of rapid changes to the
environment, particularly flower rooms
[SPEAKER_02]: generate substantial and dynamic loads,
both on a daily basis and over the course
[SPEAKER_02]: of a harvest cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Compare that to an office space or your
home where the conditions are fairly
[SPEAKER_02]: static.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't change that frequently or
dramatically.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to design and operate efficient HVAC
systems, we must understand the dynamics
[SPEAKER_02]: that are happening in these spaces
throughout a harvest cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or left uncontrolled, these drastic
changes in the environment lead to poor
[SPEAKER_02]: plant health, quality and yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing at the end of the day is all about
maintaining balance within the system,
[SPEAKER_02]: within the room, and within the plant
itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: So from a mechanical system point of view,
the water balance in these rooms is
[SPEAKER_02]: particularly challenging to manage
compared to other HVAC applications.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are not many other indoor spaces
that require as much dehumidification as
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor plant environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this graphic highlights just some of
the moisture dynamics that must be
[SPEAKER_02]: considered when designing and sizing the
mechanical system.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a lot going on, but all of this
can be quantified to size the
[SPEAKER_02]: dehumidification requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: By understanding the plant processes and
the variables that affect these dynamics,
[SPEAKER_02]: we can engineer a solution about how to
balance them.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for example, growth phase and plant age
on the upper left.
[SPEAKER_02]: As plants grow and get bigger,
their water demand increases and they
[SPEAKER_02]: transpire greater volumes of water into
the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Transpiration rates can increase almost 40
to 50% over the course of a flowering
[SPEAKER_02]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where variable capacity HVAC
systems with modulating components and the
[SPEAKER_02]: right control sequences become really
important so you don't over cool or dry
[SPEAKER_02]: the space during partial load scenarios.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the middle, the photo period also
affects the moisture dynamics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants transpire a majority of the water
into the air when the lights are on and
[SPEAKER_02]: they are photosynthesizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: In a flower room, about 75% of the
moisture needs to be removed during the
[SPEAKER_02]: lights on period and about 25% during the
lights off period in a given day.
[SPEAKER_02]: The lights on to off and off to on
transition periods are by far the most
[SPEAKER_02]: challenging dynamic shift that a
mechanical system must control.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the lights turn off, the temperature
drops and the relative humidity spikes,
[SPEAKER_02]: which requires an immediate and
significant dehumidification requirement.
[SPEAKER_02]: This spike can be overcome again with
things like variable capacity systems,
[SPEAKER_02]: appropriately sized reheat and purpose
built controls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which are things that come standard and
inspires units.
[SPEAKER_02]: The PPFD or light intensity on the upper
right also greatly affects the moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: dynamics in the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the PPFD increases, the water demand
and transpiration rates increase as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the newer high intensity LED fixtures
today, growers are pushing their PPFD
[SPEAKER_02]: higher and higher to increase yields and
shorten cycle times.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for many years, 1000 to 1200 PPFD in
flower was the standard, but now many
[SPEAKER_02]: growers are designing and building rooms
at 1500 plus PPFD all the way up to 2000
[SPEAKER_02]: and pushing the light limits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you are planning on a high PPFD
strategy, your mechanical systems must be
[SPEAKER_02]: upsized accordingly to handle the higher
transpiration rates or you will not be
[SPEAKER_02]: able to maintain humidity control.
[SPEAKER_02]: So sensible and latent loads are how we
are going to quantify these dynamic needs
[SPEAKER_02]: of an indoor plant environment and
appropriately size an HVAC system for a
[SPEAKER_02]: given room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Inaccurate load calculations lead to
undersized or oversized equipment,
[SPEAKER_02]: which both present challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: For most HVAC applications like offices,
residential homes, or even gymnasiums,
[SPEAKER_02]: there are published standards from
industry organizations that engineers can
[SPEAKER_02]: refer to for guidance when calculating
loads.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, with the the efficiency of the
cannabis industry, no good standards
[SPEAKER_02]: currently exist for indoor plant
environments for engineers to refer to.
[SPEAKER_02]: Luckily, that is going to change ourselves
and a number of other colleagues in this
[SPEAKER_02]: working on this application with industry
organizations are looking to publish those
[SPEAKER_02]: in the coming years.
[SPEAKER_02]: For now, I'd like to go through an example
load calculation and the system selection
[SPEAKER_02]: process to better prepare you for your
next facility build out.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are two types of loads we must
calculate to size a system.
[SPEAKER_02]: The sensible heat load, which dictates our
cooling and heating requirements,
[SPEAKER_02]: and the latent heat load, which gives us
the dehumidification or humidification
[SPEAKER_02]: requirements.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as we go through this example,
keep in mind that I have simplified some
[SPEAKER_02]: of these calculations for the purpose of
this webinar and other variables not shown
[SPEAKER_02]: here are considered when doing this
practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't want to put you all to sleep or
scare you away with too much math.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for this example, we're going to use a
relatively small flower room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sensible loads include anything that
generates heat we can feel within a grow
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Horticultural lighting fixtures account
for 95% or more of the sensible load in
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor plant environments.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other appliance within the space that
uses electricity will also add to the
[SPEAKER_02]: sensible load, such as fans or irrigation
pumps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Many rooms also have standalone
dehumidifiers hung within the space,
[SPEAKER_02]: which generate a lot of waste heat while
dehumidified in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: At Inspire, we design and sell what we
call integrated HVACD systems that
[SPEAKER_02]: incorporate that dehumidification capacity
into the HVAC system, removing the need
[SPEAKER_02]: for standalone dehus in the room,
hence the D in HVACD to emphasize
[SPEAKER_02]: dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Adrian will discuss this in greater
detail in part two of the webinar in a few
[SPEAKER_02]: weeks.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, for this example, we have 32,000 watt
HPS fixtures in our flower room.
[SPEAKER_02]: We calculate the total wattage of all the
fixtures and then convert watts to BTU per
[SPEAKER_02]: hour, which is a measure of energy in the
form of heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we get a large number.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we divide by 1,000 to make it more
manageable to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the result of our sensible load is
109.2 MBH, or what's called mega British
[SPEAKER_02]: thermal.
[SPEAKER_02]: units per hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: MBH is really the most common units.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if we went with the same number of
more efficient LED fixtures at 700 watts
[SPEAKER_02]: and do the same math, we now get a
sensible load of 76.4 MBH, which is a 30%
[SPEAKER_02]: reduction in the sensible load compared to
HPS.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want to use those in my flower room.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're more efficient.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to have a lower operating
expense because of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the latent loads are where an
understanding of plant science,
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation, and room dynamics become
necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: With no published standards, we came up
with this formula inspired to calculate
[SPEAKER_02]: the latent load.
[SPEAKER_02]: The math itself is simple, but inputting
the right values for each of these
[SPEAKER_02]: variables and understanding how they
affect the system sizing is why we built a
[SPEAKER_02]: multidisciplinary team of plant
scientists, cultivators, and engineers and
[SPEAKER_02]: take a collaborative approach with our
customers to understand their cultivation
[SPEAKER_02]: strategies.
[SPEAKER_02]: Establishing an open line of communication
with the cultivators early in the design
[SPEAKER_02]: phase goes a long way in right sizing
these loads and systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: The result of this calculation gives us
the pounds of water per hour moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: removal requirement for a given room.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's important that we target the maximum
latent load that room will generate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over its operational lifespan to future
proof the design and provide the right
[SPEAKER_02]: capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: The most crucial step in this process is
getting an accurate total daily watering
[SPEAKER_02]: rate in gallons per day there at the top.
[SPEAKER_02]: While it's labeled watering rate,
it's better to think of this as the
[SPEAKER_02]: maximum volume of water transpired by the
plants into the air in a day for a given
[SPEAKER_02]: room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Seemingly what you would think as small
changes to this value can result in
[SPEAKER_02]: drastically different unit sizes and costs
at these rooms get bigger and bigger.
[SPEAKER_02]: The total daily watering rate can be
calculated on either a gallons per plant
[SPEAKER_02]: basis or on a gallons per canopy square
foot basis, the total surface area of all
[SPEAKER_02]: the trays in the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: The canopy square foot route is preferred
because once these rolling benches or
[SPEAKER_02]: multi-tiered racks are installed,
it is a fixed variable and doesn't change.
[SPEAKER_02]: While the plant count often changes once
the facility is up and running.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sometimes I've seen it fluctuate by as
much as 15 to 20 percent from the design
[SPEAKER_02]: phase to what's actually being done in the
field.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like the canopy route.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for this example, we have our same
relatively small flower room with 512 feet
[SPEAKER_02]: square feet of canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a 0.26 gallons per square foot.
[SPEAKER_02]: The total watering rate giving us 133
gallons per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Next, we plug that into the equation from
before, and we get a latent load of 69.3
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds per hour of moisture removal
requirement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have that 75 percent moisture
removal during the day we talked about,
[SPEAKER_02]: the 12 hour photo period, and then we use
the 8.33 to convert pounds from gallons to
[SPEAKER_02]: pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can also convert pounds per hour to
MBH like in our sensible load to get 74.8
[SPEAKER_02]: MBH as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is the latent load of our room in
two different units, pounds per hour and
[SPEAKER_02]: MBH.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in summary, this example flower room
has a sensible or cooling load of 76.4 MBH
[SPEAKER_02]: with those LEDs and a latent or
dehumidification load of 74.8 MBH.
[SPEAKER_02]: Engineers would describe this room as
having a sensible heat ratio of 0.51.
[SPEAKER_02]: Meaning 51 percent of the room load
requires cooling and 49 percent requires
[SPEAKER_02]: dehumidification.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most comfort cooling or human centric HVAC
applications have an SHR closer to 0.85.
[SPEAKER_02]: They require almost all cooling capacity
out of the equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a result, almost all HVAC units
today on the market have an SHR of about
[SPEAKER_02]: 0.85 with 85 percent of their total
capacity going to cooling and only some
[SPEAKER_02]: going to dehumidification as a byproduct
of the cooling process.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this SHR here is why we had to design
purpose-built integrated units to serve
[SPEAKER_02]: indoor plant environments because they
really have a different need than most
[SPEAKER_02]: other spaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: The final step in the system selection
process, now that we have the loads
[SPEAKER_02]: calculated, is to find a unit that can
meet the required capacities that we've
[SPEAKER_02]: run in our load calcs at the temperature
and relative humidity conditions that the
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivator is realistically going to run
the room at.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are called the design conditions
during the system selection process and
[SPEAKER_02]: can lead to over undersizing the system as
well.
[SPEAKER_02]: For all HVAC or mechanical systems,
it is easier for them to remove moisture
[SPEAKER_02]: from the air at warmer temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as selection temperature and RH
decrease and room conditions decrease,
[SPEAKER_02]: you need a bigger and larger cooling
capacity unit to meet that load.
[SPEAKER_02]: This table shows an example unit's
moisture removal capacities in pounds per
[SPEAKER_02]: hour at various conditions.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the performance data for this
unit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And from 80 to 70 on the upper left down
to the bottom right to 6550 following that
[SPEAKER_02]: green line, this unit's moisture removal
capacity decreases by 80 percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are significant D rates depending on
the design conditions and the room
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions this equipment's operating in.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at 7555, a reasonable condition to run
a room at, this unit can do 77.4 pounds
[SPEAKER_02]: per hour, which meets our 69.3 pounds per
hour requirement from our example.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this unit would probably be a pretty
good fit at the right design conditions
[SPEAKER_02]: and has the capacity to meet that weight
and load.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, in practice, this is done by software
that has the performance data for every
[SPEAKER_02]: unit at various conditions to find the
best fit for a given load.
[SPEAKER_02]: The design conditions present a delicate
balance between the range of set points or
[SPEAKER_02]: VPD targets a system can achieve and the
overall cost of the system.
[SPEAKER_02]: As the design conditions go up,
the temperature and RH go up, the ability
[SPEAKER_02]: for a system to remove moisture goes up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the required unit size goes down
along with the cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the grower's ability now to hit all
those VPD targets also goes down and you
[SPEAKER_02]: lose some set point flexibility and you
run the risk of undersizing the system and
[SPEAKER_02]: vice versa when it comes to oversizing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lower those design conditions,
lower the moisture removal capacity of
[SPEAKER_02]: equipment gets, bigger the unit and the
connected electrical, structural support
[SPEAKER_02]: required, the costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you get some greater set point
flexibility so you have to find a very
[SPEAKER_02]: good middle ground to balance these
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have the most accurate load calcs
in the world, but with the wrong design
[SPEAKER_02]: conditions, you really run the risk of
increasing the capex and opex for your
[SPEAKER_02]: project or undersizing the system
resulting in poor plant health and yields
[SPEAKER_02]: that are really hard to overcome once the
systems are installed and require a much
[SPEAKER_02]: higher labor cost to manage.
[SPEAKER_02]: The table on the bottom here are design
conditions I recently got from a customer
[SPEAKER_02]: for an LED flower room.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so for the lights on period,
they wanted to be able to hit 7550 minimum
[SPEAKER_02]: and 8565 maximum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as an exercise, I calculated the
sensible latent loads for these rooms and
[SPEAKER_02]: I ran the selection through that software
we talked about at both conditions,
[SPEAKER_02]: both 8565 and 7550.
[SPEAKER_02]: And going from 8565 to 7550, doubled the
size of the system and doubled the cost.
[SPEAKER_02]: So at the end of the day, we settled on a
middle ground of actually 7855 for the
[SPEAKER_02]: design conditions for this room,
which will allow them to hit 7550 at the
[SPEAKER_02]: end of the flowering cycle when they want
to, when transpiration rates have started
[SPEAKER_02]: to subside without blowing up their budget
and getting them too big or too small of a
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that folks is an overview of how
mechanical systems are sized and selected
[SPEAKER_02]: for indoor plant environments and some of
the core plant science concepts to
[SPEAKER_02]: understand.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to just introduce to you some
resources if you're interested in learning
[SPEAKER_02]: more.
[SPEAKER_02]: On the top there are some of my favorite
books and in the middle there are some
[SPEAKER_02]: great industry organizations that are
doing valuable work.
[SPEAKER_02]: We work, at least one person in our
company is involved in one of each of
[SPEAKER_02]: these organizations.
[SPEAKER_02]: I highly recommend checking them out and
coming involved to help push this
[SPEAKER_02]: application forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as well, you can check out the
resources page on our website where
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a number of other webinars and
articles along with some calculators with
[SPEAKER_02]: these formulas plugged into so that you
can play with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that really concludes today's
presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for listening.
[SPEAKER_02]: I hope you learned something today and
found this useful.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to move into some Q&A and
answer some questions before we wrap this
[SPEAKER_02]: up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Adrian's going to join me
during this Q&A session as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's see here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a couple of questions sitting
here in Q&A that I think we can start with
[SPEAKER_00]: that are really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one is, do you have
recommendations, best practices for
[SPEAKER_00]: measuring leaf temperature and
particularly how to do it in a way that
[SPEAKER_00]: feeds into a control system?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Funny enough, I actually have my IR gun
here, which is the manual method of
[SPEAKER_02]: measuring leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is an infrared thermometer for
manual measurements of leaf surface
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: A thing to note about measuring leaf
temperature with a tool like this is every
[SPEAKER_02]: surface out there absorbs radiation at
different rates and reflects it at
[SPEAKER_02]: different rates.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's called emissivity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you get one of these guns,
you want to make sure you get one with
[SPEAKER_02]: adjustable emissivity setting.
[SPEAKER_02]: And an emissivity of 0.97 is conducive to
getting an accurate leaf temperature
[SPEAKER_02]: measurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most plants are between 0.95 and 0.98.
[SPEAKER_02]: And all the research I can found suggests
that a 0.97 emissivity gets you the most
[SPEAKER_02]: accurate measurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I do is you go through a room and
you stand with a gun about 12 inches away
[SPEAKER_02]: from you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm leaving the leaf surface
perpendicularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: That gives you about a one and a half inch
measurement diameter on the leaf surface.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you want to take these measurements at
multiple areas throughout a room to get a
[SPEAKER_02]: statistical average of the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to do that in the middle of the
photo period, like say six hours into a 12
[SPEAKER_02]: hour photo period to get the most
consistent results every day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I average all those measurements
and use it to dictate my set points,
[SPEAKER_02]: how I run my system and what VPD I'm at.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now about integrating in a control system,
there are a lot of ways to do this
[SPEAKER_02]: automatically without a manual
measurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's especially today as these sensors and
the IoT, things has gotten so much
[SPEAKER_02]: cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there are a couple of different
approaches.
[SPEAKER_02]: There are cameras that try and ignore the
ground and the benches and hit only the
[SPEAKER_02]: canopy to get a good measurement at the
right angle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then there are also like leaf calipers
that almost have a little thermistor
[SPEAKER_02]: underneath the leaf to measure the
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can plug a bunch of them in around the
room.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are both ways in which you can
automatically monitor and data log it in a
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, leaf temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my favorite topics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So many cool things you can do with leaf
temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: In fact, I even use it to time my
irrigation events like in P1 events of
[SPEAKER_02]: crop steering.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can sit there and measure leaf temp or
look at your water content in your
[SPEAKER_02]: substrate.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as lights turn on and that starts to
drop, leaf temp drops, water content
[SPEAKER_02]: drops, transpiration has begun,
and you can start irrigating your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and I think related to that question
is, can your leaf VPD change every couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of minutes within a room with a stable
environment?
[SPEAKER_02]: With a stable environment, that's an
important distinction.
[SPEAKER_02]: If the room doesn't have homogenous
airflow, then the leaf temperature will
[SPEAKER_02]: vary throughout a space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Essentially, the faster the airflow a
plant is getting, the more convective
[SPEAKER_02]: buoyancy flux, essentially, and the
transpiration rates will increase.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in areas of stagnant airflow,
you'll typically see higher leaf surface
[SPEAKER_02]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can change, but not that rapidly,
actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the reason being is the plants have
developed these processes to balance
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the leaf temperature is actually
much more stable in a space than the air
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature is because the plants are
using that stomata and transpiration,
[SPEAKER_02]: that cooling effect to balance it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that concept that plants are immobile
organisms, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Humans can get up and run if it's hot or
dry or too cold, but plants have adapted
[SPEAKER_00]: processes that allow them to adapt to the
environment where they are because they
[SPEAKER_00]: can't move.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, they've had to develop these things
like stomata opening and closing to
[SPEAKER_02]: protect themselves in unfavorable
environments where we can just run away.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have my sweater.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you want to – there's one last one on
leaf temperature and just differences
[SPEAKER_01]: between – does it vary between HPS and
LED?
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe there's a good finisher for that
topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So typically because of the infrared
radiation or the radiant heat that these
[SPEAKER_02]: HPS fixtures give off, oftentimes the leaf
temperature can be higher in HPS rooms or
[SPEAKER_02]: the offset be less than in LED spaces.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that is not always consistent
depending on the lighting design and room
[SPEAKER_02]: design.
[SPEAKER_02]: So depending on the mounting height of
those lights, how big the space is,
[SPEAKER_02]: because for example, a colleague of mine,
an engineer, Chris Webb, he has a great
[SPEAKER_02]: saying that the larger the biosphere,
the slower the changes, and the smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: the biosphere, the more rapid the changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so same thing with these leaf
temperature and HPS versus LED.
[SPEAKER_02]: With a bigger space, lights further away,
the environment can kind of balance itself
[SPEAKER_02]: and respond a little bit slower to
environmental changes than in a smaller
[SPEAKER_02]: space.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've seen in rooms with HPS lights,
the leaf temperature be higher than the
[SPEAKER_02]: room conditions, and therefore that's why
a lot of HPS rooms have to run their set
[SPEAKER_02]: points a lot lower to offset that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so one of the big benefits of LEDs is
you can run your rooms a lot warmer and
[SPEAKER_02]: maintain the same leaf temperature,
and it just saves you money on your
[SPEAKER_02]: utility bills every month as well from
your HVAC system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And potentially the capex spend up front
if you don't have to size your systems as
[SPEAKER_00]: aggressively.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those design conditions are more amenable
with LED rooms and HPS to give you that
[SPEAKER_02]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's another good question.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are the advantages, disadvantages of
having single or multiple HVAC unit
[SPEAKER_00]: servicing the same cultivation
environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: You prefer one large unit or multiple
small units and why?
[SPEAKER_00]: I understand this may be dependent on
particular conditions for that space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a really good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm happy to touch on that a bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think Adrian actually in part two in
a few weeks is going to go into greater
[SPEAKER_02]: detail on that question.
[SPEAKER_02]: But really quick, there's pros and cons of
each, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Having multiple units can have a benefit
in terms of redundancy, which is sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: a, what's the right term age?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a 10 plus one.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a subjective term, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: What redundancy means in the cannabis
industry with equipment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so having multiple units can have its
benefit, but it also makes control and
[SPEAKER_02]: compressor staging a little bit more
complicated and it increases the
[SPEAKER_02]: installation cost because you just have
more duct work to run, more power drops,
[SPEAKER_02]: more gas drops, and can make a little bit
more complicated.
[SPEAKER_02]: But with a single unit, you can reduce
some of those costs, but controls become a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit more simplified.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, you might have less units in
terms of redundancy, but a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: redundancy can be built into a single unit
by adding multiple refrigeration circuits.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if one goes down, you still don't lose
all your capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: And a critical part like spare parts on
the shelf just in case like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And regular maintenance.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it really depends.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, it's all a balance between risk
reduction and cost basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you really nailed it there,
Anders.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a wide range and it's really
understanding what does redundancy mean
[SPEAKER_01]: for a particular cultivator or cultivation
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really most importantly first and try to
start there, understand what the budget
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements or restrictions might be
around it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the overall system size and scale
offers the ability to in some,
[SPEAKER_01]: in many ways more inexpensively include
additional points of redundancy into a
[SPEAKER_01]: system than it may on a smaller scale or
with a hydronic type system as an example,
[SPEAKER_01]: compared to individual DX type units,
packaged units, or split systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of different factors to
consider there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it really is us putting on our owner's
hat and our fiduciary hat as if it was our
[SPEAKER_01]: money and working together with both the
design team and the ownership group to
[SPEAKER_01]: really come up with the right solution.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we see a really wide spectrum of ways
to combat redundancy or backup.
[SPEAKER_01]: Risk reduction, risk mitigation really as
it comes to that at the end of the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm really glad Anders you brought up
preventative maintenance and the necessity
[SPEAKER_01]: to maintain these systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: These systems should work and operate as
designed for their useful life all the
[SPEAKER_01]: time, as long as they are well maintained.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just the caveat there that you
really always have to make sure that
[SPEAKER_01]: you're staying in front of.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can't sit and forget it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just like plants, you can't ignore them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to be cared for and serviced and
maintained just like the system serving
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got another good question here on the
dynamics of these spaces and the
[SPEAKER_00]: transition between lights on and lights
off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given the transition from lights on to
lights off is such a great struggle for
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see any reason why it wouldn't help
to dim on and dim off over a period?
[SPEAKER_00]: For instance, the first and last half hour
of the photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the spike in temps are not as severe.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically sun setting and sun rising and
sun setting your lighting fixtures to not
[SPEAKER_02]: have such a dramatic and drastic heat
change or heat gain in the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, again, there's pros and cons
to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: From a mechanical system perspective,
it can be a pro because you are easing
[SPEAKER_02]: that load in and allowing that unit to
catch up a little bit easier in terms of
[SPEAKER_02]: its capacity and ability to its speed to
hit set point.
[SPEAKER_02]: However, from a plant perspective or
optimizing a cultivation perspective,
[SPEAKER_02]: every time you dim your lights,
you're sacrificing the total daily photon
[SPEAKER_02]: uptake of your canopy or what's called the
DLI.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so every time you sacrifice light,
you sacrifice yield essentially by a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've personally, as a cultivator,
never been a phantom sun rising and sun
[SPEAKER_02]: setting my lights.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to go full bore at lights on,
full bore lights off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's if I have the right mechanical
systems.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I just want to maximize that DLI and
total amount of photons that hit my canopy
[SPEAKER_02]: per day.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's situations for all of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: The way I think about it is things like
ramping up and down is a tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so if it requires it, yeah,
use it as a tool, as a grower in your back
[SPEAKER_02]: pocket.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you don't need it and you can maintain
set point, push your plants, push them
[SPEAKER_02]: hard and get that yield.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great, great answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got another one here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a significant heat gain from the
plants that should be considered in the
[SPEAKER_00]: sensible load?
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the sensible calc assumed all light
wattage contributes to the sensible load.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should a factor be applied if a lighting
manufacturer can provide the actual heat
[SPEAKER_00]: given off or just assume worst case
scenario?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so two questions there, both good
ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: H, how about I handle the first one and
you want to handle the second?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: So is there a heat gain from the plants
for the sensible load?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because of the evaporative cooling
effect of transpiration, they actually
[SPEAKER_02]: have a cooling capacity associated with
their canopy when they're transpiring.
[SPEAKER_02]: Plants aren't necessarily generating any
heat.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually cooling the air around
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've actually, as an exercise,
calculated how many square feet of canopy
[SPEAKER_02]: can equate to one ton of cooling capacity,
you know, and given like theoretical maxes
[SPEAKER_02]: and flowering under a transpiration or
1000 PPFD, I think it was between 150 or
[SPEAKER_02]: 200 square feet of flowering canopy at
peak can equate to almost one ton of
[SPEAKER_02]: cooling capacity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, that's more of a instantaneous
thing that will happen and not be
[SPEAKER_02]: consistently cooling the room.
[SPEAKER_02]: But to answer your question, no,
there's no heat gain.
[SPEAKER_02]: If anything, the plants transpiration
rates offset.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, or help the cooling capacity
that's required.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then H, you want to talk about the lights
and the?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, I guess I'm assuming this is
this is sort of suggesting that the
[SPEAKER_01]: drivers would be mounted outside of the
cultivation space in that situation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if that if that is indeed the case,
then we can we can take that take that
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, what are we talking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: 10 to 15 percent potentially of that
overall heat load could be moved outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's important to consider and
make sure that you know that you now need
[SPEAKER_01]: to include that heat load in that
calculation for whatever system is serving
[SPEAKER_01]: that space outside of it, especially if
it's a common hallway corridor,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, interstitial type space or
something that could be open to
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially all of the flower rooms and,
you know, multiple rooms of lighting at
[SPEAKER_01]: the same time.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know that that'll start to add up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it really it is important to make sure
that we focus on what is inside of the
[SPEAKER_01]: space there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if there's there's an opportunity to
take advantage of a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: reduction, then that's something that can
be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and there's also driver losses to be
considered like an LED fixtures and with
[SPEAKER_02]: HPS fixtures, because they're not 100
percent efficient, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so there's a number of ways you can
get that and get it from manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You could try and reach it yourself with,
you know, a micro per joule efficiency.
[SPEAKER_02]: And PPF ratings from cut sheets,
you can start calculating these driver
[SPEAKER_02]: losses.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a thousand watt HPS fixtures,
something like a thousand fifty watts
[SPEAKER_02]: actually in a day or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I forget exactly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, good deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another question here on on equipment
maintenance.
[SPEAKER_00]: What should the maintenance on your
systems look like?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often is it recommended?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are there any special differences between
your systems and regular HVAC rooftop
[SPEAKER_00]: units?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a that's a really great
question.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can jump on that one if you like,
Anders.
[SPEAKER_01]: In general, technicians that know and
understand and refrigeration systems in
[SPEAKER_01]: packaged systems or split systems,
particularly that have hot gas reheat in
[SPEAKER_01]: them and modulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as far as, you know, modulating
compressors, modulating hot gas reheat
[SPEAKER_01]: valves, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Obviously, that that expertise really is
required.
[SPEAKER_01]: In order, you know, to would use that as
sort of some of the early criteria when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're vetting a particular maintenance
contractor.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outside of that, of making sure that you
that you choose the right contractor or
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody that has experience working on
that type of equipment, the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: that we really find.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not a whole lot of things that are
so different in general.
[SPEAKER_01]: I feel like outside of the frequency that
you would want to be involved there,
[SPEAKER_01]: particularly at the beginning of the
facility startup and really understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: and making sure that the systems are
closely monitored and maintained during
[SPEAKER_01]: what would be typical commissioning type
process pre first run.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then really, you know, sort of a
confirmation and almost a recommissioning
[SPEAKER_01]: or retro commissioning of that system to
make sure that through that first run and
[SPEAKER_01]: once you plan for the second run,
your system is still operating the way
[SPEAKER_01]: that it was designed and set up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a particular item that we see often is
filters loading much quicker than
[SPEAKER_01]: anticipated or not changing out filters
from the construction and having a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: construction dust, clogging filters and
not, you know, not understanding why we're
[SPEAKER_01]: not getting full capacity out of the
systems, you know, near near the beginning
[SPEAKER_01]: of that first flower run or halfway
through the first run.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first flower run as they continue to
load up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are those are some of the
particular things that we really see often
[SPEAKER_01]: that would be important to follow through
with and focus on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think, you know, in general,
you know, most most preventative
[SPEAKER_01]: maintenance service agreements are
typically four times a year, like
[SPEAKER_01]: quarterly type maintenance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I would expand that to every
other month or once a month, at least for
[SPEAKER_01]: the first six months to really use it as a
way to get to know your service provider,
[SPEAKER_01]: have the service provider get to know you
and your facility and your operation and
[SPEAKER_01]: your particular cycle and needs both
during cycles and in between cycles and to
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure that they know if there's
anything that needs to be done,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it be any sort of warranty work or
repair work that needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll know exactly when that can be done
and can be scheduled in between runs in
[SPEAKER_01]: advance so that everybody's coordinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are the sort of things that we find
really, really helpful.
[SPEAKER_02]: One last note there on that question is
another another good opportunity to
[SPEAKER_02]: service equipment or good reason to is if
you're operating air-cooled DX equipment
[SPEAKER_02]: in northern climates or very cold climates
with this equipment being outside,
[SPEAKER_02]: like if it's a packaged DX, you know,
air-cooled system and you're going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: operating that in low ambient conditions
during the winter, just it would be a good
[SPEAKER_02]: opportunity to service and make sure that
everything is operating, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: up to spec before you enter those cold
climate months.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a great point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, from a seasonal perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, another operating situation is
like large scale curing, drying and curing
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially that may happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, if you have more of a seasonal
business where the systems aren't running
[SPEAKER_01]: all of the year, it's really important to
do sort of a, you know, a particular focus
[SPEAKER_01]: pre, you know, operation for the season
and then somewhat of a decommissioning of
[SPEAKER_01]: the system and maintenance after the
season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then, you know, again, be able to
repeat that cycle the following year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also choose a good contractor,
a good experienced contractor with the
[SPEAKER_00]: track record in commercial industrial
trades.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so critical to the operation of your
HVAC systems, particularly the way that
[SPEAKER_00]: they were installed and the quality of the
duct work and reducing the static pressure
[SPEAKER_00]: along those duct runs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen good and we've seen bad and
it can have a very, it can play a very
[SPEAKER_00]: critical role in the performance of your
facility, even if the HVAC units are
[SPEAKER_00]: right-sized.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really great, really great
points.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's, you know, that design is
perfect on paper until you get it out and
[SPEAKER_01]: install it out in the field, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you got to make sure you maintain
those standards.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a great network of service
technicians and service companies across
[SPEAKER_01]: the country that we'd be happy to refer
partners to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's an interesting one.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your team's perspective on how
standalone dehumidifiers slash split
[SPEAKER_00]: systems measure the room temp in RH?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how does that impact the grower's
perspective on how the room is operating?
[SPEAKER_02]: Stainless dehumidifiers and split systems
measure the room temp.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think another way you could think of
that is regardless of the type of system
[SPEAKER_02]: measuring a room, I think what you're
trying to get at is how does the accuracy
[SPEAKER_02]: of a sensor, the quantity of the sensors
in that room and the placement of sensors
[SPEAKER_02]: affect a grower's perspective on how the
room is operating?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is a very important, a very good
question and a very important point.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you have a single sensor hung in the
middle of the room and you're operating,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, thousands of canopy square feet
off that, you're not going to have a very
[SPEAKER_02]: good statistically significant picture of
what's going on in the space.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ideally you want to have sensors within
the canopy that are protected from the
[SPEAKER_02]: radiation influences of the lighting
fixtures and protected from moisture or
[SPEAKER_02]: damage from staff and aren't completely
surrounded by wet plant material.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want a representative picture of what
the plants are actually feeling.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as close to the canopy as possible to
get an accurate measurement.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then having a number of those
throughout a room so they can get an
[SPEAKER_02]: average and run your systems at is much
better than operating off of, say,
[SPEAKER_02]: a thermostat that's built into a mini
split hung up on the side of the wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the conditions on the side of the
wall are not what I'm trying to control.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to control the canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where I want my sensors to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also if those sensors are skewed and
not near the canopy, then we're not going
[SPEAKER_02]: to get an accurate VPD calculation at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so getting those good averages from
the room conditions as well as the leaf
[SPEAKER_02]: temperature and the space will get you the
most accurate VPD calculation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also having sensors that are
calibrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, we use like NIST.
[SPEAKER_02]: Were they like NIST calibrated handhelds,
you know, these like calibrate every
[SPEAKER_02]: sensor and, you know, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's very important to you're only as
good as the data you collect and measure,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, and if you're not getting good
data, then you're making bad decisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: I actually think a lot of growers
perceptions on how they were operating
[SPEAKER_02]: rooms 10 years ago, like myself,
were skewed based on that information.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I think we thought we were running a
room a certain way, but in reality was a
[SPEAKER_02]: way different condition than we realized
because we didn't you know, back even 10
[SPEAKER_02]: years ago, sensors and controls were
significantly more expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now with them being more affordable,
we can get better and more information
[SPEAKER_02]: cheaper and get better results.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's really, really exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: What what the innovation is going on on
that side of it and the ability to ability
[SPEAKER_01]: to get accurate data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between the reading from a
thermostat on the wall versus a
[SPEAKER_00]: temperature sensor in the canopy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll read and throughout your space.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's more things that we'll
touch on in part two around, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: sensor density and the data as well as
airflow through the space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, there's really,
you know, outside of going through and
[SPEAKER_01]: checking on your own periodically,
you know, you don't have a way to know how
[SPEAKER_01]: homogeneous that canopy is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to thank everybody for attending.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today and all of the interactive,
excellent thought provoking questions that
[SPEAKER_00]: came up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, Anders and Adrian, thank you
for participating and for presenting
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really appreciate your attention and for
joining us today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
Thank you.
