[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Mr. Soul, creator of Cinderella 99 and
the founder of Brothers Grim Seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Rick, we were talking about basically the
Rosetta Stone and how you had first
[SPEAKER_02]: achieved getting it and kind of,
would you like to talk more about that
[SPEAKER_02]: story?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I think it's a good one because when
people see that it's popular now,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's been in the news and highly rated
like that, you want to know more about it,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And another interesting wrinkle to the
whole story was back when Brothers Grim
[SPEAKER_03]: first started in the late 90s,
around 2000, I think it was.
[SPEAKER_03]: I released a Rosetta Stone, but it was a
different formula, but I love the name so
[SPEAKER_03]: much and I found the new combination that
I put together this time to be something
[SPEAKER_03]: that I thought would eclipse the old
version and people would just forget about
[SPEAKER_03]: that one and say, or maybe never have
heard of it, you know, because it's been
[SPEAKER_03]: such a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, the old version did make it into the
big book of buds and for a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: connoisseurs in the early ages,
that was a biblical standpoint for
[SPEAKER_02]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it definitely turned some heads.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that was one of the sisters that
came from the bud of Jack Herrer from
[SPEAKER_03]: Amsterdam where Princess and Genius came
from and there was a third female that I
[SPEAKER_03]: called Cafe Girl and she had a ginger ale
flavor and so that Rosetta Stone original
[SPEAKER_03]: combination had that type of a profile and
people liked it apparently more than I
[SPEAKER_03]: ever realized and so when I created the
new version of Rosetta Stone, I liked
[SPEAKER_03]: this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I reputedly have the Jack Herrer's
original cut that was presented to him of
[SPEAKER_03]: the Jack Herrer strain from Sensei Seed
Bank and Ben Dronker supposedly gave this
[SPEAKER_03]: cut to Jack Herrer himself and so I love
that female and crossed it to my best
[SPEAKER_03]: Cinderella 99 reversed and so we have a
feminized Rosetta Stone now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We also do it in the regular, but that's
how that came about and it's an amazing
[SPEAKER_03]: improvement upon the parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I really like to think that
whenever I put a seed line out,
[SPEAKER_03]: if something that isn't just the same as
one of the parents, it has to be an
[SPEAKER_03]: improvement.
[SPEAKER_03]: It has to have some reason for being and
so in the case of Rosetta Stone,
[SPEAKER_03]: I have, if you could kind of put it in a
nutshell to say it's Jack Herrer flavor
[SPEAKER_03]: and high, but in a much bigger yielding,
faster flowering, more stable,
[SPEAKER_03]: if you will, in other words, more uniform
plants come out of every pack of seeds
[SPEAKER_03]: than you would ever expect from a real,
the old school Jack Herrer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's what I've been doing lately.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I did recently grow the Cindy 99 and
I was very impressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: People are still coming back to me all the
time, of course, and I never will tire of
[SPEAKER_03]: hearing the stories, old and new,
of people who say, you know, I'd always
[SPEAKER_03]: heard about Cinderella 99.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it's available again.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it the same and how did you do it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, I have to answer all those
kinds of questions and explain to people
[SPEAKER_03]: and you and I have talked about how by
still having the original clone of
[SPEAKER_03]: Princess that that's the mother that
creates the seeds and we were talking
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier about when you create a seed line
that really works, you should maintain
[SPEAKER_03]: that same mother and father and use them
over and over as like a formula to create
[SPEAKER_03]: that seed or a recipe that a chef would
use or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: And some people get a little confused with
breeding and they think that, well,
[SPEAKER_03]: those seeds were great, you know,
and I want more of them and maybe I should
[SPEAKER_03]: cross a brother or sister from those
seeds, but that's not the same thing as
[SPEAKER_03]: going back and breeding those seeds from
the original parents.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what I did to recreate Cinderella 99 is
having that original female, not having
[SPEAKER_03]: the original male, but having the seed
pack that the original male came from and
[SPEAKER_03]: then regrowing them and finding a new male
that would be a brother of the original
[SPEAKER_03]: one is not a very big difference.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the end, I feel that the Cinderella
99 today just stands up every bit as good
[SPEAKER_03]: as the old one did because they're
virtually identical.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I love to get that feedback
from people that they will say,
[SPEAKER_03]: wow, I didn't think that after all this
time it would be possible to recreate a
[SPEAKER_03]: seed line and, you know, done right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's very possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've seen that around the industry,
too, especially with a lot of reputable
[SPEAKER_02]: breeders with their older genetics not
producing the same quality for different
[SPEAKER_02]: phenos.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're actually coming out to 30,
40, all kinds of different numbers that
[SPEAKER_02]: have just destabilized not necessarily
their brand, but definitely that genome.
[SPEAKER_03]: The uniformity of the plants you're
getting out of a pack of seeds is
[SPEAKER_03]: influenced a lot by the variability on
both parents' sides, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then it just makes more of a lottery
ticket out of each seed that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: getting because all those genetic
possibilities coming together creates
[SPEAKER_03]: variability.
[SPEAKER_03]: But by having parents that are the same as
well as not having a lot of variability in
[SPEAKER_03]: their own gene backgrounds, you know,
you're going to really ensure that you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get the same thing every time
reliably, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Which might not be that important to some
people because there are a lot of people
[SPEAKER_03]: who believe like, oh, I like to buy a
bunch of seeds and have an atheno hunt and
[SPEAKER_03]: look for something special out of that
group.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, nothing wrong with that if that's
your goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: But many people are really serious minded
professionals coming into this and saying,
[SPEAKER_03]: well, I want to grow a crop and I don't
want to have to try and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: do a lot of guesswork or testing before I
find the plant that I'm going to reproduce
[SPEAKER_03]: and clone and make for production.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they would like to be able to say,
isn't there a reputable place where I
[SPEAKER_03]: could buy packs of seeds where they're
going to perform as advertised on the
[SPEAKER_03]: description on the pack, you know,
and I can count on, you know, nearly all
[SPEAKER_03]: the females being the exact same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I try to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's what I have on the
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why my menu consists of maybe
what?
[SPEAKER_03]: Eight strains is 12 if you count the
feminized versions of the regulars or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like that, because I feel
keeping control over a smaller menu of
[SPEAKER_03]: strains is a lot smarter than trying to
keep up with fads and whatever's popular
[SPEAKER_03]: now and chasing that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have heard of a they call it the
hedgehog effect or the hedgehog principle
[SPEAKER_03]: that a hedgehog has only like one defense,
but it's a perfect defense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you have that one thing that
you do really well, concentrate on that,
[SPEAKER_03]: specialize in that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, well, I like the way that you do that,
because ultimately with that kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: destabilization, we see a lot of limits
hitting the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, that's almost a lazy man's
breed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in a sense, you'll get great things
out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not all always that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if that's your business, then
ultimately, if you're a one and done,
[SPEAKER_02]: there's no real art to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: The real artistry in breeder ships comes
to the long term stabilization and the
[SPEAKER_02]: recreation of your genetic to make it a
timeless genetic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what we see with you that I've
really enjoyed.
[SPEAKER_02]: When we've cracked the Cindy 99s,
I saw three different phenos out of 20
[SPEAKER_02]: seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you expect out of a
regular seed pack.
[SPEAKER_02]: Back in 1995, 1998.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, these are things we don't see in
today's market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing that's important about
when you do have slight variations in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Cinderella 99s that it's really not
anything that's a major trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's usually like, oh, some color like
this one got a little more purple and this
[SPEAKER_03]: one didn't.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, big deal.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you tell the difference when you smoke
it?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so I'm pragmatic, I guess.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I would say like the things that are
most important, the potency, the resin
[SPEAKER_03]: production, you know, the flavor,
the yield, all of those things should be a
[SPEAKER_03]: really tight grouping.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then if there's like, OK, this one had
a little more color of this or color,
[SPEAKER_03]: who cares?
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a guy write me.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a funny story.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had an email from a guy who said,
I really question whether these Cinderella
[SPEAKER_03]: 99 seeds that I got from this distributor
are real because he's still in veg.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mind you, you know, he hasn't even
flowered the plants and already he's
[SPEAKER_03]: convinced this can't be real.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cinderella 99.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the leaf serrations on the edges
of the leaves didn't look the way he
[SPEAKER_03]: remembered them from the last time,
which was like over 10 years ago or
[SPEAKER_03]: something like, you know, A, your memory
is probably faulty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And even if you had a photograph of it,
nobody breeds for leaf serration
[SPEAKER_03]: uniformity.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that might vary all over the
place.
[SPEAKER_02]: It might hold genetic traits, but it's not
necessarily your goal in breeding for that
[SPEAKER_03]: trait.
[SPEAKER_03]: It doesn't prove, you know, that it's one
thing or another.
[SPEAKER_03]: When the breeder has concentrated on
creating finished flowers of a certain
[SPEAKER_03]: quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is Kanekon.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that was actually pretty cool to have
him pop in like that and drop a little
[SPEAKER_03]: reality on a reality TV effect on the
whole interview.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, what was I saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: That just made me.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were basically talking about the
phenotyping and how important it is that
[SPEAKER_02]: there's not much variance, because when I
did say that I had the three different
[SPEAKER_02]: phenos, I had 18 females.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, mind you, and what slight differences
were those three phenos?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like one was a little more chunky and
one was a little more triangular with the
[SPEAKER_02]: bud formation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, they could have sat in
the same bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: They had a very similar odor and they were
very, very subtle.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I mean, like single percentage changes
on the readout.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is what I'm trying to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was what my point was earlier when I
lost track of what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the really important characteristics
stay true throughout all the females you
[SPEAKER_03]: get from a pack of seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what I take pride in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I try to do in all of my strains is
give people something that where you buy
[SPEAKER_03]: the pack of seeds, it's a uniform result
that it's as advertised on the description
[SPEAKER_03]: on the pack.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a place for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, what it is is really translating the
old ways to the new days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really a big important thing
that we don't have going forward.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a lot of people getting into
this game without we'll call it an under
[SPEAKER_02]: education of what they're truly dealing
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even have an association to
plants as people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of these these folks.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that is really the biggest kind of
connection to genetics that I found when I
[SPEAKER_02]: can sit here and say these two parents
have kids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yes, these kids all look alike.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if the mother goes and has a child
with somebody else, that kid may look
[SPEAKER_02]: completely different.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that goes back to what Rick was saying
about making sure that the cross breeding
[SPEAKER_02]: goes back to the original parents,
because with that, the consistency of the
[SPEAKER_02]: genetic can stay more true over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be totally direct, it's one of the
only real safe lines in this industry that
[SPEAKER_02]: is of a more naturalized methodology to
get that consistency and to be totally
[SPEAKER_02]: direct.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more natural we can remain in this,
the more healthy it remains as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a great respect for the way that
Rick does his genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's one of the reasons I'm a longtime
runner up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm really looking for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so a lot of my terpene inductions have
been kind of moving into the higher THC
[SPEAKER_02]: strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things that you'll see in a lot
of the 30 percent plus strains is,
[SPEAKER_02]: yes, they're 30 plus.
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll knock you on the floor,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're going to have a very waxy,
overtone in most of these strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very rare to get one over 30 with
strong terps.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's kind of something that we've
been working on breeding in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's been a project of mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to be honest, I'm not sure of the
limitations yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's it's been an exciting adventure.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a very ambitious and bold thing to
be diving into.
[SPEAKER_03]: So kudos to you to be even trying that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that just touching back on I
don't want to make this all about,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, Mr. Soul and his strains are,
you know, the best thing or anything like
[SPEAKER_03]: that, because in fact, what's happening
currently with this wave of lots of
[SPEAKER_03]: variety and different hybrids and so on is
that it exposes all the possibilities
[SPEAKER_03]: there are in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe the person who created the
strain, if he's humble and honest with
[SPEAKER_03]: himself, says, you know, hey, I'm a great
reader, but I lucked into something,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I lucked into something at the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I still like me to learn more and work
harder over the next few years and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the benefit to the public that's out
there that's now coming into this and
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, well, hey, I have a choice.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can go with like the gentleman said
earlier, agricultural standardized kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: mentality for buying seeds, where you get
what is advertised and expect to get,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, uniformity in the seeds that you
grow and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's this other opportunity or
a possibility that's out there for people
[SPEAKER_03]: to say, hey, I could also go for the grab
bag, you know, like, who knows what I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: going to get?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it might be wonderful.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I see a lot of strange stuff come up
and very little really makes me sit back
[SPEAKER_03]: and take notice and say, all right,
that's something I'd really want to know
[SPEAKER_03]: more about.
[SPEAKER_03]: But people know in the past year or so,
I've gotten interested in the Mac from
[SPEAKER_03]: Capulator.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I really think that that's in all of
my 30 some years or whatever in this
[SPEAKER_03]: business.
[SPEAKER_03]: It stands out in a way that I see sit up
and take notice.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's not many that do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it really.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why?
[SPEAKER_03]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the great follow up.
[SPEAKER_03]: The terpenes, the aromas from it are
really unique and different and very,
[SPEAKER_03]: to me, desirable.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are strains like Gorilla Glue that,
you know, you'll never forget Gorilla Glue
[SPEAKER_03]: after you smell it once.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's a really amazing, heavy hitting
strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I call it a heavy strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: It makes me sleepy and knocks me out.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a couch lock kind of smoke.
[SPEAKER_03]: Josie Wales and the group from Gigi,
they call themselves Gigi Strains now,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a heavy strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the aroma to me is so gassy and heavy
that I wouldn't want to have that all the
[SPEAKER_03]: time, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the thing with the Terpy
Strains is they're a double edged sword
[SPEAKER_02]: because they will mark you for life.
[SPEAKER_02]: But you can't sell them every day or can
ingest them every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find it a little, yeah, almost heavy
handed, a little over overpowering.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that Mac, maybe I'm a sucker for like
subtleties and lots of the notes in my
[SPEAKER_03]: nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, wow, what is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I can't quite put my finger on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's how this Mac strain strikes me
in terms of my nose.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about like, wow, what is that?
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like I sense something familiar,
but I can't quite put my finger on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've called it like Play-Doh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like when you were a kid and you open up a
new jar of Play-Doh, it's got that strange
[SPEAKER_03]: salty kind of bicarbonate smell.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, but also with like a floral fruity
thing going through it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, it's just so sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not going to lie.
[SPEAKER_02]: There was a time when I grew up where I
ate Play-Doh.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there are happy tones to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I didn't mean to make it sound bad by
saying that because... No, I think
[SPEAKER_03]: Play-Doh is a great, as I recall,
it was a lovely aroma.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anyway, so your question was,
what about the Mac attracts you so much?
[SPEAKER_03]: The aroma is just to die.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the plant itself, when it's
growing, it grows rock hard nugs that are
[SPEAKER_03]: both like sparkly with resin, as well as
like purple splashes come out and it
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers a little long.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's probably 65 to 70 day, you know,
but that's not exceptionally long either
[SPEAKER_03]: for what you get.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the yield is so amazing in the sense
that the buds are so dense that when you
[SPEAKER_03]: harvest the cola that is of a certain
length and diameter and you compare that
[SPEAKER_03]: to the same another cola of a different
strain of the same length and diameter,
[SPEAKER_03]: the density on the Mac is so much greater.
[SPEAKER_03]: It'll weigh, for example, I usually dry
cure and trim my weed and put it in mason
[SPEAKER_03]: jars, as many people do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you'll weigh the mason jar when
it's completely full.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a typical jar is like 60 grams when
it's full.
[SPEAKER_03]: The Mac, I've had it hit like 90 grams
when a jar is full.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half again.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, 50% greater because to go from 60 to
90, you have to take 50% of 60 and add to
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's a 50% increase in density over a
typical strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that pays you back big time on your
investment of having grown it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when it hits the shelf and it's
weighed and sold, you've got gold there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And add that to the fact that it looks
super desirable and smells super
[SPEAKER_03]: desirable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the high is sublime and lovely.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not a sleepy high.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not like an energetic, I just drank
two shots of espresso.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have the Durbin Tie and that's what I
use for Durbin Tie C99.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one, if you smoke the pure Durbin
Tie, it's like you just shot of espresso
[SPEAKER_03]: and you're running around waxing the
ceilings.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's where the raciness comes
from.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, you know, I always I say my Cindy 99
is really nice and heady, but it's also
[SPEAKER_02]: like a really wonky cup of coffee.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it's one of my favorite
daytime smokes as a result.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cinderella 99 was always known for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in those days, you didn't find
too many strains where it gave you that up
[SPEAKER_03]: high and the energy boost.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that definitely is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, back then, they were also associated
with being lower THC volumes when they
[SPEAKER_02]: gave you that feeling, which today's
market actually and with the help of your
[SPEAKER_02]: breeding techniques have kind of
astoundably changed that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Resin production, the expectation for a
resin production is so much of a higher
[SPEAKER_03]: bar now.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's been raised a lot from the
days like the 90s or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But Cinderella, it's funny, I've seen some
really great posts where people go,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's nothing outdated about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that was one of the cutest
things they could say.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I should get back to the booth because
there's people sure sure they're coming to
[SPEAKER_03]: buy seeds and I'd like to be there for
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
