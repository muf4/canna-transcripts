[SPEAKER_01]: Alright, well we're here with Lindsey from
Aloha Humboldt and we're going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: talking with her today about her farm and
what makes her flowers unique.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hi Lindsey.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi Russell.
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it going?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Excellent, glad to hear it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe tell us a little bit about your
background and how you got into cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: at first.
[SPEAKER_01]: How did that start?
[SPEAKER_02]: I got into cannabis when I was 16.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a great way to break the ice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Growing up in southwest Michigan we had a
lot of great cultivars, some that we still
[SPEAKER_02]: run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bubble gum was one of the first things
that I was able to see when I was 16 and I
[SPEAKER_02]: was really just in love with the plant
from a young age.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you came out to Humboldt, started Aloha
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_02]: Kind of started more indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Ryan and I moved in 2002 and we were in
Arcata for a year and we did like six
[SPEAKER_02]: octagons in a basement and maxed out the
bedrooms upstairs and then you know
[SPEAKER_02]: classic Humboldt grow in 2002.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then we moved to another spot that had a
basement in Eureka and then in 2008 we
[SPEAKER_02]: moved to Willow Creek.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys have been in Humboldt for 20
years and you've been in Willow Creek now
[SPEAKER_01]: since 2008 so that's 14 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah so you've been doing out you know
learning how that environment works for a
[SPEAKER_01]: while now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah in 2008 we put out like the 99 that
we were allowed underneath 215 but we had
[SPEAKER_02]: smaller pots so it was like 45 gallons and
then we sized up to 100 gallon smart pots
[SPEAKER_02]: and then transitioned into having some
beds and greenhouses and started doing
[SPEAKER_02]: depth.
[SPEAKER_02]: We kind of held back on doing light depth
because it meant that you didn't get to go
[SPEAKER_02]: to the river as much because you had to be
at home in the evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we were in the valley close to the
river and so the climate was really
[SPEAKER_02]: drastically different from where we're at
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then we got the property in 2016
anticipating the rec market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We knew that we wouldn't be able to afford
agricultural land so we just went for
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever we could get which was a 141 acre
parcel of TPZ land that we converted and I
[SPEAKER_02]: did a bunch of remediation on and we're at
2600 feet now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Interesting 2600 feet elevation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes that's pretty high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean transitioning into that I mean
what makes so your farm is pretty unique
[SPEAKER_01]: because you've developed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was TPZ land.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've obviously done a lot of work with
just ecological repair.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot a lot of work with ecological
repair.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the farm has been was cultivated on
since the 80s and it was kind of just like
[SPEAKER_02]: they put in the different flats when they
were doing the logging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they were logging flats and then there
were old school dugout greenhouses that
[SPEAKER_02]: were put in because they're a lot easier
to be hidden from the helicopters.
[SPEAKER_02]: So really low profile, easy to pull tarps,
terrible for canopy.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the ones we have we have like 11
different cultivation zones on our
[SPEAKER_02]: property so instead of having just one big
flat where we have greenhouses we actually
[SPEAKER_02]: have you know six different areas that are
then pieced out and our lower flat we did
[SPEAKER_02]: three greenhouse removals and fixed a rock
slide and did a lot of environmental
[SPEAKER_02]: cleanup down there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like in your farm you've
incorporated any interesting methodologies
[SPEAKER_01]: you know that would you know tend to give
your flower some type of interesting
[SPEAKER_01]: quality?
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well over the course of just getting to
know the plant more and being outside like
[SPEAKER_02]: I said we were in smart pots for a long
time and then realized that we really
[SPEAKER_02]: needed to just have all of our roots in
the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we transitioned to having everything
out of smart pots.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's in raised beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've been doing some level of you
know intercropping or companion planting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you feel like what do you have any you
know?
[SPEAKER_01]: We love cover crops.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well and then you're one of the experts on
IPM you know so we get to you know work
[SPEAKER_02]: together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we've been doing cover crops since you
know 2010 we would even do them in our
[SPEAKER_02]: smart pots and it's a lot more work but
you get a lot more biodiversity and the
[SPEAKER_02]: plants are a lot healthier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah the soil building process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah it really helps that organic matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just year after year it's like the plants
deplete the organic matter and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to rebuild it and cover crops help
with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah it just is one of the things that we
learned from friends and that's the great
[SPEAKER_02]: thing about our community and the Willow
Creek Cannabis Alliance is because we get
[SPEAKER_02]: to do a lot of exchange of knowledge see
what's working what's not in genetics and
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivation practices.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well speaking of genetics well you got
them over there?
[SPEAKER_02]: I do yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well here we have our apple fritter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then a couple of collaborations we did
with cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got the London pound cake and cake
mix but half of our product that we grew
[SPEAKER_02]: for them we decided to put in our own
packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now can I crack this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah please.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are pre-rolls they're you know a
little bit more desirable right now in the
[SPEAKER_02]: market because it's a lower price point
and you know that's good.
That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just ready you can just take it
to the beach.
[SPEAKER_02]: These have really similar terpene
profiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the beta karyophylline linalool and
humuline and then the other one has just
[SPEAKER_02]: got the humuline and limonene.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's this is what I'm smoking is apple
fritter a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's one of my favorites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice yeah yeah it seems like it's I've
heard it's pretty decent yielder.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah it's really dense.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got a spicy earthy tone something
that I'm really into.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that tone.
[SPEAKER_02]: What else do we have here?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep this is another jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah I'll check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was like looking at different jars.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you think do you have any you know
interesting techniques you know obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: growing is half the battle and almost
harvesting and drying is the other half.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have any interesting you know
things you do to try to help preserve
[SPEAKER_01]: terpene?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah we like to make sure that our room
always stays really cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even in the summer when we're running our
light up we run air conditioners in our
[SPEAKER_02]: drying rooms to make sure that it's you
know climate controlled system.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't let it get back over you know a
high humidity once we pull it.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is London pound cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so good thanks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah that's a favorite for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really similar terpene profiles but that
one's got a little bit more lemon right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow yeah it really it really pops.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow it's like really pretty and fluffy
and like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It turned really nice and purple this year
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know as far as different cultivation
methodologies we do a pretty extensive
[SPEAKER_02]: prune.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're cutting back a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: We still incorporate super cropping which
is you know just a method of twisting the
[SPEAKER_02]: stem and I really enjoy doing foliar feeds
on the plants these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: I could smell this all day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It smells good.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like it's weird it's almost like a
London pound cake like the name actually
[SPEAKER_01]: reflects.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a really it's like a dessert smell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah well that's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have some of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah yeah I know I definitely so wow and
these these so you've these are the
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you is there a place where people
can buy these or would you do a normal
[SPEAKER_01]: wholesale or.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah well you know for people that are
looking to carry it in their shop we do
[SPEAKER_02]: our distribution through up north
distribution and statewide and we actually
[SPEAKER_02]: have around 240 dispensaries that carry
our product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Off and on.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Almost every place in Humboldt carries us
as far down as San Diego area and actually
[SPEAKER_02]: the Bay Area is really supportive and I
was really surprised Sacramento smokes a
[SPEAKER_02]: lot of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good sign especially for the
small farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well speaking about the small farmer I
mean you know we're dealing with a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: corporate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to balance balance that very
carefully.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have anything specifically you
would like to talk about your product that
[SPEAKER_01]: stands out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what makes your product different
than corporate cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that a lot of it is to do with the
way it's grown and the intention that's
[SPEAKER_02]: put into it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know that's not measurable in
numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we talk a lot about THC and the
different cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really important too.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think there is a real energetic
exchange between the farmer and the plant
[SPEAKER_02]: that can then carry over to the end
product and experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that as the market matures we'll
talk more about the experience and less
[SPEAKER_02]: about just the numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it makes a big difference how
it actually makes you feel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think in you know the 90s and early
2000s people were more interested in
[SPEAKER_02]: smoking the herb and experiencing it
before purchasing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know now we can't smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We can't.
[SPEAKER_02]: The nose knows.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I just think that it's a miss to not be
able to have your consumers smell the
[SPEAKER_02]: flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: And understand what is going to work with
their chemistry.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think there's a lot of knowledge in that
that's being lost.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to see that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's a good change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kind of went into that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if I had to ask you any other changes
you'd like to see like a specific thing if
[SPEAKER_01]: you could change one thing about
regulations or education what would be the
[SPEAKER_01]: positive outcome you'd like to see happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I love wine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I think about how Ryan and I
used to try to travel and go down to Dry
[SPEAKER_02]: Creek specifically for their Zinfandel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that something that could be
really exciting for people that love wine
[SPEAKER_02]: and food would be to find a way to say you
know well in Willow Creek the expression
[SPEAKER_02]: of the terpenes that are more like gassy
and spicy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those really stand out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that those more hearty terpenes
are going to be able to withstand our
[SPEAKER_02]: diurnal swing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we've got really really hot days.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really really cold nights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it takes a hearty plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll have a huge swing in temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so our climate only really allows for
the most hearty plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a rugged community.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you think like in terms of like having
the ability to like to basically direct to
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer sales where people can come visit
the farm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Experience the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that cannabis farmers should have
all of the same allowances that people
[SPEAKER_02]: that make wine do and craft brewers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also think that a big huge thing that
would help is a way to mitigate taxes for
[SPEAKER_02]: craft producers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we can't compete at a commodity scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we can compete in quality and
experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if we're able to have the first
thousand pounds have a tax rebate in Q1.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know that way people that are selling
bulk then when they need to plan for the
[SPEAKER_02]: year they have a return of funds.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that that would be a wonderful way
to do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or if they wanted to just remove those
taxes right away for us.
[SPEAKER_02]: That would be fine with me too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you sure you don't want to run for
supervisor or send you know gubernatorial
[SPEAKER_01]: positions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well I actually did apply for the cannabis
advisory committee.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know if it was something.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that it's something where we need
to have equity and legacy producers
[SPEAKER_02]: represented.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't mean that it should be me.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think it should be someone that has
a perspective that can represent farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: authentically.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not from a special interest place being an
ancillary company because I don't think
[SPEAKER_02]: you have the same view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's the same with whoever made metric
was never a farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well and then you have to look at who
you're aligning with because then when you
[SPEAKER_02]: have someone that's you know doing your
marketing or things that are
[SPEAKER_02]: representative of the community it really
should be authentic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Indeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I think that pretty much wraps it up
here today.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I didn't want to talk to you guys about
our rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: So oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: The other thing that I think I always love
to touch on is collaboration.
[SPEAKER_02]: So especially working with getting our
products to market and not just selling in
[SPEAKER_02]: bulk but selling with you know
representation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think that piece is so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're working with Humboldt Curb Council.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've known Rob since like 2002.
[SPEAKER_02]: We used to do fish tours together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh hilarious.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's so funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well like we would both go.
[SPEAKER_02]: We weren't going together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah I know totally.
[SPEAKER_01]: But this is our papaya.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the papaya turned out really nicely.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's actually dropping on the up north
menu Monday which will be the 16th.
[SPEAKER_00]: THCA THCBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has a really interesting terpene at the
top that's guaiol that I hadn't really
[SPEAKER_02]: heard of that much.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I did a little research.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's got pineine limonine and then the
guaiol.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe I'm saying it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a sucker for terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Isn't it elite.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like one of those nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: The papaya is so nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the guaiol is similar to pineine in
flavor but it has more of a eucalyptus.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then can kind of lean towards a woodsy
rose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my god.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never smelled a terpene profile like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the other thing I want to mention is
the wine and the food pairings.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've done for all of our cultivars
that hit the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got a sommelier down in the Bay Area
that we work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And she's has passed her French scholars
exam.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she's literally studied how to
describe flavors and smells.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so she does our strain descriptions
and then pairings.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so like wine a lot of the fully and
more robust flavors actually pair well
[SPEAKER_02]: with reds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the things that are more floral
and fruity pair better with whites.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an interesting development.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fun way to experience your cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's quite phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you guys doing much flower rosin
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So last year we did a lot of flower and
then you know trying to be more market
[SPEAKER_02]: savvy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know thinking about doing bigger batch
seem to make sense because then you're
[SPEAKER_02]: cutting your testing costs.
[SPEAKER_02]: But once it's in a jar it's going to
degrade quicker.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I found this year that I really
wanted to make sure that by the end of the
[SPEAKER_02]: first quarter that we weren't going to
have any more flower to sell.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wanted to have we're doing bubble hash
with actually the guy that's playing in
[SPEAKER_02]: the band tonight my friend Matt Engel.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's opening a store in Eureka called
Mocha.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it stands for modern cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he's doing a product called Basic
Bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like a basic bubble.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're collaborating on the London
Pound cake.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a bubble gum guava.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we also have the cake mix.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we're going to make some hash
infused pre rolls out of the bubble hash
[SPEAKER_02]: that we do with them with peak.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I think we're going to still jar
some wedding cake and do another batch.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got this Zev and that's going to
come out as rosin from Turb Council.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we're going to do a batch of
papaya resin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well it's all about collaboration.
[SPEAKER_01]: Rob's definitely got the high end level
turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love the Myron jars too.
[SPEAKER_02]: They really preserve the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah they're real nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well thanks again.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks Russell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for letting us know about your farm
and I look forward to smoking some of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bye.
