[SPEAKER_00]: Hey everybody, Green Life Productions
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I apologize for the loud noise of the fans
and this silly mask, but we're in a highly
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated indoor facility, so that's just
how it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now recently, Kiss Organics and Child
Science both put out a video sharing their
[SPEAKER_00]: opinion on the use of cover crops,
companion plants, and living mulch
[SPEAKER_00]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now these are two credible individuals who
brought up valid points that shouldn't be
[SPEAKER_00]: ignored if in fact you want to use these
systems successfully indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, the only thing I disagree with
that they said was just their opinion
[SPEAKER_00]: overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only reason I'm sharing my opinion
with you is because both of them named me
[SPEAKER_00]: in their video, so I feel an obligation at
this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now early on, I didn't have a lot of
places to look or resources to look for
[SPEAKER_00]: information, so my primary teacher has
always been Mother Nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now Mother Nature has been doing this
bigger, longer, and more successful than
[SPEAKER_00]: any of us could ever imagine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to say that we can't take those same
natural systems that we've been studying
[SPEAKER_00]: for thousands of years and apply that
science and those systems indoors in a
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled environment, to me just sounds
kind of silly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm going to share with you guys my
perspective and my opinion on this from a
[SPEAKER_00]: martial arts standpoint, more specifically
using jiu-jitsu.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds silly, but hear me out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now in jiu-jitsu, your opponent's
strengths can be used against them,
[SPEAKER_00]: and that's kind of the concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: He pushes, I pull.
[SPEAKER_00]: He pulls, I push.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go with the flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus trying to fight things head on.
[SPEAKER_00]: You anticipate your opponent's moves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grab his arm, he pulls his arm.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go left, he goes right.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you start to anticipate, you know the
probability of what your opponent's going
[SPEAKER_00]: to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can make better decisions on how to
trick your opponent, how to trap your
[SPEAKER_00]: opponent, how to do all these different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now let's apply that to a living system,
more specifically our living mulch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now when we first started off,
we were super clover heavy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what everybody was doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: After time, a little bit of time,
we started noticing that yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: clover is definitely more problematic than
the solutions it provides.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot easier ways to get nitrogen
into the system than putting a
[SPEAKER_00]: nitrogen-fixing plant in your soil that
attracts and harbors pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we cold all the clover, and we ran
brown mulch for a while, straw and wood
[SPEAKER_00]: chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: Didn't have much cover crop going down in
our soil, and we actually had bigger
[SPEAKER_00]: problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually had more threat pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The spartanites that were in our clovers
were now crawling up our plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: things of that nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then I started studying these plants,
their strengths and their weaknesses,
[SPEAKER_00]: and how I can use that to my advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll use a couple case in point to be
the first time I encountered green aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a big deal, but we'll get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I first encountered green aphids
was in a large facility, commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: facility, and one of the things that I
noticed right away just by scouting my
[SPEAKER_00]: rooms and just doing my due diligence was
the green aphids preferred the clover over
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis, and I had clover all over my
beds, so they're going from the clover to
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis, from the cannabis to the
clover, and just this big aphid buffet
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I did was I cold all the clover
from all my beds, all my soils,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then I planted the clover in a small
pot, and I placed several small pots,
[SPEAKER_00]: to be precise, and I placed that pot in
the corner of a room, and I drew all the
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids in that room to that pot,
and then I busted out my trusty old
[SPEAKER_00]: blowtorch, and I sent them to hell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the most organic way you can deal
with things, in my opinion, is fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: A little risky at times, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's just one case where I took
something that presented a problem I
[SPEAKER_00]: flipped the script, and I made that
problem a solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that brings me to my next point,
is that everything can serve a purpose if
[SPEAKER_00]: you know its strengths and weaknesses and
how to apply them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's take, for example, this country,
for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a diverse population of people
from multiple countries all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world, speaking multiple languages,
so much good food, so much good music,
[SPEAKER_00]: so much good food, so much good parties.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a polyculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: America is a polyculture of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have multiple cultures that coexist,
and it's an awesome place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, can you imagine if we were to
monoculture the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: and all we have are rich white dudes?
[SPEAKER_00]: That would not be a fun place to live,
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same concept goes with this soil and our
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our plants don't want to live in beds
surrounded by clones of themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no biological intelligence shared
in that system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't make sense to try to treat
it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see the value in that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So going on to my aphids thing,
green aphids were my first experience
[SPEAKER_00]: using trap plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: From there, I learned about banker plants
and having pollinators in the system that
[SPEAKER_00]: can feed my predators more in between
pests outbreaks, keep them around longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: spend less money on pests, and then
successful at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm going to talk a little bit about
some of the plants we use and why,
[SPEAKER_00]: because I get this question a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the primary plant that we use that
everybody always sees, I'll try to get it
[SPEAKER_00]: in here, that's Dichonja.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's basically the use, what we use
that for is just simply to cover the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a ground cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to manage.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't need reseeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: It grows good in low light, but also will
die off in low light.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just an easy to manage plant
indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we use it to cover the soil to keep it
from eroding when we water and all that
[SPEAKER_00]: good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, we use chickweed, another really
good ground cover.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a really good consistency to it as
far as it's fluffy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It adds a really good aeration to the
mulch layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't get super heavy and layered.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fluffy like a sponge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really good environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now both of these two cover crops are
really unfavored to most pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to say that pests won't linger on
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That'd be untrue.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not what they want to eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not what they look forward to eating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't have to worry about an
abundance of problems growing down there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also use from time to time,
you'll see grasses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something to take into consideration when
you're choosing your cover crops,
[SPEAKER_00]: your companion plants or whatever,
is their roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: See our Dichonja has super shallow roots
and creates a thick carpet across the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of the soil where it's not really pumping
sugar, it's pumping exudates deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not really expanding the biology
in the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: To the depth that it could go.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's why the grass is good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to have much deeper roots than
the Dichonja, than the chickweed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's good to take into consideration
just how you're occupying that soil with
[SPEAKER_00]: what.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also then use various companion plants
like marigolds and brassicas and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that that produce biotoxins that may
kill an unwanted pest or pathogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't want to go too far down that road.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a long one.
[SPEAKER_00]: With a lot of big words, I can't
pronounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So with a combination of companion plants,
ground cover, both brown mulch and green
[SPEAKER_00]: mulch, we have found success.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's not to say that we haven't had
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that we always pay attention to
learn from them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not just going to give up the first
time we see something that we don't like.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to find out how to defeat it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to rise to the occasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's my perspective on some of the
values of cover crops is at the end of the
[SPEAKER_00]: day, you're going to get pests.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to show up eventually.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you don't have something else for
them to eat, they're going to be on your
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the beauty about having a living mulch
is I can find things that they like more
[SPEAKER_00]: than my cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I explained about the aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I can take the fight there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So deep in the flower or in the flower in
general, I can't spray nothing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not that I would spray anything bad,
but even compost teas and organic sprays,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't even use because I'll fail the
microbial side of the test.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by having companion plants,
by having a living mulch, what that allows
[SPEAKER_00]: me to do is it allows me to find plants
that my pests like more than my cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It allows me to take the fight somewhere
other than my cash crop.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll plant, whether it's clover in a
pot and I bust out the torch or it's
[SPEAKER_00]: Dichondra, chickweed, marigold,
whatever it is in my beds that I can spray
[SPEAKER_00]: with a compost tea when I can't spray my
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Either way, it takes the fight where I
want to take it and it puts me in control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those same problems that people have
found again, I have found ways to make
[SPEAKER_00]: those solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to be persistent.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to mean it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have good intentions.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't fakeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it is on Instagram, I'll be
honest, but in real life, when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: walking people through this facility,
they see it, they feel it, they can
[SPEAKER_00]: breathe it, they can smell it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The energy is in the air.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product speaks for itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: I run these rooms again with two people,
two women, so it can be done.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just, are you willing to put in the
work?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you willing to put the science to the
test?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you willing to have faith in Mother
Nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you willing to have faith in Mother
Nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you willing to have faith in Mother
Nature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you willing to have faith in Mother
Nature?
