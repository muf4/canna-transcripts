[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the challenges for growing plants
in space are basically trying to make them
[SPEAKER_00]: grow in a way that's similar to what we
experience them growing on Earth with
[SPEAKER_00]: gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in space you have no gravity,
which means it's not necessarily the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants that are having any kind of unusual
response to the lack of gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the other physical parameters
that the plants require to grow that you
[SPEAKER_00]: have challenges that you have to beat.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, water delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you don't have gravity, water
doesn't stay in the pot, it floats around.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or water is stratified different in the
media that the plants are growing in.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on Earth where you have gravity,
water is added to the top of the pot,
[SPEAKER_00]: it sinks down to the bottom of the pot due
to gravity.
[SPEAKER_00]: In space it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's equally distributed throughout
that media because the media is holding on
[SPEAKER_00]: to the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots can absorb that water out of the
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the early experiments in growing
plants in space were having to overcome
[SPEAKER_00]: the challenges of water delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overwatering the plants because we're used
to giving them a certain amount of water
[SPEAKER_00]: on Earth because of that stratification of
water in the pot versus in space,
[SPEAKER_00]: the water is equally distributed
throughout that media and therefore you
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have to add as much water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So overwatering plants is bad for the
plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was one of the challenges that had
to be overcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Was it overcome?
[SPEAKER_01]: Was there a clever solution?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, by just simply managing watering
protocols, watering control.
[SPEAKER_00]: But plants grow well in microgravity
because they orient themselves toward
[SPEAKER_00]: light and so if you have a light source
that's suitable for growing those plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: they orient themselves toward the light
and they grow similarly to what you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: expect them to see on Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're growing towards the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But interestingly enough, roots are not in
the light.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if roots are in the media, they don't
have any clue or any environmental clue to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So roots will grow up and out of the soil
because they are sensing gravity and not
[SPEAKER_00]: light.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at some point, won't they start to get
air pruned as they poke?
Yes, they would.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so once they get out in the air and
they're not in a media, a liquid or a wet
[SPEAKER_00]: type of media anymore, they would not be
happy in that environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the journey to let's say a plant like
Mars and then growing plants on Mars,
[SPEAKER_01]: would it all be under lights or is the sun
too radiation heavy on Mars to be able to
[SPEAKER_01]: use that in addition to the lighting
system?
[SPEAKER_01]: So are we going to have all LED lights on
Mars and that's the only light source
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants are going to have or are they
going to have sunlight as well?
[SPEAKER_00]: So currently, the types of scenarios for
being on Mars or the moon is to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: subterranean habitat and a subterranean
area to grow the plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason for that is the exposure to
radiation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are lucky that we have an ozone layer
and an atmosphere that protects us from
[SPEAKER_00]: radiation from the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're on the moon or Mars,
you don't have that protection anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's a very hazardous environment
both for people and materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a facility that is exposed
to that type of radiation, you can start
[SPEAKER_00]: to have material breakdown.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the current types of models are to be
subterranean and have solar collectors
[SPEAKER_00]: that provide the light and is then
delivered into the plant growth area as
[SPEAKER_00]: well as the human habitat area and
protecting the plants and the people from
[SPEAKER_00]: that type of radiation.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you say solar collectors,
do you mean like solar tube type things
[SPEAKER_01]: that are taking the sunlight, letting it
come in but maybe having filters?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, or variations of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it could be solar tubes, it could be
solar light concentrators that have
[SPEAKER_00]: filters on them that remove the harmful
radiation in the radiation band that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're receiving so that you're only
bringing in the wavelengths of light that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plants need and you're eliminating the
ones they don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll be a combination of filtered
sunlight and supplemental lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, because of the, well, certain parts
of the extraterrestrial planets might not
[SPEAKER_00]: have the same kind of photo periods that
we would experience on Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you would want to be able to
provide the amount of light that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plants need to grow to support the humans
that are going to be living in that
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: What would be the daily challenges you
feel like you would be going through as
[SPEAKER_01]: the guy responsible for keeping the plants
alive for the population on Mars?
[SPEAKER_00]: I really cannot come up with a good answer
to that question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Would you want to be that guy?
[SPEAKER_01]: Would you want to go on a trip?
[SPEAKER_00]: Personally, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to have the same,
if you're on another planet, you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a lot of, there's a lot of things
that you have in your favor that's similar
[SPEAKER_00]: to Earth, like you have gravity again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're able to have similar
horticultural protocols to growing plants
[SPEAKER_00]: that you're using, for example,
as your life support system that you'd
[SPEAKER_00]: have on Earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you would also have to be very
cognizant of the various environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges that you have under those
conditions as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We mentioned radiation before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's one of those challenges.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about things like oxygen and creating
sort of an environment for plants and
[SPEAKER_01]: people to live in?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you would have a closed environment
or semi-closed environment with which you
[SPEAKER_00]: would try to retain as much of those life
support components as possible,
[SPEAKER_00]: the oxygen, the carbon dioxide,
and the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the carbon, you wouldn't want to lose
any of those things.
[SPEAKER_00]: You would want to continue to recycle and
reuse those along the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are those things things that could be made
by pulling out of the Mars atmosphere?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is there maybe not enough to
breathe, but is there oxygen in the
[SPEAKER_01]: atmosphere that you can pull?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there hydrogen?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the atmosphere on Mars is very thin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not practical to think you
could use that as a resource.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not to say it's not impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are other aspects of
extraterrestrial habitations that could be
[SPEAKER_00]: useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: For example, there is lunar or Mars soil
that could be used to grow plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's research looking into using
those types of media to support plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so they've analyzed the soil on Mars
and deduced that it actually has a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: what a plant would need.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's lunar and Mars stimulants that
have been developed that they're using to
[SPEAKER_00]: do plant testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: To see if they're compatible with that.
