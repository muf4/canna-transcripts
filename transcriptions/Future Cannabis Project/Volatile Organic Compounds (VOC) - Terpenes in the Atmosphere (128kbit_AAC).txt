[SPEAKER_02]: So we were talking volatile organic
compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one thing that kind of blew me away is
every time I've ever thought about,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, greenhouse or indoor cultivation
and having kind of odor control systems,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's always been about the smell,
like the neighbors don't like the smell or
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't want people to know you're
growing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right, from a nuisance perspective or a
security perspective.
[SPEAKER_02]: But there's actually a totally different
reason why you don't want the terpenes
[SPEAKER_02]: floating out of your facility and into the
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_02]: So can you talk about that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, happy to.
[SPEAKER_03]: So terpenes are volatile organic
compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Volatile organic compounds are important
because they're an ingredient to ozone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ozone, although it's protective in the
atmosphere when it's up high, it's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: acts as an insulating blanket for our
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_03]: But down low in, you know, where we're
breathing the air, it's actually a toxic
[SPEAKER_03]: air pollutant.
[SPEAKER_03]: It oxidizes our lungs.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually oxidizes plants as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You actually see the plants almost like
turn black and look bruised in a high
[SPEAKER_03]: ozone environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So ozone is formed when volatile organic
compounds are released into the atmosphere
[SPEAKER_03]: and react with nitrogen oxide emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nitrogen oxide emissions are combustion
emissions, cars, power plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anytime we're burning anything,
we get nitrogen oxide as a result.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when nitrogen oxide and volatile
organic compounds meet in the presence of
[SPEAKER_03]: sunlight, they form that ground level
ozone, which is toxic for us to breathe.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Colorado, it's an issue that we're
looking into because all of our cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation is in our urban environment,
co-located next to all of our major
[SPEAKER_03]: highways, our cars, our power plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: About 60 to 70 percent of our marijuana
cultivation is within our urban
[SPEAKER_03]: environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we want to know how many pounds of
VOCs are emitted per pound of marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: grown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then what is the ultimate influence on
that ozone reaction?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because it's a public health issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's toxic for us to breathe.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's toxic for our environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we want to be it's a heightened and
it puts a new perspective on your odor
[SPEAKER_03]: control system, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: A heightened sensitivity, because now
you're not only controlling odor for
[SPEAKER_03]: nuisance reasons or for security reasons,
you're actually contributing to the public
[SPEAKER_03]: health of your community by controlling
those odors because of the secondary
[SPEAKER_03]: reaction that can happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just to be clear, if you're growing in
somewhere like Humboldt or Mendocino or
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere kind of removed, you're not
really creating that problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: But if you're right, you have a big
greenhouse next to the highway in Santa
[SPEAKER_02]: Barbara or down in L.A., you have an
indoor grow and you're pumping what smells
[SPEAKER_02]: to me beautiful out your exhaust system
into the environment and a Knox rich area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you have a Knox rich area,
like in an urban environment like downtown
[SPEAKER_03]: L.A., there's a smog problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys have an ozone problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a congestion problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's industrial sources as well that,
you know, provide combustion emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so when you bring in this new source
of volatile organic compounds that
[SPEAKER_03]: traditionally wouldn't be there,
you get new ozone formation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: So terpenes are obviously found in other
products as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are they problematic there, too,
or is there something about cannabis that
[SPEAKER_00]: is especially problematic?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: So VOCs come in many different products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Anything that traditionally has an odor
with it is you're smelling the volatile
[SPEAKER_03]: organic compound coming off of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, personal care products,
deodorants, perfumes, and then industrial
[SPEAKER_03]: sources would be like solvents and paints.
[SPEAKER_03]: But any other agricultural source,
pine trees, they're all putting off
[SPEAKER_03]: different volatile organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's unique about cannabis is that
we took it from the forest and put it in
[SPEAKER_03]: the urban environment to create those
reactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also, it just happens to be that
the terpene profile associated with
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, those terpenes are highly
reactive on the scale for ozone formation
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to other terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I thought about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like Miracene, pionene, limonene.
[SPEAKER_02]: What was the other like top?
[SPEAKER_02]: Terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Terpenaline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like those are some of the most egregious
in terms of ozone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Reacting with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what's the nitrogen oxide?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can short as NOX.
[SPEAKER_03]: NOX.
OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So does it make sense for a state to
mandate where terpene rich products and
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture are grown within the state?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, that's one factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in Colorado, we had a lot of
regulatory drivers that drove our industry
[SPEAKER_03]: indoor and in our urban environment,
zoned industrial, co-located next to these
[SPEAKER_03]: sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it just you know, the environmental
impacts of that was a little bit of an
[SPEAKER_03]: afterthought.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're trying to just quantify what
is the impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really important to point out that
there's no regulatory drivers here because
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis is an agricultural process,
at least the cultivation of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And agricultural processes are exempt from
air quality regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is unique agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's an agricultural process in that no
other agricultural commodity has the
[SPEAKER_03]: profit margins for it to make sense to
grow it in the way that we grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would never grow tomatoes downtown next
to Coors Field.
[SPEAKER_03]: You just wouldn't do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We do that with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You talked a little bit in your panel
today about how carbon filtration can be
[SPEAKER_01]: designed specifically to, you know,
to correlate with phytochemical data.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can phytochemical data collection be
standardized at state and hopefully one
[SPEAKER_01]: day federal levels to improve that
outcome?
[SPEAKER_01]: And also, I hope, improve consumer
outcomes as well because now they have the
[SPEAKER_01]: ingredients available to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so knowledge is very powerful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once we know the terpene emission profile
specific to these cannabis facilities,
[SPEAKER_03]: we can design carbon filtration that's
customized to capture those molecules
[SPEAKER_03]: because carbon filtration is a physical
solution to a chemical problem.
[SPEAKER_03]: The way that carbon filtration works is
there's lots of pores within the carbon
[SPEAKER_03]: filter and it actually physically traps
those molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if those carbon pores are too big or
too small, we're not effectively capturing
[SPEAKER_03]: those molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we want to design the carbon filter
specifically for the pollutants that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: trying to capture.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so in this case, those top four
terpenes, they're each physically a
[SPEAKER_02]: specific size.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you'd have a carbon filtration system
that had pores that were each of those
[SPEAKER_02]: sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's going to capture mostly those
four.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and it might be, you know,
those four might have like, they might be
[SPEAKER_03]: in a family where it's even a similar size
where we're targeting that specific
[SPEAKER_03]: molecules and very different carbon
filtration for plant molecules versus,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, industrial sources of VOCs like
maybe an ethanol or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now the other interesting thing we were
talking about was the wine industry and
[SPEAKER_02]: they're noticing kind of new terpene,
like someone makes their Cabernet in
[SPEAKER_02]: Sonoma and they're noticing a new terpene
in their Cabernet that wasn't there before
[SPEAKER_02]: and they're attributing it to cannabis
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, that is happening in the wine
industry and they're interested in my VOC
[SPEAKER_03]: research from that perspective because
they want to know what are the dominant
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes coming off of cannabis
cultivations and are those dominant
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes showing up in our final wine
profile?
[SPEAKER_03]: And what is the consumer response to that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do we embrace it?
[SPEAKER_03]: As, you know, only Santa Barbara wine has
these cannabis terpenes in it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or, you know, do we fight against the
grain there?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's something that the wine
industry is having to adapt to,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, with this new influx of industry
being co-located next to them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then also from the cannabis,
you know, farmer's perspective,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're heavily regulated on what
pesticides they can use versus the wine
[SPEAKER_03]: industry is not.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can see from, you know,
the transport, cannabis is transporting
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes to the wineries and then the
wineries are transferring, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: pesticides to the cannabis cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really interesting because the beer
industry or parts of it are embracing
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and actually putting them into
creating new products that are terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: rich and killing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I mean, there's also cannabis
products too, where people are adding
[SPEAKER_03]: terpenes, you know, concentrated terpenes
in to get different flavor profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I had a really interesting
lesson about extraction early on because I
[SPEAKER_03]: was naive and thought, well, why doesn't
everybody do CO2 extraction?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we don't get those volatile organic
compounds off of solvents.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone had to educate me and tell me,
well, with CO2 extraction, you're not
[SPEAKER_03]: getting the terpene profile extracted.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're only getting the cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that'd be akin to like, you know,
drinking Everclear versus a fine craft
[SPEAKER_03]: beer or wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where you're getting those flavor
profiles.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I had to really shift my perspective to
understand the consumer needs that are
[SPEAKER_03]: driving these processes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Peanut gallery.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys just so overwhelmed by these
deep thoughts?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the one thing I thought of was that
even if it's not regulated, the argument
[SPEAKER_00]: to get cultivation out of urban areas
into, you know, rural areas or even
[SPEAKER_00]: farther out is a really strong one and
might counter the NIMBY effect that is,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, really problematic in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so many municipalities that,
you know, are saying no to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they could be incentivized or,
you know, they had a really powerful
[SPEAKER_00]: reason, which this is, you know,
these industries will, if they're in your
[SPEAKER_00]: area, it's a quality of life benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the environment benefits in a
big way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, that's one of the things that
I thought about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it could be regulated,
but one way or another, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the production and the, you know,
in California, the patchwork system is
[SPEAKER_00]: just not working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, that was one of the things.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the biggest lesson we can learn,
you know, collectively for the cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: industry from Colorado is the willingness
to be nimble and adapt our regulatory
[SPEAKER_03]: structure to the needs of the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, very early on with us being one
of the first regulated markets,
[SPEAKER_03]: we, all of our regulations were focused on
safety, security, no diversion to the
[SPEAKER_03]: black market.
[SPEAKER_03]: The environment wasn't necessarily
considered in that regulatory structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, now that we're, you know,
a couple of years into legalization and
[SPEAKER_03]: the house didn't fall down, so to speak,
we can start circling back and finding
[SPEAKER_03]: efficiencies in our regulatory structure
and working with the cannabis industry to
[SPEAKER_03]: still meet all of the needs of safety,
security, no diversion to the black
[SPEAKER_03]: market, but in a more logical,
sensible way.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think the best example of that would be,
you know, either the 50-50 waste rule with
[SPEAKER_03]: plant mixing having to mix with 50%
non-marijuana waste, which doubles our
[SPEAKER_03]: landfill footprint, or, you know,
from the packaging perspective of
[SPEAKER_03]: childproof packaging, yes, we want to
protect our youth, but can we do it in a
[SPEAKER_03]: way that's not five layers of packaging?
[SPEAKER_03]: Could we manage to do it in one?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe you don't need to package flour.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I also like to throw it out there
from an environmental perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the public health side of the house
doesn't like this perspective,
[SPEAKER_03]: but from an environmental perspective,
we don't do childproof packaging on
[SPEAKER_03]: alcohol or tobacco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why cannabis?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or keeping it in the family and,
you know, focusing our efforts on creating
[SPEAKER_01]: hemp cellulose packaging that is far more
sustainable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we're starting to see advances in
hemp-based plastics, certainly in
[SPEAKER_03]: Colorado, and they do have, they break
down a lot quicker than plastics,
[SPEAKER_03]: traditional plastics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I talked to brands that are kind
of making these packaging decisions
[SPEAKER_02]: because it costs more.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's kind of like, does the consumer
care enough to pay a tiny bit more?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that's the question right now,
at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So before you go, do you mind missing your
next, I'm joking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's 520, so she has to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But is there research being done to assess
what the impact is of these terpene VOCs?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much the amount actually is?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'm doing that research.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I am collecting air quality samples
from commercial cannabis cultivation
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities, getting spreciation results.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are the terpenes being emitted and in
what concentrations?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we will be putting that into very
sophisticated air quality models that
[SPEAKER_03]: already know what are the sources of
nitrogen oxide?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are all the other sources of volatile
organic compounds?
[SPEAKER_03]: Put that all together, add the layer of
cannabis emissions.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the resulting impact on ozone?
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a very complicated scientific
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're in the early stages of this
research.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we actually, we hope to publish the
results this summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're pretty far along, but this
summer, hopefully.
[SPEAKER_02]: Any initial findings?
[SPEAKER_03]: The biggest thing that I can share at this
point is just the dominant terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: emission profile that we're seeing is,
you know, mercine, pining, limonene,
[SPEAKER_03]: and terpenylene.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, those are by far the dominant
terpenes that we're seeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're definitely seeing a whole family of
other terpenes, but at much, much lower
[SPEAKER_03]: concentrations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are the dominant ones that we're
seeing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's really important.
[SPEAKER_03]: Information to know, because now we know
what we're controlling, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know the concentrations yet,
but we know what we're controlling,
[SPEAKER_03]: at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of this, you'll have a sense
of, say, in Denver, here's how much ozone
[SPEAKER_00]: is being emitted as a result of these
practices.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be the results of that should
be super interesting and should have an
[SPEAKER_00]: impact.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, in Colorado, we're using it as
an educational piece.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we want to know.
[SPEAKER_03]: We want to understand where our ozone is
coming from and all the sources.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's building block information.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it will have impacts nationwide and
across the globe, for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, thank you for having me.
Thank you.
