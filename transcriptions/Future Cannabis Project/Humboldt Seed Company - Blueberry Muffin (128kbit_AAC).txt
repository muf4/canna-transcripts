right here is blueberry muffin and boy I
[SPEAKER_00]: just can't say enough about how good of a
job the folks at Hygro Humble do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're always just turning out top shelf
fire and they've got, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can pick up their products at
dispensaries all over the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: California.

it's always amazed me because this is just
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the cleanest cannabis that you can
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're still using,
utilizing the sunlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're not taxing the,
we're not doing too much carbon emissions
[SPEAKER_00]: in a spot like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of a best of both worlds.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've got no kind of limit inside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got something that'll show you've set your
stuff on fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: You refuse to put anything before your
pride.
