[SPEAKER_00]: So the science started in conventional
agriculture with Elaine, Dr. Elaine Ingham
[SPEAKER_00]: and conventional agriculture is a thing
and it's not interested in those
[SPEAKER_00]: technologies, techniques and there's a
massive effort to keep them out of that
[SPEAKER_00]: area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of the cool thing is where they're
being really embraced and picked up is
[SPEAKER_00]: within the cannabis industry and these are
the people that are living inside a
[SPEAKER_00]: forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I feel like what we do is a form of
ecological restoration.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I can fix your farm, the forest will
fix itself from inside your farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the intense production model of the
states of like Nevada, they went big with
[SPEAKER_00]: warehouses in this heavy production model
and so their analysis of that process was
[SPEAKER_00]: a very quick learning curve and each week
you're bringing new batches of plants in
[SPEAKER_00]: on a 200,000 square foot building.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of learning to have right
there and the same thing's happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: light depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can go and help a corn farmer and turn
around one season and learn a specific set
[SPEAKER_00]: of information from that interaction and
then I can go to a light depth greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: and I can have five full harvests in a
calendar year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for every year I get five full
opportunities to learn and that is
[SPEAKER_00]: propelling the cannabis, light depth and
high production indoor people,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean decades and decades and decades
ahead of the conventional agriculture.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think the long term implications
of that are really hopeful because we're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to hit a point where the average age
of the farmer that's growing our food is
[SPEAKER_00]: 62 retires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their kids are now lawyers because farming
is not a prosperable business in the mega
[SPEAKER_00]: scale and we're going to have a tremendous
amount of really educated, talented
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers that know more responsible ways to
produce food and they've been working with
[SPEAKER_00]: altering environments and I think that's
going to be needed for human
[SPEAKER_00]: survivability.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of what I'm all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to help those people and try to
help that movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: People take what I say really personally
but I'm here for human survivability and
[SPEAKER_00]: the way I'm doing that is by communicating
what's happening in the soul of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers and that's a really enjoyable
thing to do with my life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe the question is about
integrating food production and cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: production into the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why that question is asked is
there seems to be the farther you get away
[SPEAKER_00]: from suburban America or integrated
heavily densely populated growing areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: you start to end up with organic living
soil, sustainable practice farmers that
[SPEAKER_00]: are growing their food along with their
cannabis and I think it came out of a need
[SPEAKER_00]: because these are the same people that
don't want to live off food from the
[SPEAKER_00]: center store and so they're trying to grow
their own food so naturally just they
[SPEAKER_00]: threw it in with the beds of cannabis and
that turned into making really good food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also turns out the farther you get off
the road and the more vegetables are grown
[SPEAKER_00]: with the cannabis the bigger the plants
get.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why that happens is in a living
soil system the nutrients are produced by
[SPEAKER_00]: organism to organism interactions.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those organisms are fed through plant root
relationships so the more roots you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get into that living soil the more surface
area you have for the potential of
[SPEAKER_00]: producing nutrients and that's exactly
what happens and that was a really fun
[SPEAKER_00]: transition for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started out going to the chemical
farmers in the mountains and the better I
[SPEAKER_00]: got at the microscope the farther I got
off the road and the more food was being
[SPEAKER_00]: grown with plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are so many specifics about no wood,
there's certain growing materials you can
[SPEAKER_00]: use, there's certain things inside and
outside of the building so I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: an approach to surviving the regulated
area would grow food in with the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: just because of the complications but we
can take that learning lesson into the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated area and we can replace the food
with cover crops that host mycorrhizal
[SPEAKER_00]: fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can grow plants that host these banks
of populations of organisms that produce
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients in the soil so we still carry
that mentality and that method for success
[SPEAKER_00]: but the regulator, it's a sticky thing but
we've had a wide array of root vegetables
[SPEAKER_00]: that grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brassicas are helpful in starting the
system because they're early successional
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, they become antagonistic earlier
on but they are good for starting a system
[SPEAKER_00]: and so we've had cover crop blends that
have root vegetables in it and all kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of wild things so you still can carry the
method for success but it might be really
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a lot of people that are
entering the regulated market with brands
[SPEAKER_00]: and they also grow food so whether those
happen at the same exact location,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, that would be risky I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just because now you're combining two
regulatory bodies so I'd probably keep
[SPEAKER_00]: them separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we can move out of fear of problem
mindset and we can move away from being
[SPEAKER_00]: afraid of things we can quantify them
mathematically and address them with a
[SPEAKER_00]: cost-effective approach and that just
takes a mentality shift to the facility
[SPEAKER_00]: but people are absolutely succeeding in
the regulated market, they're absolutely
[SPEAKER_00]: thriving in the regulated market doing
living soils with beneficial insects and
[SPEAKER_00]: no chemicals in the building at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be my suggestion for a
reasonable pathway through the regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: market, remove all the things that can
cause a fail and create plant health
[SPEAKER_00]: environments that lower pest pressure and
disease susceptibility and then they can't
[SPEAKER_00]: get you in trouble for anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the industry really needs right now
is help with best practices.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a couple groups that are trying to
do it, the TCC, the ICFA, I'm not up on
[SPEAKER_00]: all of them but the farm farmers are
communicating to me that what's really
[SPEAKER_00]: needed from them is a way to actually
differentiate themselves from the other
[SPEAKER_00]: growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we're in an era where organic
facilities in regulated states are using
[SPEAKER_00]: banned pesticides early on and skating
under.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an absurd disrespect for human
life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absurd to me because we can
quantify mitigation and mitigate and
[SPEAKER_00]: adjust for these pests, we don't need to
poison humans in the process and the
[SPEAKER_00]: process is raising an intelligence,
I think our farmers need to raise an
[SPEAKER_00]: intelligence and that's kind of been what
I've been after, mostly inspired by the
[SPEAKER_00]: Dragonfly Earth medicine people and they
said something to the effect of we don't
[SPEAKER_00]: need any more rich people, we need
educated farmers that can farm sustainably
[SPEAKER_00]: so humans can survive and that's really,
I think the beauty of the regulated era,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we bring things to the forefront and as
we examine them closely it shows how much
[SPEAKER_00]: we're relying on a by all means approach
with disregard to human health and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: it's really irresponsible to our fellow
people and if you're a farmer growing
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's consumed you have the
highest obligation to other humans to act
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my two cents.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
