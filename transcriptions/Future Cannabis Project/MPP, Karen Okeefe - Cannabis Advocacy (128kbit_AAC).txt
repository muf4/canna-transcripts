[SPEAKER_00]: MPB was mentioned a couple times,
and I assume most of you know who we are,
[SPEAKER_00]: but in case not, we're a 22-year-old
nonprofit based in Washington,
[SPEAKER_00]: D.C.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've worked on medical marijuana for
years and years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the lead organization for most of
the medical marijuana laws that passed in
[SPEAKER_00]: the last 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've also worked on decriminalization
bills.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we played the leading role in five of
the eight marijuana adult use initiatives
[SPEAKER_00]: that passed, including Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also supported the one here in
California that our allies at DPA took a
[SPEAKER_00]: leading role in.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just such an amazing time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been with MPP since 2003.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I started out, you know,
there were eight states with medical
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana, none with adult use,
and about 35% of the population of the
[SPEAKER_00]: United States supported making marijuana
legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we've got 29 medical marijuana
states, 60% support for making marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: legal, and 29 states that have medical
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, we have all this
promise and the support, we also have a
[SPEAKER_00]: time of peril.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we have an attorney general who
thinks that good people don't use
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have a president who said that he
supports states' rights to make their own
[SPEAKER_00]: decision.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can't necessarily be trusted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the attorney general is urging
Congress to get rid of the rider that
[SPEAKER_00]: they've put on an appropriations bill
every year to tie the hands of the
[SPEAKER_00]: Department of Justice so they can't go
after medical marijuana providers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to get that renewed and also
to get a measure passed that would apply
[SPEAKER_00]: to adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even if Sessions wanted to go after all
of these providers, they wouldn't be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to financially supporting
advocacy, which is such an issue,
[SPEAKER_00]: as Mary hadn't mentioned, you know,
a lot of philanthropists are thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: there's all this money to be made and
industry should really be funding it now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this circumstance where we've
got 22 states with bills pending where
[SPEAKER_00]: really the limit to how many states can
move how fast is how much funding there
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's more opportunity for us to
move very quickly than there ever has
[SPEAKER_00]: been, but there's just not funding.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition to the need for funding for
all kinds of advocacy organizations,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's so important that industry members
make a real firm relationship with your
[SPEAKER_00]: members of Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, not only should you know them,
but they should know you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If they're at all supportive, you might
want to go to their fundraisers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might want to invite them or their
staff on a tour, your state, local,
[SPEAKER_00]: and federal officials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth building a relationship with
all of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a dispensary or other
business, you know, make sure that your
[SPEAKER_00]: customers and that your employees are
involved, that they're contacting their
[SPEAKER_00]: members of Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because this is all, of course,
federally illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the survival and the freedom of so
many people really depends on elected
[SPEAKER_00]: officials realizing this is something that
people care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the tides can shift really quickly.
[SPEAKER_00]: I worked on a medical marijuana initiative
in 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember getting a call from this
patient I worked with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said the cops came and they counted
his plants, and then they left after it
[SPEAKER_00]: passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he actually ended up dying in prison
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: About eight years later, after the federal
government under Obama, arrested him and
[SPEAKER_00]: his partners for conspiracy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they thought they were OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had law enforcement come in for
tours.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was kind of in the gray area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's always this risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot less in some respects than it
might be.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot more hope.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's so important that, you know,
we don't let up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's people's freedom in so many
states.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under federal law, it depends on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't take that for granted.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you so much for your interest and
for having me.
