[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually quite a handy unit,
because you have all the measurements that
[SPEAKER_00]: you might want in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're used to parts per million,
it has that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're used to EC, it has that,
and a pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a very relatively easy one to figure
out how to work, because it quickly jumps
[SPEAKER_00]: from one reading to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to check out.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's nice that the probe is replaceable
all by itself, rather than having to get a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the probe goes wrong, you can just
disconnect it, and I'm sure buy one of
[SPEAKER_00]: those all by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're calibrating the EC meter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Put the sensor in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what's that packet?
[SPEAKER_00]: A quick calibration unit of liquid for EC
and pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you do a one step.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's going to calibrate both?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Normally with pH, you would use a two
step, like a seven and a four.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bit more accurate, but like I said,
this is a quick set.
[SPEAKER_00]: The EC should five at 77 degrees.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, we're at 81.
[SPEAKER_00]: At 86, it should be 543.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold it there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That should be somewhere right about
halfway between.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'd be 5200, or 5.2, roughly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're calibrating the EC and the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go through this device.
[SPEAKER_01]: So basically, this is a Hanna grow line,
reads pH, EC, and then what's TDS?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, total dissolved solids, which is
again, another reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: And total dissolved solids is actually a
bit different than EC, and I've never used
[SPEAKER_00]: it, and I'm not that familiar exactly what
it means.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it will read some of the particles in
there that are not being read by a salt
[SPEAKER_00]: meter, or EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the moment, I'm reading our parts per
million in our feed, which is at,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's on the 700 scale, and it's 1210.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little bit on the, probably the
lower end right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if I want to change to a pH,
I just press the set hold button,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it changes to pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our pH right now is 6.47.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have not yet added the pH down,
so we will be bringing the pH down to
[SPEAKER_00]: right around six, a bit below six.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we want to change, now we were reading
in parts per million, if we want to change
[SPEAKER_00]: to EC, so we are reading parts per million
on the 700 scale, and we got 1210.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we want to go to the EC scale,
we will push the on-off button,
[SPEAKER_00]: go past off, past calibrate, onto units.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we get to there, we can see the units
we're in, which is 700.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to change that to EC,
we just push the set hold button,
[SPEAKER_00]: and it goes to EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we push it again, it goes to 500.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wherever you want to go to, you just stop
at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to go back to EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from there, we just press again,
and press the on-off mode button until we
[SPEAKER_00]: come to where it's reading EC,
and it's 1.7.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you took 700 times 1.7, you would
get the 1200 parts per million that we did
[SPEAKER_00]: with the 700 scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're on a 700 scale, the EC reading
times 700 gets you the PPM.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're on the 500 scale, the EC reading
times 500 gives you the PPM.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're used to looking at something in
relation to what you've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's what you're familiar with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You understand what parts per million
means to you with the meter you have.
[SPEAKER_00]: For me, parts per million doesn't mean
anything, because I'm so used to using EC.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when somebody tells me, oh,
it's 1400 parts per million, I don't know
[SPEAKER_00]: anything until, OK, I convert it to EC,
and it says 2.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it means something to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: In all these modes, or the readings are
temperature sensitive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right below each of them, you will find
a number that says 69 degrees right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with salts, if your temperature is
higher, the salt level is going to read
[SPEAKER_00]: higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's temperature compensated.
[SPEAKER_00]: pH is the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that because higher temperatures are
better at conducting electricity,
[SPEAKER_01]: or what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things are more reactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if you're reading EC and it's
higher, it means it's more conductive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're taking care of your pH meter,
make sure that you're using the cup to
[SPEAKER_00]: store the probium.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have a storage solution in the
cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep it in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep the bulb.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a bulb on the bottom that reads
the pH.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has a solution in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in a porous glass, and the solution
can come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you keep it in a solution that has
a slight salt content in it, it will help
[SPEAKER_00]: your probe to last much longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what the storage solution is.
[SPEAKER_00]: A probe will, in general, last a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: When it gets to be more than a year,
you may be able to keep it longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're really diligent with the storage
solution, as soon as you are noticing it's
[SPEAKER_00]: more erratic or it's difficult to get it
to calibrate, then it's time to buy a new
[SPEAKER_00]: probe.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you get a pH or EC reading that you
think is outside of the range where you
[SPEAKER_00]: believe it should be, don't assume there's
something wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: First thing you do is recalibrate your
instrument so many different times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something can have happened to the
instrument where the calibration is off.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you recalibrate it and then still get
the reading wrong, then you start to look
[SPEAKER_00]: to see what could have caused the change
in your EC or pH that you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's it.
