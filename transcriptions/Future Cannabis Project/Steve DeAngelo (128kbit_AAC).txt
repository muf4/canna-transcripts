[SPEAKER_00]: When Ronald Reagan started his escalated
war on drugs, that was back in the days
[SPEAKER_00]: when most of the weed that came into the
country was coming from Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of it, most of it probably,
was coming on boats, was coming on ships.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so one of the very first targets of
that war, which started with the war on
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, were boats that were carrying
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was when the zero tolerance policy
was first implemented and the Coast Guard
[SPEAKER_00]: went around seizing people's boats and
ships and even rather sizable vessels
[SPEAKER_00]: because they would find a joint or a half
a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where that first zero tolerance
term was coined.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think it's really significant that as
we are here gathered to think about the
[SPEAKER_00]: state of cannabis and where we are at
today, that Susan was able to report this
[SPEAKER_00]: news.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we have liberated the Queen Mary,
that she has liberated the Queen Mary.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's a great sign of what's coming
in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many of you are working harder than
you ever have in your lives before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many of you are loving it more
than anything you've ever done?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm like so busy doing stuff these
days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I never have enough time to prepare as
much as I want to for anything that I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm afraid that's a little bit the
case this morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I got a lot of important ideas that I'd
like to share with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I may wander off and get a little lost
from time to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need to come back to my notes and get an
anchor back again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So bear with me as we go through this.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I am really pleased and proud and happy to
report to all of you, if you don't know it
[SPEAKER_00]: yet, right, that the state of cannabis is
strong and getting stronger every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our future is bright and getting
brighter every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not entirely out of the shadows yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the worst of the darkness is behind
us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our ultimate goals are within reach.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's good news almost everywhere we
look, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's only 10 states in the United
States now that have failed to pass some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of cannabis reform law, only 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every year, the Congress passes the
Farr-Rorbacher Amendment, which protects
[SPEAKER_00]: those state laws by blocking the DOJ from
interfering with them by larger and larger
[SPEAKER_00]: margins every year, including many,
many Republican votes, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has
just affirmed that the Farr-Rorbacher
[SPEAKER_00]: Amendment means exactly what it says.
[SPEAKER_00]: The DOJ cannot prosecute anybody who is
acting in compliance with their state
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: Take a look at Congress now, in the
Senate, and in the House.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got several really groundbreaking
cannabis measures that are pending.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're gaining more and more support.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not sure when they're going to start
passing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But more and more of them are gaining
support.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's only inevitable that we'll see
their passage, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Presidential campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the very first time in history,
we have both, both general election
[SPEAKER_00]: candidates from both parties, Democratic
and Republican, who have publicly
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed support for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember when we couldn't even get a
joke out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all we got was jokes for a while,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is going to continue,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: This will continue for the rest of the
Obama administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll continue to see this gradual
dismantling of federal prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if Hillary Clinton becomes president,
it may slow down.
[SPEAKER_00]: But federal reform won't stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And even if Trump is elected, he,
and probably more importantly,
[SPEAKER_00]: the people associated with him,
may be able to completely stop reform at
[SPEAKER_00]: the federal level.
[SPEAKER_00]: That could happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they will not, they will not be able
to roll us back here in the states at the
[SPEAKER_00]: state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will continue taking territory and
making reform.
[SPEAKER_00]: More good news, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: More good news.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new legal, profitable cannabis industry
has been created.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went from no such thing to the most
rapidly growing industry in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a decade, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've harnessed the engine of free
enterprise to the train of social justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is no stopping us now.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no stopping us now, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Increasingly, moving forward, funding from
that industry is going to supplant and
[SPEAKER_00]: supplement the funding from
philanthropists.
[SPEAKER_00]: God bless them, who we've had to rely on
all of these years for funding this
[SPEAKER_00]: movement, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Time for the industry to step up and start
doing its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we don't need to speculate
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens when we do reform the laws,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's like this long, long demonstrable
track record of benefits that flow to
[SPEAKER_00]: reformed states, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Jobs, up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Investment, up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tourism, up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Construction, up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pharmaceutical, drug fatality,
down.
[SPEAKER_00]: 25%.
[SPEAKER_00]: 17,000 lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: 17,000 lives we've saved, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Binge drinking, down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Domestic violence, down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Violent crime, down, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: The list of benefits is so long and so
impressive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just going to powerfully,
powerfully reinforce the efforts of all of
[SPEAKER_00]: these activists who increasingly are going
to be funded by individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're going to see in the
industry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And this acceleration, this acceleration
of reform, right, has brought a whole new
[SPEAKER_00]: wave, a whole new wave of professionals
into the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: People who just didn't feel safe before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're bringing with them a whole new
range of experience and skills and
[SPEAKER_00]: credibility that we've never had in the
industry before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of those professionals have
started the first dedicated investment
[SPEAKER_00]: funds in the space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the investments that those funds are
making are in turn attracting even more
[SPEAKER_00]: folks, more professionals, more seasoned
people coming into the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they, their presence is really
powerfully dampening the stigma that's
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have lots of friends and lots of
influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the stigma is being reduced and
reform is accelerating as a result of
[SPEAKER_00]: their presence, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the financial success of the industry
is encouraging and motivating ever
[SPEAKER_00]: increasing numbers of individuals,
of businesses, of organizations,
[SPEAKER_00]: of elected representatives who maybe they
were opposed to us a few years ago or at
[SPEAKER_00]: best neutral.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're like turning into our best
friends.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're promoting and defending the
industry, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: America loves a winner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're winning now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a big difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that doesn't mean there's not bad news.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still plenty of bad news in the
world of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just saw the Neanderthals at the DEA
for the umpteenth time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Despite the mountain of evidence,
to the contrary, refuse to reschedule or
[SPEAKER_00]: deschedule cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, Big Pharma right there by
their sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most disgusting things that
I've seen recently in the world of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis is this company called Insys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Insys is the large, is the manufacturer of
fentanyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the most deadly and addictive
substances on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You may have been hearing about all these
people who are dropping dead across the
[SPEAKER_00]: country because of fentanyl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well these disorganization, right,
is the largest funder of the no campaign
[SPEAKER_00]: on cannabis legalization in Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that despicable?
[SPEAKER_00]: So still bad news.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still way too many of our sisters and our
brothers who are getting arrested.
[SPEAKER_00]: My friend James Sladek is here somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And James just had this horrible thing
happen to him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's far too many people that are
getting arrested and are being put on
[SPEAKER_00]: trial and are being, their lives are being
ruined still to this day in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: across the country, around the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're disproportionately people of
color.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, there's still some things we have
to get done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes, sometimes the bad news is just
like the flip side of the good news,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing the passage of regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like everywhere I see counties,
cities, states, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're never going to get cannabis into the
medicine cabinet of every American family
[SPEAKER_00]: without those kinds of regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for some people, for some legacy
cannabis entrepreneurs, for many people,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to have devastating effect
like the MRSA regulations are going to on
[SPEAKER_00]: small manufacturers and small growers in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's wonderful to see new entrants
coming into the industry with new skills
[SPEAKER_00]: and new abilities to reach out to the
mainstream and new ways to influence
[SPEAKER_00]: decision makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they often also come along with a much
greater ability to get financing,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get capital, to scale up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes they introduce disruptive
business models to the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: that force people like me to change the
way that we've done things for years and
[SPEAKER_00]: sometimes decades, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we're going to have to learn to adapt.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the folks who have been in this
industry for 10 or 20 years, are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: need to adapt to a greatly heightened
level of competitive intensity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to have to learn how to
work together with people who come from
[SPEAKER_00]: very different backgrounds than ours,
very different cultures, and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: different value sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the financial success of the industry
is, it's wonderful, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to see people coming in who
really know how to make money,
[SPEAKER_00]: but sometimes we see those folks who are
coming into the industry using their
[SPEAKER_00]: established financial power and their
political influence to create protected
[SPEAKER_00]: niches for themselves in the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, one really close to home example of
that in the state of California is the
[SPEAKER_00]: mandatory distribution requirements in the
newly passed medical cannabis regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were enacted at the behest of what I
call the unholy alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big alcohol, the Teamsters Union,
and the law enforcement organizations,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: None of those organizations have ever been
friends of our movement or lifted a finger
[SPEAKER_00]: to make cannabis legal, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the provision that they're backing
could double or triple the price of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis for medical patients in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other examples of this kind of
nonsense around the country.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, Nevada Initiative has a provision in
it that exclusively gives all distribution
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses for cannabis to alcohol
companies, exclusively.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or Florida's kinda sorta maybe almost
medical cannabis law that restricts
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses to nurseries that have been in
existence for 30 years or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, manipulation of legislation,
of regulation has already become a central
[SPEAKER_00]: business tactic, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And new and existing cannabis businesses
are gonna need to be prepared to engage
[SPEAKER_00]: with regulatory agencies, to engage with
legislators, to defend their interests and
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that this is a market they can
continue to participate in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And more flip side of good news,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to see capital finally flowing
into the industry because for a long time
[SPEAKER_00]: it was one of the major obstacles we had.
[SPEAKER_00]: To growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that capital is coming in largely at
the service of the strongest and most
[SPEAKER_00]: successful companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those companies are using the capital
to grow and to consolidate their
[SPEAKER_00]: positions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as they do that, there will be more of
them and less smaller companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're at the beginning of the classic bell
curve that you see in all boom industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes like this, okay, the bell curve.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're right at the beginning of it
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where it's shooting up really,
really quickly, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got new entrepreneurs and new
investors.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're jumping in every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's gonna keep happening for a
couple of years, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But eventually, at some point,
the market does, what it does,
[SPEAKER_00]: it does its job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weaker players are going to start
dropping out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the stronger players are going to
start consolidating.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that curve is going to level out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's gonna start dropping.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it may go down as steeply as it went
up and will eventually level out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what does that mean for us?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does life in the bell curve mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really important that we
consider this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the things that it means is
that the first ones now may later be last.
[SPEAKER_00]: The person who today is your employee may
well in a few years be your employer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or your investor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or vice versa.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of us really know how this horse race
is going to turn out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's be kind and gentle with each
other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's seek out the human qualities that we
really love and appreciate in one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's build real relationships that are
enduring enough to carry us through
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever turbulence these times bring us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all brought together by this plan,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are all one people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is massive change?
[SPEAKER_00]: Massive change.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we're seeing all this massive
change all over the place.
[SPEAKER_00]: New entrants, new laws, new strategies,
new capital, new tactics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing increasing numbers of
general practitioners who are recommending
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not cannabis stocks, but GPs, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because there's this increasing acceptance
of cannabis in the mainstream.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got guys like Sanjay Gupta saying
that it's okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're seeing the creation of more
standard forms of cannabis therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_00]: More capsules, more tinctures,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that in turn is encouraging even more
GPs to write recommendations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which in turn is creating demand for more
of these products, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's this very beneficial loop that's
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now we can look ahead to the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just had some really fascinating
conversations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like 20 minutes ago about this,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We are now coming to the day where instead
of just working with THC and CBD and one
[SPEAKER_00]: or two other cannabinoids, we're gonna
start pulling out all of the many
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoids that there are in the plant,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: We've looked at maybe 15 out of 450,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: That treasure chest is opening up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we see other stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pushing us forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: Other innovation, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: New cannabis formats.
[SPEAKER_00]: Products like vape pens and beverages and
transdermal patches.
[SPEAKER_00]: More socially acceptable forms of
ingesting cannabis than sucking on a bong
[SPEAKER_00]: or rolling up a joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those new formats are bringing in even
more new adopters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day we see more and more people who
are willing to consider cannabis because
[SPEAKER_00]: it doesn't look like the stereotype that
they had in their head, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: National brands, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: We now have national cannabis brands that
are like known across the country,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, institutional finance is not gonna
be far behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can hear their footsteps in the hallway
already, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when they come, there's gonna be a
wave of really big acquisitions and rich
[SPEAKER_00]: exits for cannabis companies that have
been smart, that have played their cards
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I mean, you can already see it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at horticulture, where Scott's
Miracle Grow just bought General Hydro,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Next, quite possibly, probably,
I think are gonna be cannabis companies
[SPEAKER_00]: focused on the science and medicine of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Analytical laboratories, extraction
technologies, geneticists, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we will see rescheduling or
de-scheduling and when that happens,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will kick off a wave of pharmaceutical
R&D.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those pharmaceutical companies are
gonna wanna acquire the research,
[SPEAKER_00]: the data, the techniques, the team,
the brand of these companies that have
[SPEAKER_00]: been focusing on cannabis for a while so
that they can get first to market
[SPEAKER_00]: advantage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, I don't know, then after that,
maybe we see cannabis beverage and food
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that have developed a lot of
traction and brand equity in the market
[SPEAKER_00]: being acquired by large corporations that
have already existing footprints in food
[SPEAKER_00]: production and beverage production,
distribution, and they're basically
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly positioned to just add cannabis
to their list of ingredients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, that's what's gonna happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be more waves like that that
come.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what we're seeing is the first signs
of what's going to be a monumental
[SPEAKER_00]: collision between the world of cannabis
and the world of corporations.
[SPEAKER_00]: That collision is gonna be wrenching,
it's gonna be jarring, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: shocking like all collisions are.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, if we take a moment and we
think about it, that collision has been
[SPEAKER_00]: inevitable ever since we started working
on legalization all of those years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because nothing, nothing in the United
States of America is mainstream until it's
[SPEAKER_00]: in the mainstream of commerce.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, taking this plant into the
mainstream of commerce, which is
[SPEAKER_00]: controlled by the world of corporations,
has to be, it has to be a part of our job.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I say that to you as a legacy cannabis
person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of my very dearest friends in this
world, people whose children I was there
[SPEAKER_00]: to see their birth and watch them grow up
and have children of their own,
[SPEAKER_00]: are gonna be really seriously hurt in this
collision.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the people who, some of the people
who are most responsible for bringing us
[SPEAKER_00]: to the state that we are here today,
this good day that we're at, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I wanna take a moment to speak
directly to those of you who, like me,
[SPEAKER_00]: carried this plant so faithfully,
for so long, through so many years of the
[SPEAKER_00]: darkness of prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: Around 50 years ago, probably by some
divine stroke of providence, this plant
[SPEAKER_00]: fell into the hands of our people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we opened our arms and we embraced
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: We gave her a home.
[SPEAKER_00]: We nurtured her.
[SPEAKER_00]: We protected her.
[SPEAKER_00]: We watched her grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: We defended her against the people that
would have ended her existence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we fought ferociously for a long time
for her liberation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has not been easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It hasn't been easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have been made sacrifices.
[SPEAKER_00]: There have been all kinds of sacrifices by
many, many people over a period of many
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most painful kinds of sacrifices that
human beings really can make.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've had violent raids on homes,
properties seized, our cars and our bank
[SPEAKER_00]: accounts taken away, even our children
yanked away from their mother's arms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been arrested and jailed and
sentenced and subject to extraordinarily
[SPEAKER_00]: long prison terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes people have even lost their
lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we still gladly welcomed cannabis into
our homes and into our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over time, she came to feel like one
of ours, like one of our family members.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in those years, it's only been
natural for us to develop a sense of
[SPEAKER_00]: possessiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: A sense that this plant should in some way
belong to those of us who have loved her
[SPEAKER_00]: so well and sacrificed so much on her
behalf.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we need to remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's hard sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, these thoughts, I feel them
almost everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every day, sometimes multiple times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who are these people?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are they doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have to remember what we really
know in our hearts to be true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is that no creation of nature
belongs to any human being.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this plant, no matter how much we
love her, does not belong to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are not her owners.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are her stewards.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are her caregivers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are her protectors.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she didn't come into our hands so that
we could become rich.
[SPEAKER_00]: She came into our hands to help us change
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all my brothers and sisters there,
OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm talking to the dreadlock warriors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to the rainbow
revolutionaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to the radical fairies.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking to the wise earth mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all know who you are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going to be called upon to make
one more final sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are being called upon now, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's going to be to let this little
sprout that we have tended with such care
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow up and claim her real destiny.
[SPEAKER_00]: To be able to reach out all around the
world and come into the hands in a legal
[SPEAKER_00]: way of everybody on this beautiful planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we know the promise of cannabis
belongs to every human being because every
[SPEAKER_00]: single last one of us has an
endocannabinoid system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we can't do that alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: Our arms aren't long enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not enough of us to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And fortunately, that help is coming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's coming in the form of newcomers
who are coming into our industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we need to welcome them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to help them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: If we don't, we're never going to finish
this job.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also want to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The newcomers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those of you who have come to the
movement, come to the industry after a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: of the heavy lifting has been done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Show some respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate the decades of struggle and
sacrifice that it has taken us to come to
[SPEAKER_00]: this day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Understand that for many of us,
this isn't just a living or a way to build
[SPEAKER_00]: wealth or a product or even an innovation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is our teacher and our guide.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in some cases, our sacrament.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who don't write off the legacy cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know this plant and the culture that we
have built around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Better than the very best of Wall Street
analysts.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're the best subject matter experts that
you will ever find anywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so we got this collision happening,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, like I said, it is going to
be shocking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will be painful.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the key to turning all of this
to something that has value and meaning
[SPEAKER_00]: and purpose?
[SPEAKER_00]: And is consistent with our love for this
plant, OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think what we need to make absolutely
certain of is that cannabis changes the
[SPEAKER_00]: world of corporations more than
corporations change the world of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: This plant has been doing just fine for
millennia.
[SPEAKER_00]: Giving sustenance and healing to human
beings and doing nothing to harm the rest
[SPEAKER_00]: of nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: But corporate culture has taken us to the
brink of planetary extinction in just a
[SPEAKER_00]: few centuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's only been a few centuries we've had
these things called corporations,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK?
[SPEAKER_00]: And look where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to make absolutely certain that
we cannibize corporations more than
[SPEAKER_00]: corporations corporatize cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So big goal, big goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Big dreams.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a dreamer, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: They told me that 40 years ago,
too, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'll tell you why I'm hopeful.
[SPEAKER_00]: A couple of reasons I'm hopeful about
achieving that goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of them is the many conversations that
I have with people who have just come into
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry from the straight corporate
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over and over and over again,
they're like, Steve, it's so different
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't have to put a mask on in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have to hide who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I care about during the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: My life has a meaning and purpose.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are more tolerant of me and my
quirks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're more forgiving.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're more caring.
[SPEAKER_00]: I enjoy my life more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I look at them, I know it's true,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it in their eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it in the lift in their step.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can see it in the smile in their faces.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so why is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that one of the reasons is the
inherent properties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of this plan, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Its ability to spark creativity and to
extend patience.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to inspire togetherness amongst
people, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not gonna stop happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another reason I have hope is because our
industry is different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's different in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: The product that we work with is one of
those big differences.
[SPEAKER_00]: But another is that this is an industry
that grew out of a social justice
[SPEAKER_00]: movement.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a very strange dynamic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many industries have grown out of a
social justice movement?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the people who created this thing,
we weren't people who cared about creating
[SPEAKER_00]: wealth so much as we cared about changing
the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we started this thing 50 years ago,
we didn't know that cannabis could cure
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or prevent Alzheimer's.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or help epileptic kids, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: All we knew was that when we smoked this
plant, when we smoked this flower,
[SPEAKER_00]: it helped us become more like the people
that we really wanted to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've tried to carry that
sensibility into the organizations and
[SPEAKER_00]: into the businesses that we've built.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tried to infuse that sensibility
into the entire culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: To use what we're building as a vehicle
for social justice.
[SPEAKER_00]: For social change as a way to create this
new way of life.
[SPEAKER_00]: That we're all looking forward to.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think everybody's looking
forward to it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, do we really need to create
just another new industry like every other
[SPEAKER_00]: global industry out there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do we need more of them?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: We need a new kind of industry that's
gonna unleash transformational change.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna break the corporate mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's gonna be a lot of wealth and
fabulous careers that are gonna happen in
[SPEAKER_00]: this industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And many of the people who will enjoy
those benefits are in this room today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if all that we have to show for
ourselves at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_00]: 20 or 30 years from now, when we look over
our shoulders, are those riches?
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll have blown the most valuable
opportunity that's in front of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's to create this new country.
[SPEAKER_00]: A new kind of industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: The future is in our hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a blank slate.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting this really from the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still just in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: The revolution has just begun,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what this thing is going to become is
in all of our hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's make sure that what we create,
that the world that we leave to our
[SPEAKER_00]: children is a world that takes the lessons
that cannabis teaches us seriously,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what does that mean, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: That means a world where leaders are no
longer so ostentatious and they're held
[SPEAKER_00]: more to account.
[SPEAKER_00]: A world where gender roles are more fluid,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: A world where bottom line calculations
always include returns to communities and
[SPEAKER_00]: workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: A world where sustainability is a basic
threshold of all new ventures,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where people are kinder and gentler to
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where disputes are solved peacefully,
more peacefully, more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where parents spend more time playing
with their kids and where couples spend
[SPEAKER_00]: more intimate moments with each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where violence of all kinds drops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where we finally have a place,
an honored place in our society for all of
[SPEAKER_00]: the flavors of human beings that we are
blessed with, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the future of cannabis,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the future of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what we can really achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people say, Steve, you're playing the
long game.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I am playing the long game,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the future that I want.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the future that is in our
hands.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's what we can achieve.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we really take the lessons that this
plant teaches us seriously, if we really
[SPEAKER_00]: demand of ourselves that we become the
people that we really want to be,
[SPEAKER_00]: this is an amazing chance and we should
take it, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think that we can afford to blow
this opportunity, this greatest
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity that any of us will have in
our lives because look around at the world
[SPEAKER_00]: today, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at what we're dealing with,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're created technology that's on the
verge of cooking this planet into an
[SPEAKER_00]: inhabitable cinder, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Every time I turn on the news and I see
what's happening, I hear about more people
[SPEAKER_00]: blowing themselves up, more people killing
each other for the most ridiculous of
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: So is there ever a time, has there ever
been a time that this plant, that the
[SPEAKER_00]: wisdom that this plant teaches is more in
need by the world?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think it's going too far to
suggest that the future and the fate of
[SPEAKER_00]: our world could depend on the future of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's all get this job done.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's win on November 7th.
[SPEAKER_00]: I look forward to partying with you that
night and throughout the coming year.
