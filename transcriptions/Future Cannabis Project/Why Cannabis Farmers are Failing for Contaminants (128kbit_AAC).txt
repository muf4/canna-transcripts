[SPEAKER_00]: Essentially, the question is problems in
the regulated era that farmers are facing
[SPEAKER_00]: as far as rigorous testing procedures,
failing for contaminants that we didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: even know existed, and maybe some possible
ways that we can mitigate those
[SPEAKER_00]: difficulties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a little background about myself,
I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use a microscope to analyze soil
biology.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been working with Elaine Ingham for
the past three years very closely.
[SPEAKER_00]: She offers some classes online.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took those early on and then continued
with everything she put out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I took the online classes that Dr. Elaine
Ingham offered, and at a certain point,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you finish all the classes,
you have the opportunity to work on a
[SPEAKER_00]: one-year mentorship where you become
certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I started that, it was in the infancy
of the program, so I got to work directly
[SPEAKER_00]: with her on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She literally walked me through a lot of
the procedures of helping some of these
[SPEAKER_00]: larger-scale farmers make it at this new
scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was a very valuable experience to
have her interpret what I was seeing in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that was a really unique
opportunity for me that was extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: valuable and has turned into some really
fantastic insights as to where the
[SPEAKER_00]: problems are starting and what are some
rational, cost-effective solutions to get
[SPEAKER_00]: through that process and actually produce
material that can be tested afterward and
[SPEAKER_00]: make it through the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how we use the microscope in that
situation is we can count the organisms in
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil, and based on different
populations or different ratios of
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms to different organisms,
it can speak to the volatility or the
[SPEAKER_00]: stability of the system, which can also
tell us where pest or disease pressure is
[SPEAKER_00]: likely to come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we move to this larger scale,
we can look really tightly and
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically with this microscope and say,
we actually have a problem in Group 2 and
[SPEAKER_00]: Bay 3.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to send employees in to
spray everything every Monday.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to address the underlying issue
with the environment in the corner of the
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And being able to mathematically quantify
what's happening in the soil, it's led to
[SPEAKER_00]: an intense understanding of how the
environment is negatively affecting the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil, that is negatively affecting plant
health, which is leading us to use really
[SPEAKER_00]: toxic chemicals.
[SPEAKER_00]: By looking very precisely at the groups of
plants across the facility, we can then
[SPEAKER_00]: zoom way out of that and look at it on a
macro scale as like an F-grade and a
[SPEAKER_00]: C-grade and an A-grade, and F-grades
become red boxes on the thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can zoom out, and an example that I
just saw is five long beds in a
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouse, and the water comes in at the
center between bed 2 and 3, and the
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure is highest there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so beds 2 and 3 get overwatered and
slightly saturated, and so they spend more
[SPEAKER_00]: time of the day not producing nutrients
because the organisms are really specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: They operate during very tight tolerances
of moisture, and so those two beds are
[SPEAKER_00]: creating an over-saturating event that
shuts down nutrient cycling and negatively
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts soil stability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can see that mathematically with
the different organisms that are there or
[SPEAKER_00]: are not there, and percentages of
disease-causing fungi to beneficial fungi.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been able to use the microscope
to mathematically quantify the organisms
[SPEAKER_00]: in the soil, which can give us an
indication as to where the problem is
[SPEAKER_00]: coming from, whether it's a hostile
environment that's negatively impacting
[SPEAKER_00]: the soil environment or an overwatering
event, which is suffocating the aerobic
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen-loving organisms, creating mold
pressure, or from overfeeding,
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly overstimulating the system,
which is 99% of living soil farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are way overdoing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because there's not enough to
process this massive amount of nutrients
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to cram into the top of a
pot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this really beautiful shift
that's happening from people going from
[SPEAKER_00]: these really toxic, really harsh growing
styles to more sustainable, respectable
[SPEAKER_00]: farming styles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally, genuinely, the biggest
obstacle to doing that is changing your
[SPEAKER_00]: mindset.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're coming from a nutrient-quantity
style farming where we need to put this
[SPEAKER_00]: many PPMs into a reservoir to get a
certain plant growth response and yield
[SPEAKER_00]: and turn that into a harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we take that mentality into the
living soils, we're constantly throwing
[SPEAKER_00]: way too many nutrients on top to cram them
into the system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if we have a deprived biological
system, meaning we only have bacteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's all that's available in
over-the-table products, and most compost
[SPEAKER_00]: lacks an actual soil food web.
[SPEAKER_00]: So most people are growing with just
bacteria.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the soil, bacteria mineralize nutrients
and store them in their body.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're the fertilizer bags of the
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for those to become plant available
and do something beneficial for our plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: we need a predator to eat it and rip the
top off of that bag and make it plant
[SPEAKER_00]: available for our plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's literally what's happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a bunch of things, eating other
things, creating nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And almost everything that we're doing is
hindering that thing and also this thing
[SPEAKER_00]: that is not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can zoom in really closely,
count the organisms, and zoom out and go,
[SPEAKER_00]: what is about the layout of this facility
that's causing this situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is about our process that is creating
a disturbance event in group two that is
[SPEAKER_00]: leading to pest pressure and disease
susceptibility?
[SPEAKER_00]: An example of this would be standard 30 by
96 greenhouse with five long beds in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water comes into the center between bed
two and three, and that's where the water
[SPEAKER_00]: pressure is highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So out of the drip tape, those beds get
slightly oversaturated compared to the
[SPEAKER_00]: other five beds.
[SPEAKER_00]: This effect in its own can lead to pest
and disease pressure later on in the life
[SPEAKER_00]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant for two reasons, organisms are
really specific when they operate with
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture percentages being a big important
factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as moisture gets too high, these
organisms that are producing nutrients go
[SPEAKER_00]: to sleep and they go dormant and they wait
till conditions become ideal for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: execute.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we overwater those beds,
it puts everything to sleep and they're
[SPEAKER_00]: slower to wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those plants have nutrient cycling
issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if the water amount is too much after
a certain threshold, you actually start to
[SPEAKER_00]: deprive oxygen so much that the dormancy
becomes death.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the fungi and these other organisms
that create soil structure naturally to
[SPEAKER_00]: allow the natural storage of the water
die.
[SPEAKER_00]: Soil structure collapses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now it is the same effect to your root
system as if a hydroponic reservoir took
[SPEAKER_00]: the aeration out.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the same effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the same problems we see over here in
hydroponics, and we don't have enough
[SPEAKER_00]: aeration to the root zone, that same thing
is happening in our living soil bed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we can't pick that plant up and look
at the roots and see that they're brown
[SPEAKER_00]: and look like dready ropes because that's
under the soil and we don't look at it
[SPEAKER_00]: that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in that situation with the five
beds, we just adjust the water and then we
[SPEAKER_00]: can count the organisms again and see that
the tides have changed or if they haven't
[SPEAKER_00]: changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically we can see if an effect or if a
change was effective within seven to ten
[SPEAKER_00]: days, and you can take a soil that is...
Straight up most problems are from excess
[SPEAKER_00]: saturation right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll answer this more thoroughly,
but an actual usable answer is we have an
[SPEAKER_00]: intense pressure on farmers from the
investors to produce widgets.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so people are feeding twice a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are feeding multiple times a day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're upping, they're upping,
they're pushing, they're pushing,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're pushing, they're pushing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And from a biological standpoint,
the floor of that abandoned rose grower
[SPEAKER_00]: house is loaded with disease-causing fungi
and spores, and we can count those and see
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we just pour water all over this
facility that the soil is loaded with
[SPEAKER_00]: water molds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those things spore and germinate and
attack your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And literally it's because their water
molds and they can only transfer on a film
[SPEAKER_00]: of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the more times we leave a film of water
everywhere, that's the more we're
[SPEAKER_00]: spreading, proliferating, and creating
disease to fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's a specific answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But mathematically,
[SPEAKER_00]: depending on the populations of the
disease-causing organisms, we've just seen
[SPEAKER_00]: enough now that most people are following
the same four trends, most people are
[SPEAKER_00]: following the same four recommendations
that have worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have merit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not discounting things we do because
we're able to do them more than once.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a component of effectiveness
that allows the technique to keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as we move into the regulated era,
the material we're producing is being more
[SPEAKER_00]: tightly analyzed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a proactive approach can avoid costly
errors in the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's essentially when we've really
done the most work is after somebody just
[SPEAKER_00]: had a confiscation, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we talk about the confiscation,
try to identify where the problem came
[SPEAKER_00]: from, try to change the soil environment
so it's more conducive to thriving and not
[SPEAKER_00]: disease.
So that's what we're trying to do.
