[SPEAKER_00]: Dave, this is your waning days now as the
Insurance Commissioner, and I have met you
[SPEAKER_00]: as a lawyer coming to provide professional
services to the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've worked with you and your office a lot
to try to bring insurance to that
[SPEAKER_00]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just give folks a sense of what the
California Department of Insurance has
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing, what your goal has been,
and sort of what the success stories sort
[SPEAKER_00]: of look like in that arena.
[SPEAKER_01]: When the voters decided to legalize adult
recreational use of cannabis, I
[SPEAKER_01]: immediately set out to make sure there's
insurance available for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure that the second a
consumer walks into a cannabis retailer,
[SPEAKER_01]: the second an employee works for a
cannabis business, the second a seller of
[SPEAKER_01]: goods and services, a vendor to the
cannabis industry sells a product,
[SPEAKER_01]: that there's insurance to cover all of
those various ways in which consumers,
[SPEAKER_01]: workers, businesses, investors,
owners, and operators interact with the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's my mission as Insurance
Commissioner, insurance protection for all
[SPEAKER_01]: Californians.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge, of course, is that you're
talking about a newly legalized industry
[SPEAKER_01]: for which there isn't a lot of experience,
so we've done everything we can to try to
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage the carriers to come into this
space, including meetings you've attended
[SPEAKER_01]: where we've brought together insurance
company executives with leaders from the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry so the executives can
better understand the degree of risk
[SPEAKER_01]: management, transparency, and
professionalism of the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've led tours of major cannabis
businesses with senior underwriters from
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance companies so they can see
firsthand how the cannabis industry works,
[SPEAKER_01]: its degree of professionalism,
risk management, and transparency.
[SPEAKER_01]: We held the First in the Nation public
hearing to highlight where there are
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance gaps and where we need insurers
to come in, and we've had some success.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got the first admitted carrier in the
nation, Golden Bear, a California company,
[SPEAKER_01]: to begin writing last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Since then, we have Continental Health
Heritage, which is offering a products
[SPEAKER_01]: liability product.
[SPEAKER_01]: California Mutual is now offering a
product for those landlords that are
[SPEAKER_01]: leasing to, and as well we have about 30
surplus line writers that are writing as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're excited about the growth of this
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it's only going to get better over
time, but there are challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you spoke to the challenges that lie
ahead for the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: For folks that are in the insurance
markets, for folks that are in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry, what do you see those
sort of challenges are, if you have any
[SPEAKER_00]: thoughts about how they sort of overcome
those, and maybe what do you see in the
[SPEAKER_00]: days ahead, or what do you hope to see in
the days ahead in terms of the insurance
[SPEAKER_00]: markets coming to this space?
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think the upside for the insurance
industry is very, very positive.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a tremendous demand, and the
cannabis industry is only going to
[SPEAKER_01]: continue to grow in California and
elsewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge is the continued federal
schedule of cannabis as an illegal
[SPEAKER_01]: substance, and that has caused some
hesitancy amongst some of the carriers.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I tell the insurance company
executives is I think the risk is zero of
[SPEAKER_01]: federal intervention.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no recorded case where the federal
government has investigated or taken some
[SPEAKER_01]: enforcement action against insurance
company writing for cannabis, and we're
[SPEAKER_01]: already starting to see admitted carriers
come into this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that is the one thing that's still out
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think as we see more states fully
legalize cannabis, as we see our neighbors
[SPEAKER_01]: to the north, Canada fully legalizing,
I think we're going to see the federal
[SPEAKER_01]: government ultimately change too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my hope is the insurance industry
doesn't wait for that because there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: demand now, and this is an industry that's
going to be very loyal to those that are
[SPEAKER_01]: willing to come in early, and I think
there's really benefits for the insurance
[SPEAKER_01]: industry to get in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've definitely seen that from the legal
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Being a firm, the first full-service
national law firm to come into this space
[SPEAKER_00]: and say, we're comfortable doing business
with this industry, those companies that
[SPEAKER_00]: see you there early like that,
they respect that, they'll go back to you
[SPEAKER_00]: and do business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's a great message for
insurance carriers, that if you are first
[SPEAKER_00]: to market, there are going to be loyalty
in that respect.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the things that I've started to
learn and sort of sense as I've been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: more work within this industry is that
it's getting bigger and it's starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: become something that's looked at as a
global market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, there's some complications
there when you're talking about U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: companies but certainly there's Canadian
concerns that are putting money into the U
[SPEAKER_00]: .S.
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are U.S.
[SPEAKER_00]: companies that are going to the Canadian
markets to go public, for example,
[SPEAKER_00]: or do fundraising.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's obviously going to be trade
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the industry, there's a lot of
actors in the industry that want to be in
[SPEAKER_00]: multiple jurisdictions, that want to be in
multiple countries, and I know that you've
[SPEAKER_00]: been doing work to basically take all the
work that you've done here in California
[SPEAKER_00]: and try to export that and really teach
people the success stories of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: worked here, what hasn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe just speak to that about what you're
doing with the National Association of
[SPEAKER_00]: Insurance Commissioners, what the
receptiveness has been in other states or
[SPEAKER_00]: other jurisdictions to talk about this
issue outside of California.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insurance, unlike every other financial
product, is regulated at the state level.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a national system of state
regulation.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are insurance commissioners in all
50 states and in the six territories.
[SPEAKER_01]: As more and more states legalize cannabis
in one way, shape, or form, all of them
[SPEAKER_01]: are facing the need for insurance in their
markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: What I propose to our National Association
of Insurance Commissioners, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: body that sets the standards for insurance
regulation for commissioners throughout
[SPEAKER_01]: the nation, was that we form a cannabis
insurance working group so that we could
[SPEAKER_01]: learn what's happening in each state's
market, learn what regulators are doing to
[SPEAKER_01]: try to foster more insurance companies to
come into the market, and so that we could
[SPEAKER_01]: take some of the positive results we've
had here in California and share those
[SPEAKER_01]: with other states.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have formed that working group.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was appointed its chair, and we're very
excited, and the level of participation
[SPEAKER_01]: from the other states has been fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some 30 or so other states
commissioners eager to be involved in one
[SPEAKER_01]: way, shape, or form.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our objective is to prepare what's called
a white paper, which will lay out what the
[SPEAKER_01]: availability is, where the insurance gaps
are, where the opportunities are for the
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance industry, but also more
importantly, what are the things that
[SPEAKER_01]: regulators can do to encourage more
insurance companies and surplus lines
[SPEAKER_01]: riders to come into this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: We really appreciate the help of the
National Cannabis Industry Association,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as the California Cannabis
Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're helping us put together some of
the background information we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: identify where the gaps are state by
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have our next national
meeting of insurance commissioners in San
[SPEAKER_01]: Francisco in November.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have a meeting of the working group.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're excited that we're going to have a
number of cannabis industry leaders
[SPEAKER_01]: testifying there, and I think for some
insurance commissioners, this will be
[SPEAKER_01]: their first opportunity to really hear
directly from the cannabis industry what
[SPEAKER_01]: their needs are, so we're excited about
that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beyond that, just anecdotally,
if a lawyer in another state or an
[SPEAKER_00]: operator in another state or a broker or a
caretaker in another state is watching
[SPEAKER_00]: this and wants to know how to sort of
influence that or become a part of that
[SPEAKER_00]: discussion, outside of joining CCI or
NCIA, how would you recommend that they
[SPEAKER_00]: get their voice sort of heard with
commissioners in your state or in other
[SPEAKER_00]: states?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think certainly NCIA and CCI are
great platforms for all professionals and
[SPEAKER_01]: all entrepreneurs and business owners and
operators in this space, and I would
[SPEAKER_01]: encourage brokers and lawyers to get
involved with the CCIA working group,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is focused specifically on
insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has insurance professionals,
lawyers like yourself and others from
[SPEAKER_01]: Wilson-Elser, as well as brokers like
NextGen and others that are actively in
[SPEAKER_01]: this space, so getting involved with that
working group is a way to learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as well, there's been some really good
online information that's been provided.
[SPEAKER_01]: The National Association of Insurance
Commissioners has a Center on Insurance
[SPEAKER_01]: Research, which did a webinar just the
other month that your partner,
[SPEAKER_01]: Ian Stewart, participated in, as well as
Golden Bear Insurance Company and me
[SPEAKER_01]: representing the regulators, and that
provides a great overview of some of the
[SPEAKER_01]: recent developments in this space,
so go to the neic.org website,
[SPEAKER_01]: plug in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can find a recording, a video of this
online webinar and plunge right in.
Perfect, perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you maybe speak to sort of what are
the more recent developments in insurance
[SPEAKER_00]: availability specific to this cannabis
industry?
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've been really excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: As I said, we were able to get the first
admitted carrier in the country,
[SPEAKER_01]: Golden Bear Insurance Company,
to begin writing and to file with our
[SPEAKER_01]: department a general business liability
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well, we've seen a number of other
admitted carriers come into this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Continental Heritage is now writing a
product liability product that we've
[SPEAKER_01]: approved in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: California Mutual Insurance Company is
writing a insurance product for landlords
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've had a number of companies we've
approved to write surety bonds,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a requirement of our state
licensing regime for cannabis businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another important development is the
American Association of Insurance
[SPEAKER_01]: Services, AAIS, which is what's called an
insurance service organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've prepared a standardized policy
form that can be used by their members,
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of plug and play.
[SPEAKER_01]: They filed it with us, we've approved it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great development because now
insurance companies that are members of
[SPEAKER_01]: AAIS don't have to reinvent the wheel
themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can take what's called the Cannabop
policy program and begin to write right
[SPEAKER_01]: away.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're really excited about these
developments.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's more to come.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm continuing to be out there
encouraging, encouraging, encouraging more
[SPEAKER_01]: companies, more service providers,
surplus lines writers to get into this
[SPEAKER_01]: space.
[SPEAKER_00]: The cannabis operator that's out there,
why do they care about what the Department
[SPEAKER_00]: of Insurance is doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why do they care whether there's surplus
lines insurance versus admitted carriers
[SPEAKER_00]: involved?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe speak to them about why it's
important that they really get involved to
[SPEAKER_00]: see that this all develops in a way that
benefits them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like any other industry, the cannabis
industry faces financial risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Insurance is a great way to mitigate those
risks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to protect yourself from loss.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we had some of the worst
wildfires, for example, in the state's
[SPEAKER_01]: history in 2017.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there was a grower in Northern
California that purchased an insurance
[SPEAKER_01]: policy from a surplus lines writer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And thankfully they had that policy
because even though their product was
[SPEAKER_01]: heavily impacted by ash and other various
particulate matter thrown up by the fire,
[SPEAKER_01]: they were able to recover against that
policy and help to cushion the blow of the
[SPEAKER_01]: fire on their business.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just one example.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reason why cannabis businesses
should be supportive of what we're doing
[SPEAKER_01]: is because it's in their interest to get
more insurance companies to write.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason we want more admitted carriers
to write is that those are the traditional
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance writers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with their entry in the market,
you're going to get more standardization,
[SPEAKER_01]: more capacity, and better pricing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's not to take anything away from
the surplus lines writers, which is the
[SPEAKER_01]: additional market that's out there right
now and the surplus lines brokers,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing a yeoman's job of providing
insurance coverage when it wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: available before.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're excited about them too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as this market matures, we'd like to
see more admitted carriers come in along
[SPEAKER_01]: with the surplus lines writers so that it
becomes a more mature market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have greater availability, greater
capacity, a better pricing for the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: More competition, that's the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the challenges that's obviously
going to face this market convergence of
[SPEAKER_00]: insurance and cannabis is going to be
insurance carriers trying to measure the
[SPEAKER_00]: risk and figure out how to write it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis industry operators buying
insurance products and then claims are
[SPEAKER_00]: going to hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Invariably, there's going to be some
disputes about what's covered,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's not, how those things are going to
be handled.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, your office is right there,
close to the ground on hearing what the
[SPEAKER_00]: concerns of the industry are, what their
frustrations or pain points are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe from your perspective, speak to the
industry about what you're hearing and if
[SPEAKER_00]: you have any creative thoughts about maybe
ways to bridge gaps between the carriers
[SPEAKER_00]: and the actual insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as insurance commissioner, I lead the
California Department of Insurance,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is a consumer protection agency.
[SPEAKER_01]: And part of our job is to regulate the way
in which the insurance companies respond
[SPEAKER_01]: to claims.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't adjudicate the claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not the judge over the claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a body of due process law and
procedures called the Fair Claim
[SPEAKER_01]: Settlement Practices Act that requires
fairness and reasonableness in the
[SPEAKER_01]: handling of the claim.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we get about 160,000 calls a year from
businesses across all sectors of the
[SPEAKER_01]: economy and consumers where they have an
issue with their insurance company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we go to bat, take a look at whether
the law has been properly followed.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it hasn't, then we ask the insurance
company to follow the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're successful each year in
returning hundreds of millions of dollars
[SPEAKER_01]: to consumers that they wouldn't otherwise
get.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with regard to cannabis, because it is
such a new product, and a new market,
[SPEAKER_01]: there are going to be these sorts of
disputes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And insurers themselves are trying to
figure out how best to write these
[SPEAKER_01]: policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's going to be a little bit of
a shakeout period.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would encourage people to contact us.
[SPEAKER_01]: People in the cannabis industry,
if they have a dispute with their
[SPEAKER_01]: insurance company and they're not able to
resolve it, call us at 1-800-927-4357 or
[SPEAKER_01]: go to our website, insurance.ca.gov.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can ask for our assistance.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll take a look at the insurance policy,
what you've been promised, what the
[SPEAKER_01]: exclusion are, what the coverage is,
and we'll assist you in trying to make
[SPEAKER_01]: sure that you're being treated in a fair
and reasonable way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We spoke earlier about bringing more
product to market, bringing different
[SPEAKER_00]: options, pricing, competitiveness.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know with your office's help and
leadership, the professionalism in that
[SPEAKER_00]: regard, in terms of what the policies say,
has really gone a great way during your
[SPEAKER_00]: administration.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know we as lawyers that typically
represent insurance companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: have been working with them and there's
been an appetite to get it right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think between what your office is
doing and what people like myself are
[SPEAKER_00]: doing with insurance companies,
to try to get it right, to try to get
[SPEAKER_00]: carriers involved in the space that want
to insure cannabis, are willing to insure
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, they want to pay a claim when
they are insuring a claim, I totally would
[SPEAKER_00]: agree with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to take some time to get it
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as long as both parties are sort of
part of that conversation, only good
[SPEAKER_00]: things could come and it's only going to
be better for the industry as a whole and
[SPEAKER_00]: for consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree and I think really appreciative of
your and your law firms and other lawyers
[SPEAKER_01]: that are active in this space and the
insurance industry and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: industry too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's been a real collaborative,
cooperative effort to try to make sure
[SPEAKER_01]: that there is insurance and that the terms
of that insurance are clear and explicit
[SPEAKER_01]: so that cannabis owners and operators know
what they're getting and so the insurers
[SPEAKER_01]: know what their obligations are as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes there are going to be
disputes but I don't think we're having
[SPEAKER_01]: any more disputes that we see anywhere
else.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's pretty significant because this
is a new area and so the fact that we
[SPEAKER_01]: don't see even more disputes I think
speaks highly of the good faith and the
[SPEAKER_01]: positive way in which lawyers and
insurance companies, brokers in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry are working together to
try to get this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really appreciate you saying that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know lawyers and insurance companies
have got terrible reputations inside and
[SPEAKER_00]: outside of cannabis but I think a lot of
cannabis operators view the insurance
[SPEAKER_00]: market with some level of skepticism and
they see people getting claims denied or
[SPEAKER_00]: things happening and they sort of view it
as, oh this is a business world against
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis but to your point, this stuff
happens in every walk of life and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: just trying... They deny claims in every
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, they deny claims in every industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to hear you say that it's sort of on
par with what you see everywhere,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's an important message for the
cannabis industry to hear so that they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't get discouraged by it, that they
stay engaged, that they continue to have a
[SPEAKER_00]: voice and stay engaged in the conversation
about how we make this insurance market
[SPEAKER_00]: more mature and more sophisticated to
serve them and protect the consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout California that are getting
these products that are coming out of this
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I just want to say I really appreciate
everything that your office has been doing
[SPEAKER_00]: and will continue to do through the end of
your term.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your staff's been wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hope that your successor will continue
to stay engaged, will continue to do the
[SPEAKER_00]: things that need to be done to make sure
that this industry has those protections
[SPEAKER_00]: because without it, it's not a safe
environment for not just the businesses
[SPEAKER_00]: but the consumers throughout California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really wanted to say I appreciate
your approach to this, your
[SPEAKER_00]: professionalism and your staff's really
willingness to cooperate with not only the
[SPEAKER_00]: lawyers in this space, not only the
insurance carriers in this space but the
[SPEAKER_00]: operators as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well I've made it a real priority of my
commissionership and have devoted
[SPEAKER_01]: substantial resources and staff time to it
because it's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure that anytime anybody
goes into a cannabis retail facility,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's insurance to cover that person.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to make sure when someone works for
a cannabis business, there's insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: When someone owns or operates a cannabis
business, there's insurance.
[SPEAKER_01]: This industry needs to be covered just
like any other industry because it is a
[SPEAKER_01]: legitimate business in California and
we've done everything we can to
[SPEAKER_01]: institutionalize this approach and to take
it national.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm confident that my successor,
whomever that might be, and the voters get
[SPEAKER_01]: to decide that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now I'll still be in office till early
January so I'm looking to see more
[SPEAKER_01]: carriers get into the market before I
leave in early January.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I've done everything I can to make
this a core part of the regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: approach of the California Department of
Insurance so that it won't be subject to
[SPEAKER_01]: the political winds or vagaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too important to politicize it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too important for California,
it's too important for consumers,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's too important for the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm confident that regardless of
who that successor is, this will continue
[SPEAKER_01]: to be a big part of the Department of
Insurance.
