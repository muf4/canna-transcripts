[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really glad that everyone's here to
have this discussion on materials,
[SPEAKER_01]: specifically biomaterials, but like
materials affect everyone's life.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a degree that I think sometimes
people forget about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like parents buying a new couch or office
managers buying holiday gifts or even the
[SPEAKER_01]: Olympic committee who is planning like the
LA Olympics are going to be the first zero
[SPEAKER_01]: waste and energy positive Olympics in
2024.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like everybody is really affected
by these materials and like what happens
[SPEAKER_01]: to these materials when we're done with
all of these products.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm glad that we can have this
discussion tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: First off, we're going to introduce
Jessica Aldridge, who has had a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: experience in sustainability and waste.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Jessica, do you want to tell us a
little bit about your journey?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I have worked in zero waste and
resource management and recycling world
[SPEAKER_00]: for 15 years almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am a sustainability and zero waste
programs manager for one of the largest
[SPEAKER_00]: recycling companies in Los Angeles County.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have my own nonprofit, which is called
Adventures in Waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just going through its rebranding
because it used to be Burbanker and
[SPEAKER_00]: Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: And instead of focusing on sustainability
as a whole, we also helped start the local
[SPEAKER_00]: 350.org chapter, which is SoCal350.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I'm just focusing directly on
waste and trying to the concept is to
[SPEAKER_00]: bridge the information gap and experience
and knowledge between those in the waste
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and the experience and knowledge
of those who are just everyday people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that we can come to solutions and
building a site that's a go to resource
[SPEAKER_00]: hub.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this concept of, oh, someone asks you a
question, someone asks you a question,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're just writing everything down on a
cocktail napkin and you hand it to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in the waste world, a lot of us have
that same experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the concept is to take that napkin and
put it into an actual hub of information.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be very helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot to introduce myself to you.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Ardeah Denize and I am the
founder of Polima and I'm helping
[SPEAKER_01]: companies find materials made from waste
and biology.
[SPEAKER_01]: So having that kind of resource to to send
people to where we can actually understand
[SPEAKER_01]: everything that's going on with materials
would be super, super helpful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what I would like you to kind of tell
us just so everyone has like a base
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge, what is how is how are we doing
with recycling right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like globally, what's what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are we doing a good job?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we're hurting a little bit right
now, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's an extreme global shift that we've
never seen before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And where we used to take our materials to
be recycled, the majority of 60 percent or
[SPEAKER_00]: more going to China, 60 more than 60
percent of our exports of of waste going
[SPEAKER_00]: to China from the United States to be
processed in some manner is not happening
[SPEAKER_00]: anymore because that door is closed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that door is not closed because
there's a trade war.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's sanctions and all this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's closed because China has been on this
path for the past seven or so years to say
[SPEAKER_00]: we want less and less of your
contamination and your waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I say contamination, I'm not just
talking about food being on a recyclable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about metals mixed with paper
and paper mixed with glass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And stuff that we just can't really
recycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've been told by our cities and
we've been told by everyone, don't worry,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's recyclable in some place in the
middle of North Dakota where there's some
[SPEAKER_00]: guy who can actually break it down in his
garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that doesn't really actually mean that
it's really recyclable and that there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: global market for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And China also, they want 20 skies,
20 skies, blue skies by 2050.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's their goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have this green sword that says if
your contamination rate is over 0.5% for
[SPEAKER_00]: most of the product, we're not going to
take it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's metals, it's 1% contamination.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to take this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the whole globe is trying to find
new places to take this material and have
[SPEAKER_00]: it be processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of the recycling companies,
these small, some very large recycling
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure within China have picked
up, moved, and gone to other countries as
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these countries are now getting this
material.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, hey, wait a minute,
we can't process this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't have the infrastructure here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what infrastructure we have doesn't
take that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see in places like the Philippines
where countries like Korea and Canada have
[SPEAKER_00]: gone and docked their barges of waste and
said, oh, yeah, it's diverted.
[SPEAKER_00]: We diverted it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We took it out of our country and we stuck
it somewhere else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the Philippines are like,
no, no, no, you're going to take this
[SPEAKER_00]: back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they just want a great, the activists
there just want a great, great campaign to
[SPEAKER_00]: get Korea to start taking this stuff back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to be targeting Canada
soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, our recycling rate here in the
United States is about 26%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in California, it is a little over 40%
where it used to be 50% back in 2014,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is what regulatory wise is supposed
to be 50% or more.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going down and down because we
can no longer say that a product is
[SPEAKER_00]: divertable and just go stick it somewhere
and outsource our problem onto someone
[SPEAKER_00]: else's suffering, which is known as a form
of waste colonization.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can no longer, you know, do this and be
honest about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we need to take this material back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to process it in our own country.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we're going to be, if we're going to be
creating this material and saying that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's recyclable, we need to build
infrastructure here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to do a lot more than that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to stop.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't need to be creating the stuff in
the first place, but.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's the thing is now people are
saying, Oh gosh, plastic is so bad since
[SPEAKER_01]: we're doing such a bad job at recycling
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's stop producing so much and let's
produce some new products.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what are the, what are the issues with
bringing in these completely new products
[SPEAKER_01]: into the waste stream?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what does that look like when they're
at the end of their life and what problems
[SPEAKER_01]: is that causing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just to say about the plastics,
we've only since the time that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: been created since the 1950s have ever
recycled maybe 9% of all the plastics that
[SPEAKER_00]: have ever been created.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the rest are in landfills or in the
ocean and made 8.3 billion metric tons of
[SPEAKER_00]: this material and have wasted 6.3 billion
metric tons of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and just another fact, the Ellen
MacArthur foundation through the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the, the new plastics economy are the,
I think I got that right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like rallying off things in my head.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Said that the amount of waste that we're
looking at creating in the near future by
[SPEAKER_00]: 2050, we're going to have more plastic in
the ocean by weight than we are going to
[SPEAKER_00]: have fish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And currently right now, the way that we
create plastic is through oil production
[SPEAKER_00]: and 6% of our oil production goes towards
creating plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: By 2030, it's going to go up to 20% of our
oil production is going to go towards
[SPEAKER_00]: plastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to stop the source where it's
starting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we need to also move into other
options and opportunities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first and foremost is not making this
stuff in the first place because we can't
[SPEAKER_00]: just trade one single use disposable item
for another single use disposable item,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter what it's made out of.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to look at solutions that say no
waste in the first place.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when we go into this trade off of
single use disposable items and,
[SPEAKER_00]: or maybe not even single use disposable
items, maybe it's you know, it's couches
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's, you know, it's chairs,
durable chairs and couches.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go figure.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to understand how that material is
going to work within the system as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the people who are creating these
materials need to be talking downstream to
[SPEAKER_00]: where that stuff is going to be processed
in the end and if it can even be
[SPEAKER_00]: processed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we look at stuff like bioplastics,
material that's not plastic, but it's made
[SPEAKER_00]: out of, you know, corn or potato starch or
whatever it might be and they create a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that looks like plastic,
but it's actually made out of plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can that material then be processed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can it be recycled or can it be composted?
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we said, everything can be recycled
in some place, somewhere in the middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: the country or- This is recycled
bioplastic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Upcycled bioplastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but everything can potentially be
recycled, but is it going to actually be
[SPEAKER_00]: recycled?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there a market for it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And with composting this material,
because it is a plant-based material,
[SPEAKER_00]: so people think, oh, it's compostable and
if it's certified, BPI certified,
[SPEAKER_00]: Biodegradable Products Institute
certified, says this material can be
[SPEAKER_00]: composted in a high heat compost facility
or in some of them like paper products in
[SPEAKER_00]: a backyard system.
[SPEAKER_01]: But do we have those facilities in Los
Angeles?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have them outside of Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have facilities that service Los
Angeles, but the problem is the BPI
[SPEAKER_00]: certification certifies for a degradation
of six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this product needs to sit, on average,
the product needs to sit in the high heat
[SPEAKER_00]: compost facility for six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's an aerobic compost facility,
which is with air, could be windrow
[SPEAKER_00]: technology, big rows of what is eventually
compost, it's a three month degradation
[SPEAKER_00]: process because that's the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can get the materials in and out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of materials that are coming
in with new legislation that's passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to get 50% of the organics out of
our landfills and into these composting
[SPEAKER_00]: infrastructure, whatever it may be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they need to process this as quick
as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a three month degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if a compostable bioplastic item goes
into an aerobic compost facility,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's probably in the current situation,
it's probably not going to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of these compost facilities are
going to see that as a contaminant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to see it as a contaminant,
period.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a contaminant that they accept and
then they'll pull out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But everything that goes over the line at
a compost facility needs to leave as
[SPEAKER_00]: diversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it's trash, it's not leaving as
diversion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other issue is, given regulation,
if they want to sell this compost to an
[SPEAKER_00]: organic farm or a farm that grows organic
food, they can't have any inorganic
[SPEAKER_00]: material in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these bioplastics are seen as
inorganic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether that's right or wrong,
it's currently seen as inorganic material.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when this material comes in,
they have to separate it out, put it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different windrow if they're going to
process it like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a very hard product process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of the legislation and needing
to take more organics and turn this stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: quickly because we do not have enough
organics infrastructure in place,
[SPEAKER_00]: some of these facilities are going to a
one-month degradation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So an aerated static pile where they're
going to cover the pile or the pile has
[SPEAKER_00]: aeration coming through it so it doesn't
need to be turned.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if it does, maybe like once or twice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's going to be a one-month
degradation with a little bit of curing
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those compostables, if they're
certified at that six-month degradation,
[SPEAKER_00]: are not going to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the building of these products needs to
have those conversations with the
[SPEAKER_00]: processes that are out there and say,
OK, can we create a product that has a
[SPEAKER_00]: one-month degradation?
[SPEAKER_00]: And can we certify for that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can we prove that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we use more fiber-based material?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a rating system for degradation?
[SPEAKER_01]: Say I'm going to the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: Say I'm a business that wants to find
better packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do I know what it's rated as?
[SPEAKER_00]: For us in the waste industry, when
something's brought to us, the only thing
[SPEAKER_00]: we get is to see if that thing's BPI
certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that BPI certification, I'm not an
expert in that area, but they have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through a third-party testing system to
find out what the degradation of that is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to know that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But not everything is certified,
I'm guessing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of compostable ware stuff is
becoming BPI certified.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's also expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it kind of prices some small
entrepreneurs out of the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not surprising.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you think of the pyrolysis as a
means to accelerate that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, so there's anaerobic digestion as
well for organics, AD facilities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the current one that's in Paris,
California, one of the largest ones that
[SPEAKER_00]: we have, is not taking any bioplastics at
this moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not even taking fiber-based from
what I've heard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So even the pyrolysis, though,
is not scalable at this moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're talking about a product that
you're like, well, maybe this will work so
[SPEAKER_00]: we can create all this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And let's put millions of dollars into
creating pyrolysis versus creating a
[SPEAKER_00]: product that works within the system that
exists.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's an issue that a lot of us in the
zero waste community, which I didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: define zero waste, but we push for
solutions within the situation versus
[SPEAKER_00]: spending millions of dollars to solve a
problem that could be solved by product
[SPEAKER_00]: redesign.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't think that legislation to deal
with bioplastics is the answer,
[SPEAKER_01]: then, is what I'm hearing you say.
[SPEAKER_01]: What it sounds like is if we could create
a zero waste system, that that would be a
[SPEAKER_01]: much better alternative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think right now I don't see a need to
legislate on the bioproducts at the
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if the businesses can work with
the hardware and the haulers and the
[SPEAKER_00]: processors, and they can figure out the
system within it, I don't see why to
[SPEAKER_00]: legislate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's need for legislation when we have
situations where we have to tell at the
[SPEAKER_00]: state level and at the federal level when
we say, you kind of need to pull these
[SPEAKER_00]: organics out of the landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if we don't say, if the state
doesn't say, you need to pull this
[SPEAKER_00]: organics out of the landfill, the
jurisdictions, the cities are not going to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell the haulers, you need to start
pushing organics collection and recycling
[SPEAKER_00]: on the businesses in order to pull this
material out of the landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why we need to get organics
out of the landfill, one, organics is the
[SPEAKER_00]: largest amount of material that goes to a
landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about, for the state of California,
it's 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then that's all of it, including food.
[SPEAKER_00]: And food accounts for 14% of the overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the United States, it's upwards of
almost 40% is organics in the landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that creates a lot of methane.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it creates methane.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's the biggest, if food is 14%,
is there anything bigger than food?
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics in general.
[SPEAKER_00]: Organics in general is just, paper usually
comes out pretty high.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's food.
[SPEAKER_00]: Food's a massive amount.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just grouped the organics together.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've got your tree waste,
your yard trimmings, your wood,
[SPEAKER_00]: and your food together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the reason why that's such an
important thing to target is our,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have AB 32.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have climate legislation, strongest
climate legislation that's ever been
[SPEAKER_00]: passed in the United States that says that
we have to reduce our greenhouse gas
[SPEAKER_00]: emissions to 1990 levels by 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, I think it's 2019.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one of the second largest source of
anthropogenic methane gas in the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: California and the third largest source of
anthropogenic methane gas in the United
[SPEAKER_00]: States comes from the organics in the
landfill.
[SPEAKER_00]: And personally, we had to legislate that
because I don't think any business or any
[SPEAKER_00]: hauler would have said, yes, we need to
target that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would really like to hear what your
dream waste solution would look like.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concept of zero waste is this weird,
not understood, singular, blogger,
[SPEAKER_00]: idol, popularized concept.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not what it is at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2004, and then updated just recently,
the Zero Waste International Alliance,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the one that came up with the
first peer-reviewed definition of zero
[SPEAKER_00]: waste back in 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is their newest update.
[SPEAKER_00]: Zero waste is the conservation of all
resources by means of responsible
[SPEAKER_00]: production, consumption, reuse,
and recovery of products, packaging,
[SPEAKER_00]: and materials without burning and with no
discharges to land, water, or air that
[SPEAKER_00]: threaten environment or human health.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my ideal solution is something that's
equitable, that is scalable and obtainable
[SPEAKER_00]: for all of the market, and that does not
cause harm to any community, that the
[SPEAKER_00]: community is involved in the decisions on
how that product might be cultivated
[SPEAKER_00]: within that area or mined or whatever it
might be, that there's full corporate
[SPEAKER_00]: responsibility, that the responsibility is
not always put back on the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's managed locally.
[SPEAKER_00]: The waste of it is managed locally with
local infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that there's, I want B-core
certification with zero waste application
[SPEAKER_00]: to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I want there to be zero waste checklist
that considers all aspects of a pre and
[SPEAKER_00]: post of a business, worked into the
B-corporation certification.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good, yes, that's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I can, you know, some of those
things can be attainable, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's like just a really
comprehensive way for any business to
[SPEAKER_01]: work, is to just consider all of those
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I, as a product developer,
consumer, and working like, let's say last
[SPEAKER_03]: year in the neighborhood, right,
like asking neighbors to give the plastic,
[SPEAKER_03]: the caps, whatever we need, a t-shirt to
make rugs and all that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I learned a lot about how disconnected and
how we, which is a big problem,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, taking the technical part that
we discussed, how disconnected we are from
[SPEAKER_03]: each other.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the other thing is how people just
don't think about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, you know, to just enter a supermarket
and just buy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as much as we talk, and I have been
working with upcycling, innovation,
[SPEAKER_03]: materials, wherever, for 20 years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I go to Trader Joe's or, you know,
I go on the plane, and there is all this
[SPEAKER_03]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So time goes by, and go to Trader Joe's.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's there, all the supermarkets.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all the plastic, all the plastic,
it's nothing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like one apple, you know,
one thing, it's all.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, in this zero waste thinking,
is there a possibility to have like a law
[SPEAKER_03]: that really goes into the manufacturing or
the retailers that they really can't have,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, packages anymore?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because if we don't go to Trader Joe's,
I have thought about doing like with my
[SPEAKER_03]: neighborhood and putting all the money in
the plastic from Trader Joe's,
[SPEAKER_03]: and we're doing like a project.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, so to speak.
[SPEAKER_03]: Greenpeace has been doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's like the corporate social
responsibility of designing for the end in
[SPEAKER_02]: mind, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And cradle to cradle kind of mentality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that is there for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so there's legislation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have products at cradle to cradle,
and it's there, but years goes by,
[SPEAKER_00]: go to Trader Joe's today.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's extended producer
responsibility legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very hard to pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: They finally, after 10 years, got a take
back program for pharmaceuticals and
[SPEAKER_00]: sharps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took 10 years because of the push back
from the industry that controls that
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you're totally right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're also not only disconnected with
each other, we're disconnected with our
[SPEAKER_00]: product, we're disconnected with our
earth, we're disconnected with the
[SPEAKER_00]: resources.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we look at places like in the UK where
they're saying, you know, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: move towards something where the products
have to be made out of something that was
[SPEAKER_00]: recyclable, compostable or reusable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Berkeley just passed an ordinance that
said if you're going to be a restaurant in
[SPEAKER_00]: Berkeley, you have to charge 25 cents for
any disposables that leave your place of
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all of you businesses have to have
reusable disposables on site that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: no longer use disposables.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are small pockets of that sort of
happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: California's a little bit easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: The larger the country is, even harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's harder, it's really hard to push
on extended producer responsibility laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while those are happening, while we
have entities work in that area,
[SPEAKER_00]: we as consumers also have to keep pounding
that pavement because I know personally
[SPEAKER_00]: from working with Trader Joe's that they
are hearing you and they are looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: phasing out unnecessary plastic within
their stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully they do it and it's not like
just something they're saying at this
[SPEAKER_00]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it comes from all aspects.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just know that plastic pollution,
that plastic consumption, the single use
[SPEAKER_00]: disposable consumption, even though you
are choosing to buy that, it's not your
[SPEAKER_00]: fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is their fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the corporations that are giving it
to us as fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the corporations that are giving it
to us as fault.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the corporations that are giving it
to us as fault.
It's the corporations that are giving it
to us.
