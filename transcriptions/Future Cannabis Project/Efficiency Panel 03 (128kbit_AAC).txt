[SPEAKER_03]: So in, whoa, this one's a little louder.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't hear you.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in terms of retrofitting a greenhouse,
you know, there's a lot of greenhouses in
[SPEAKER_03]: the Central Coast right now that are being
retrofitted that were used for,
[SPEAKER_03]: say, fresh cut flowers, roses and orchids
and other sorts of flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, maybe most people don't
know this, but, you know, since most
[SPEAKER_03]: flowers are not being eaten and are not
edible, they just have to look really
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they dump a shitload, excuse me,
kids, of pesticides on these flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will fumigate the ground and the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that space is probably pretty
polluted.
[SPEAKER_03]: Speaking of remediation, you know,
they're rickety greenhouses, they're wood
[SPEAKER_03]: framed, they're torn plastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, like you think you're
getting a good buy by getting,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, by buying that greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: But you have to completely replace all the
wood with steel or aluminum.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to replace the cover with
something else, I hope.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe now you're going to add pad and fan
cooling because you can't just,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, open up the windows to let,
you know, the cool coastal air come in
[SPEAKER_03]: when you have it for these flowers that
you don't really care if pests come in or
[SPEAKER_03]: what the environment is, because while
you're going to fumigate it, so it doesn't
[SPEAKER_03]: really matter so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, having to deal with an
existing greenhouse structure in some ways
[SPEAKER_03]: can be more painful than an indoor
structure where at least you have bones
[SPEAKER_03]: that are going to stay put that maybe,
you know, like you'll fix up.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, in terms of indoor facilities,
you know, the roof, the structure itself
[SPEAKER_03]: is horrible to deal with because a lot of
it can't hold the load of the equipment
[SPEAKER_03]: that you want to install.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have neighbors both for greenhouses
and for indoor that are going to complain
[SPEAKER_03]: about odor that are forcing less efficient
greenhouse designs because we're trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: keep all that odor from leaving the
facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if you let it leave the facility,
now what are you spraying into the air
[SPEAKER_03]: using to mitigate those odors,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Also not a good solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So being able to find a green,
a property where the greenhouse is maybe
[SPEAKER_03]: more rural and you're not going to get all
those complaints.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can do some, install more
efficient equipment would be ideal.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't always have that option though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: The ideal isn't always there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Still sticking on the design topic.
[SPEAKER_02]: What are a couple of things that are
commonly overlooked on just general
[SPEAKER_02]: designs of greenhouse, of space in
general?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are a few things that are overlooked?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it post-production, pre-production,
the happiness and health of the employees?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are some things that you've kind of
noticed that people kind of go in
[SPEAKER_02]: forgetting about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming from the last question in terms of
retrofit versus fresh build, every time if
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do it once and right, that's the
way to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the retrofit side of things,
I think a lot of it comes down to what I
[SPEAKER_01]: would consider to be workflow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that includes materials flow,
harvesting flow, all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked in far too many facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll give one of my favorite examples,
a couple hundred light indoor facility in
[SPEAKER_01]: Denver.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was back in the day, Cummins engine
test plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so, you know, they had, it was clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: There was no major issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had huge bay roll-up doors,
you know, obviously they're bringing in
[SPEAKER_01]: heavy, you know, diesel engines and stuff
to test at a mile high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it got converted into a cultivation
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in their enthusiasm, they walled off
all the roll-up doors for security
[SPEAKER_01]: measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the biggest entrance into the
building was a man door.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they wanted to bring in things like
tanks, they, no, it's totally laughable.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they wanted to bring in things like big
tanks, which you might want in a,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, a couple hundred light indoor
possibly, you'd have to cut a hole through
[SPEAKER_01]: the roof and crane it in, which,
you know, given the crazy HVAC and
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting and everything wasn't entirely
functional for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, it's good to plan for the
purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, certainly workflow I think
is like the biggest thing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: soil in, soil out, material in,
material out, ergonomics, all of that is
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty darn key.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I think workflow is one of the
things that people constantly leave out in
[SPEAKER_02]: the efficiency model.
[SPEAKER_02]: That is probably one of the most efficient
models that they need to be thinking of is
[SPEAKER_02]: how do your employees get from point A to
point B as well as the product?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm just going to say real quickly,
is move the plants to the people as
[SPEAKER_03]: opposed to the people to the plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The amount of labor efficiency and just
risk of cross contamination by doing it
[SPEAKER_03]: that way, huge savings, huge opportunities
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, when we're just talking
horticulture in general, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: like some of you may have seen,
you know, these lettuce greenhouses where,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, they transplant the seeds at one
end of a deep bed water culture and then
[SPEAKER_03]: they incrementally move those plants down
the row.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then 30 days later, they're harvesting
from the other end.
[SPEAKER_03]: People never moved those plants,
never had to harvest them by hand.
[SPEAKER_03]: They literally just have a machine that
just scoops it up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Takes it over to the packaging room and
then people handle it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, we're so concerned about
energy efficiency and the cost of energy,
[SPEAKER_03]: but what is always the number one cost of
any business?
[SPEAKER_03]: Labor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So anything you can do to reduce labor,
increase labor efficiency, which is move
[SPEAKER_03]: plants to the people as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was only going to say one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm now going to say two.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you are asking sort of what are some of
the primary things that people fail to
[SPEAKER_00]: consider?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I agree with both of the things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other thing that I'm going to
say people fail to consider on the
[SPEAKER_00]: regular, which is kind of shocking,
is where their most fundamental components
[SPEAKER_00]: are going to come from.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's your electricity coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's your water coming from?
[SPEAKER_00]: People genuinely don't ask those questions
when looking at properties all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't just flip a switch and it's all
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not actually where electricity
comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not magic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to get to you from somewhere and
understanding where it's coming from and
[SPEAKER_00]: how it's going to get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Kind of important when it is one of the
highest cost factors and one of the most
[SPEAKER_00]: critical components of your facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: Secondarily, I will say that we very much
confuse energy efficiency with efficiency
[SPEAKER_00]: and sustainability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are two totally different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And super important when we are speaking
on an efficiency panel to recognize that
[SPEAKER_00]: we are not only considering how to be
energy efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are considering how to be efficient in
the entire scope and function of our
[SPEAKER_00]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's not only going to capitalize on
your electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the people become really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: The workflow becomes really important.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those things are part of
efficiency.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of those things are critical parts of
sustainability and will ultimately have
[SPEAKER_00]: massive impacts on the cost of doing
business.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to jump in there and follow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Coming from Nevada County and having my
roots in organic cultivation and things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that, there's been this ongoing
debate that I'm sure everyone's been
[SPEAKER_01]: somewhat privy to, which is organic versus
synthetic.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's better?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's worse?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's more efficient?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's not?
[SPEAKER_01]: The opinion that I've come to is
essentially that you can do organic
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation very well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can have an efficient business model
built from an organic cultivation model.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can also do organic cultivation very
poorly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can do organic cultivation in a very
resource inefficient manner.
[SPEAKER_01]: So to me, it's no longer, is it organic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it synthetic?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a triple bottom line, of course.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in terms of just resource efficiency,
one doesn't inherently mean resource
[SPEAKER_01]: efficient or low carbon footprint at this
point.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sort of surprised that that's the
situation in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's the reality of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You really need to be aware of your supply
chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you?
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're in the middle of nowhere,
it's going to cost you more.
[SPEAKER_01]: You may be less resource efficient,
bringing in bulk organic media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the other thing I thought of too was
I've been working on this project in Ohio.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's a big project.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are a very limited number of
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I talked to the lead cultivator a few
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're starting to talk down way
further planning stages beyond build out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said to him, so will you send me the
water data?
[SPEAKER_01]: And he was like, yeah, I'm pretty sure we
have it somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, yeah, can you find that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I can't believe you're millions into a
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you don't know you have excellent
supply water quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you might want to take that
into consideration in the pre-planning
[SPEAKER_01]: stages so you know what your capital
requirements are going to be for the
[SPEAKER_01]: equipment to remediate your site and get
it to the spec that you desire.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, thank you for saying water quality
and water source.
[SPEAKER_03]: That should be number one when selecting a
property, because that is the life of your
[SPEAKER_03]: plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, and it's going to affect your
filtration needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you need reverse osmosis?
[SPEAKER_03]: It kills me to see all these facilities
installing reverse osmosis that has
[SPEAKER_03]: perfect water quality or that has really
crappy water quality and isn't filtering
[SPEAKER_03]: it or doing any sort of remediation.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I'm not even sure which one is
worse.
[SPEAKER_03]: We recently worked on a project in
Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were designing a high pressure fog
system.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of the first questions is,
what's the water quality?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because how much filtration do we need to
put on the water that's going to go
[SPEAKER_03]: through these teeny tiny, teeny tiny
nozzles?
[SPEAKER_03]: And the grower is like, oh, we have that.
[SPEAKER_03]: A few days later, well, we can't find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're getting it tested again.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just like you wanted an answer
for this fog system two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we're waiting two weeks for your
water quality sample.
[SPEAKER_03]: So water, water, water.
[SPEAKER_03]: It all starts there.
Thank you for saying that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a pretty important thing,
I guess.
Maybe more than energy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right, exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, and that's the truth.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like how you touched on the topic of
organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it could be a good thing or it can be
a non-sustainable thing, just depending on
[SPEAKER_02]: the inputs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Another thing that comes to mind,
too, in the efficiency of the design is
[SPEAKER_02]: the operating procedures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally every single function in the
farm, even going to get the mail,
[SPEAKER_02]: should have an operating procedure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're adaptable.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's an evolution, depending on how the
business grows and evolves.
[SPEAKER_02]: But everything should come with a
procedure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that procedure should always be
scrutinized.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how can it be more efficient?
[SPEAKER_02]: And how can it benefit the program more?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's something that a lot of people
overlook is that, yeah, I got my
[SPEAKER_02]: procedure.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pour a little of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I pour a little of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're all good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, no, I had that 8% strain.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, well, what do I do?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so, yeah, having an operating
procedure and a standard procedure for
[SPEAKER_02]: everything that you do is very,
very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to just have a moment to touch on
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because actually, somebody on the legal
panel was talking about how freaked out,
[SPEAKER_00]: frustrated, bent out of shape everybody
gets with the regulation, the regulation,
[SPEAKER_00]: the regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sucks.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're coming from no regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, any regulation feels excessive
and frustrating and expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the end of the day, it's those
regulations, those procedures,
[SPEAKER_00]: that ultimately create the sustainable
functioning economy of an industry of
[SPEAKER_00]: scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not even going to call them necessary
evils.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are just flat out necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how we figure out how to do this
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's how we figure out how to do it in a
way that supports everybody actually being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to stay open and actually being able
to make money off of the work that they
do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we're going to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
