[SPEAKER_02]: I grew up in Mendocino County and I've
been growing since I was 16 years old so
[SPEAKER_02]: it's been 12 years now and well I mean my
dad taught me how to grow from the
[SPEAKER_02]: beginning and since then things have
changed a lot but I guess he just taught
[SPEAKER_02]: me the techniques and more taught me to
respect the land and that we want to you
[SPEAKER_02]: know increase or better the property and
better our home instead of just using it
[SPEAKER_02]: up and using it for our business it's more
for you know I guess he just taught me to
[SPEAKER_02]: respect where we're from and where we
live.
[SPEAKER_02]: My farm is called Elysian Fields and I
live on a 50 acre piece of property that
[SPEAKER_02]: we grow all seeds right now from that have
been developed by our neighbors who are
[SPEAKER_02]: old school growers so they all grow really
well and they're a lot there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: pineapple in what we're growing I don't
know if that particular trait works really
[SPEAKER_02]: well where we are or what the deal is with
that but we grow mostly I think fruitier
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff more on the sativa side for me works
better the more indica has the fat buds
[SPEAKER_02]: and we get especially in the fall we get
more of a coastal fog and that can create
[SPEAKER_02]: mold and bud rot so for us more of more on
the sativa side of things works a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: better so we grow a pineapple OG something
called pineapple OG that's been developed
[SPEAKER_02]: by one of our neighbors and then we also
grow a sour pineapple also developed by a
[SPEAKER_02]: neighbor and I think at our farm we're
growing mostly sour pineapple and there's
[SPEAKER_02]: actually a few different phenotypes of
that one there's a purple one and then
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a more on the indica side and more
on the sativa side and my favorite one is
[SPEAKER_02]: the more sativa one came out really frosty
really good smell good yield pretty much
[SPEAKER_02]: mostly but we're trying now to pheno hunt
and find our favorite ones and we've been
[SPEAKER_02]: taking cuttings of all of our favorite
plants and just keep our own genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: going but knowing the biggest one of the
biggest issues for us right now is testing
[SPEAKER_02]: and knowing that we're getting a clean
start so there's been you know people have
[SPEAKER_02]: used gnarly chemicals on their clones and
that will that can last in the plant for a
[SPEAKER_02]: really long time like generations so we
have been taking cuttings of our own and
[SPEAKER_02]: we're trying to save our own genetics and
make sure that we have a really clean
[SPEAKER_02]: start so we know everything that happens
to the plant throughout its whole life my
[SPEAKER_02]: favorite strain I don't smoke that much so
I would have to say right now Ringo's gift
[SPEAKER_01]: is my favorite because it's a high CBD
describe the grow are you growing in the
[SPEAKER_01]: ground are you growing in pots are you
growing in native soil are you adding
[SPEAKER_02]: outside soil so we're doing a mix this
year we got a tractor I got my first loan
[SPEAKER_02]: ever and got a tractor and we ripped the
native soil first and then we put out
[SPEAKER_02]: mounds of organic composted and this guy
out in Chico makes a worm casting compost
[SPEAKER_02]: and we're just put out mounds of that on
top of the native soil and we only used
[SPEAKER_02]: about a hundred gallons per plant and
usually we'd have like 200 to 400 gallon
[SPEAKER_02]: pots so we're just using a hundred gallons
per plant and then it they especially
[SPEAKER_02]: because they're from seed they have a
taproot that goes down and they're able to
[SPEAKER_02]: just keep on going through the native soil
and they're responding really well to that
[SPEAKER_01]: so that's interesting you just said
historically we actually had a 500 a few
[SPEAKER_02]: 500 gallon ones last year too yes or not
pots just mounds so we ripped the ground
[SPEAKER_02]: and then we put laid mounds out on top of
that so the plants can just keep on
[SPEAKER_02]: growing and you know they're about seven
feet on center and we used to be more like
[SPEAKER_02]: 10 feet on center because we wanted to
have the biggest plant possible because we
[SPEAKER_02]: were only allowed 25 and now we're allowed
a square footage so we have like a hundred
[SPEAKER_02]: and a hundred and seventy probably at our
house and that's not even filling up the
[SPEAKER_02]: whole square footage of what we're allowed
but yeah we're moving more towards
[SPEAKER_02]: building our own soils and we want to have
we're planning on getting a compost pile
[SPEAKER_02]: like a big load of manure put down so we
can build a compost pile of our own soil
[SPEAKER_02]: and because that's a whole nother thing
buying soil you don't know what's in there
[SPEAKER_02]: you don't know there could be stuff that
comes in through the plant and then
[SPEAKER_02]: that'll show up in testing at the end so
we're trying to just get to a point where
[SPEAKER_02]: we know exactly what's happening to plant
the whole life so we're there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: surprises so what are some of the issues
with growing in the ground versus like you
[SPEAKER_01]: grew it one way in the pots for a long
time tell me about the experience of now
[SPEAKER_02]: growing in the ground well so actually
I've had one patch for five years or so
[SPEAKER_02]: that was in the ground holes that I dug
out in the ground they were like five feet
[SPEAKER_02]: across and it was a great spot for a long
time and then I thought I had russets one
[SPEAKER_02]: year because one plant just died and it
just like dried up at the end I thought it
[SPEAKER_02]: would just finish out but it just dried up
and died and then the next year I noticed
[SPEAKER_02]: in more plants and it wasn't russets what
it turned out to be was some sort of
[SPEAKER_02]: soil-borne fungus maybe fusarium or
something like that so it was just killing
[SPEAKER_02]: plants so that can be an issue in if you
have once you have that it's really
[SPEAKER_02]: difficult to get rid of it like we talked
to an agronomist and they said just don't
[SPEAKER_02]: grow there anymore so that can be one of
the issues rodents is an issue they even
[SPEAKER_02]: if they don't eat the roots they just
tunnel through and can affect them those
[SPEAKER_01]: are the two biggest issues I would say
well it hasn't happened yet we use a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of teas mostly like we haven't really been
feeding much we don't use any bottled
[SPEAKER_02]: nutrients anymore we're doing all compost
teas and maybe some micronized feedings
[SPEAKER_02]: but that's it we actually just bought a
500 or a 400 gallon tank that we can just
[SPEAKER_02]: put in the bed of our truck and we have a
pump that we can attach to a generator
[SPEAKER_02]: just plug in so we can move it from patch
to patch because we have we have two
[SPEAKER_02]: different farms and at our house we have
two different garden sites in one farm
[SPEAKER_00]: would Flo Kanna be a collective is that is
it the collective model or is it different
[SPEAKER_02]: no so their main thing is distribution and
so they they came up to Mendocino County
[SPEAKER_02]: and met some farmers up there and realized
that they wanted to be kind of part of
[SPEAKER_02]: that or promote that so they have been
working with sun-grown farmers that are
[SPEAKER_02]: all organic and they have been they're the
only distribution that I've worked with
[SPEAKER_02]: that has been really consistent and has
been promoting us as the farmers who've
[SPEAKER_02]: been here forever you know trying to make
our way so they do they do a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: wholesale right now but they have jars and
when they put your product in a jar they
[SPEAKER_02]: say where it was grown and then they put a
tag on it with your farm name and explain
[SPEAKER_02]: a little bit like just a little blurb
about your farm but the biggest brand name
[SPEAKER_01]: was Flo Kanna and then you're the sort of
separate yeah so for me it's a model that
[SPEAKER_02]: makes sense as a small farmer how am I
supposed to go out and brand myself when
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm trying to grow the best product I can
I don't have time I work all day long I
[SPEAKER_02]: from sunup to sundown or even past sundown
sometimes I'm working on my farm trying to
[SPEAKER_02]: grow cannabis so I can't I don't have the
time I also don't have the funds to go out
[SPEAKER_02]: and brand myself as an individual farm I
also don't have the product that there's
[SPEAKER_02]: not I don't have enough to if I had a huge
demand to make it make sense it to me it
[SPEAKER_02]: just doesn't really make sense so having
this the double I think what is it white
[SPEAKER_02]: label branding is that what it's called
yeah that makes sense you you
