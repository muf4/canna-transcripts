[SPEAKER_01]: So the county has had a ban on commercial
cannabis businesses for about 10 years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That prohibition was recently extended to
give us time to develop regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the board has directed us to go out and
develop regulations, but the board also
[SPEAKER_01]: wanted us to maintain a status quo so
that, you know, we don't have any changes
[SPEAKER_01]: in what's going on until they see the
package and approve it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so there's a wrinkle.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis is an illegal controlled
substance under federal law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's still criminalized to sell
cannabis, even if you're in compliance
[SPEAKER_01]: with your state and local regulatory
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there are some things in place at the
federal level that has the DOJ hands off
[SPEAKER_01]: at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't know what the new administration
will do in terms of changing those
[SPEAKER_01]: guidance documents.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this creates a lot of uncertainty for
the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we may have cannabis industry
participants here tonight who are aware of
[SPEAKER_01]: this.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the primary issues, besides being
afraid to get arrested, is that businesses
[SPEAKER_01]: don't have access to standard financial
services that other businesses could use.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't take debit cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can't take credit cards.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's expensive to get a bank account.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of businesses can't afford a bank
account.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's a lot of cash in these
transactions that creates opportunities
[SPEAKER_01]: for crime.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from our perspective as regulators,
it creates opportunities for people to not
[SPEAKER_01]: report how much money they're earning.
[SPEAKER_01]: More background.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mentioned this, the Board of
Supervisors did direct the preparation of
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis regulations for unincorporated
county last February.
[SPEAKER_01]: They gave us some objectives to reach.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's maximizing the transition from
unlicensed business activity to a
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated marketplace, essentially to go
from a largely unregulated space to a
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It sounds easier than it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Avoid blight and prevent over
concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is a worry that with the location of
businesses, you could actually end up with
[SPEAKER_01]: too many in one place that could cause
either blight or overexposure or some
[SPEAKER_01]: unintended consequences.
[SPEAKER_01]: The board wants us to address principles
of equitable development that includes
[SPEAKER_01]: equity and licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It also includes other equitable
development principles like making sure
[SPEAKER_01]: certain communities don't, quote,
bear the burdens of legalization,
[SPEAKER_01]: which could happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are focused on environmental
sustainability measures.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're taking a look at, for example,
cultivators who use a lot of electricity.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're taking a look at those rules to see
where can we conserve on electricity and
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure we're conscientious of how we're
using resources and address the issue of
[SPEAKER_01]: youth access and exposure to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's one of the board's goals to ensure
that youth usage does not increase.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a primary goal of almost every
regulatory system for cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_01]: country.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we are going to talk about that today
at one of the tables.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So community voices matter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, let me just explain what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually the county will draft regulations
and then publish them for 60 days and
[SPEAKER_01]: people will come down to the board of
supervisors and they'll yell, they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: scream.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will not have been notified and the
county gets defensive, we react,
[SPEAKER_01]: we make some changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to avoid that process for
this because this is so new and so
[SPEAKER_01]: different and so dynamic and changing all
the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The board has asked us to go to the public
first, get the feedback and then develop
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations that are responsive to the
feedback.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why this isn't your traditional
town hall because we don't have answers
[SPEAKER_01]: for you yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want to hear what you say before we put
pen to paper on any of the regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what you say tonight will be
documented.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll become part of a report.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have 18 of these listening sessions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything will become part of a report
that will be public that the board can
[SPEAKER_01]: consider when looking at what to adopt for
unappropriated areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as Joe mentioned, 18 different
sessions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all are kicking off the very first one
and we're going to be having these through
[SPEAKER_00]: August 12th.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they'll be taking place in evenings and
also on Saturday mornings all around all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the five supervisorial districts.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are six particular topics around
which we're going to have these same kinds
[SPEAKER_00]: of facilitated small group discussions and
recorded answers so that we can feed all
[SPEAKER_00]: of this back into a report that's going to
be used to help make recommendations that
[SPEAKER_00]: will ultimately lead to regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these are the six topic areas and our
six tables are broken out along these
[SPEAKER_00]: topic areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So who has youth access to exposure to
cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the discussion for that table is going
to be guided by everybody has a copy of
[SPEAKER_00]: your information packet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all got the same information.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody here should have a packet
that has six different sheets in it to
[SPEAKER_00]: correspond with the six different areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are a couple of discussion topics
for each of the different areas as well as
[SPEAKER_00]: some background information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you'll get a little bit of time when
we move to your tables that you want to
[SPEAKER_00]: start with to sort of go over what the
background information is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then on the back, you'll see that
there are questions that your facilitator
[SPEAKER_00]: will ask you to give answers to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are what are going to be part of the
recommendations that go forward to the
[SPEAKER_00]: supervisors.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one of these for each of the
areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where should cannabis businesses
locate?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where's the location table?
[SPEAKER_00]: Great, that's yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cultivation, who's our cultivation table?
[SPEAKER_00]: Green, excellent, right up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Taxation and revenue, the money people,
money and spending.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then equity and economic development
is in the back, the blue table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, other concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: We recognize that there may be some topics
that you want to express questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: comments, concerns about that don't fall
neatly into these other five areas.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is going to be a facilitated
discussion and also recorded answers at
[SPEAKER_00]: that table.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do know that there is a place to go if
these are not the topics you want to talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how this is going to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are going to, in just a moment,
have you break and first go to whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: table you feel like you want to talk at
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's going to be four different periods
of time, 25 minute allocations for you to
[SPEAKER_00]: talk.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means you won't be able to
necessarily go to all of those discussion
[SPEAKER_00]: topics for 25 minutes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll have to sort of govern your own
time and maybe lead one conversation and
[SPEAKER_00]: go to another.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have designed this so that you'll
be able to have facilitated discussion for
[SPEAKER_00]: four of these topic areas at 25 minutes
each.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to let you know when it's time
to move to the next topic area.
[SPEAKER_00]: First, we were going to have a big gong
and then we thought that might be a little
[SPEAKER_00]: too disruptive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there'll be something a little less
intrusive, like somebody going through to
[SPEAKER_00]: the tables, letting your facilitators know
that it's time to move on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do want to ask everyone to honor the
ground rules for participating in table
[SPEAKER_00]: talks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're on the back of your agenda,
which is the very first page of your
[SPEAKER_00]: packet with a nice icon here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, we're just asking people to
keep your comments brief, respect one
[SPEAKER_00]: another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody here will agree,
but respect one another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please silence your cell phones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stay focused and try not to talk over one
another because we definitely want to
[SPEAKER_00]: capture what it is that you're saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need to have talking one at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're asking you to follow these and when
it's time to move to a new discussion,
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't need to go over these again.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just bear in mind, these are the rules
that we're asking people to abide by for
[SPEAKER_00]: the whole night.
[SPEAKER_00]: Recognize that your facilitator is there
to help encourage conversation,
[SPEAKER_00]: to get your feedback input into new
regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not subject matter experts.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have a question about something
that is technical, along the lines of what
[SPEAKER_00]: Joe raised earlier, there are question
cards here in the middle of every table.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can write it down and raise it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be people from the Office of
Cannabis Management and perhaps other
[SPEAKER_00]: county staff too, who will be wandering
through and can answer those questions
[SPEAKER_00]: along the way.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Comments will be recorded for a public
report, but no comments will be
[SPEAKER_00]: attributed, which is what we said before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in general, do you all feel like you
understand how this is going to flow?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: You all are the very first group we're
trying this with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll see how well it works and then
we'll adapt it for future sessions if need
[SPEAKER_00]: be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I'm going to ask you to do right
now is to, if you don't want to stay at
[SPEAKER_00]: the table where you are, understanding
that in 25 minutes, you'll be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: rotate to another one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now's the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: In a minute.
