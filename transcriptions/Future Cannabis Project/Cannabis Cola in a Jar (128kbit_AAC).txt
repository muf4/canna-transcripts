[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, this is the connoisseur kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the Silver Dragon connoisseur kit.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a half ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm also going to have ounce kits
available in the future, but this is the
[SPEAKER_00]: half ounce kit size.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you want to do if you want to
reuse this package is you want to take a
[SPEAKER_00]: razor blade or an X-Acto knife.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually peel these off if you
wanted to actually save this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or you can cut it and then it's
permanently opened and cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside your kit you will find your cola
jar and you will see your 14 grams,
[SPEAKER_00]: your half ounce of bud in there on the
stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is how a grower and all the highest
quality producers of cannabis for all time
[SPEAKER_00]: have really kept their weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most growers will keep their herb on the
stick with many of the leaves intact
[SPEAKER_00]: because those leaves are going to provide
protection for the trichomes and hairs,
[SPEAKER_00]: pistols, and they're also going to provide
a little bit of a moisture reservoir in
[SPEAKER_00]: the environment around the bud so that the
bud itself doesn't dry out too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: This little bit of extra water retention
is like having a Boveda pack or a Boost
[SPEAKER_00]: pack inside of your jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It will release that moisture over time
and make your bud stay fresher for much
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your bud can stay fresh on a stick like
this with the leaves in a cool dark place
[SPEAKER_00]: for up to a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see our lab tests here and
you'll see our identifying functions on
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll open this jar up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is child resistant child proof so you
have to push and turn to open it and as
[SPEAKER_00]: you do so you will then be opening the
seal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sometimes the seal doesn't open by taking
the lid off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just peel the seal off as you would
with a vitamin jar.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is an airtight seal keeping your bud
100% airtight fresh in here for as long as
[SPEAKER_00]: it's on the shelf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you know your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you buy your cannabis from us it will
be fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get to pull out your nice cola
inside here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can trim them off the stick as you
need them and leave them where they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: stay moist and fresh longer for longer if
you choose to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can observe just the beauty,
the raw natural beauty of the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This here is a calyx.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a swollen gland, a swollen sac of the
flower that contains cannabinoids and
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bulk of the flower's medicine is
contained within calyxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bud itself is dozens or hundreds even
of individual calyxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all next to each other and each
calyx, one of these calyxes has a hair
[SPEAKER_00]: coming out of the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all those hairs that you see on the
bud there.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are delicious and full of goodness,
these calyxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the hairs are almost pure THC as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inside the kit we also provide you with a
pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you inside you have some scissors
and papers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like organic raw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's how you trim.
[SPEAKER_00]: The most important thing to remember is to
not cut these calyxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These calyxes that we've just talked about
that contain all the cannabinoids and all
[SPEAKER_00]: the terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to lose them or half of
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to aim only for the parts that
we want to remove.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaflets that are still attached to
the flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're trimming we're only using the
tips of the scissors.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not cutting any red hairs and we're
just removing the individual leaves one
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Removing the leaves one by one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Individual removal of leaf one by one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not cutting into the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not damaging any of the hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaving all those beautiful hairs intact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Leaving all those calyxes whole and filled
with medicine for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The machines that process most of your
medicine will tend to just make a cut like
[SPEAKER_00]: this which will not only cut that little
leaf right there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like using a sledgehammer to open an
egg.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all they're trying to do is get rid
of this one little leaf but that machine
[SPEAKER_00]: or that person trimming will take their
scissors and they will literally remove
[SPEAKER_00]: that whole side of the flower instead of
taking their scissors and removing that
[SPEAKER_00]: leaf that needed to come off.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see them, individual round,
swollen calyxes with hairs coming out of
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the calyx right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what not to cut.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what all the machines and most
trimming processing stories will be
[SPEAKER_00]: destroying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't cut the calyx.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the most important thing with
trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all I got to say with this.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are shaving the calyxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are cutting the calyxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need to preserve the calyx,
the flower in its entirety and its
[SPEAKER_00]: wholeness and respect it as its wholeness
and stop shaving it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You love herb as much as we do and the
ritual preparation of flower to become
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine for the body mind and soul is
your spiritual process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Afterwards, soak it in oil and then wipe
them off.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to slide the scissors behind the
leaves so that you're not damaging the bud
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it and only removing the leaves
that don't have the crystal on it with the
[SPEAKER_00]: veins because it's all useful.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm holding the bud very gently so that
I'm not pressing on the hair and squeezing
[SPEAKER_00]: it at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's best if you hold it from the stem or
at the bottom of the bud so that you avoid
[SPEAKER_00]: touching it too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can wear gloves if you like when you
do this so your fingers don't get sticky
[SPEAKER_00]: before trimming and after trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, there's very little leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not talking about a lot of leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is just enough to make one little
infused snack.
[SPEAKER_00]: Remove all these from the stems or some of
them from the stems at least.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then what I'm left with now is this twig.
[SPEAKER_00]: The stem itself has calyxes on it with
hairs coming out of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: See that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are delicious.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people like to collect only the
calyxes, these stem calyxes and make a
[SPEAKER_00]: joint of just stem calyxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a popular old classic grower thing
to do for a grower this way now.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're ready to roll one up,
what I suggest you do is cut along the
[SPEAKER_00]: stem down the middle of the bud so that
you can extract the majority of the stem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to roll it up and smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just extra carbon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to hurt you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not what you're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can also cut your flower up this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do the same thing almost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Slightly different texture, a little
different burnability, but classic.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is purple punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: They call it a day tripper.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a classic roll even.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free your plant.
Thanks for watching.
I'll see you in the next one.
