[SPEAKER_00]: Yo, what's going on guys?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Pat with Heroes of the Farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today I want to discuss and talk about the
new Dry Flower Rack System.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a rack system that has been
designed over the last couple of years by
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the homies down in Southern
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not only for cannabis, but also for
hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason that these hanger systems are
made of metal is for the amount of weight
[SPEAKER_00]: we can put on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, we're putting not that much
product for what one of these can actually
[SPEAKER_00]: hold to capacity when talking about hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: That being said, there is two different
sizes available right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got a 21 inch and a 41 inch.
[SPEAKER_00]: The 41 inch, it's good for what we're
doing, but really they make whole pod
[SPEAKER_00]: systems throughout in the field for hemp
drying solutions where you can take whole
[SPEAKER_00]: hemp plants and stuff them.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of these racks all the way filled
full.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about this is first off,
it's American made, so it's definitely a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit more expensive because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: These aluminum hangers have been really
thought out and designed and you can fit
[SPEAKER_00]: more weight without that hanger bowing in
comparison to a plastic hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over the last 15 years, I've used all
types of different drying systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is the trellis technique where we're
loading and unloading.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've seen a lot of the new trellis
techniques, a lot of nice systems where
[SPEAKER_00]: they'll slide on racks and pull it in and
out.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with that is you're loading on
and you're loading off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The system that we used in here before,
we just did old school coat racks that
[SPEAKER_00]: I've collected over the last decade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plastic hangers, but every time we load
one of those, you have to go inside of the
[SPEAKER_00]: hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The real benefit to these is one,
it's locking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can literally put one side weight on
there and not have the product fall off
[SPEAKER_00]: unless I'm shaking like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you're done and the product's
dry, here is the real benefit and the
[SPEAKER_00]: solution inside of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, this is a wet product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not ready to come off, but I'm just
going to show you real quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: If this was a hanger, trellis tech,
line, you're always having to pull that
[SPEAKER_00]: back off and you're handling that product
more and it's taking a lot of time versus,
[SPEAKER_00]: okay, I'm done.
Boom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Empty.
[SPEAKER_00]: Locks back on.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, there's quite a bit of weight on
here because it's wet, but I can break
[SPEAKER_00]: this down, lay this down in my bin
gracefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flip it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, when you look at the thought that's
gone into this to be able to hold this
[SPEAKER_00]: type of weight, this piece of aluminum is
actually bent and curled in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, that's what makes this so strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could probably literally hang off of
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Again, all aluminum, made in Oregon,
USA by the homie Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay has spent years literally designing
these locking systems and these overall
[SPEAKER_00]: racks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They offer basically the hanger.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brackets to the hanger is kind of the
big things that they're offering right
[SPEAKER_00]: here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all the patents are in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The website is about to be up.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have interest, you can reach out
via DM and we can get you all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: brochures and information until the
website is up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be dropping here in the next,
I believe, like two weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the meantime, we're just kind of
showing you guys the system that's coming
[SPEAKER_00]: up that's going to be offered through
Heroes and through Dry Flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm fortunate enough to be able to get to
utilize them and kind of prototype them
[SPEAKER_00]: and give them feedback and have them for
some time now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do offer these stands, which if you
look at the stands, the one thing that's
[SPEAKER_00]: nice about these stands is if you saw the
first video that we put out, in this room,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can fit easily about 120 pounds with
our old drying system.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the new drying system, we can
actually fit about 20 to 25% more because
[SPEAKER_00]: we can densely put everything on the
hangers.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we're done, basically the bars will
break everything down to the bins as we
[SPEAKER_00]: showed you and then the bars click out and
then from there, these actually pop out
like this.
Then we can just move the layout and then
stack them in the corner and then put
everything to the side.
[SPEAKER_00]: That way, when we're done, we can quickly
clean out our room and reorganize the
[SPEAKER_00]: space versus I can show you in my other
area where I have, I don't know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 60 coat hanger racks and where I've got
trellis.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Out of all the drying systems that I've
built, seen, and used over the last 15
[SPEAKER_00]: years, this by far kind of takes the cake.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're also supporting growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's built for growers, by growers,
and it's built in the United States,
[SPEAKER_00]: which right now in the pandemic,
I think that should be important to
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone because it's definitely important
to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing just about these systems
is the way that they flow for not only
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but for hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: You haven't seen them yet, but there is
pod systems that Jay has come up with that
[SPEAKER_00]: literally you can build these four stories
high.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got basically some tech coming out of
trailers for infield harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to see all of these basically
come up through the Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: through live feeds, and through demos and
tutorials that we'll continue to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's just a little bit further of a
sneak peek of the dry flower, dry racks,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bars, the hangers, and the clips for
the hanging solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have more questions, please hit me
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can get you in touch with Jay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do offer custom room designs.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have very short ceilings in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually get these.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're three, four, eight, however many
tiers up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay specifically built these racks for
this room that has basically a lower
[SPEAKER_00]: ceiling design because there is a grow
right below us, a second floor,
[SPEAKER_00]: so we just don't have a high ceiling as an
option.
[SPEAKER_00]: If we have higher ceilings, we could
maximize our space even further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right now with this system, like I said,
we've been able to increase about 20 to
[SPEAKER_00]: 25% overall mass that we can put into
these rooms because of the organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you, again, look at how neat this all
is, absolutely amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those right now are the two sizes of
hangers that are offered and a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: about the company.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do have some brochures that I can send
you if you're interested.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hit the DM and thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll see you next time.
