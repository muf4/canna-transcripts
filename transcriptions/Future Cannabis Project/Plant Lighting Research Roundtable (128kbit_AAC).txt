[SPEAKER_06]: An associate professor at McGill
University.
[SPEAKER_06]: I specialize in controlled environment
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a bunch of pretty pictures on the
side there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So basically anything to do with
controlled environment from a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_06]: all the way to NASA based stuff I've done
work on.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like showing my farm that I grew up on
because I come from a flatland area right
[SPEAKER_06]: there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's rural agriculture in Western
Canada.
[SPEAKER_06]: If anybody's into ice hockey, then that's
what we play there predominantly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it drives everything.
[SPEAKER_06]: Background for solar energy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Most people have probably seen this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Predominantly we have the solar output of
the sun, which is the big tall red line
[SPEAKER_06]: that we see on top here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have a little bit of UV light
that's being produced.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we go to the other side, we have our
far red and our infrared that's all being
[SPEAKER_06]: kicked out on this side.
[SPEAKER_06]: The atmosphere has a habit of breaking up
or absorbing some of these wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you can see the actual spectrum
that are being absorbed along this.
[SPEAKER_06]: The part that I always find interesting
when I look at this slide is that the
[SPEAKER_06]: human eye and plants both evolved to
absorb and utilize the primary wavelengths
[SPEAKER_06]: of light that are coming out of the sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's the vast majority of the light
that's actually coming to us.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's where the majority of that light
energy is being produced from that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's within the same spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: So human eye and plants are fairly
similar.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they evolved independently as far as
we know.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so from this perspective, we have to
be aware that there is differences from
[SPEAKER_06]: this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it is also something, there is
similarities.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we can tie through those things.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over the history of humanity, we found
different ways to actually produce light.
[SPEAKER_06]: Solar being the background that
everybody's aware of.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we also have come up with
different systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: Ultimately, as you look at this,
you can see that none of these actually
[SPEAKER_06]: mirror that solar light spectrum that's up
top.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we also have our cool white
fluorescence, which are a lot more peaky.
[SPEAKER_06]: So little individual peaks here and there.
[SPEAKER_06]: More in the blue wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_06]: A little bit through the green area.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then our high pressure sodium,
which is the industry standard for most
[SPEAKER_06]: people.
[SPEAKER_06]: Predominantly in the, I call it,
amber, but between the orange and the
[SPEAKER_06]: yellow spectrum of light.
[SPEAKER_06]: Incandescent, which is one of our first
lighting fixtures that we have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Metal halides.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then our LEDs.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm one of these guys that actually thinks
low pressure sodium should actually come
[SPEAKER_06]: back at some point.
[SPEAKER_06]: I see some fun stuff on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we are doing some research on this.
[SPEAKER_06]: People ignored it.
[SPEAKER_06]: NASA did one research project and said,
it could be useful.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then everybody's ignored it ever
since.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I actually think it has applications.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at some point, I'll start ranting in
great length about why I believe that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the coolest thing that's happened in
the last while is LEDs have come onto the
[SPEAKER_06]: field.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the part that's fun is that they're
very narrow spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: They produce a lot of light.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're one of the more efficient
systems that are out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And you can see that they're fairly narrow
spectrum out of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Up until this point, most of them were 50
to 100 nanometer type width.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in these cases, they're sitting down
to that 20 nanometer width.
[SPEAKER_06]: So fairly narrow light spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we can actually start tailoring
different colors specifically for growing
[SPEAKER_06]: plants.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the challenges that we're playing
with, and I'll talk about later on,
[SPEAKER_06]: is that this is at 20 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can we narrow it down farther?
[SPEAKER_06]: And what's the impact that we can do?
[SPEAKER_06]: Could we ever make a one nanometer base
light and actually see what the impact of
[SPEAKER_06]: that?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why I talk about the low pressure
sodium.
[SPEAKER_06]: It is a narrower light source than the LED
systems that we have there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So these are most of the LEDs that we have
on the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can see that we go all the way from
the UV range on this side, all the way
[SPEAKER_06]: over to the far red, infrared in some
cases on this side.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have this area in between.
[SPEAKER_06]: One of the parts that I find interesting
is this area where everybody talks about
[SPEAKER_06]: the green gap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Personally, I think we kind of ignore,
it's not as serious of an effect for plant
[SPEAKER_06]: growth as people think it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's purely because we cheat and we do
the PC amber.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the phosphorus coated amber light
production, and we still get light across
[SPEAKER_06]: the whole spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: The place that I have my biggest issue is
actually right here in that 680 to 700.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't seem to find LED lights that
produce efficiently or actually at all in
[SPEAKER_06]: that space.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I need them to finish off some of my
research.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if anybody knows lights in the 680 to
700 range, I'm more than willing to chat
[SPEAKER_06]: with you because I need them.
[SPEAKER_06]: The basis of light and photosynthesis
basically is driven by the principles of
[SPEAKER_06]: pigment absorption.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have chlorophyll A, chlorophyll B
and our carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we've actually tailored around
these things, these pigments to actually
[SPEAKER_06]: determine our photosynthetic efficiency
and how do we can actually set this up.
[SPEAKER_06]: But McCree back in the day, so there was
plenty of people before McCree that
[SPEAKER_06]: actually worried about photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_06]: McCree is the one that's become the
standard.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we actually overlay what happened with
the pigments with this, we can see that
[SPEAKER_06]: the chlorophyll A and B kind of line up
reasonably well between 400 and 500.
[SPEAKER_06]: And between 600 and 700 is also our
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_06]: But there's this big gap between 500 and
600 where there is no pigment absorption
[SPEAKER_06]: that we believe is driving photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yet we actually get a fairly good
activity.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like playing in that 595, the amber
light.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I will rant about that quite a bit
next in two days from now.
[SPEAKER_06]: As kind of a final thing, since you are
all here, human eyes did evolve to
[SPEAKER_06]: actually measure light.
[SPEAKER_06]: Our problem is that we're actually,
we're really good at measuring green
[SPEAKER_06]: light.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the primary response is of a green
light and we're poor in the red and the
[SPEAKER_06]: blue spectrum.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so people will come to me and say,
I have plenty of light within my
[SPEAKER_06]: greenhouse or in my controlled environment
space.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, did you measure it with a
sensor?
[SPEAKER_06]: And they're like, no, I can see it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm like, no, you didn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: You just looked at green light and you
have no real ability to understand the
[SPEAKER_06]: blue or the far red.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's where plants do a lot of
photosynthetic activity out of this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then ultimately we have our high
pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_06]: Space on this space, which is actually has
become the industry standard.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if you overlay that with that green
line, which is the McCree curve that I
[SPEAKER_06]: showed you before, as I'm showing there,
the high pressure sodium seems to be
[SPEAKER_06]: hanging out in that amber wavelength
space.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it seems to be the industry standard.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, it is the industry standard.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's the place that I find the most
interesting because ultimately plant
[SPEAKER_06]: pigments don't have a good absorption
capacity within that space.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yet plants grow really, really,
really well with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have a lot of questions that
we're going to have understood on this
[SPEAKER_06]: one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So more in-depth understanding of our
different wavelengths, photosystem one,
[SPEAKER_06]: photosystem two, and our different
pigments and the McCree and how all these
[SPEAKER_06]: things actually drive this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's a really quick overview of the
basics of photosynthesis, at least from a
[SPEAKER_06]: light perspective and wavelengths that we
play with.
[SPEAKER_06]: We have to be aware that high pressure
sodium is the industry standard.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so as such, everything has to be
compared to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I hope that these guys will all
chat from that perspective.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the first speaker is actually going to
be Dave Hawley.
[SPEAKER_06]: He works for Fluence.
[SPEAKER_06]: His exact title is a senior scientist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe you just got that a little while
ago.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's been from the beginning, because it
was added onto your LinkedIn account I
[SPEAKER_06]: saw.
[SPEAKER_06]: So yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wondered if he was ever a junior
scientist before that point.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then we have two others that will be
coming up after him, which is Neil
[SPEAKER_06]: Dirgett.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm working on that one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he's at Solotube.
[SPEAKER_06]: He's based here in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he'll be talking about some of the
systems.
[SPEAKER_06]: And as you walk down the hallway,
you can actually see that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the one that I worked on is
Sinder Rajan.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, Sun.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so he's going to be talking about the
biomimicry of light.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm actually really interested in
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand the other two slightly.
[SPEAKER_06]: But this is the one that I'm looking
forward to.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm a little bit jealous for this talk
that my name is Sun, because nothing is
[SPEAKER_03]: more appropriate than that, I think.
[SPEAKER_03]: So once again, my name is Dave Hawley.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I am the senior scientist at Fluence
Bioengineering.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been senior scientist the whole
time.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then again, haven't we all been junior
scientists at one point in life,
Mark?
[SPEAKER_03]: In some ways, I definitely still feel that
way.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the intent for me today, first of all,
if you're not familiar with Fluence,
[SPEAKER_03]: we are a horticultural lighting company,
of course.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we sell primarily broad spectrum light
in an LED form factor.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're very present in the cannabis market
worldwide, and increasingly so in
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if you imagine fine crop, leafy greens,
berries, things like that, that's where
[SPEAKER_03]: we're putting a lot of our efforts now,
especially on the research side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, Mark gave a really efficient talk on
light spectrum and absorption and pigments
[SPEAKER_03]: and things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's almost as though you've done it once
or twice before, Mark.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm going to expand a little bit more
and go just a little bit slower,
[SPEAKER_03]: because I know this is not an audience
with kind of a wide array of backgrounds.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it could be helpful to kind of set
the stage for the rest of the conference.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we're talking about optimizing
light quality for plant development from
[SPEAKER_03]: an LED standpoint, we're really talking
about three pillars of plant development.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this can be yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that drives most of the market,
whether it's cannabis or leafy greens or
[SPEAKER_03]: vine crop or anything else, mostly people
care about yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're talking about morphology.
[SPEAKER_03]: People want certain canopy architectures
for various reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And finally, we're talking about plant
quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the case of cannabis, that means
plant secondary metabolism.
[SPEAKER_03]: So cannabinoids, terpenes, things like
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it can mean different things in
different crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in berries, it might mean sugar
content.
[SPEAKER_03]: In tomato, it might mean, oh, I don't
know, it could mean sugar content.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, it could also mean things like
lycopene for coloration and flavor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we dive into these three pillars,
right, yield, morphology, and secondary
[SPEAKER_03]: metabolism, we can look at how light
affects each one of these things,
[SPEAKER_03]: starting with yield.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yield really means photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just means taking CO2 from the air and
turning it into plant stuff, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And sometimes you get the good plant stuff
that can be leaves.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're lettuce, it can be cannabis bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in that industry, it can be
tomato fruit, but it just means turning
[SPEAKER_03]: CO2 into plant stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how does this work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, there are these three steps.
[SPEAKER_03]: And once again, I'll try to do this in
kind of a depth that's appropriate for
[SPEAKER_03]: this group.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we've got the light reactions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's some chemistry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's the dark reactions that
actually captures the CO2.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if we dive into these steps,
first, we're going to be looking at light
[SPEAKER_03]: absorption.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is really where we are playing
most of the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Ultimately, what you see here is a light
harvesting complex.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have these green dots that
represent chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have the yellow and the red and the
orange dots that represent these secondary
[SPEAKER_03]: pigments.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like Mark said, chlorophyll,
really good at absorbing light between the
[SPEAKER_03]: sort of 4 to 500 nanometer region and the
6 to 7 nanometer region.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or in other words, red and blue light.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how we all understand it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then there's this big gap kind of
between 5 and 600.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're all kind of guessing with our
best understanding of how all of this
[SPEAKER_03]: works.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as we understand it right now,
we do have these secondary pigments like
[SPEAKER_03]: alpha-carotene, beta-carotene,
lycopene.
[SPEAKER_03]: These all fall in this category of
carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are some other related ones
called xanthophils.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we think that these compounds fill in
that gap a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And essentially, they're going to absorb
light in that region.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pass it over to chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_03]: A bunch of things happen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Water gets split.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hydrogen gets liberated.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it powers a bunch of full chemical
kind of machinery.
[SPEAKER_03]: And plants grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: And of course, if you look at this last
graph here, this is actually what light
[SPEAKER_03]: absorption looks like in a whole leaf,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So the first two graphs are showing light
absorption if you just isolate these
[SPEAKER_03]: compounds in solution and then shine some
light on it and see what happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you actually look at a whole leaf,
though, you get something that looks a
[SPEAKER_03]: little bit like this last graph.
[SPEAKER_03]: And rather than kind of doing a deep dive
through each one of these, what I'll point
[SPEAKER_03]: out is that the yellow line, which is kind
of the one that dips down the most,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's representing your isolated sort of
photosynthetic pigments.
[SPEAKER_03]: Your green line is showing what a whole
intact leaf is actually absorbing.
[SPEAKER_03]: What you see is that, again, like Mark
said, the plant does absorb light more or
[SPEAKER_03]: less across the spectrum.
[SPEAKER_03]: It does dip down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's why it looks green.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the plant is capturing full spectrum
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the part where I say a little bit
of chemistry happens.
[SPEAKER_03]: All of that stuff that we just looked at
in the previous cartoon is that first PS2
[SPEAKER_03]: molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: Does this have a laser pointer on it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Top one?
[SPEAKER_03]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So right here, this guy we're talking
about, PS2.
[SPEAKER_03]: And again, there's a lot of other stuff
happening here.
[SPEAKER_03]: But essentially, all of those compounds we
just talked about exist in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: It captures that light.
[SPEAKER_03]: It splits water.
[SPEAKER_03]: It liberates this hydrogen molecule.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this hydrogen proton powers this
protein that makes ATP, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So really what we're doing here is we're
tuning light energy into biochemical
[SPEAKER_03]: energy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately, what we end up with is
NADPH and ATP.
[SPEAKER_03]: And these are very energetic biochemical
molecules.
[SPEAKER_03]: It goes on to do other stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is where we get into the dark
reactions of photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Once again, probably review for a lot of
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is where we take that CO2 from
the air and turn it into the plant stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have CO2 from the air.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we have these energetic molecules
that I just talked about.
[SPEAKER_03]: And ultimately, they reduce CO2 to make
glucose or sugar.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this sugar goes on to do a whole bunch
of other biochemical processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: But this is really your primary
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually, from this point forward,
a lot of what happens is really similar to
[SPEAKER_03]: what happens in animal cells.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have mitochondria.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have cellular respiration and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that is ultimately the first pillar of
how we optimize light for plant
[SPEAKER_03]: production, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Focusing on yield, turning CO2 into plant
stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: The next pillar, I'll move through these
very quickly because I'm sure,
[SPEAKER_03]: again, we're going to talk about a lot of
these today.
[SPEAKER_03]: But essentially, when we talk about plant
morphology, we're really talking about
[SPEAKER_03]: utilizing different wavelengths of light
to get a canopy architecture that might be
[SPEAKER_03]: appealing for a whole bunch of different
reasons.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in very broad strokes, short
wavelengths generally mean short plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: The shorter the wavelength, you get kind
of a more compact plant, usually thicker
[SPEAKER_03]: leaves, often a little bit more robust.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as you move across the spectrum
towards longer wavelengths, you get a
[SPEAKER_03]: longer plant.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get cell expansion.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get intranode expansion and so on.
[SPEAKER_03]: So UVA and blue, you get really similar
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: You get increased pigmentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like the plant getting a sun
tan, just like if we go outside and we
[SPEAKER_03]: hang out in a bunch of UV light,
we get a tan.
[SPEAKER_03]: The plant's doing the same thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's defending itself from high-energy
photons.
[SPEAKER_03]: Green, a little bit less morphologically
impactful, but a lot of people are saying
[SPEAKER_03]: now that you can induce a lot of the same
sort of physiological responses with green
[SPEAKER_03]: light as you would get with far-red light.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, it's sort of telling the plant
that it's in the shade.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it should stretch out and try to get
into more intense light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Red, really good at driving
photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, cell expansion, generally
increased leaf area, but maybe a less
[SPEAKER_03]: robust plant overall than if you had a
higher kind of blue content.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not saying red's bad by any means.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm just saying it's a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And far-red is kind of the really extreme
example of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: When a plant is in far-red light,
it thinks it's in the shade and it wants
[SPEAKER_03]: to stretch out and get out of that shade
and get into some brighter sunlight just
[SPEAKER_03]: so it has more photons available to drive
you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Last but not least, we're talking about
plant quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm going to use this biochemical
pathway as a really good example of this
[SPEAKER_03]: because it's very relevant to the cannabis
space and indoor agriculture in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when we're talking about plant quality,
we are talking about secondary metabolism.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to point out a couple of
things right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this pathway that you're looking at is
representing a few things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's representing the biosynthesis of
carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what you see in the pinkish
color towards the bottom right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Lycopene, alpha-carotene, beta-carotene.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you remember, I mentioned these a
little bit earlier as the compounds that
[SPEAKER_03]: kind of fill in some of that gap in the
middle for yield production.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we have representing near the top
here are cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of this audience probably knows
what those are.
[SPEAKER_03]: They are exclusive to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: They do interesting things to your brain.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we have along here are all of the
terpenes that people think are probably
[SPEAKER_03]: relevant to the cannabis space and also
interact with cannabinoids to induce
[SPEAKER_03]: different sort of recreational attributes
and also medicinal attributes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we can find is that all of these
things share common precursors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Isopentanil pyrophosphate, or IPP,
and dimethyl allopyrophosphate,
[SPEAKER_03]: or DMAP.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, what you can take away from this is
that given they have all common
[SPEAKER_03]: precursors, maybe if you create a light
environment rich in some mid-range light
[SPEAKER_03]: and the plant has to be able to absorb it,
so it produces more lycopene, more
[SPEAKER_03]: alpha-carotene, more beta-carotene,
maybe the way it handles that is by
[SPEAKER_03]: up-regulating these precursors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe if you have more of these,
you can produce more carotenoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm sorry, maybe you can produce more
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe you can produce more terpenes.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is just one example where we take
what we understand about light and we
[SPEAKER_03]: manipulate that light environment to
achieve a sort of targeted result in our
[SPEAKER_03]: production.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So with two minutes remaining,
I just have one more slide on here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just a picture of a few of our
products.
[SPEAKER_03]: As I say, I understand probably a lot of
people here are of some familiarity with
[SPEAKER_03]: Fluence, but if you don't, it is an LED
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have lots of different form factors to
satisfy a few different markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: But very briefly, what you see here,
kind of front and center, is something we
[SPEAKER_03]: call Spider 2P.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is most often what gets specked
into indoor cannabis facilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's designed to have very good uniformity
placed really close to the canopy.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's great because, again, you can play
this over tables.
[SPEAKER_03]: It also works really well in like a tiered
sort of multi-level system.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not exclusive to cannabis, but that is
where we see it most.
[SPEAKER_03]: A similar product, but a little bit
different, is in the top left here,
[SPEAKER_03]: we call this Razor.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is intended for leafy greens,
kind of vertical farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can mount this, again,
on kind of a racking system.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have a version of this that mounts on
the end on a rack.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's sort of cantilevered off a wall.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you can have trolleys of plants kind
of move in and out of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a few other things.
[SPEAKER_03]: This here we call Viper.
[SPEAKER_03]: And in the sort of commercial agriculture
space, we spec this into greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of like our HPS replacement,
where it's just this super bright thing
[SPEAKER_03]: that just blasts out a whole lot of
photons.
[SPEAKER_03]: But again, for certain indoor
applications, depending on how your
[SPEAKER_03]: facility is laid out, that gets specked in
sometimes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is just called Ray.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a single bar of LEDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Honestly, this is mostly used for
research, but there are some niche
[SPEAKER_03]: applications where you can use this as
well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have quite a few different spectra
of Ray.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you use it either as a sole source
solution, or if you had a bright broad
[SPEAKER_03]: spectrum and you wanted to supplement some
additional far-red or some UV or something
[SPEAKER_03]: like that, Ray is usually what you would
use.
[SPEAKER_03]: So without being too long-winded,
I think I'll just pass it on.
[SPEAKER_03]: And do you do the next introduction?
[SPEAKER_03]: Neil can speak for himself.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Holliday, that was amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: I've learned a lot.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So good morning, everybody.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm Neil Dygert.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm vice president of SoliTube
International.
[SPEAKER_08]: And there we go.
[SPEAKER_08]: My specialty is actually light and the
circadian response to the ever-changing
[SPEAKER_08]: spectrum of light, especially as human
vision, neurochemistry, and psychology of
[SPEAKER_08]: perception.
[SPEAKER_08]: But obviously, plants follow or use the
same spectrum.
[SPEAKER_08]: As Dr. Lesserud already pointed out,
our daytime vision is uniquely tuned to
[SPEAKER_08]: the green portion.
[SPEAKER_08]: The green portion of the visible spectrum.
[SPEAKER_08]: But what he didn't state is that we
actually have some intrinsically
[SPEAKER_08]: photoresponsive ganglion cells that
actually drive our circadian rhythm that
[SPEAKER_08]: actually almost directly match the blue
spectrum that drives photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what keeps us entrained in the
24-hour clock.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll talk about that a little bit.
[SPEAKER_08]: I am here to talk about daylight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So obviously, daylight is the reference
light source that we use to compare
[SPEAKER_08]: all-electric lighting today.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what we're going to see is that when
we properly capture daylight, it obviously
[SPEAKER_08]: directly matches the McCree response curve
or desired action spectrum that we want
[SPEAKER_08]: for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So traditionally, when we think about
lighting, we're going to have three
[SPEAKER_08]: different ways of emitting light to a
building.
[SPEAKER_08]: Perimeter glass.
[SPEAKER_08]: So perimeter glass is great.
[SPEAKER_08]: It allows us to have views to the outside.
[SPEAKER_08]: But typically, it's associated with heat,
shifting patterns of light, and just a
[SPEAKER_08]: very dynamic environment.
[SPEAKER_08]: Not necessarily something that we want for
today's growth environments.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can have top lighting, as we would
associate with a skylight or the rooftop
[SPEAKER_08]: glazing of a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, really good if we're fully glazing
a building.
[SPEAKER_08]: But we do have shifting patterns of light.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have heat.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have leakage.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have all sorts of issues that could
become problematic in the growth arena.
[SPEAKER_08]: What we're talking about today,
or what I'm introducing you to,
[SPEAKER_08]: is the notion of optics.
[SPEAKER_08]: So optical daylighting.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for the first time now, we have a
product that is uniquely designed to only
[SPEAKER_08]: admit the wavelengths that we need for
vision and photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually extracts heat and UV that we
don't want in the building.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it would be problematic.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can also use very small apertures to
selectively harvest light by angle.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can actually tune it to admit light
or to broaden the number of hours per day
[SPEAKER_08]: that we have useful illumination.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can also capture incredible amounts of
daylight in a very small aperture and
[SPEAKER_08]: drive it down into a building and focus it
optically where we want it, such as the
[SPEAKER_08]: plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can do this without any heat.
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, really beneficial in a growth
environment.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just very quickly, when we talk about
an advanced optical system, we have the
[SPEAKER_08]: capture zone, which allows us to
selectively harvest the light and the
[SPEAKER_08]: wavelengths of energy that we want,
extracting the wavelengths that we do not
[SPEAKER_08]: want in the system.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have the optical light guide that
allows us to now duct the light.
[SPEAKER_08]: So whether it is a very short distance or
a very long convoluted pathway,
[SPEAKER_08]: we have wonderful new technologies that
literally allow us to transport the light
[SPEAKER_08]: with virtually no light loss.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then ultimately, we can diffuse the
light just like we would with lighting
[SPEAKER_08]: equipment.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can provide focused lighting to
highlight an object in a room that we want
[SPEAKER_08]: to call visual attention to.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or in the case of indoor agriculture,
we can now focus it on the plant canopy
[SPEAKER_08]: itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: We also can provide full range dimming so
we can fully modulate daylight as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So obviously, for those of you familiar
with Solitube, you know of us as a product
[SPEAKER_08]: for lighting interior spaces.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's what we do.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have done it for a very long time,
and we've invented a lot of technologies
[SPEAKER_08]: that allow us to do this.
[SPEAKER_08]: All these spaces that you see are 100%
daylit.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is actually one of the very first
daylit Olympic venues.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the martial arts venue in the
Beijing Olympics.
[SPEAKER_08]: Ever since then, every Olympic building
has had Solitube products or optical
[SPEAKER_08]: daylighting systems in the venues.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here, we're focusing the light 60 feet to
the competition floor.
[SPEAKER_08]: So production facilities.
[SPEAKER_08]: Again, nothing new for us.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then also, we have been working in the
indoor agricultural field for quite some
[SPEAKER_08]: time.
[SPEAKER_08]: This project is about 10, 12 years old.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is actually an algae growth facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so these bioreactors are daylit.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the optical daylighting system,
as you can see, is pumping into the top of
[SPEAKER_08]: the bioreactors to allow the algae to
propagate.
[SPEAKER_08]: OK, so today, I really want to talk about
some pivotal research that has been
[SPEAKER_08]: ongoing for the last few years.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I want to reference a foundational
study done by Dr. Cachet of CCB Research
[SPEAKER_08]: and Flourish Farms and really focus on
what he has learned relative to the
[SPEAKER_08]: application of optical daylighting to an
indoor growth facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: So in this study, what we're going to look
at is a fully optimized system where
[SPEAKER_08]: daylight is the dominant light source.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it's supported by LED lighting on
the shoulder hours of the day where we
[SPEAKER_08]: might want to provide a little bump up in
daytime illumination or actually the PPFD
[SPEAKER_08]: levels on the plant canopy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's an example of some of the growth
chambers that he was experimenting on.
[SPEAKER_08]: These are 10 by 12 sheds, daylit with four
optical systems.
[SPEAKER_08]: Each of these optical systems can produce
around 55,000 lumens during the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is the inside of the growth chamber.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what was kind of interesting is that
what he discovered, anecdotally,
[SPEAKER_08]: is that the daylight actually provides a
different quality of illumination in the
[SPEAKER_08]: space.
[SPEAKER_08]: It actually provides volumetric lighting.
[SPEAKER_08]: So rather than just laying the top of the
canopy of the plants themselves,
[SPEAKER_08]: it actually fills the space with light.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we actually extend the depth of the
growth area in the usable area.
[SPEAKER_08]: From an energy standpoint, relative to the
typical HBS system, if we look at the
[SPEAKER_08]: daily energy consumption, when we apply
the daylight, what you see in the lower
[SPEAKER_08]: green bar, so we're looking at the course
of the day, and the use of electric lights
[SPEAKER_08]: in response to or to provide makeup PPFD.
[SPEAKER_08]: levels inside the growth chamber itself,
we see that we're able to fully displace
[SPEAKER_08]: the need for the electric light for a
significant portion of the day,
[SPEAKER_08]: on average between five to eight hours per
day.
[SPEAKER_08]: In doing so, we're able to significantly
reduce the annual energy costs,
[SPEAKER_08]: both for lighting, as well as for heat
removal in the growth chamber so we can
[SPEAKER_08]: keep the plants at optimal temperatures.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can also provide the desired
spectral content that we want for the
[SPEAKER_08]: plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: to grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we can reduce the energy consumption by
a fifth or more from what you would
[SPEAKER_08]: associate with a traditional indoor
agricultural environment.
[SPEAKER_08]: So looking at the spectral content of
daylight, that back farthest most spectral
[SPEAKER_08]: region is going to be for daytime,
noontime illumination, a DL 5500 source,
[SPEAKER_08]: as we would call it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we see that as a full spectrum light
source.
[SPEAKER_08]: We also see that it peaks in the blue
wavelengths, which is what we want for
[SPEAKER_08]: photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_08]: The light sources in front of that are
going to be the more traditional electric
[SPEAKER_08]: light sources that we would see in the
standard illuminated space.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, we see that the shapes are very
different, so daylight really is the
[SPEAKER_08]: reference source that we need to consider.
[SPEAKER_08]: This chart, the lower left-hand corner,
represents the McCree curve.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the photosynthesis or photosynthetics
is basically active radiation spectral
[SPEAKER_08]: response curve that we want between 400
and 700 nanometers.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then the central curve in the center
reflects what we were able to achieve with
[SPEAKER_08]: the optically filtered daylight through
optical systems.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we see this beautifully biased curve
that is perfect for photosynthesis.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what does it look like when we're
actually growing plants?
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, we can see that when we provide
this daylight, we can do so, again,
[SPEAKER_08]: five to eight hours a day without the need
for any makeup electric light.
[SPEAKER_08]: And we can also see that we have very deep
penetration of the growth canopy itself
[SPEAKER_08]: while the plants are growing and working
towards maturation.
[SPEAKER_08]: We can see some early stages in the
flowering process.
[SPEAKER_08]: And in the end, you can see the end
result.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, what was very interesting is there is
some discussion on whether we need UV for
[SPEAKER_08]: growing plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, solitubes or I should say optical
daylighting is unique in that we can
[SPEAKER_08]: actually start to filter out the UV that
we don't want.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what was very interesting from these
studies, as anecdotal information,
[SPEAKER_08]: Dr. Cachet was able to discover or
discovered that without the UV,
[SPEAKER_08]: we don't have the browning effect of the
flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So as a result, the flowers literally have
a longer shelf life.
[SPEAKER_08]: Here's an example in a hemp facility.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going from a small scale kind of
proof of concept application to some large
[SPEAKER_08]: agricultural application.
[SPEAKER_08]: So here we have a hemp cultivation
facility in Arkansas.
[SPEAKER_08]: And you can see a range of optical systems
being applied to the roof.
[SPEAKER_08]: And what's really interesting is that in
the case of the hemp growth facility where
[SPEAKER_08]: you're growing seedlings and then
preparing them for planting, you have a
[SPEAKER_08]: hardening process that you normally have
to go through with electric growth
[SPEAKER_08]: chambers that doesn't or is not required
when we use daylight.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the plants emerge fully pre-hardened,
ready for planting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: So very quickly, just again, some examples
of the hemp cultivation facility of these
[SPEAKER_08]: pre-hardened plants and a nice comparison
side by side of daylighting light,
[SPEAKER_08]: daytime daylight illumination to nighttime
LED illumination.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's optical daylighting.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll talk more about it later.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Sundarajan Mutialu.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to talk a little bit about
sunlight and biomimicry aligning with
[SPEAKER_04]: nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think to do this, it isn't just
lighting.
[SPEAKER_04]: We need a very symbiotic relationship
going inside, especially indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to understand why are you
growing this?
[SPEAKER_04]: What's the reason for it?
[SPEAKER_04]: You want full nutrition, nutrient value.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want cannabis that has all of the
compounds so you can actually heal and not
[SPEAKER_04]: be extractive in the sense of just going
high THC as an example and not bringing
[SPEAKER_04]: out all those beautiful compounds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you've got to grow like Mother Nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to preserve and really grow the
genetics and get genetic diversity rather
[SPEAKER_04]: than putting genetics down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because in the way of cannabis,
it pretty much all started with Afghan
[SPEAKER_04]: many years ago, and people kept going down
to the point where we're down to a
[SPEAKER_04]: significant amount of chemovars that are
the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: So achieve full genetic expression from
optimum nutrient, grow generality and
[SPEAKER_04]: beyond organic, and then produce really
freshly and delicious food.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because sun is the energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the main source of the whole world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a definition of science is seeing how
nature does it and emulate that through
[SPEAKER_04]: biomimicry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we know plants can heal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so the questions I'm interested in are
a little bit different than just designing
[SPEAKER_04]: of light.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this one here is very controversial in
the sense that we believe coming from a
[SPEAKER_04]: wellness and sustainability income,
that if you're growing with artificial
[SPEAKER_04]: lights, you're bottle feeding,
you're in a sterile, very sterile medium
[SPEAKER_04]: and then finishing off with things like
pesticides, you get really a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: limited genetic expression because you're
tightening that plant down into a very
[SPEAKER_04]: narrow place rather than Mother Nature.
[SPEAKER_04]: Going back then, obviously with nature,
you have sunlight, true living soil,
[SPEAKER_04]: very hard to do indoors, completely
organic, healthy plant immune system has
[SPEAKER_04]: to set, and full genetic expression to get
the entourage effect, especially for
[SPEAKER_04]: things like, well not things like,
but cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're a company that's really tech
agnostic.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so nature is the reference point for
us.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to have abiotic and biotic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Conditions to really have an optimum and
grow of plants to get maximum expression
[SPEAKER_04]: and bioavailability.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from the plants point of view is what
you need to look at when you're growing
[SPEAKER_04]: indoors, not from the growers point of
view, not from the soil guys point of
[SPEAKER_04]: view, but from what the plant wants.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to do a very symbiotic kind of
system of looking at water transferration,
[SPEAKER_04]: VPD, the living soil so you can have
microbes that help and not flood the whole
[SPEAKER_04]: room with CO2, which by the way,
thickens leaves and closes stomata often.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you want to look at it from the plant's
point of view.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm going to talk a little bit
different than the gentlemen have so far.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to talk about outside of PAR.
[SPEAKER_04]: And PAR, it's really only 43% of the
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have a lot of plants that grow outdoors
that gets everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when we start limiting it, you limit
the PAR.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really artificial lighting in that
PAR range because that's what really the
[SPEAKER_04]: systems can produce.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you basically do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: More and more we're getting away from that
and getting more full spectrum light.
[SPEAKER_04]: So when you have no ultraviolet and no
infrared, you know it lacks the uniformity
[SPEAKER_04]: and density of sunlight frequencies and it
really limits genetic expression as well
[SPEAKER_04]: as diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: For instance, rather than talking about
McCree, I'm going to talk about the
[SPEAKER_04]: combinations of different light UV and
blue, which you have to have UV to be able
[SPEAKER_04]: to get a good immune system.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you want to get some secondary
metabolites, as we were just talking about
[SPEAKER_04]: a little while ago, are extremely
important as well for the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: And infrared circadian rhythms,
just like you just mentioned a moment ago,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's very important for the plant how fast
they go to sleep.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're growing when it's dark.
[SPEAKER_04]: Most of the growing is when it's dark.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just getting energy during the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm going to spend a little time here.
[SPEAKER_04]: The little two little dots at the bottom
there, this is where all the lighting
[SPEAKER_04]: technology currently is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's within typically the PAR range.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are some that go out.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you look at UVA, I mean, when you
look at the sun, which is the yellow here,
[SPEAKER_04]: our technology emulates that 100%.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other is when you look at HP,
you see this range is actually just here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And also mostly LEDs are in that same.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's very normalized frequency,
which means you're normalizing those dots
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to get the curve to match,
rather than in the way our technology,
[SPEAKER_04]: every quarter wave, everything is present.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just trying to mix it or putting
a filter in front of it to be able to get
[SPEAKER_04]: the waves, wavelengths.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what does that look like in a grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: Here's a 500 square foot grow with HPS.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can see all the air conditioning
systems necessary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it really relies on doing some things
to your plant you really don't want to do,
[SPEAKER_04]: but you've got to get it to grow at 43.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that is 24,000 watts, 24 lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: Air conditioning to be able to cool that
room down.
[SPEAKER_04]: We replace that with one light.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 1100 watt light.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, would we do one in this grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we'd probably do five so that we have
uniform UV.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's a significant, not only
savings, and you can see the difference
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you look at the shadows even compared
to what you see here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very clean, very crisp.
[SPEAKER_04]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Even the tie down here, you can see.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just a sheer number of photons coming
out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very dense, very uniform, just like
sunlight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the reason it's just like sunlight,
we actually developed this for sunlight.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a lot of numbers here,
but basically we just did an economic
[SPEAKER_04]: study on a 1400 square foot facility.
[SPEAKER_04]: And not only do you have a savings in it,
and energy, you get full plant expression.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to pass that one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But here's a grow of 2100 square feet in
Oakland.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's 66 HPS lights in here, 66,000
watts.
[SPEAKER_04]: We replaced that with 20.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there was a leading LED company that
bid for this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So let's put 110 LEDs in here.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can imagine the amount of power.
[SPEAKER_04]: So what do those plants look like?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have to say that I am from the cannabis
world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been starting to grow in Berkeley
when I was 12 and 13.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's definitely cannabis and not
marijuana to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't mind talking about it at any
conference.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some of the things you can start doing
is doing land races when you can do
[SPEAKER_04]: completely living soil and full sunlight.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you do lots of different combination.
[SPEAKER_04]: The headband here is notorious for popcorn
type of growth rather than distance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so you can see these things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is a hoop house in Oregon with no
heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can see.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the fruity pebbles here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wanted to show you a little
diversity.
[SPEAKER_04]: We also do food.
[SPEAKER_04]: If anybody's looking at trichomes,
take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything here was grown by the sun on
demand and except obviously the rice and
[SPEAKER_04]: the rap.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can grow indoors.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we'll open it up for questions.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't have any, I can start posing
some.
[SPEAKER_01]: But sun, what is the underlying technology
that's giving you twice the efficacy of
[SPEAKER_04]: plasma?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a plasma, a light.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, uh, it's not a point source.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it allows for a lot of photons to come
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what would the efficient, like the
micro moles per joule of your system be?
[SPEAKER_04]: When you start talking about PPFD is the
same as the sun 2100 electrical
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiency, meaning like how much
electricity or light out do you get per
[SPEAKER_01]: electricity or energy in?
[SPEAKER_04]: Ooh, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say from, uh, I'm baffled by your
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for light usually measured in,
um, you know, like a typical efficient
[SPEAKER_01]: fixture efficiency would be 2.5 micro
moles per joule.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a number of photons per energy and
other like LED fixture or HPS would be
[SPEAKER_01]: 1.8.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I can't answer that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I can get the information to you.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, are UVs making a breakthrough on life
or are they still about the eight to
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 hours on the, uh, LED UV dance?
[SPEAKER_06]: Who is the question directed towards?
[SPEAKER_00]: The panel.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are the ones.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the question is, uh, life of the LED
source itself.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, there's still a shorter lifespan than
any of the corner of, uh, dominant LED
[SPEAKER_03]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like, uh, anything within the visible
spectrum has kind of the comparable
[SPEAKER_03]: lifespan, whether, whether you're talking
about a broad spectrum diode, like a,
[SPEAKER_03]: just a generic, like a warm white or a
cool white or, or if you look at narrow
[SPEAKER_03]: band, you look at like a blue diode and a
red diode and a less so amber and green.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause that technology is also a little bit
behind, but yeah, UVs are still,
[SPEAKER_03]: they have a ways to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with LEDs, typically I, I'm a thin film
engineer as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we developed a lot, a lot of diodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're starting to about 130,000,
140,000 hours, depending on which diode
[SPEAKER_04]: you start, start losing spectra.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, and typically cycle times three,
three years, maybe some people are now
[SPEAKER_04]: going up to five, but that's by cooling
because you've got a lot of heat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heat dissipation our lights a hundred
thousand hours without losing any kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: spectra.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's one of the beauties of plasma.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any other questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'll pose one here.
[SPEAKER_06]: Um, so we heard a little bit about the
costs and structure, but if I can actually
[SPEAKER_06]: do it, has anybody actually done a
calculation based on a number of units of
[SPEAKER_06]: light that are able to be produced over a
year period using each one of the
[SPEAKER_06]: technologies.
[SPEAKER_06]: So if you're going to be doing the solar
tube, obviously there's an installation
[SPEAKER_06]: capex cost.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then hopefully the light is free at
that point, uh, as opposed to the led,
[SPEAKER_06]: which is there's a cost of buying the led
and electrical cost as well as for the,
[SPEAKER_06]: for the plasma system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Has anybody actually done that?
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have, I mean, we've looked at
various systems for daylight.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously the capex is going to be largely
a climate driven.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it depends on where you are
constructing your facility that will
[SPEAKER_08]: determine how many daylighting systems are
required to provide the necessary,
[SPEAKER_08]: um, par illumination on the plant canopy
here in California or anywhere where it's,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, we have a nice robust sunny climate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Uh, actually we're looking at something
where based on energy savings,
[SPEAKER_08]: you're probably looking at about a one
year payback to pay for the, the
[SPEAKER_08]: daylighting system.
[SPEAKER_08]: And at that point it's free.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's no maintenance of the system and
it's just, uh, work thrown.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think on the operational expense
side, Neil is probably going to have me
[SPEAKER_03]: beat at free.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, led can't quite compete with that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, as for the capital expenditure,
um, led is certainly more expensive than
[SPEAKER_03]: HPS on day one, but that, that narrative
tends to fall apart pretty quickly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm not going to pretend to be an
expert on that, but I have a couple of
[SPEAKER_03]: colleagues here.
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, Karim, while they're, and Brady Namath
are a little bit more plugged in on a few
[SPEAKER_03]: things.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some really interesting stuff
going on with utility providers and
[SPEAKER_03]: rebates and a lot of the capital expense
that's associated with led.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I probably shouldn't say this,
but I would imagine probably some more
[SPEAKER_03]: efficient technologies in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are a lot of initiatives to kind of
encourage people to go that route.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, and governmental bodies will absorb
some of that cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can work through your utility
provider to really have the capital
[SPEAKER_03]: expenditure, uh, become kind of a
non-issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: So again, I'll, if you're interested in
that part of the story, I can connect you
[SPEAKER_03]: with those people after the fact.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, with our systems, the, with the bulb
of a hundred thousand hours, you don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have to obviously change bulbs all the
time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, for a new installation, we actually
pay for the lights before a plant goes
[SPEAKER_04]: under it because you're half the air
conditioning, you're 20 lights versus 66
[SPEAKER_04]: lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Structure goes away.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the other area is the use of
materials.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, when you're doing it in living soil,
you're buying less inputs.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're doing less pest control strips,
uh, because you have UV and you have,
[SPEAKER_04]: uh, all of the spectra available just like
outdoors, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So the plants are healthy and they're
immune.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you also save in that arena.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I didn't know if you just meant from a
manufacturing perspective, but in total,
[SPEAKER_06]: the full system.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: If I may, I mean, certainly I think the
important aspect is that when we talk
[SPEAKER_08]: about a well-designed facility,
we want to integrate all the systems and
[SPEAKER_08]: we want to optimize them so they all work
together.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the nice thing about a daylight
enhanced growth facility is that we're not
[SPEAKER_08]: just talking daylight.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're actually talking about a fully
integrated system where we have the
[SPEAKER_08]: electric light source that's providing the
makeup, uh, par, uh, or PPFD.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, uh, intensity is where we need them in
doing so though, and when daylight becomes
[SPEAKER_08]: the dominant light source, we
significantly extend the life of the
[SPEAKER_08]: electrical components.
[SPEAKER_08]: So your facility actually has might much
greater, uh, life expectancy.
[SPEAKER_08]: We've increased the efficiency
significantly and we reduced the cost of
[SPEAKER_08]: goods dramatically for the product in the
end.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it's a win-win.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also when it's properly done,
as we've seen in the research is that.
[SPEAKER_08]: When you have properly monitored or
metered systems, you can actually,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, prevent failures of electrical
components because you can start to see
[SPEAKER_08]: where a problem might be arising,
get it corrected before it becomes an
[SPEAKER_08]: issue that damages the crop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: And actually I think probably everybody in
this room is picking up on a common thread
[SPEAKER_03]: here, which is that, um, although the
three of us were representing three pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: distinct technologies, the common thread
here is that we're all advocating it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: broad spectrum light.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, whether that's plasma technology,
which admittedly I'm, I'm actually less
[SPEAKER_03]: well versed in or, or sunlight,
which we all have some familiarity with or
[SPEAKER_03]: broad spectrum LEDs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, really what you could be taking away
from that, uh, from us as a group is that
[SPEAKER_03]: broad spectrum is really going to be
better for plant quality in a whole lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: ways.
[SPEAKER_03]: And whether it's, um, channeling sunlight
around or creating sunlight or using led
[SPEAKER_03]: for broad spectrum light, you do end up
with a more robust, robust plant and
[SPEAKER_03]: whether that is making it easier to manage
heat load or mitigate pathogen stress or
[SPEAKER_03]: other applications for plant hardening or,
or achieving certain chemo bars or
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Um, that's, you know, for, for good
reason, that's the way the entire industry
[SPEAKER_03]: seems to be moving.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Any questions?
[SPEAKER_06]: We'll hold bunch now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uh, two, two comments on the plasma.
[SPEAKER_05]: Um, is there, I'm wondering first if
there's any restriction on ceiling height,
[SPEAKER_05]: if you need a higher ceiling height,
then you would for, uh, uh, led or high
[SPEAKER_05]: pressure sodium.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also if there's any special
reflectance you need, uh, off the ceiling,
[SPEAKER_05]: uh, reflective materials off the ceiling
to distribute that light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you saw that one didn't have a
reflector in the photo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, obviously you want to save photons for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it's a lack of them, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, you know, a lot of people said to me
about, you're like the sun, really?
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, well, no, not really.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, that's, that's point 3.74 times 10
to the 37th Watts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm 1100 Watts.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no way that kind of power is going
to come down.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would, I forgot the rest of your
question.
[SPEAKER_04]: What was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: You had three, Oh, ceiling height,
nine, nine feet, nine and a half feet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're about a hundred to 144 square foot
footprint.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, obviously when you put them that way,
that one room had, uh, 20 lights.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we do measure, uh, we, we made this
for a solar simulator.
[SPEAKER_04]: People put in a whole Mercedes to see in
1000 hours, what 20 years does.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, a lot of, a lot of area was
there.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, so the question was, uh, when we have,
uh, utility companies that are either
[SPEAKER_08]: requiring some sort of site, site based
generation to account for the power
[SPEAKER_08]: consumption of the facility or the
utilities themselves are having a ramp up,
[SPEAKER_08]: uh, power generation themselves,
is there a benefit?
[SPEAKER_08]: And absolutely, because we're able to
displace, you know, 50, 60% or more of the
[SPEAKER_08]: electrical consumption associated with
lighting and, uh, reduction in cool,
[SPEAKER_08]: in cooling energy as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: So there is definitely a benefit for the
utilities and certainly for the growth
[SPEAKER_08]: facility itself, we would definitely
decrease the need for, uh, generation or
[SPEAKER_08]: at least use of the generation equipment
over time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, uh, we keep talking about solar space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, but from my understanding,
it changes throughout the day and can
[SPEAKER_02]: change depending on what your latitude is
on earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, how are, how are we determining what
solar spectrum is?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we presented multiple graphs,
uh, showing a different distribution.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, it seemed like some of them were
different from others, especially in early
[SPEAKER_02]: on in the presentation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, so I'm just wondering if there's a
standard methodology for determining what
[SPEAKER_02]: sunlight is.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you're right.
[SPEAKER_08]: The, the special content of daylight does
change to a certain degree.
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, the underlying principle is that
daylight is continuous.
[SPEAKER_08]: The, it is always going to be rich in the
blue end of the spectrum where things
[SPEAKER_08]: start to change is when we have turbidity
in the skies.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we go from a clear sky day to an
overcast sky day.
[SPEAKER_08]: Some of the reds may change during the
course of the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so the general curve may alter whether
we're talking about a 5,000 K daylight
[SPEAKER_08]: source or a 6,500 K daylight source,
but the, the overall intensity of the
[SPEAKER_08]: light in the critical regions stays
consistent and very useful.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other is that you have to have some
kind of a standard to be able to do.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sunlight outside is the standard.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's what we should be doing because
that's what plants, how, how they came
[SPEAKER_04]: into play, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have pretty much ruined our
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_04]: So by the time you get to the surface of
the earth, by the time you hit all the
[SPEAKER_04]: water molecules, especially the smaller
wavelengths, you lose a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: The reason you, the latitude and latitude
make a big difference is the amount of
[SPEAKER_04]: atmosphere it's going through.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you see the refraction of light.
[SPEAKER_04]: As an example, a peacock is actually brown
or almost a brown gray.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just our eyes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the surface that creates those
colors.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it isn't color anymore.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not luminous flex.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's electromagnetic.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you look at a class A bulb for
instance in Europe, there's been a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: work in looking at what is the sun
spectra.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that's the one you should kind of take
because in our marketing material,
[SPEAKER_04]: we'll make everything fit to sell
products, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to go back to the real
standard of what sunlight is and then talk
[SPEAKER_04]: to a lighting guy, say, what is that plant
or what does that product look like
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoors?
[SPEAKER_04]: And now show me you did the same thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Last question and then we'll wrap this up.
[SPEAKER_06]: Great.
[SPEAKER_07]: Question for Solotube.
[SPEAKER_07]: For both your research facilities,
like the sheds that were shown there,
[SPEAKER_07]: as well as for production facilities,
what PPFD have you been able to achieve
[SPEAKER_07]: specifically for flowering cannabis?
[SPEAKER_08]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what we see from diffuse daylight,
the research was able to show that diffuse
[SPEAKER_08]: illumination or PPFD is in the 300 to 600
range over the course of the day.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we have a transitory bright spot,
which actually is beneficial for the
[SPEAKER_08]: plants, which if I recall correctly,
ranges from about 1300 up to about 1900
[SPEAKER_08]: PPFD.
[SPEAKER_08]: So again, that's going to vary based on
whether it's a cloudy day or a sunny day,
[SPEAKER_08]: but so nice robust levels.
[SPEAKER_08]: And obviously the desire of keeping it in
the 500 or 600 PPFD range is readily
[SPEAKER_08]: achievable over the course of the day.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: That would be top of canopy.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'd like to thank everyone for
coming to this session and hopefully you
[SPEAKER_06]: enjoy the rest of the conference here.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'd like to thank the three panelists
for spending your time, Sun, Neil and
[SPEAKER_06]: Dave.
[SPEAKER_06]: So thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll see you next time.
