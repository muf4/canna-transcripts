[SPEAKER_01]: Data is king.
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess after cash, data is king,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether we're scaling or our customers
are scaling, everybody speaks about data
[SPEAKER_01]: to make the company smarter and build.
[SPEAKER_01]: How long has that customer been in the
store wandering around for a product?
[SPEAKER_01]: How old are they?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's their average spend?
[SPEAKER_01]: When's the last time they came back to the
store?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they coming back once a month?
[SPEAKER_01]: Did they never come back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they a regular?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are they using your data?
[SPEAKER_01]: Your loyalty program?
[SPEAKER_01]: That, in a nutshell, is what I see as a
smart, forward-thinking company that wants
[SPEAKER_01]: to not only obtain customers, but keep
them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Given that LeafLogix is in 28 states,
what kind of trends are you noticing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily within the data,
but actually in terms of retailer behavior
[SPEAKER_00]: and adoption of your services.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you seeing any differences between,
let's say, the West Coast more
[SPEAKER_00]: commercially-oriented states or the East
Coast more medically-oriented states?
[SPEAKER_01]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_01]: How it changes in the future will be
interesting, how it evolves, because it
[SPEAKER_01]: will become borderless, but it's not
borderless now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there is a distinct difference between
an East Coast buyer, which is similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe a Midwest buyer, and then it all
changes when you hit the mountain time
[SPEAKER_01]: zone, mountain standard time.
[SPEAKER_01]: I see brands, brands, brands much more
evolved on the West Coast from Colorado
[SPEAKER_01]: West.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the East Coast, I don't know if
I'd call it catch-up, but because of that
[SPEAKER_01]: medicinal area, that they're not in that
consumerism market yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the vertical integration, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And the vertical integration, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In Colorado, for example, they used to
make it 70, if you were selling medicinal
[SPEAKER_01]: products, you had to source within your
own vertical 70% of the product.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now it's down to 50, or about to be,
and it will be phased out sometime next
[SPEAKER_01]: year, is what I'm hearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: But all of that leads back to data,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So data will trend from brands to what
they come back to purchase, the results.
[SPEAKER_01]: On our point of sale, one of the aspects
is the consumer, whether they're a patient
[SPEAKER_01]: or rec customer, they leave feedback on
what they liked and didn't like about the
[SPEAKER_01]: product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're saying that consumers are able
to leave feedback on the products they
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased through your platform.
[SPEAKER_00]: A, how are you actually engaging with a
consumer that way?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there an application or do they get
texted?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they can go online.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an e-commerce platform for our
clients, our B2B clients, and they in turn
[SPEAKER_01]: will open that up to their patients or rec
customers, and they will leave feedback on
[SPEAKER_01]: everything from how it helped,
a medical problem they had, a condition,
[SPEAKER_01]: or simply for recreational, the effects on
their body, and they'll tie that together
[SPEAKER_01]: with, do they go back and purchase that
product?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do they try something else?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they can leave that on, within that
point of sale facility, so the next time
[SPEAKER_01]: they go in, that budtender will have a
running knowledge of what that person
[SPEAKER_01]: likes, which is pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not just bought, but what they like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct, and the effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you think about it, yes,
our industry's nascent compared to the
[SPEAKER_01]: liquor industry, for example, but when's
the last time, unless you knew Charlie the
[SPEAKER_01]: bartender at your local haunt,
when's the last time you could go into a
[SPEAKER_01]: bar and the person serving you knows what
you like, prepackages it perhaps before
[SPEAKER_01]: you come in, and you know the effects on
your body.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely, and I'm actually going to
follow that up with some interesting
[SPEAKER_00]: insights that we're seeing in the data,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we collect both retail tracking data,
which is the data that we partner with the
[SPEAKER_00]: point of sale systems on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we actually partner directly with
the retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The retailer is the one that agrees to
give the data, but we partner with a point
[SPEAKER_00]: of sale data, with a point of sale to
actually collect that data, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're seeing there is the
purchasing behavior overall in California,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're definitely seeing everything
move away from flour towards, as we've
[SPEAKER_00]: heard before, edibles and concentrates and
more consumer or new user consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: oriented products, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: More easy, ease of use and entry level
friendly products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And incidentally, what we're seeing
within, we're seeing about 15% edible
[SPEAKER_00]: sales, but in our consumer data,
so this is what is actually being
[SPEAKER_00]: purchased at retail, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The retail tracking data.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our consumer data, which is the
survey-based data, we actually see
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers reporting on preference a much
higher preference of edible consumption
[SPEAKER_00]: than we see in the purchasing,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So while roughly 15% of sales are edibles,
the consumers report, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe roughly 20 or 20-something percent
report that they prefer edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so where's that discrepancy,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Why are we seeing that difference between
the purchasing and the preference?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, and where's it going,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So A, a lot of it is probably at home
baking.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're definitely seeing a lot more brownie
preferences in the consumer data than
[SPEAKER_00]: actual purchases in the sales data,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's probably more regulatory based
in California at this point, since making
[SPEAKER_00]: brownies has become a whole lot harder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think what it shows and how it ties
back into the interesting insights that
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys are collecting on consumers'
response or how they like the product
[SPEAKER_00]: they're buying, whatever the word is for
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Preference.
[SPEAKER_00]: How they enjoy that specific product or
how it makes them feel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, so it's the frequency, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: The frequency of consumption is what is
not being recorded between the purchase
[SPEAKER_00]: and the preference is how often are they
consuming it, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a knowledge there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got to gather that data.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if you're getting that data and
you're saying, okay, well, look,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the reason only 15% of sales are
edibles, but 20-something percent of
[SPEAKER_00]: consumers report that they prefer edibles
is because maybe, you know, our chocolate
[SPEAKER_00]: bar is lasting too long.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, if you're a chocolate
manufacturer and you know that people are,
[SPEAKER_00]: that there's a strong preference for your
edible product and, you know, consumers
[SPEAKER_00]: are reporting favorably on it,
but they're not purchasing it as often as
[SPEAKER_00]: they should, well, that is an opportunity
for not just the retailer to make
[SPEAKER_00]: different decisions around what types of
products, maybe they want more
[SPEAKER_00]: high-frequency products on their shelves,
but also for the manufacturers to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: more high-frequency purchasable products.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know BDS just went into Arizona
recently, correct?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we just launched.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're going to bring that knowledge
from other states into the stores in
[SPEAKER_01]: Arizona, or do they start from scratch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any type of comparison?
[SPEAKER_01]: You give them a little education on what's
happening outside of Arizona?
[SPEAKER_00]: Very interesting question.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so initially, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, generally how it works is,
you know, you, as a participating
[SPEAKER_00]: retailer, you receive access to the state
in which you participate, exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but yeah, when we launch a state,
right, we obviously don't have data on
[SPEAKER_00]: that state.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we give our retailers access to another
state, perhaps as an incentive to
[SPEAKER_00]: participate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they are able to learn from other
states' behavior to see, all right,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, you know, I mean, Arizona hasn't
launched an adult use market yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they haven't legalized just quite
yet, but expected to legalize soon,
hopefully.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say 2020.
[SPEAKER_00]: 2020, right on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sounds about right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and so, yeah, and so what's
interesting is, you know, adult use are
[SPEAKER_00]: not, yes, of course, there's a lot for
them to learn from other adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: markets, such as Colorado and Oregon that
have been up and running for many years.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, California is still young.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't, not that they're, I mean,
there's obviously tons to learn from the
[SPEAKER_00]: California market, but it's not as mature
yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what's interesting is, no matter where
we're at in the legalization phase,
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at the trends across all states is
what we notice.
[SPEAKER_00]: The consumers actually end up behaving
more similarly than they do differently,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the trends are not that
drastically different state by state,
[SPEAKER_00]: no matter where they're at, no matter
where they're at in their legalization.
[SPEAKER_01]: Legally, there's a border, but really with
people, it's, you know, it's borderless.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so that's, that's what's,
you know, I think that overall,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, yes, of course, you're going to
have your regulatory variances,
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as some personality quirk
differences between states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I mean, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: The interaction to get the data,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still unique that you have such
interaction to gather data.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with our, with some of our,
with our setup at point of sales,
[SPEAKER_01]: customer will come in, they can be
greeted, and the person will have an iPad
[SPEAKER_01]: while they're, or whatever could be any
type of handheld mobile device.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's call it an iPad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they will get, as they're speaking,
put in that person's profile, what they're
[SPEAKER_01]: speaking about.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very interactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's stored there, going back to
that data of Hula.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it follows up with their
purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like your comment about X percent of
edibles and what people prefer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when you put that together,
whether it's artificial intelligence from
[SPEAKER_01]: that route, or just someone analyzing
internally at your, at that person's
[SPEAKER_01]: company, you're going to make,
get a happier customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to get a customer that comes
back, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's how you expand
your revenue for the customer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A, getting the customer to come back in
more often.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, actually, I think where there's
a lot of opportunity is how to get that
[SPEAKER_00]: customer to bring their friends in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try this.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was the effect on me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me what, what it was like on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And especially with edibles.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's a thing where people
are still, you know, getting used to
[SPEAKER_01]: edibles because it's such an inexact
science of what you're popping in your
[SPEAKER_01]: mouth, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's still a trepidation, not for
everybody, but enough of the parties.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that feedback, which is data,
this is all data related, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that feedback of this is how I felt
when I did it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the high quality stores, and we have,
many throughout the country now will have
[SPEAKER_01]: good standardizations of product quality
standards.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, a lot of it is just
consumer education, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, and, and you can't blame
the end consumer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause here's, here's the analogy I like to
give.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, let's jump back to, you know,
probate alcohol prohibition, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, no, I mean, people had been drinking
for, you know, long before then,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an alcohol prohibition wasn't in
effect that long enough for people to
[SPEAKER_00]: forget how to drink, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, um, cannabis prohibition has been in
effect for 70 plus years, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Roughly a lot of catch up time for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of catch up time, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, where you've essentially our
cannabis culture, if there even was one to
[SPEAKER_00]: begin with before the twenties or thirties
or four, you know, what did it exist?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Imagine, imagine right now, you know,
we had had 70 years of alcohol prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: and I, you had no idea how to drink,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like maybe, you know, there was obviously
the underground scene and you knew exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: how to find your speakeasies and how to
get your medical card.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went like this, how to get your medical
card.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, but, uh, but yeah, imagine that that
was the alcohol world we lived in now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, you know, we just legalized and I
put a bottle of vodka in front of you and
[SPEAKER_00]: said, go, no way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put a bottle of vodka, a bottle of wine
and a beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, do I drink this whole
bottle of vodka and a sip of that beer or
[SPEAKER_01]: you have no comparative study.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, it's just, there's been,
you know, we haven't, for my mom,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: For my, you know, cousin from all my
grandma, even all these folks that are now
[SPEAKER_00]: thinking about how to get into this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're walking into the
dispensary and they're trying to figure
[SPEAKER_00]: out what the difference between wine and
beer is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Between, you know, both in taste and
effect, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, and how, and to give it another
moving part, we still have to remember
[SPEAKER_01]: our, the industry we're in, cannabis is
also medicinal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, there's the old joke, I'll have a
scotch and it's my medicine, but that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: little figurative cliche, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But in our industry that we're proud of,
scientifically proven, it is medicinal and
[SPEAKER_01]: can be fun.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so the more data there, the better,
the more comparative word of mouth,
[SPEAKER_01]: but word of mouth isn't going to cut it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be, it's going to be that,
you know, social media mainstream,
[SPEAKER_00]: mainstream education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and that's, and right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the big challenges is the fact that
all of our operators don't have access to
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional advertising mechanisms,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so I do think that there's going and
you know, the celebrity route,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that sort of, that's what people have
been trying to take.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it'll be interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be interesting to see how that plays
out, but whoever can figure out how to
[SPEAKER_00]: mass educate consumers on A, what the
difference between wine and beer is and
[SPEAKER_00]: why you take a sip of that wine and why
you would drink that whole beer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when, you know, whoever can figure out
how to educate us on that, educate us on
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, not us, you know, but, well,
I know at least not to say for you,
[SPEAKER_00]: but, but my mom doesn't, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, she, she right now is trying
to figure out, you know, what do I take
[SPEAKER_00]: for, you know, I'm, I woke up today.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm feeling a little bit anxious,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What should I take now?
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then later on, I'm going to be feeling
a little bit sleepy and maybe later
[SPEAKER_00]: tonight, I'm going to want to feel sleepy,
but have hard, hard time sleeping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're still, we're still
figuring that out, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're, when you go into what's your
poster child customer on your,
[SPEAKER_01]: that the information your system will give
them surrounding data, how will they take
[SPEAKER_01]: that and work with that to build both,
both their brand because they're a
[SPEAKER_01]: business, but also the, the, the loving
education to their customers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are most of the, well, let's say our
poster children purchase both the,
[SPEAKER_00]: the retail tracking data as well as the
consumer survey data, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So the retail tracking data, like I said,
is the data we collect from the
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries where we will through the
point of sale and, and what they subscribe
[SPEAKER_00]: to that to obviously understand what their
market share is to understand what types
[SPEAKER_00]: of products to manufacture and how to
adjust their price points to adequately
[SPEAKER_00]: meet their target consumer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So now the second part of that,
or the next question is, well,
[SPEAKER_00]: who is their target consumer, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where our consumer survey
data comes in, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is just your traditional consumer
survey data.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that tells you, you know, I mean,
in California, for example, I think the
[SPEAKER_00]: average consumer is like 40 years old,
either male or female, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, the assumption generally is
generally that males consume more than
[SPEAKER_00]: females and yet the average consumer is
pretty much either.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just a person in their forties with
kids and children under the age of 10,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the average consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so of course, and of course,
one of the fastest growing demographics is
[SPEAKER_00]: my grandma, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't surprise me at all, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, the, the, the number of
dispensaries I hear anecdotally telling me
[SPEAKER_00]: that people come in, I mean, the number of
people that have come in for sleep over
[SPEAKER_00]: the last, since legalization, just,
just sleep, just sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there are, there, it's,
it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And arthritis and joints, you know,
there's certain conditions that you,
[SPEAKER_01]: we as humans get as, as it's that with the
data, they will be educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not, you know, a voodoo,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've been brainwashed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so, and that is in fact,
what the data has helped educate,
[SPEAKER_00]: not just the industry, but folks outside
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, regulatory bodies even,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, look, this is your average
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: This isn't a, in quotation marks,
stoner who's like sitting in his basement.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then playing video games all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, which is fine too.
[SPEAKER_00]: If that's, if that's your MO, awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but you know, it's, it's a,
so yeah, we w how they use that data,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: As they're, you know, a lot of these,
a lot of companies historically and still
[SPEAKER_00]: are targeting that same in quotation
marks, stoner, the person that's already
[SPEAKER_00]: walking into the dispensary, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the consumer data shows is,
okay, here's the percent of consumers,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's the percent of people who are
not yet consuming and are open to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's currently in California,
38% of adults over 21.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 38% of adults over 21 in California are
currently don't consume, but, but are down
[SPEAKER_00]: to consume.
[SPEAKER_01]: Really?
[SPEAKER_01]: So they approve it, but they're not,
let's just say they're getting the,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just about to take their leap in
because they, or they don't know how,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, they're like, do I drink the
wine or the beer?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, like so, so those, so the
question is, right, and if you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer right now and you're trying
to target a consumer segment, looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: that consumer segment and thinking,
all right, you have the opportunity to get
[SPEAKER_00]: creative and not just educate them on here
is what wine will do for you and here's
[SPEAKER_00]: what beer will do for you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what an edible with high CBD will
do and here's what, you know, depending on
[SPEAKER_00]: your need state and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whoever figures out how to adequately do
that and reach that new consumer,
[SPEAKER_00]: not the one that's already walking into
the dispensary, but the one that's not yet
[SPEAKER_00]: walking into the dispensary, teach them
how, A, to come in, B, to buy that wine
[SPEAKER_00]: over that beer, and C, to buy your wine
over that wine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is the winner.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there'll be multiple winners,
but you have to go in that direction,
[SPEAKER_01]: in my opinion, to be one of the winners.
[SPEAKER_01]: Consumers or consumerism, they're smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: They pick, whether it's, you know,
buying a mattress or a car or a toaster,
[SPEAKER_01]: they know from price to quality to I like
that, I don't like that, so it's really,
[SPEAKER_01]: they need an education.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will get the, for us, it's lay out
the information, they will see it if it's
[SPEAKER_01]: there, because they will educate
themselves fast.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you and I are in that ballpark as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we've all educated ourselves
really quickly and it's funny,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I think that it's, the consumers
have the luxury of taking their time on
[SPEAKER_00]: educating themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally think that one of the areas
we really need to focus as an entire
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community is the physicians.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have a lot of friends, I have a lot
of friends that are doctors right now and
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whether they work in a family
practice or in the ER and they get regular
[SPEAKER_00]: questions around cannabis and they have no
idea how to answer it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go home and Google.
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the funny part of that is,
going back to that prototypical stoner,
[SPEAKER_01]: that stoner knows more about this medicine
or rec product than the doctor with the
[SPEAKER_01]: degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that, I mean, you know, we can get
into why that's the case.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll save that for another interview,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So big pharma is not going to educate us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to educate ourselves in this
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, at least they're not going to
educate us yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as they have incentive to educate
us, you bet they will.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll join just like the liquor industry
is joining now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, I think, I think consumerism
will go a long way, especially with
[SPEAKER_01]: starting with data and them educating and
us educating ourselves.
Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been talking a lot about this new
consumer or the existing consumer that's
[SPEAKER_00]: been walking into that has previously
walked into the dispensary or trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: get this new consumer to walk into the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk a little bit about the actual
physical experience the consumer has when
[SPEAKER_00]: they walk into the dispensary and how your
software makes it easier or less
[SPEAKER_00]: intimidating or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that's a good question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether you're an educated consumer,
repeat customer, or they call you by your
[SPEAKER_01]: first name when you walk in or the first
timer, there's differences, but that color
[SPEAKER_01]: of experience is going to be one of coming
in, walking through the door and being
[SPEAKER_01]: greeted with someone.
[SPEAKER_01]: In our case, you can use an iPad or a
mobile device.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as soon as you walk into the store,
that consumer will get an experience of
[SPEAKER_01]: let us show you on a one-on-one talk what
products we're offering and what you may
[SPEAKER_01]: like and what may be fit that person
coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They will also normally see a flat screen
live menu in the area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're already getting an education.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you do any sort of, I mean,
is the menu just a static menu or do you
[SPEAKER_00]: find ways to incorporate education?
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be various underlying feedback
from other patients, nutrient tracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Testing results?
[SPEAKER_01]: Testing results will be at a stage where
you can look that up from the store level
[SPEAKER_01]: and on the e-commerce level.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like if you were buying milk and
you're online, you can see the calories in
[SPEAKER_01]: the milk and the details of the vitamins
in the milk.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Vivid pictures, nice user-friendly images,
and then it flows into what that
[SPEAKER_01]: particular store wants to promote in terms
of what are you looking for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Very interactive, very interactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you find that that increases their
speed of sale, potential of sale,
[SPEAKER_00]: quantity of sale?
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually all of the above.
[SPEAKER_01]: With the software, that experience walking
in will promote a pre-order so it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: faster transaction for the store and that
pre-order from off that iPad of standing
[SPEAKER_01]: by somewhere near the entrance or cases
will be put into the back office and that
[SPEAKER_01]: order will begin to be put together where
by the time you get up to the register,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's already ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can ask more questions and a lot of
times, besides the questions, you order
[SPEAKER_01]: more product.
[SPEAKER_01]: You already have your bag and you put in a
few more into your cart.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's a big benefit in the
experience for the consumer and the store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
