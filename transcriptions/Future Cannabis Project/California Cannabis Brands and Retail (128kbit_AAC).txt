[SPEAKER_00]: So you want to talk about brands and
cannabis in 2019?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that coming from Koreatown
Collective, which is a recreational adult
[SPEAKER_00]: use cannabis collective, the brands are
really out there way too soon ahead of the
[SPEAKER_00]: curve, spending way too much money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can take a Candescent that has a
multitude of billboards now that's
[SPEAKER_00]: competing for billboard time with med men
and how they've tried to brand themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're basically outsiders coming into a
cannabis world.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brand itself, I think, will be,
and people will understand the brand when
[SPEAKER_00]: we actually have delivery services
working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when people call on the telephone and
want something, they want a consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want Heinz 57 ketchup, you want
Heinz 57 ketchup.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want a Coke, you certainly don't
want a Pepsi to show up at your door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of where the brand can
really get their foothold in.
[SPEAKER_00]: The THC world really is turning into CVS.
[SPEAKER_00]: I stock the store, and I look at price
points.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I got to have something for every
single person because we're on Melrose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The tour buses stop right in front of our
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get on and off the buses all day
long besides selling apparel and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that for people to go home with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want a pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want different types of things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Back in the day, people wanted their
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your flower business was probably 60%
to 70% of your business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now it's vapes and edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are going crazy with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've taken away the stigmatism of having
to smoke a joint or a blunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people can smell that odor.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you vape, that odor is not as
distinct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to get into your car and
smell a vape pen like you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: smell like I was smoking a joint in my
car.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a totally different thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've taken away the stigmatism.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CBD source took away the hurdle of you
don't have to show your ID to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get to ask a lot of questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after you're prepared,
you can leave the CBD store and then go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the THC store and get whatever medicines
you want to fill and not feel intimidated
[SPEAKER_00]: because you don't know anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you give me some nuanced differences
like the interactions with brands and
[SPEAKER_01]: distributors representing brands today
versus a year ago or two years ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to tell you, these brand owners,
distributors, they're whores.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they really are.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so busy trying to do anything
they can to get into a career town
[SPEAKER_00]: collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're desperate to get there because
you're not a brand if you don't have any
[SPEAKER_00]: retail place to deliver your brand,
especially in cannabis space.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can spend all the money you want and
put all the orange billboards or red
[SPEAKER_00]: billboards you want around town unless you
get someone to come in a retail store and
[SPEAKER_00]: buy your product.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just a money pit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it seems like what I'm hearing is
everybody is going for market share and
[SPEAKER_01]: they will do anything to show sales and
market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that's a very good point that
you've just said there because you take
[SPEAKER_00]: someone like spending a lot of money.
[SPEAKER_00]: You take a brand like select.
[SPEAKER_00]: They did exactly what you just said.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were able to put a lot of sales on
their books, whether they're creditable
[SPEAKER_00]: sales or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not to judge, but they were able to
turn around and sell themselves for $900
[SPEAKER_00]: million last week.
[SPEAKER_00]: He did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, he did what he was supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kudos to Cam for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's really what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until these brands realize the stores
are their flagship places to do business,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're going to spend a lot of wheels.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can spend a lot of time getting
people to come in and brand ambassadors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some are cute.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some have a sense of personality.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some can really sell products.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some are educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And unless you can get someone to come in
there and support your product,
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you I don't have the time to
make you a brand anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like it was back in the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can remember when Kiva first walked in
my store and we did all our own edibles
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Kiva girl was just awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we took Kiva.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of our first brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we actually brought it into our store.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was like 2015, so like four years
ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they support their brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that would be the best advice I could
give a brand to do is support your brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Meaning come into our store.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come into your store, support it,
and educate the patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't educate everyone by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be knowledge that's
going to give everyone power.
[SPEAKER_01]: So which brands are doing a good job
supporting the retail efforts?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some small brands that are doing
better jobs than the bigger brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: I will tell you, because we're a very big
partner of Pax.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Pax fillers have really become,
they're like a lot of small boutique oil
[SPEAKER_00]: companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've become very close with them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as everything has evolved the past
year, those little vapor companies have
[SPEAKER_00]: paired with farms or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I spend more time working with the
smaller farms and those type of businesses
[SPEAKER_00]: bringing into retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I do the big brands such as
Candesa and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The flower is just not there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some as far as like Kineco or who makes
edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Dixie makes a great gummy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of these companies are really
having to step up their game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're probably hiring real chefs to
come into their kitchens and cook.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have to just know how to work
with the distillates to make it taste
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: But those type of brands really will do
OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me the percentage of people walking
in the door who are looking for specific
[SPEAKER_01]: brands versus people just saying,
I want an edible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you recommend what you like?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what on Melrose, with all the
tourists and the recreational people,
[SPEAKER_00]: people walk in and like whatever we
recommend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most people come in and say they want
an edible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And most of the edibles we have are brand
names, whether it's Kineco, it's Kiva,
[SPEAKER_00]: Big Peeps, Pushy Punch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have those name brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the billboards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've known the names.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of times that's very,
very easy to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the same thing with the vape.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the vape companies, they had such a
problem because when 2018 came around and
[SPEAKER_00]: all these vape companies didn't know what
to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're parting so much of their product
out into the block.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was counterfeit and whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of those brands you now know that
do the oil companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not going to pick because you don't
know if it's real or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can tell you that if I have a product in
my store, it came directly from the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I know its quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there are some really great brands
that came out, like Ocean, which is a live
[SPEAKER_00]: resin carts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone's come and stepped up their game
in the oil game.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now people just like almost like price
wars because there's such a glut of it on
[SPEAKER_00]: the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to put it into a cart or are
you going to put it into an edible?
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have your flour that took so
long to go through the whole chain by the
[SPEAKER_00]: time it gets into a jar and into a
patient's hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It probably was harvested six months ago,
which is not fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now that THC medicine is now maybe CBN
because it's degraded.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know how they're going to fix
all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, so on the one hand, you mentioned
brands spending a ton of money.
[SPEAKER_01]: That you think they're overspending.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then you also said that the tourists
coming in recognize the brands from the
[SPEAKER_00]: billboards, just really from the food,
not these flower shops.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not seeing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not understanding the branding
that's going on in front on these
[SPEAKER_00]: billboards.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're so busy trying to make a lifestyle
pose or a picture or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not doing anything to educate the
consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes the consumer needs a little
bit of education because nobody wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: walk into a store and be so intimidated.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't ask that first question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know in our store, I'll say if I'm the
one waiting on the client, what brought
[SPEAKER_00]: you here?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are you looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can I help you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because everyone has a story.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has an ailment.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone has something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they have a friend that has a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the whole thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for me, I don't need a brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't need a brand to come tell me that
and then make up some cockamamie name.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can tell you that the market shifted
when you were asking about that,
[SPEAKER_00]: where 80% of the people were connoisseurs
in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now 80% are adult use users.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% of us are out there that still know we
want a specific thing to smoke.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a certain terpene taste.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want a certain profile that we're
looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how we're ever going to get
over that hump.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, do I go out and create a
brand that caters to that 20%?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let it take off because I know that
if people know that Janice put her name on
[SPEAKER_00]: it, that it can go in a box and we can
sell it and it'll be what you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I wouldn't have done it if I
couldn't do it right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry, just to clarify, the 20% were
talking about the highly educated people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Just now 20% are highly educated and 80%
have.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the whole market's changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: 80% was a medical user.
[SPEAKER_00]: 20% was a recreational user.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the whole market's like flip-flopped.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now I cater to the adult use user.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell tons of pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: People come in, whether it's an ocean
pre-roll or a coast pre-roll, no one
[SPEAKER_00]: cares.
[SPEAKER_00]: And knowing what they're using to do their
pre-rolls, not realizing that that's a
[SPEAKER_00]: great place for them to make money,
that I would put my best foot in my
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of these other people that are new
into the business, they don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: They put their trim and their trash into
their pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the easiest way to get someone
to your brand is through a pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in any kind of retail market,
I think of like beverages and Coca-Cola
[SPEAKER_01]: and Pepsi kind of controlling.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're very powerful.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as companies become more powerful,
they throw their weight around in not the
[SPEAKER_01]: nicest of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my assumption is this industry is going
to go to a point where you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: have the chains of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what it's going to be?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're trying to get to where are
they going to start paying for shelves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Shelf space and places to be in stores and
or own their own stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yes, the reason we have not done that
yet is because I'm more concerned about
[SPEAKER_00]: how the IRS is going to treat that income
coming in because when everything going
[SPEAKER_00]: into a cannabis store gets taxed
differently with a 280 than anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: And until they can discern whether
someone's going to pay me shelf space is
[SPEAKER_00]: that rent.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it comes off my rent is that consulting
money to me because I have 12 years
[SPEAKER_00]: experience and you're doing that or it's
at a discount off a product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now I don't have to pay as much taxes
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's another one of those things that
the legislators and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they need to get straight this whole
tax situation because they're burying us
[SPEAKER_00]: alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not Al Capone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why the 280 was started from the
1980s where the cocaine dealers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why am I being treated like I'm a
criminal?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I would basically there are two
groups that could become powerful and
[SPEAKER_01]: further wait around.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is a retailer that becomes the CBS or
the Starbucks of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another one is a brand that becomes a big
dominant brand, which maybe wants to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, they want to extend payments or
like that brand can try to do whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: they see.
[SPEAKER_00]: The brand has no legs unless they have a
relationship to retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can get over it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can tell me how they're going to get
over that hump.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they figure it out, please make sure
that I know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any brand that you currently feel
like you need in your store?
[SPEAKER_00]: To be successful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, they need me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do not need them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they really have to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't hate being like that because I
really like to be the humble person.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they those brands need the retailers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by the state not issuing the license,
it's going back full circle all the way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the state's not issuing those licenses
and keeping the pre ICOs and the regular
[SPEAKER_00]: stores and even municipalities that voted
to have license dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they're not only 80 percent of the
cities, only 20 percent of the cities in
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of California are actually
licensed to have legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just shutting it off.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's there's a lot more brands than
there are retail spaces right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you had mentioned Shell Space and
paying for Shell Space between kind of all
[SPEAKER_01]: the operators you talk to our brands
currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a trend of brands now paying for
Shell Space?
[SPEAKER_01]: And where do you see that going?
[SPEAKER_00]: I see it going to be a big mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything in California when it comes to
politics and rules in Texas is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: a mess.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I see a huge trend for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a question of how someone operates a
business as to how they're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: incorporate that into the business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some companies such as a Khalifa wants to
give a retailer support, whether it's
[SPEAKER_00]: software support, consumer support,
put in their own brand ambassadors to run
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's other ways to do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, how that it's going to go full circle
back in a brand can get over it if they
[SPEAKER_00]: just own the retail space like a
condescent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why don't they just buy a retail store?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have your hub and you can go out
from wherever else you want to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at least you have your orange flag
somewhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is MedMen a nice player in the space?
[SPEAKER_00]: MedMen doesn't bother me in this space.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I like their business model?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I like the way they handle things?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not particularly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, have they sent the street teams
outside your shop to try to poach
[SPEAKER_01]: customers?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I've seen them on the streets doing
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know that I've seen their
street teams out on the streets as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they have their own internal
problems to deal with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've gotten themselves into a quandary
because they spent a lot of money
[SPEAKER_00]: advertising, whatever, and they took away
the money probably from their operating
[SPEAKER_00]: costs and doing their day-to-day stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that they've bitten off quite
a bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they have a lot of shareholders to
answer to.
[SPEAKER_00]: But MedMen's going to have to answer to a
lot of shareholders.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are some other companies that are busy
running to the north to get this money.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're investing in a lot of
renderings, renderings of business plans
[SPEAKER_00]: or renderings of structures and things of
that sort.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I hope it doesn't put a black eye on
the people that have been here for a long
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I guess we're used to fixing whatever
happens and occurs.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why they called us the pioneers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have all these companies that are
raising tons of money to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it's necessary to play the
long game.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is in the world of social media where
a long time is a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all relative, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just how I was brought up.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I still own 100% of Koreatown
Collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We own the CBD store.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll franchise out some of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other CBD stores are coming into other
cities right now as we speak.
[SPEAKER_00]: But no.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in addition to your own house brand,
because I think a lot of the talk in the
[SPEAKER_01]: CBD world is it's so crowded with all
these brands and how you know which ones
[SPEAKER_01]: are good, which ones aren't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give me some brands that stand out for
quality in your mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quality, besides Elevate CBD Skincare.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say the Paba and Barclay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They brought their stuff into CBD world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bloom Farms made an excellent tincture.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Antidote itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're coming with our own brands because
of the manufacturing, being able to have
[SPEAKER_00]: beauty manufacturers behind us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're able to bring all these different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the question of looking for how to
use CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're going to do it topically,
you want to make sure you're using a
[SPEAKER_00]: topically place where your ports can
absorb in the CBD and it's useful to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as tinctures, you want to find a
company that came into CBD world for a
[SPEAKER_00]: reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: IRE is the one that comes up to me because
it's a botanical line of tinctures that
[SPEAKER_00]: they make.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a very natural move for them to
come into CBD world because now they're
[SPEAKER_00]: pairing CBD with their natural and
essential oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're dealing with your team
internally, what's your head of compliance
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to hammer and drill into
everybody's head?
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, our biggest compliance issues are
getting our products in the door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a manifest, an invoice,
a tracking number, and it's educating our
[SPEAKER_00]: distributors to bring and have properly
documented products that are coming to the
[SPEAKER_00]: stores.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas my employees, my employees don't
have the problem because everything's
[SPEAKER_00]: given to them ready to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the shelves, it's like going to CVS.
[SPEAKER_00]: When was the last time you went to CVS?
[SPEAKER_00]: When you were standing by the aspirin
section and you didn't know the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between Aleve, Tylenol, Motrin or
whatever, but yet you went in a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: store and you've got four different
edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's two and a half milligrams,
one's five milligrams, one's 10
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams, but yet at the cannabis store,
you have someone telling you which one you
[SPEAKER_00]: should take and how you should take it and
how you should use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: At CVS, did you have that same thing at
the Tylenol section?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's going to have a greater success rate
of getting their client over the headache,
[SPEAKER_00]: CVS or me?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, me, because I educated.
[SPEAKER_01]: You spend personal time with people,
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a compliance perspective,
it's not really your internal team,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's more the company's- That's right,
literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like running a relay and you're
handing the baton, so the baton has to go
[SPEAKER_00]: from the person that was in the nursery to
the cultivator, to the manufacturer,
[SPEAKER_00]: to the retailer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So all that had to match up.
[SPEAKER_00]: My in-house staff, once they have their
IDs on, they scan their barcodes come in
[SPEAKER_00]: and out, everything's set up for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just like regularly going to CVS and
them explaining products and you selecting
[SPEAKER_00]: the products you want.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not a compliance problem on their
side, unless I'm missing the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so it seems like of all the
companies that come in to deliver
[SPEAKER_01]: products, some of them are totally on top.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have all their teams- Right,
and some of them have to go back.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just rejected.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't teach anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: I reject.
[SPEAKER_01]: What percentage of people coming in the
door to drop product off get an A plus on
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance?
[SPEAKER_00]: The people now coming to me, if you had
asked me six months ago, I would say 10
[SPEAKER_00]: percent were compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now everything coming to me, I bet you we
got to like 75 percent are compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I have a lot of people, still new
people, trying to drop new product or
[SPEAKER_00]: samples and things like that, and most of
them don't even get to a conversation
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not compliant product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know how that's in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to end up in the track and
trace system.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not my job, thank God.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are like the top three oversights
that those people may have to drop off?
[SPEAKER_00]: They try to do a mass batch, and then they
break it into flavors or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't realize that each flavor is
a distinct unit product skew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each one had to be tested to comment
that product skew.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not just Indica sativa hybrid is the
main branch, and they can all have the
[SPEAKER_00]: same skew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now if you make one flavor, one grape,
one green crack, one blue drain,
[SPEAKER_00]: each one of those subsets needs to also
have a skew.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you going to be doing delivery?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're setting it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're first launching our delivery.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to partner with someone,
and it'll be like top tier stuff so they
[SPEAKER_00]: can get larger amounts, and then we'll
roll out right behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll roll out where you can get
deliveries from K-Town Direct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where your brands, that's where
your loyalty, that's where all 12 years of
[SPEAKER_00]: everything I've done in my community will
make me different than everyone else
[SPEAKER_00]: because people will trust what I put in a
bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Also on-site consumption when they finally
approve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: For us, we would go next door.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're next door to a hookah bar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've already spoken to, you know,
it's like five places on one lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've already spoken, and because I
ended up being the mayor of my community
[SPEAKER_00]: block, I just like said, you have this in
that, you know, they don't run the hookah
[SPEAKER_00]: lounge really in the daytime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, you got this part, I got my part,
and shook hands and just wait for the
[SPEAKER_00]: licenses to come out for the City of Los
Angeles, which I don't think will be any
[SPEAKER_00]: time soon.
[SPEAKER_02]: 2020?
No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg is great, and Greg and I have a lot
of the same ideas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We both had each other's backs when people
just kind of pushed us aside.
[SPEAKER_00]: We stayed to our own stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's awesome what he's done for the
refinery, the micro license.
[SPEAKER_00]: He really helped so many brands in the
beginning, especially in 2018 when they
[SPEAKER_00]: needed to get brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: They needed a place to be for our
distribution, and he took to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like right now, all of us were
doing certain things that made us unique
[SPEAKER_00]: and pioneers for all those years,
but every one of us is kind of recreating
[SPEAKER_00]: ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Greg built his niche.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, my niche went over to CBD and
making other things because I could
[SPEAKER_00]: operate and think in that space because
that's who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we created, I found a void,
and I just drove a truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you think there's something to the idea
that for that last mile distributor,
[SPEAKER_02]: really knowing that market really well is
an advantage?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that Greg is really good at what
he does, and he's going to know his
[SPEAKER_00]: products of what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I do think it makes a difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: That last mile, I think the brands have to
remember they're using Greg for that last
[SPEAKER_00]: mile distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: They still have to kind of come back in
there and support Greg.
[SPEAKER_00]: Greg doesn't have the time to go make
their brand in other spaces.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, he can get the product there or get
it there because he has to travel with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to support Greg.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if Greg can be more successful than
Greg can be, it's going to make them even
[SPEAKER_00]: exponentially much more successful.
[SPEAKER_02]: So are you seeing this as an overall
issue, which is kind of what I'm hearing,
[SPEAKER_02]: lack of support from the distributors?
[SPEAKER_02]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: My distributor, I only take brands out
into my store if they're coming in to help
[SPEAKER_00]: support because I can't do it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have me with so many jobs and so many
hats.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to keep up with emails.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard to keep up with everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they've made a miserable space.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took something that I really used to
like have fun doing, and I would go
[SPEAKER_00]: through and I'd get products and create
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would create products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would have edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were always making the chicken and
waffles and sauces, and we are going into
[SPEAKER_00]: contests.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't even ask we were winning just
because it's what it was in our
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they've taken that away.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've cut our arms off.
[SPEAKER_00]: The politicians, the government,
legislators, law enforcement, although I
[SPEAKER_00]: have to say my law enforcement for me,
they've so supportive of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a robbery and they were like the
detectives kind of like looked in the lead
[SPEAKER_00]: detective said, no, she's our girl.
[SPEAKER_00]: She's our legitimate shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're going and it was and they were
there and they checked up on me every
[SPEAKER_00]: single part.
Thank you.
