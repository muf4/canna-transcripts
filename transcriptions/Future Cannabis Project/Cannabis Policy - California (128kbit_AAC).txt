[SPEAKER_05]: It's been a long year, and we're glad that
everyone was able to make it down.
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot's gone on over the last year,
a lot's about to happen over the next year
[SPEAKER_05]: as well in this state.
[SPEAKER_05]: The very first panel is going to feature
some of the, I would say, rock stars from
[SPEAKER_05]: the state capitol this year who formed a
coalition, and only half of these rock
[SPEAKER_05]: stars are even here.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you saw happen in the capitol was
lawmakers come together in a way you don't
[SPEAKER_05]: see happen every day, where you saw four
lawmakers testifying for one bill,
[SPEAKER_05]: one joint authored bill at the same time.
[SPEAKER_05]: You saw their staffs actively going out in
groups working with different,
[SPEAKER_05]: every stakeholder out there.
[SPEAKER_05]: They made sure everyone's voice was heard.
[SPEAKER_05]: Did everyone get what they wanted?
[SPEAKER_05]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: But everybody got a chance to actually
talk.
[SPEAKER_01]: The first problem you're going to have is
a minute is not long enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name alone, Assemblymember Reginald
Byron Jones Sawyer Sr. takes a minute.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to thank everyone here for all
the work, especially Nate Bradley,
[SPEAKER_01]: because he expended a tremendous amount of
hours and work so that we could be where
[SPEAKER_01]: we are here today, waiting for the
governor of the state of California to
[SPEAKER_01]: sign AB 266.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, how I kind of got into this,
when I was running for the assembly,
[SPEAKER_01]: I came in in 2012, and my father-in-law
had cancer, and in 2011, when he finished,
[SPEAKER_01]: he needed, you know, to use some cannabis
to be able to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw the ravages of that cancer,
what it did to him, how he couldn't eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a man that's from New Orleans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in New Orleans, they eat, and they fry
butter to eat.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, they love food.
[SPEAKER_01]: He had cancer to the throat, so he
couldn't swallow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was just horrible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And eventually found something at the
medical marijuana place that helped him
[SPEAKER_01]: with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then one day, while I was campaigning,
no one could take him around to the
[SPEAKER_01]: medical marijuana place.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they all looked at me, and I said,
look, I'm running for office.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can't go over to that little store,
that little place over there in the corner
[SPEAKER_01]: with the little sign that nobody knows
what it is, but everybody knows what it
[SPEAKER_01]: is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember taking him, going in,
and he said, do you have any cash on you?
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, this sounds like a drug operation,
like you wouldn't believe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when I went in, I didn't see a lot of
students or a lot of people who were
[SPEAKER_01]: faking it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a lot of sick people.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw a lot of people who needed it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I saw how professional each of these
places were.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just changed my outlook on it in
ways that I never would have seen before
[SPEAKER_01]: if I had not gone in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what started me is my father-in-law,
who has since passed on, when I got to the
[SPEAKER_01]: assembly, someone said that none of those
places are regulated.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, yes, it has.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I said, how long has it been?
[SPEAKER_01]: They said, like, 1995.
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, this is 2012.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's the problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I worked with Mr. Armiano and Senator
Lou Correa to try to figure out a way to
[SPEAKER_01]: get the regulations through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I saw them suffer, burn, and die and not
being able to get it done.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then I saw Measure D in LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm from Los Angeles, South LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: 59th Assembly District represents South
LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I just felt that for an industry,
a burgeoning industry this big,
[SPEAKER_01]: this large, it should have regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that we, the legislature, should take
on that responsibility, especially talking
[SPEAKER_01]: about statewide.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I decided to put a bill through.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am blessed to say that immediately after
and soon after, Mr. Bonta, Mr. Cooley,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mr. Wood, all started putting bills
through that would make legislation even
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other reason why I felt that we really
needed to do this, that we're all
[SPEAKER_01]: freshmen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're southward now and is now
freshmen.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's been a lot of infighting up and
down when you talk about the legislature.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things early on that Mr. Bonta
and myself, Mr. Woods, Mr. Cooley said,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though one person may have put their
bill across first, if we all join
[SPEAKER_01]: together, we'll get our bill across,
period.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for the first time, we wanted to show
the rest of the assembly, I'll be quite
[SPEAKER_01]: frank with you, that if you work together
on a major legislation, and you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand, this legislation we went
through is major.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm not saying it because I'm one of
the officers.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think it is the number one piece of
legislation that's gone through in its
[SPEAKER_01]: entirety.
[SPEAKER_01]: No disrespect to the bill that the State
Center printed, but in its entirety.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully when you look at us,
because one of the goals that I wanted to
[SPEAKER_01]: have accomplished when we did this is what
happens when you collaborate, how big
[SPEAKER_01]: bills can get done, how big ideas can be
done when the legislature works together.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why I got involved in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, greetings.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm actually going to say some very
similar things to Reggie.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm Assemblymember Ken Cooley.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm from the Sacramento County area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And all of the authors involved in this
issue, I think it's important to flag our
[SPEAKER_04]: comparatively new members of the
legislature.
[SPEAKER_04]: A number of members of Reggie in my class
and in freshman members.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mr. Lackey, Mr. Wood, Mr. McGuire,
all newly elected just last fall.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say a key piece of this issue
is actually you suddenly had a group of
[SPEAKER_04]: authors who have a little more time that
we can spend in the legislature and are
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at this phenomenon, which I refer
to as sort of Groundhog Day legislation,
[SPEAKER_04]: where year by year we as a state try to
tackle monumental issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not just medical marijuana, monumental
issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you work hard all year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they become a black hole of effort.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then in the closing weeks,
the wheels come off.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the next year, you've got to start all
over.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while I am a freshman, I actually
started in the state capitol as a young
[SPEAKER_04]: guy back in 1977.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eight years chief to a part of leadership.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've run policy committees in both houses.
[SPEAKER_04]: My law practice was such I always did
legislation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sort of in an odd place that I've
actually done legislative work
[SPEAKER_04]: continuously for 38 years in my career.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as a legislator, I'm in my third year.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm a founder of the city of Rancho
Cordova in Sacramento County.
[SPEAKER_04]: Was mayor there twice, served 10 years in
the city council.
[SPEAKER_04]: Although there's about 500 cities in
California, within a very short time after
[SPEAKER_04]: my election to the city council,
I started getting involved with the League
[SPEAKER_04]: of Cities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And between 06 and 09, or really 04 and
09, moved to the number two position in
[SPEAKER_04]: the League of Cities.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was about five months away from becoming
president of the league.
[SPEAKER_04]: But in 2009, the senate asked me to come
in in a policy role and run a big policy
[SPEAKER_04]: committee for them, which I did,
promptly resigning from my post with the
[SPEAKER_04]: league.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say I have a pretty strong
governmental skill set.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm pretty collaborative.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when the league approached me on this
bill, I had an interest in it because Lou
[SPEAKER_04]: Corre, I've known him very well for a lot
of years.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was very close to Lou, understood his
effort in the prior session.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was senate bill 1262.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I also have this conviction that if my
colleagues and I can be a part of a group
[SPEAKER_04]: of legislators starting to become dominant
in the state capitol or some of these big
[SPEAKER_04]: issues, we actually start and finish in a
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we start expanding that from this
beachhead to other key issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: To the end of our career, actually,
people will look at our time in the
[SPEAKER_04]: legislature and say, the state of
California and the legislature and the
[SPEAKER_04]: assembly entered a new era.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that was actually a big part of my
interest.
[SPEAKER_04]: I actually sat down with the league of
cities and said, I actually think I'll be
[SPEAKER_04]: a strong author.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you have to know that I can tell you
that there will come times in the
[SPEAKER_04]: conversation where although I'm a strong
author on your behalf, I'm going to do
[SPEAKER_04]: things that you may not agree with.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because ultimately, I think the stake here
is not this issue, but it's institutional.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we can be successful in taking some big
issues and bringing them to a close and
[SPEAKER_04]: create some institutions, institutional
momentum, we will touch the state in a
[SPEAKER_04]: variety of ways which matter when you have
12 years to serve.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel in a particular way, I kind of
helped that along.
[SPEAKER_04]: I did start out with a bill, AB 266,
in the assembly policy process when it
[SPEAKER_04]: went through the BNP committee on the day
it was heard.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know Rob's bill got eight or nine votes
that day in that committee.
[SPEAKER_04]: My vote got, my bill got 13.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same committee, same day.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as soon as we got into a probe,
we merged the bills.
[SPEAKER_04]: AB 266, which you hear a lot about,
actually for about half of the year was
[SPEAKER_04]: the Cooley bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I actually felt that good work had
been done trying to put the ideas
[SPEAKER_04]: together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I felt that we had a pretty good working
product in that committee.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm enough of a political person to
understand that actually if you're Rob
[SPEAKER_04]: Bonna from Alameda County, this subject is
more of a district issue for Rob Bonna
[SPEAKER_04]: than it is for me in Sacramento County.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I actually suggested that we should
take the merged bills.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would become the lead on his bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'd put the new content in his old bill,
which stayed with the committee.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he would, we'd put the new content in
266 and we'd make him the lead author.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that was this collaboration strategy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It could sound funny that you amend the
same stuff into two bills, one of which
[SPEAKER_04]: you leave behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the purpose of that, in
appropriations, was to send the signal
[SPEAKER_04]: that you could not put a sheet of paper
between where Ken Cooley was on this bill
[SPEAKER_04]: and where Rob Bonta was.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that became sort of our way to signal
that we are serious and earnest about
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to move something forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it did become, as Reggie
explained, a great collaboration of
[SPEAKER_04]: members, Republican, Democrat,
staff.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of staff, particularly on the
Republican side, in their long careers had
[SPEAKER_04]: never been brought into the table in a
conversation as we brought them in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm very excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it is a milestone accomplishment.
[SPEAKER_04]: Long time in coming and just an honor to
be here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to quickly say, in the
interest of collaboration, there were
[SPEAKER_01]: three bills.
[SPEAKER_01]: One was mine.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we didn't lose our minds about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put our egos to the side and at the
door.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my name's Jim Wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: I represent the second assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I represent the third assembly
district, which is the north coast of
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the northern half of Sonoma
County, Mendocino, Humboldt, Trinity,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Del Norte counties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have a little herb business in our
county.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my interest in this came from my time
in campaigning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a dentist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I practiced dentistry for 27 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have a health care background.
[SPEAKER_00]: Over those years, I encountered a lot of
people who used medical cannabis and began
[SPEAKER_00]: to appreciate the value of that,
especially my receptionist.
[SPEAKER_00]: Her husband was a patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she worked for me for 25 years,
which is pretty phenomenal in this day and
[SPEAKER_00]: age to have anybody work for anybody for
that long.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we developed a relationship around
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I began to get an understanding for
the industry and for the value of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: When I was campaigning, the things that
began to concern me were some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: environmental things that were happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are folks that are absolutely trying
to do the right thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are folks that are absolutely
raping and destroying our environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the legacy and the history of the
north coast has been about environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: conservation, about environmental
protection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We protect our coastline.
[SPEAKER_00]: We protect our redwoods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We protect our salmon-bearing streams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to see what I saw firsthand that was
going on in my district broke my heart,
[SPEAKER_00]: quite frankly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I went to Sacramento in December
and sat down with my new staff,
[SPEAKER_00]: who knew nothing about cannabis,
and I knew this much, I said, we are going
[SPEAKER_00]: to work on a bill that's going to be very
focused on the environmental challenges
[SPEAKER_00]: we're facing on the north coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we set a motion to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the process, I got the opportunity to
meet these two fine gentlemen here,
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Lackey, who's also a freshman
legislator like myself, and Mr. Bonta.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it became really apparent for us to be
successful, we needed to collaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we continue to collaborate.
[SPEAKER_00]: My challenge, quite frankly, was that
people don't think about the environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: impacts of large-scale industrial
cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I was really stubborn,
and Reggie and Ken know that really well
[SPEAKER_00]: now, is that I kept my bill very separate
for that very reason, because I really
[SPEAKER_00]: wanted to highlight that among my
colleagues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know what was interesting about
this whole process as we went through it
[SPEAKER_00]: was that we took, when you mentioned
marijuana or cannabis to people who,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the legislature, they kind of looked at
you, and of course, snickering around,
[SPEAKER_00]: they kind of look away.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have taken that to a point where we
freely talk about this in a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very open way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is a huge step forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I mean, to the point where we had a
party, an end-of-session party,
[SPEAKER_00]: in my office, and we actually,
we made mock marijuana brownies,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mock, mock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mock, mock.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we did have doubters, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially the speaker of the assembly,
when I took hers to her office,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if she ever ate it or not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know, the value of the
collaboration, you know, maybe I was just,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, new enough.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really had no legislative background.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would come from a local city council,
okay, practiced dentistry, small town,
[SPEAKER_00]: 12,000 people, that's where I live,
small town, Northern California town.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had no knowledge of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And coming from someone like Mr. Cooley,
who has tremendous knowledge of the
[SPEAKER_00]: legislature, and Mr. Jones, who comes from
an area and has a background that is very
[SPEAKER_00]: different from mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you put the five of us together as
authors on these, and we actually
[SPEAKER_00]: encompass the state of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the value of the collaboration
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what has done for us and me is
that, you know, these are my go-to guys on
[SPEAKER_00]: not just this issue, but a ton of issues.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to be able to build these
relationships and friendships with people
[SPEAKER_00]: moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will tell you, as I want,
I know there's a lot of questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I'll tell you, this is the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not the end of the process,
okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Keep that in mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nothing is ever perfect, and you need
to know that up front.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know it's not perfect, and we know why
it's not perfect, and we want to make it
[SPEAKER_00]: perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is the beginning of the process,
and it has been needed for a very,
[SPEAKER_00]: very long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm just excited to have been young and
dumb and, you know, enough to get involved
[SPEAKER_00]: in this and tackle a really difficult
issue that was inherently really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really important to my district.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, if the governor
signs these bills, I think we all have a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot to be thankful for and a lot to be
proud of.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: The next question is a two-part question.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's been a lot of talk.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, people have had concerns about
the bills.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can felons get a license?
[SPEAKER_05]: Who can?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is there, you know, what does the may
versus shall mean type of a situation?
[SPEAKER_05]: So the question is, what is the most
important elements of this legislation to
[SPEAKER_05]: you, and what parts do you think need to
be fixed?
[SPEAKER_05]: And you don't have to give all of them,
just a couple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, for me, I do a lot of work on
recidivism.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the chair of budgets of five over
prisons and incarceration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I know the war on drugs, especially
the war on marijuana, has resulted in a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of black and brown brothers ending up
in jail, really for low-level offenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: Being able to work on this to kind of
almost start the discussion of trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: decriminalize that so we can have people
come back into society and work and get
[SPEAKER_01]: back to their families is really important
to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even when the discussion about having
people formerly who had records,
[SPEAKER_01]: or may have been charged with something
out of state but never really was
[SPEAKER_01]: incarcerated, to have them work in this
field, because when we bring people back,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want them to have working jobs that
they may actually be comfortable working
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean that to be facetious,
but they may be good at it and they can
[SPEAKER_01]: work in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have to find a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know, because Mr. Cooley worked on it a
lot, a whole lot, because I know a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: law enforcement is adamant about allowing
former felons and individuals to work in
[SPEAKER_01]: this business, not to allow them at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's a happy medium we can
meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, that might be the next steps that
we work through, but it also becomes part
[SPEAKER_01]: of us desensitizing, as Mr. Woods said.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more you talk about it, before you
would say, you talk about cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: then they call us the cannabis kings and
making jokes like that, to go from that to
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys have a serious piece of
legislation and start talking about AB-66,
[SPEAKER_01]: 266, and talking about it in a serious
way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so for me right now, the number one
issue is how to integrate people who have
[SPEAKER_01]: been charged with this, may have served a
little time, how to get them involved in
[SPEAKER_01]: this business.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because quite frankly, this is a multi
billion dollar business and we need to
[SPEAKER_01]: ensure that everybody has an opportunity
to work in it, especially since we're
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about, it may have been a time
where it was illegal, like in prohibition,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you look at the prohibition laws,
and now, hopefully, in the future,
[SPEAKER_01]: if it becomes legal, that we can
reacclimate those people back into this
[SPEAKER_01]: business.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's an interesting question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I tend to feel in the broad brush
areas where it addresses both public
[SPEAKER_04]: health or public health, public safety,
local control, those are very important
[SPEAKER_04]: elements.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the use of existing state agency
expertise in food and ag and in public
[SPEAKER_04]: health, the testing standards that will be
introduced, I think all those are very
[SPEAKER_04]: important provisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: An interesting part, I think, when you
look at it from a larger conversation
[SPEAKER_04]: standpoint, I'm not particularly a
proponent of legalization, but I
[SPEAKER_04]: understand that there will be a
legalization conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And from day one, I've sort of actually
had the view that if you're interested in
[SPEAKER_04]: legalization, you would probably be
advantaged by having the legislature
[SPEAKER_04]: establish a systematic framework for the
regulation of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the League of Cities in support,
because I think what you can anticipate is
[SPEAKER_04]: as you go into January and February of
next year, there will be cities up and
[SPEAKER_04]: down California, almost 500, talking about
the breakthrough that this legislation
[SPEAKER_04]: represents.
[SPEAKER_04]: And consequently, if you are on the ballot
in November of next year on a related
[SPEAKER_04]: topic, it will appear that the jump
between the new status quo in California
[SPEAKER_04]: and that question is a smaller jump.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just think I would just kind of throw
out that while I actually am not a
[SPEAKER_04]: proponent of legalization, I'm not,
that just stated the truth, the political
[SPEAKER_04]: side of me, the tactician in me just says,
actually, this is a major stepping stone
[SPEAKER_04]: to the next conversation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for a lot of folks there, the question
that is coming will seem a smaller
[SPEAKER_04]: question.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will point out that, and I think it
is important because it is the Senate
[SPEAKER_04]: bill, there is some general language that
deals with a study to be commissioned
[SPEAKER_04]: related to motor skills.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would actually say this study will
help address the question of impaired
[SPEAKER_04]: driving.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I would just suggest that in 2010,
during the campaign on Proposition 19,
[SPEAKER_04]: a very big question in a lot of people's
minds was actually that impaired driving
[SPEAKER_04]: issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even this little study, which was
proposed by Mr. Lackey, our colleague who
[SPEAKER_04]: is not here, I think even that study will
play an outsized role in the year ahead.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I want to point that out to you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, my bill is a little different,
and it talks about, we talk about some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the environmental issues that come up with
that, with the cultivation, so with
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of some of the highlights of my
bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, funding for the new Cannabis
Bureau comes from a funding mechanism in
[SPEAKER_00]: my bill, $10 million to start this up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there will be, I believe, money that
will go, give us the opportunity directly
[SPEAKER_00]: to impact some of the cleanup efforts that
we need to do in my district.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in addition, the authority for all the
licensing entities to assess fees to cover
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing and administrative costs,
unfortunately with licensure comes cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that is, I know that's going to be
frustrating to you, but hey, I worked in a
[SPEAKER_00]: very regulated industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm licensed in 14,000 different ways,
it seems like.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's unfortunately a fee associated
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it sometimes gets redundant,
it gets frustrating, but it is sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: cost of legitimacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how you're going to move
forward here, is you want to be a part,
[SPEAKER_00]: which I know you all do, of the mainstream
business community out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a cost to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of what you're going to
experience is what I consider the pathway
[SPEAKER_00]: to legitimacy has a cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I hope that you understand that and
accept that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's our job to try to make it
reasonable and fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think as we go forward, that's
fundamentally, we're going to continue to
[SPEAKER_00]: follow all of this and work on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the beginning is, this is the
beginning, the regulatory process as it
[SPEAKER_00]: plays out over the next two or three years
is going to be absolutely critical.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to keep your eye on the ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to keep attention to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to keep us informed so we can
help to advocate.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another thing that comes from my bill is
the creation of a fines and penalties
[SPEAKER_00]: account.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that money would be used to assess on
non-compliant actors that are growing in
[SPEAKER_00]: my areas that are not following the rules,
to help pay for some environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanup, to pay for some enforcement,
for state and local law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Important to me, and what I didn't expect
immediately when I introduced this bill,
[SPEAKER_00]: was to, you know, I was all about the
environmental part of this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you cannot talk about the
environmental component unless you talk
[SPEAKER_00]: about cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: We knew that really early on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we kind of kept that as a card.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what was important to me is that,
as we went forward, that we would actually
[SPEAKER_00]: have cannabis actually regulated under the
California Department of Food and
[SPEAKER_00]: Agriculture as an agricultural product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, really critical from my
perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're not in the cultivation business
out there, and you're certainly not an
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor grower, you may or may not
understand that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the growers who are growing,
the cultivators, want to be a part of the
[SPEAKER_00]: legitimate community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with that, my intention, my hope is
that the access to not only the regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: scheme, but the programs that are
available through the Department of Food
[SPEAKER_00]: and Agriculture will be valuable to the
industry going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing for me is really important
for the requirement for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators to follow all the
environmental laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the biggest things I hear from my
world is that grape growers get really
[SPEAKER_00]: irritated with cannabis cultivators.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because grape growers or farmers,
whether you're a dairy farmer or whatever,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have a lot of rules to follow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's a feeling that cannabis
cultivators follow none of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's actually true for the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to be willing to come on board
and follow those same environmental laws.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other thing which I think is really
important is going to play into 266
[SPEAKER_00]: really, really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a package now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ought to just recognize that this is a
package.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is some sort of a unique identifier
program, which is in my bill, we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to track from seed to sale for a
variety of different reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: Number one for me is going to be public
safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for crying out loud, people out
there grow broccoli and lettuce and
[SPEAKER_00]: tomatoes and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if there's a health problem,
there's something that gets into a crop,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got ways now to target that small
part of that crop and take that off the
[SPEAKER_00]: market rather than wiping out the entire
system for a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are somewhat kind of the
highlights of what we're doing with my
[SPEAKER_00]: bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: But once again, it's collaborating with
those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm going to do this now because I
don't want to forget.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to give a shout out to folks that
work closely with me, who are with me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hezekiah Allen in the back, California
Growers Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: Formerly Emerald Growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jamie Kerr, 530 Edibles.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, CGA and Sean Donahue with CGA as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's OK, Sean.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can look this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, that's passed it back,
Nate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: We will move on to the actual questions
from the crowd now.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_11]: Really appreciate you guys getting this.
[SPEAKER_11]: My name is David Arcudo.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm an elected council member in the San
Gabriel Valley.
[SPEAKER_11]: And my first encounter with the industry
was back in 1989 when I attended Humboldt
[SPEAKER_11]: State.
[SPEAKER_11]: So as a freshman, I moved forward.
[SPEAKER_11]: I served my country, graduated from
Humboldt State, and we helped with the
initiative back in 1989.
So after almost 20 years, it's glad to see
you guys moving forward in the right
direction.
One of my questions was answered.
The first question was answered.
[SPEAKER_11]: And the thing was the trailblazers back in
the 90s, when they were moving towards
[SPEAKER_11]: this movement, we had people that got in
trouble.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I appreciate that you guys are taking a
look at that because I think that those
[SPEAKER_11]: individuals should deserve an opportunity
in this industry.
[SPEAKER_11]: But my second question was, what are we
doing in regards to the medical research
[SPEAKER_11]: part in the state, being in conflict with
the federal government?
[SPEAKER_11]: We have a lot of soldiers coming back.
[SPEAKER_11]: Some of the statistics are with PTSD,
they're dying at a rate of 22 people per
[SPEAKER_11]: day.
[SPEAKER_11]: So to me, that touches my heart.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm very passionate about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: And what is it that the state legislature
is going to do?
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sounds like a medical question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Dr. Jones, tell us about how you
feel about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I think it's absolutely critical that
there will be, I believe that the movement
[SPEAKER_00]: forward, California, for once again,
actually needs to lead the way on this
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We led the way in 1996 with 215,
and then we've kind of taken a backseat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's time for California to lead the way
again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so medical research, I believe that
there will be an emphasis on medical
[SPEAKER_00]: research and public health, and I think
it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not specific to the bills,
but it doesn't mean we can't move in that
[SPEAKER_00]: direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think part of that should come from
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: There should be a way to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that testing now is becoming more
and more sophisticated, and there is
[SPEAKER_00]: research out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we put it all together,
and how do we actually have reasonable
[SPEAKER_00]: symposiums on the medical research and
promote medical research?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's something that hasn't been brought
up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I thank you for your question.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thank you for your service on both to
our country and also to your city,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we need people like you with your
background.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it is important.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's certainly my background, something
that I want to look at, and I appreciate
[SPEAKER_00]: the question, and we will look into it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let me jump out on that, if I may,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: A bill like this is not just a structure
of law, but it's sort of a trigger to
[SPEAKER_04]: start releasing a lot of energy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time we testify in the bill,
Reggie was out there noting that the US
[SPEAKER_04]: Department of Justice has said they're
going to take a more relaxed attitude
[SPEAKER_04]: about marijuana enforcement generally when
the state has a robust law in place.
[SPEAKER_04]: That was a key element of the strategy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the bills actually include sort of
this express authorization.
[SPEAKER_04]: If someone is properly licensed under
this, they can't be prosecuted.
[SPEAKER_04]: Under the California law.
[SPEAKER_04]: And on the issue of research, there's
research here.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're setting up the Department of Public
Health to develop testing laboratories.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's a lot of very substantive work
that's going to be unfolding in the food
[SPEAKER_04]: and ag area, in public health,
kind of developing standards,
[SPEAKER_04]: measurements, and in general, a way to
think about the whole impact of the bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: This will sound sort of funny,
but I often invoke this, even in some of
[SPEAKER_04]: our conversations in the Capitol,
is every California county, every
[SPEAKER_04]: professional discipline, may not be all on
board from day one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you start to make beachheads where
there's acceptance in counties and
[SPEAKER_04]: professions within the structure of this
bill, as it starts to release some energy
[SPEAKER_04]: in research and enterprise and other sorts
of things, other folks who've been
[SPEAKER_04]: negative or sitting on the sidelines will
start seeing it through a different lens.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the analogy I use, and I just would
hearten you with this thought,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's sort of a crazy analogy, it sounds
sort of militaristic, but in World War II,
[SPEAKER_04]: we fought the campaign in the Pacific,
and the basic strategy was not every
[SPEAKER_04]: island where there's resistance is
something we need to tackle.
[SPEAKER_04]: We will be targeted, we will advance,
we will make progress, and as we make that
[SPEAKER_04]: progress, sort of moving northward through
the Pacific, places that initially might
[SPEAKER_04]: have been resistant started to fall into
line.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's a more dynamic way to think
about how this bill will affect the future
[SPEAKER_04]: of marijuana in California, but I think on
a lot of fronts, that dynamic model is
[SPEAKER_04]: probably what you're gonna see unfold,
and I actually think it'll also be in the
[SPEAKER_04]: research area.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there you go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me just quickly add, could you,
these forums, a lot of times you think
[SPEAKER_01]: you're coming and you're getting answers,
and sometimes you give us answers,
[SPEAKER_01]: or even questions we need to ask.
[SPEAKER_01]: I represent South Los Angeles
disadvantaged community where willful
[SPEAKER_01]: defiance, they're kicking black and brown
kids out of school, or they're prescribing
[SPEAKER_01]: Ritalin to take care of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We probably need to do the research,
because these kids are experiencing PTSD
[SPEAKER_01]: because they live in the communities where
they see people shot, drug deals going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some kids are ADD, and they want to
prescribe them harsh drugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe this is the answer, is this
industry, the medical marijuana industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: might be a better alternative than what
has been prescribed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna swipe in the past.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, my name is Theresa Ryan.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am the CEO of an organization called
Cannikids.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're a collective here in Southern
California, and we currently treat
[SPEAKER_06]: pediatric patients with cancer,
epilepsy, we have PTSD in Crohn's patients
[SPEAKER_06]: as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's already very expensive for us to
grow, extract, and provide this medicine
[SPEAKER_06]: to our patients, and the care that we also
give them in helping them with their
[SPEAKER_06]: mostly drug calls.
[SPEAKER_06]: My major concern are the licenses that my
company and other companies are now going
[SPEAKER_06]: to have to purchase in order to still
continue to do those growing
[SPEAKER_06]: methodologies, the extraction processes,
providing this medicine to these patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: Having parents that you deal with,
that have sick children, they're very,
[SPEAKER_06]: very strapped financially, and they can
barely afford the medicine as it is now.
[SPEAKER_06]: Can you tell me, do you guys have any idea
what the pricing structure is gonna be,
[SPEAKER_06]: and how is that going to affect the cost
of the medicine for these really sick
[SPEAKER_06]: people who truly need it?
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't know what the fees, and you have
to remember, this legislation,
[SPEAKER_00]: number one, hasn't been signed yet,
so if it is signed by the governor,
[SPEAKER_00]: it will go through a regulatory process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Totally understand where you're coming
from.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the modern medical community,
we have ways of dealing with what you're
[SPEAKER_00]: dealing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are programs that allow for sick
people to get medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not the intent of what we're doing to
be punitive in any way.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not meant to be that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: I believe there are protocols and things
that need to be followed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't tell you how many licenses and
fees I had to do to provide care for
[SPEAKER_00]: patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oftentimes, care that I gave away,
and continued to do that for the 27 years
[SPEAKER_00]: I practiced, because it was the right
thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally subsidized a lot of care out
of my own pocket, and would do it again in
[SPEAKER_00]: a heartbeat.
[SPEAKER_00]: There needs to be mechanisms, and I
believe that will happen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would challenge the industry to create a
foundation, to do something to help in
[SPEAKER_00]: situations like this with critically ill
children, and people who have chronic
[SPEAKER_00]: diseases that really need management.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear you, and I hope that you will
continue to correspond with us so that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can get that message out there,
and take care of the people who really
[SPEAKER_00]: need it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then just to jump in, of course,
Prop 215 had the issue of access,
[SPEAKER_04]: and affordable access.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every time the bill got amended,
I was in my legislative director's office,
[SPEAKER_04]: making sure we have a provision in the
bills for a task force that will be
[SPEAKER_04]: advising the Bureau of Medical Marijuana
Regulation on its implementation,
[SPEAKER_04]: and a specific charge to the task force is
look at issues of accessibility as affects
[SPEAKER_04]: patients, and their caregivers.
[SPEAKER_04]: What I would say is, I actually believe in
this issue of affordable access is vitally
[SPEAKER_04]: important.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel the work of putting together the
bill is a mammoth work, a mammoth
[SPEAKER_04]: undertaking, tremendous, but this issue
has been on my personal radar screen,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I just made sure that at every
iteration, that language stayed in.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's moved around a little bit,
exactly how it's phrased, but the
[SPEAKER_04]: accessibility, and for patients,
is an element of the ongoing work of this
[SPEAKER_04]: study thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's something you're going to want to
follow.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we're done, I can give you the site.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm Frank Moreno from NGIC, a marijuana
investment company.
[SPEAKER_09]: We invest across the sector, and have
investments in distribution,
[SPEAKER_09]: manufacturing, and dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious to know, just in summary,
what this legislation will mean for those
[SPEAKER_09]: companies, in terms of compliance,
and keeping it regulation.
[SPEAKER_05]: Frank, just to clarify, are you talking
about the restrictions on vertical
[SPEAKER_05]: integration, like you can't own certain
types of licenses, or what are you talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about?
[SPEAKER_09]: Specifically, what sort of new compliance
issues or regulations are embedded in the
[SPEAKER_09]: bills for those three categories?
[SPEAKER_09]: Distribution, manufacturing, and fused
products, and dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_09]: Vis-a-vis, in particular, vis-a-vis the
federal guidelines.
[SPEAKER_09]: In other words, the extent of these
companies are in compliance with the new
[SPEAKER_09]: legislation.
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you see that pulled again,
and building, and strengthening the
[SPEAKER_09]: industry here in California?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, some quick observation.
[SPEAKER_04]: On the manufacturer side, some processes
use volatile solvents, some don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a different license, depending
upon what style you have.
[SPEAKER_04]: There is a licensing requirement on
manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_04]: On distributors and dispensing,
there are rules.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are rules concerning safety and
security of the business premises,
[SPEAKER_04]: with respect to dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Transportation rules between dispensaries
end up getting regulated.
[SPEAKER_04]: The safe harbor, under California law,
against prosecution, hinges upon being
[SPEAKER_04]: licensed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if you're in that space, you're gonna
wanna get licensed, because that protects
[SPEAKER_04]: you from the law enforcement side.
[SPEAKER_04]: There are like 17 different licenses,
and they deal with specialty cultivation,
[SPEAKER_04]: small cultivation, moderate cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's quite a structure, but it's not
like you throw a switch on January 1st and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's in place.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's gonna take time to roll out.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I would just say, any one of us can
get you a style of bill printout,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is as it amends current law.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you can actually look at the bills as
they went through and see, set out on
[SPEAKER_04]: italics, what's new.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you carve out two hours of your time,
you kind of go through it, you'll have a
[SPEAKER_04]: heck of a bird's eye view.
[SPEAKER_01]: So my staff wrote something else,
so to make it appear that I'm smart.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the bill language was designed to
create, the bill language was designed to
[SPEAKER_01]: create a regulatory framework that fit in
with existing models in other industries
[SPEAKER_01]: and did as little to disrupt businesses
that have been operating for decades in a
[SPEAKER_01]: manner that is consistent with sound
policy.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some local jurisdictions,
such as the city of San Jose, that require
[SPEAKER_01]: vertical integration, which means that
each business must do cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing, dispensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: At the same time, there's a concern from
some stakeholders that allowing
[SPEAKER_01]: unrestricted vertical integration will be
problematic for enforcement and public
[SPEAKER_01]: safety.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thus, our bill does allow some
grandfathering under specific conditions
[SPEAKER_01]: including cultivating, manufacturing,
and dispensing prior to July 1,
[SPEAKER_01]: 2015.
[SPEAKER_01]: In addition, there is limited vertical
integration allowed under the confines of
[SPEAKER_01]: the bill.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call it the 3-1-4 model, which allows
an individual who has no more than three
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries to also hold one
manufacturing license and up to four acres
[SPEAKER_01]: of cultivations.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than these exceptions, the bill only
allows for individuals who carry up to two
[SPEAKER_01]: license types depending on the licensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, applicants for testing licenses may
only hold a license in that category.
[SPEAKER_01]: Distributors may also only hold licenses
in only transport and distribution,
[SPEAKER_01]: not cultivation, manufacturing,
testing, or dispensing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is to prevent diversion as well.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just to add one quick thought on there.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was actually some changes.
[SPEAKER_05]: The first grandfathering clause he was
speaking about, where he referenced the
[SPEAKER_05]: city of San Jose, the word was basically
you can stay vertically integrated if the
[SPEAKER_05]: ordinance required you.
[SPEAKER_05]: They actually were able to change that,
and they added the word required or
[SPEAKER_05]: allowed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it actually expanded it out to
basically any town where you've been given
[SPEAKER_05]: a license, if they allow you to be
vertically integrated and you're doing it
[SPEAKER_05]: now, you can maintain what you're doing
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just add that government in
general is not terribly innovative.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to see as the regulatory
process moves forward, especially around
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution, transportation, and the
licensing, it's going to rely on things
[SPEAKER_00]: that are working well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have a governor who doesn't really
like the idea of creating new divisions
[SPEAKER_00]: and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the emphasis on this process has been
around using existing programs that work
[SPEAKER_00]: well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So distribution, the three tier system was
discussed in great detail.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know that puts people who have
vertical distribution in conflict with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you're going to see as we move forward
a reliance on systems that work well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And remember, too, the regulatory process
is going to take a couple of years,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it's not going to happen overnight,
which once again gives you that
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to have input.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why the language for these
bills was much more specific until we got
[SPEAKER_00]: close to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when the administration got involved
with us, working with us online,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of the specificity was in language,
went away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I get it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We kind of get wed to the language.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the issues we worked on and all the
countless stakeholder meetings we had with
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody across the board, it was like a
parade in our offices, quite frankly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the governor's office, his
administration, kind of backed up and
[SPEAKER_00]: said, OK, we want something more basic
around regulatory because we want this to
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be able to create a system
that's actually going to be able to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my hope is that it will.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why your input in the
regulatory process can be so valuable.
[SPEAKER_10]: James Shaw, I am a dispensary operator in
Los Angeles property, and I also founded
[SPEAKER_10]: the Union for Methameral on Patients and
Agcite, Incorporated.
[SPEAKER_10]: And it sounds as though the intent,
and thank you, by the way, for your great
[SPEAKER_10]: effort.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is a great piece of work.
[SPEAKER_10]: And my question is, and it seems as
though, the intention is to license all
[SPEAKER_10]: property organizations.
[SPEAKER_10]: If that's accurate.
[SPEAKER_10]: How do we rectify the conflict with the
rules of property in terms of permitting
[SPEAKER_10]: and transporting?
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it's not, then how do we interface
with the state law?
[SPEAKER_01]: Being from Los Angeles and making my first
call to the first bill, some of the first
[SPEAKER_01]: were to eliminate LA altogether.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the first calls were to the city
attorney, Michael Fuhrer, to let him know
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he worked directly with the governor's
office to try to come up with some
[SPEAKER_01]: solutions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think they're still working through
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the city attorney has specific
ideas of what he can and can't do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe he believes, for example,
he may not be able to license in the city
[SPEAKER_01]: of LA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have to work through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with Measure D, with 134 there now,
we want to make sure that we ensure,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I think on both ends, both the city
attorney's office and the state,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want to make sure that after a certain
time, 2016, 17, it doesn't become a major
[SPEAKER_01]: problem where they're not in existence
anymore.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm Dr. David Durbin.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the executive vice president of the
American Academy of Cannabinoid Medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have some concerns, but I was delighted
to hear that this is the beginning and not
[SPEAKER_03]: the end.
[SPEAKER_03]: I guess my concern is why this isn't being
treated like any other medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't you just adopt the pharmacy
regulations?
[SPEAKER_03]: Why didn't you reschedule the schedule of
two?
[SPEAKER_03]: And why didn't you put in $9 million like
John Baskin South State in 1999 to do
[SPEAKER_03]: research on cancer?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, this is real medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I look forward to working with a
gentleman in the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I think you've done a good start,
but it's only a start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think, wow, it took us 19 years to get
to where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to take a little while
longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I appreciate the interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I personally have a concern as a
current and past medical provider.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is not, like you said,
this is the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said the beginning, this is the
beginning, not the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need people like you to help us to move
forward on this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not an oversight.
[SPEAKER_00]: The issue is so large, so large,
we couldn't capture everything all at
[SPEAKER_00]: once.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be cleanup legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: There will be opportunities to make things
better going forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I introduced a bill at 11 o'clock on
September 11th, because we're looking at
[SPEAKER_00]: banking regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working with Board of Equalization
member Fiona Ma on trying to move forward
[SPEAKER_00]: some banking regulations so that this is
not a cash industry any longer,
[SPEAKER_00]: which will be hugely valuable for
everybody moving forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: So these kinds of things, we couldn't
think of everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: We couldn't get everything in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But who knows?
[SPEAKER_00]: Next year, there may be 10 or 15 bills
moving forward on this subject.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, a few minutes ago, Jim mentioned
the word, the movement towards legitimacy,
[SPEAKER_04]: which I think this constitutes a great
vaulting forward on legitimacy.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the most remarkable things on the
subject was when our bills reached the
[SPEAKER_04]: floor of the assembly in June,
we got a 62 to eight vote in support of AB
[SPEAKER_04]: 266 off the assembly floor.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that means we had 14 or 17 Republicans
joining in support.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think the progress on legitimacy,
you chip away on that, and other things
[SPEAKER_04]: will come.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sort of that island-hopping argument.
[SPEAKER_04]: You advance the edge, others will come
along.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think you'll see more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I want to just say one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a firm believer in incremental
progress.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we could have gone to this huge,
huge, I mean, this is a big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a big package.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we could have tried to encompass
everything, and we could have lost it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We could have lost it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the reality is we now, I believe,
have a strong foothold to be able to move
[SPEAKER_00]: forward on something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will build upon that for the next
several years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I would much rather have something
that we could start with than lose it all
[SPEAKER_00]: and have to go back to ground zero,
like had happened time and time again in
[SPEAKER_00]: this legislature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So while it's not perfect, we're not done.
Hello.
[SPEAKER_08]: My name is Stephen McCann.
[SPEAKER_08]: I work with Medicare.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I'm also a former professor of
political science.
[SPEAKER_08]: And the one law that we all have to follow
is the law of unintended consequences.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so in reading this legislation,
there's several things that I see that are
[SPEAKER_08]: worrisome in terms of unintended
consequences.
[SPEAKER_08]: The first one is the distribution model,
that is requiring all of the supply to go
through a distributor.
And somehow the supply chain for patients
is going to be disrupted because of all
[SPEAKER_08]: the unilinear, unidirectional distribution
that's going on now.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's number one concern.
[SPEAKER_08]: Number two is that there's going to be
hundreds of millions of dollars,
[SPEAKER_08]: people's blood and treasure, going to be
poured into this regulatory process.
[SPEAKER_08]: And if it's delayed, or if it doesn't
work, the citizens who have decided to get
into this are the ones who are going to
suffer by having to sustain their
businesses while they don't have the
position to do that.
And then the third thing is the taxation
issue.
It's a medicine, yet we tax it at 8%.
And the only way we're going to be able to
keep the medical cannabis regime in place
[SPEAKER_08]: is if there's a lower taxation rate for
medical or no taxation rate for medical,
[SPEAKER_08]: while the legalization has a higher
taxation rate.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that will sustain us in the medical
model.
[SPEAKER_08]: So my question to you is, what are you
going to do as far as oversight to make
sure that the regulatory system doesn't
damage us in the industry?
[SPEAKER_08]: And can you commit to us that if there's a
problem, please defer to the current
[SPEAKER_08]: status quo rather than to the regulatory
need to wrench it and make it right?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, this was a key part of the 266
strategy from day one.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one agency, the Medical Marijuana
Regulatory Board in DCA, which is actually
[SPEAKER_04]: in charge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Early in the conversation, people were
having agencies, Food and Ag is going to
[SPEAKER_04]: do this, but it's an equal with public
health.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's going to do this, an equal with the
third agency is going to do this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We opted for the idea that there's one
agency in charge that the legislature can
[SPEAKER_04]: pursue oversight with directly.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other piece of this was using Food and
Ag and public health.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't want to have somebody in a brand
new agency purporting to come up with the
[SPEAKER_04]: rules for ag, because we felt that would
lead to who knows where the rules came
[SPEAKER_04]: from and not necessarily well found in
relation to how other ag interests get
[SPEAKER_04]: dealt with.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say the oversight issue is a
vital one, but we've got one lead agency
[SPEAKER_04]: that the legislature can bring before us
to talk about implementation issues.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the other ones, we're bringing them in
because of their expertise, and we would
[SPEAKER_04]: expect to see consistency with how they
deal with similar issues in a
[SPEAKER_04]: non-marijuana setting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would just add that there hasn't been a
single piece of legislation ever passed in
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of California that didn't have
unintended consequences.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know it, and we know it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, I'm committed to make sure that
it's right, that it's right in the end and
[SPEAKER_00]: that the interests and concerns of
patients are protected.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's going to be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not going to be exactly the same as
it always has been.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you need to understand that move
towards acceptance and broad acceptance by
[SPEAKER_00]: the entire state of California,
there is a cost to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll just quickly say they call it cleanup
language for a reason.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name is Merrick Elson, and I'm an
attorney at Kansas Patient.
[SPEAKER_07]: My question is about the amendment to
11368.775.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's the section that concerns the
collective.
[SPEAKER_07]: The one that is going to be rescinded one
year after licenses begin to be issued.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would assume that that came about
because this collective or cooperative
[SPEAKER_07]: cultivation defense has been used by big
dispensaries and that they were trying to
[SPEAKER_07]: limit that, something that's been somewhat
seen as an abuse.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was wondering if that was,
A, if that was the effect of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I was also wondering if
[SPEAKER_07]: the consequence of the law is that there's
going to be that vertical integration
[SPEAKER_07]: requirement for everyone except for anyone
that had a license prior to 2016.
[SPEAKER_07]: And if in that case, if your, perhaps some
ordinances, some of the ordinances even
[SPEAKER_07]: formalized vertical integration and
collective cooperative distribution into
[SPEAKER_07]: their ordinances.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in some cases, the bigger dispensaries
will actually have, they will still be
[SPEAKER_07]: operating, as I see it, they don't
necessarily need to get licenses if they
[SPEAKER_07]: were operating cultivation licenses
separate from, if they have to get
[SPEAKER_07]: licenses on every step of the chain,
or if they're not required to do that
[SPEAKER_07]: because they didn't have to do that before
2016.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll take the first part of that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That language popped up in Amiano's bill
first last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not something we were excited about.
[SPEAKER_05]: The thought process behind it was,
though, 2003 when they originally wrote
[SPEAKER_05]: points, that entire section, that was sort
of a compromise between law enforcement
[SPEAKER_05]: and the advocates because they didn't want
to actually create regulations that would
[SPEAKER_05]: sort of legitimize dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically what law enforcement said was
fine, they can exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: But we're not going to define how they
have to operate or work or things like
[SPEAKER_05]: this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just saying these collectives can exist.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was their kind of, that was their
offer.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's what got the bill through 2003.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is, is that is what's kind of
created the gray area, which allowed
[SPEAKER_05]: Harborside and some other with three
plants in our backyard and their
[SPEAKER_05]: neighbors, they all operate under that one
section.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they needed to be able to fix that.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so they did what they wanted to do
back in 2003, is they're going to actually
[SPEAKER_05]: create rules now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the thought process was we're going to
create this stack of rules and regulations
[SPEAKER_05]: and take out the gray area and put in the
actual rules.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that was the thought process.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't to allow one group to be
vertically integrated or not.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was they were going to remove the gray
area with black and white rules,
[SPEAKER_05]: unless you guys want to speak to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's exactly it.
[SPEAKER_05]: There was case law before that,
which clarified that people could
[SPEAKER_05]: collectively grow as a group.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not the Minch case.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a different case before that.
[SPEAKER_05]: But so people from 215, they can grow in
groups.
[SPEAKER_05]: What 775 did was put it in law and
clarify.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you still have the protections you have
under 215.
[SPEAKER_05]: That doesn't get changed.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what they are changing is sort of the
gray area where it just says you can't
[SPEAKER_05]: operate without any sort of rules or
regulations attached to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That was the thought process.
[SPEAKER_05]: It wasn't necessarily us, but that was
just the conversations we've had with law
[SPEAKER_05]: enforcement people who are working on that
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And first of all, I want to thank you for
your questions.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't mean to be flippant.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I often say things I really regret later,
but this is who I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that one, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the same boat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think, partly to Nate's point,
which may not come up, there is a feeling
[SPEAKER_00]: among law enforcement that parts of the
collective model have been grossly abused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's where part of this
conversation came from.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what my folks that I talk to in law
enforcement feel like has happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you're trying to craft something
like this, you're trying to work with lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of different stakeholders to come to
solutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there was a feeling in some areas
that it was grossly abused.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I do think that Accessibility Working
Group will be looking at that issue of are
[SPEAKER_04]: there people who arguably under Prop 215
clearly should have ready access and are
[SPEAKER_04]: finding barriers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I sort of think that is at the end of
the day sort of behind your question.
[SPEAKER_04]: And as I say, we made clear that never
dropped out of the bill.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is an element.
[SPEAKER_04]: We didn't solve every problem,
but we kept a spotlight on certain ones we
[SPEAKER_04]: want to keep paying attention to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And finally, nothing that we did anywhere
along the way is meant to be perceived as
[SPEAKER_00]: punitive towards patients.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that way at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite the opposite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Quite the opposite.
[SPEAKER_05]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've been told we were supposed to stop.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: A third question.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Swami Chaitanya.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm from Lakeville.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_12]: And so far I know that I'm speaking to the
grower.
[SPEAKER_12]: So I'm a member of the Mendocino County
Policy Council.
[SPEAKER_12]: I mean, we're trying to get regulations
from the grower's point of view
[SPEAKER_12]: to the Monroe Woods District, but very
many
[SPEAKER_12]: into Mendocino County every year.
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's just Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_12]: So my question really is you're phasing
out cooperative and collective
[SPEAKER_12]: definitions.
[SPEAKER_12]: But within the agriculture, there is such
a thing as an agricultural co-op.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I think the only defense for growers
is, in fact, going to be co-op.
[SPEAKER_12]: Will that be possible in this new
legislation?
[SPEAKER_12]: Because it's definitely under the
agricultural rules that we're supposedly
[SPEAKER_12]: as cultivators going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is my intention.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_12]: Then the other thing is, are we going to
be able to make a profit?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's nothing that stops you now.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would ask you, and everybody else who's
cultivating, will you do it with respect
[SPEAKER_00]: for environmental laws?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you use water that belongs to you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you be careful with fertilizers and
pesticides?
[SPEAKER_00]: Will you respect the environment?
[SPEAKER_12]: And that's my ask.
[SPEAKER_12]: I am registered as Clean Green with Chris
Van Hook.
[SPEAKER_12]: Good.
[SPEAKER_12]: And I have spring water.
[SPEAKER_12]: I am trying at the most of my ability to
comply.
[SPEAKER_12]: And the fact of the matter is,
it's a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_12]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_12]: We in Mendocino and Humboldt and I'm
trying.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a lifestyle.
[SPEAKER_12]: We have a culture.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's been developing over 60 years.
[SPEAKER_12]: And you all benefit from it.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we just want to make sure that we are
recognized.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've supported Mendocino County for the
last 30 years when the lung registry went
[SPEAKER_12]: bankrupt.
[SPEAKER_12]: So please give us respect and let us grow.
[SPEAKER_12]: And we will comply if you don't make it
too long.
[SPEAKER_05]: And on that note, we will end it here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
