[SPEAKER_03]: So Sabrina brought up an excellent point,
the July 1st transition.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Bureau took a lot of heat when we
did not extend the transition period.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was a tremendous amount of pressure
on us to extend it.
[SPEAKER_03]: We did not change our regulations and we
did not extend it.
[SPEAKER_03]: One question, two questions for the panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: How did you feel about that decision and
how did it affect your business
[SPEAKER_03]: operations?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, my personal feelings about the
decision were that I had been approached
[SPEAKER_05]: by some retail operators and other
operators in the industry to put my name
[SPEAKER_05]: with those who were asking for an
extension.
[SPEAKER_05]: And for ourselves as a laboratory,
an extension wasn't really going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: material one way or another in terms of
readiness or execution because we were
[SPEAKER_05]: already doing what we needed to do for
July 1st.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what I was seeing was that having to
do with the inventory that was being held
[SPEAKER_05]: and valuation of inventory that was either
owned by yourself or by another party that
[SPEAKER_05]: you were in contract with, that the
particulars around the ownerships of those
[SPEAKER_05]: inventories and the date of its
production, in some cases, because the
[SPEAKER_05]: deadlines either weren't understood or
anticipated with respect to when things
[SPEAKER_05]: were manufactured or harvested and when
they could continue to be sold,
[SPEAKER_05]: that I became aware of certain people who
I personally cared about a lot that were
[SPEAKER_05]: going to take enormous losses that could
potentially put them out of business as
[SPEAKER_05]: small business owners.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so as a small business owner and
entrepreneur, I have a lot of compassion
[SPEAKER_05]: for those people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I was dismayed that they were having
such a negative impact because I've known
[SPEAKER_05]: them since my company was founded eight
and a half years ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: And to be in business for eight and a half
years or ten years and suffer that kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: blow and one that you really can't affect
and maybe it's their own responsibility
[SPEAKER_05]: and their own fault because they weren't
prepared or they weren't engaged and that
[SPEAKER_05]: may have been why it happened.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it was unfortunate just as from a
humanistic perspective, it was unfortunate
[SPEAKER_05]: to watch that happen for people.
[SPEAKER_01]: Personally, I would have liked to see an
extension for all the reasons that you
[SPEAKER_01]: said.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do wonder though if we had extended,
I'm sure this is part of what informed the
[SPEAKER_01]: decision not to, would it have been any
different another six months hence,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So personally, I would have liked to see
an extension because I think that there
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to be a smoother transition from the
unregulated to the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_01]: From a business perspective though,
anticipated that it would be held hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to that July date, so we amped up
for it and there was a lot of market share
[SPEAKER_01]: to be got during that period as a result.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then lastly, just kind of embarrassed
by the Instagram and social media posts of
[SPEAKER_01]: just all these empty shelves throughout
our state.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the biggest concerns I have is the
lack of dispensaries in our market being a
[SPEAKER_01]: whole supply chain company.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I hope to see those shelves filled
again and that's robust market.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a little scary how much of a reset
it was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I agree.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it would have been delaying the
inevitable if you had just moved it and
[SPEAKER_04]: the reactions would have been the same but
I made sure that the buyers at BPG were in
[SPEAKER_04]: communication with their vendors to make
sure that they were as prepared as they
[SPEAKER_04]: can be and how that communication gets
through and whether it's received on that
[SPEAKER_04]: end, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that it definitely helped to
provide a sort of a process for them
[SPEAKER_04]: because a lot of them didn't really know
what to do or what was even going on or
[SPEAKER_04]: that there was even a July 1st deadline.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just to ensure that we did have enough
products and didn't lose out on any of
[SPEAKER_04]: that and all of the testing and Berkeley's
testing standards have always been
[SPEAKER_04]: extremely high and the highest in the
state.
[SPEAKER_04]: So most of the vendors that we worked with
were pretty used to meeting those rules
[SPEAKER_04]: anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the testing wasn't as much of an issue
as the packaging and labeling,
[SPEAKER_04]: which also kicked off a lot of discussions
and arguments.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that, yeah, I mean it better
to happen now and to have everybody adjust
[SPEAKER_04]: right now if this is all, it's inevitable.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we've been fighting for this for a
really long time and here we are.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is what it looks like.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just look at it as growing pains.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really hard to see, like you
said, some of these smaller business
[SPEAKER_04]: owners that just don't have the resources
or the bandwidth to really keep up with
[SPEAKER_04]: all of these things and find themselves in
a situation where they're not completely
[SPEAKER_04]: able to comply to the extent that they can
get their stuff online right away.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of this is a very flexible
creative industry that has managed to
[SPEAKER_04]: survive through many challenges in the
past.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that that spirit will continue
on and people can be innovative and find a
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think it was good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say that despite preparation
beginning in June for the July 1st
[SPEAKER_00]: deadline, changes, the end of that grace
period, you know, Flocona suffered
[SPEAKER_00]: significantly in early July as we didn't
agree with our retail clients on what were
[SPEAKER_00]: the packaging requirements.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was really challenging to not see
eye to eye, have us all trying to comply
[SPEAKER_00]: but disagree about what the rules said.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was very challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, despite the pain
that we felt and what I assume many,
[SPEAKER_00]: many companies felt, I would say that I
still salute the BCC for not flexing on
[SPEAKER_00]: that because this is the beginning of the
relationship of there's an open period
[SPEAKER_00]: where we all get to talk about what the
rules should be and then we will enforce
[SPEAKER_00]: the rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I salute you for enforcing the
rules when it was time to enforce the
[SPEAKER_00]: rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we learned that this is sort of a weak
link situation, the weakest link situation
[SPEAKER_00]: in the industry where those who,
and we're gonna confront it again in the
[SPEAKER_00]: near future, probably when these regs go
final, we will have those who didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: prepare enough and businesses will choose,
oh, you're not prepared.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not gonna do business with you right
now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that may be a make or break moment for
those who didn't prepare.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet that is the way this industry and
any industry works.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's competition and we can seek
to out compete each other on compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think a lot of farmers were kind of
caught off guard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, granted, the transition period was
published, but we're transitioning away
[SPEAKER_02]: from kind of a bulk flower market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So traditionally, cultivators have
provided bulk flower into the retail
[SPEAKER_02]: sector.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how it's gone into vending
departments.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of cultivators weren't prepared
for packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have a brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have containers.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're used to bringing whole pound units
and then having the dispensary package.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when you're in a position to try to
or have to start figuring out packaging,
[SPEAKER_02]: first of all, the time frame on that is,
you know, six months to a year to just try
[SPEAKER_02]: to figure out how to source and how to put
together compliant packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as Humboldt's Finest, we started our
rebrand for compliant packaging in
[SPEAKER_02]: January.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we came up against was that as
early as April, the distributors we were
[SPEAKER_02]: working with were like, oh, no,
no, we're not taking any more product
[SPEAKER_02]: unless it's prepped for July.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're like, oh, my gosh, this is kind
of crushing because here we have packaged
[SPEAKER_02]: product that, you know, should have been
able to be on the shelves until July.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then our distributors were kicking it
back because they didn't want to have
[SPEAKER_02]: anything in their stock, right,
come July 1st.
[SPEAKER_02]: That wasn't compliant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'd already been doing the testing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And for us, it was dealing with the child
resistant packaging component,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially when we looked at pre rolls.
[SPEAKER_02]: We do a lot of pre roll cigarette or
cannabis cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So trying to figure out how to,
especially in single serving sizes,
[SPEAKER_02]: manage that CRP component was really
challenging and it was expensive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think if people didn't plan,
you know, six, nine months in advance,
[SPEAKER_02]: they really got caught off guard with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's basically have a point person
that you could put on that and the
[SPEAKER_02]: resources to do it, to be prepared is what
we found.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, one point to add on,
I think that was actually really important
[SPEAKER_05]: about the July transition that's very
focused on the lab sector was the increase
[SPEAKER_05]: in testing requirements and the increase
in the compound lists because the phase
[SPEAKER_05]: one pesticide list really didn't encompass
what's normally used on cannabis and the
[SPEAKER_05]: things that we're usually most concerned
about finding.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so I think that delaying the
implementation of the phase two pesticide
[SPEAKER_05]: list especially would have definitely been
an error.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really, it's really helpful from
your perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
