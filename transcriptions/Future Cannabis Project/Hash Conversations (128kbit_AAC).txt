[SPEAKER_03]: Right now it's at four or sixty seven.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, sick bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cool He has to come stock that 420 which
is kind of low temp and works pretty well
[SPEAKER_03]: I take fatter dabs.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think and I just raise it higher.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sometimes I have to raise it a little
higher, but Right, you know play with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Um, those preferences on it totally
exactly all about the text smoking tech
[SPEAKER_03]: You asked me what I did before cannabis
and I did a few things man, like but right
[SPEAKER_03]: before cannabis I was in the HVAC world,
you know, okay doing it I was an air
[SPEAKER_03]: technician, you know doing doing that and
I chose that profession because I knew
[SPEAKER_03]: some poorly directly with the camps
industry, you know But yeah before that I
[SPEAKER_03]: worked a few jobs Mainly it was like I
worked at in-and-out for like seven years
[SPEAKER_03]: and got a really good idea of a training
team-building quality control production
[SPEAKER_03]: and then a customer service and then I
moved on went to school and got into HVAC,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I'm wearing the trade and then
went into sales with HVAC and then on my
[SPEAKER_03]: way out into the camps industry I got a
warehouse job and then I just like peace
[SPEAKER_03]: out You know did my own thing and all
during that time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was always Doing what I could you know
on the side, you know after the
[SPEAKER_03]: nine-to-five, you know, trying to be
trying to get my experience You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I said I was growing for like a year and a
half and then I was making hash,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know while I was working and then I
finally stowaway, you know and About a
[SPEAKER_03]: year and a half later, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm here and I feel like I feel like it's
been ten years.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's crazy, but it's only been like a year
and a half, but I feel like it's been such
[SPEAKER_03]: a long like a long short journey,
you know Fuck yeah, that's awesome Fuck
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, so what made you love solving this?
[SPEAKER_03]: Back in the day man back when like Phil
probably first like invented it I didn't
[SPEAKER_03]: like I wasn't deep in this scene by always
a part of cannabis I remember my friends
[SPEAKER_03]: standing on hair straighteners and doing
the dabbing, you know, I remember giving
[SPEAKER_03]: him like An eighth of like my my best that
I had like either it was Bubba Kush or it
[SPEAKER_03]: was a God's gift or it was Something
purple, you know GDP, but he pressed it
[SPEAKER_03]: and I got like a little squirt out of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got one dab Maybe like two dabs and I'm
like man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I want to smoke weed, you know,
but What got me to solve on this was
[SPEAKER_03]: basically my time, you know, I tried to
grow it My biggest dream was to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: grower, you know But at the time with me
starting to pursue the growing side
[SPEAKER_03]: Seriously, I had my son was being born,
but you know, I had a daughter already I
[SPEAKER_03]: just recently married I had a lot going on
and you can't really allocate all the time
[SPEAKER_03]: to the play, you know, we have You know as
a beginner, I guess but I tried I went
[SPEAKER_03]: through it all and I went through all the
you know, all the different like mediums,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, like Rockwell cocoa for and it
all led to Living soil, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but my mind was always about like what's
the easiest This most sustainable,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and like I just want to add a
water to these bitches, you know and grow
[SPEAKER_03]: the best I can so I found that Jeremy at
build a soil followed him a lot and kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of took his approach and And I started
doing with the soil and then we had to
[SPEAKER_03]: move and I just couldn't grow anymore And
I just started I always chased like the
[SPEAKER_03]: best quality, you know smoke like all of
us mostly do you know and so I used to do
[SPEAKER_03]: a lot of dabs and shit and the pants came
out and I'm like, oh fuck the pens and
[SPEAKER_03]: then that's just kind of how I found
solving this, you know, yeah Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: yeah, and I saw how to make it and I'm
like I can do this and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw that it was new I'm like,
all right, fuck this.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not gonna be five years from now,
you know sitting at this job I hate pissed
[SPEAKER_03]: off looking at a guy and saying oh I could
have done that, you know, so I'm like no
[SPEAKER_03]: way dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep You know, you know, you guys all know
the same story like everyone I'm one in a
[SPEAKER_03]: million, you know I'm saying I'm happy to
be here though.
[SPEAKER_03]: I appreciate it, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally So I just like making hash for my
my grower guy, you know working at that
[SPEAKER_03]: warehouse at the H5 warehouse,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You came in No one was giving him
attention and just because of my
[SPEAKER_03]: background like an in-and-out,
you know customer service I helped this
[SPEAKER_03]: guy all the way out the door, you know
small talk.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_03]: He's like Oh, I grow weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like sweet and we were just we were
friends instantly.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave me some bud and then I started
washing his trim.
[SPEAKER_03]: He gave me his trim and then for without
him man, I wouldn't have had that material
[SPEAKER_03]: to really start and do all my work and
trials man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like I went from washing like ounces of
trim and then I wash ounces of bud because
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to wash everything and then I got
my press and like sort of pressing
[SPEAKER_03]: everything and just literally grew from
there man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, that's fucking awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and everything so far and it's been
like the beer fridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have that You know the beer fridge.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah This thing came to me to man and
refrigeration technician like shops at our
[SPEAKER_03]: store, you know, he he just asked me if I
want a beer fridge and I said sure let's
[SPEAKER_03]: check it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: He had a whole bunch of these I picked out
the best one and I was you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: making hash at the time and I had my home
fridge full of pizza boxes My wife was
[SPEAKER_03]: pissed this guy came in at the right time
and I got the fridge and wow should just
[SPEAKER_03]: think he'd be happening like that just
Effortlessly almost dude, like non
[SPEAKER_03]: forcefully like even my first job in the
industry, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hate to take up the time, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You're just me.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, please No, this is exactly what's
about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: No rush.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah the the my first job in the industry,
so I quit I quit my job, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: the first job wasn't what It wasn't what
it was like the juice promised things and
[SPEAKER_03]: I wanted to get into that story But after
I realized like what this industry kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: could be like like it's not all what you
see.
[SPEAKER_03]: It ain't all you know I just I had a
dedicated community and Peter from the
[SPEAKER_03]: future cannabis projects was holding a
history of rosin events with the nicotine
[SPEAKER_03]: Phil Salazar You do blue ice extracts and
a few other guys on the panel,
[SPEAKER_03]: but you know, I just drove out there Met
all the guys on the panel and then
[SPEAKER_03]: afterwards I talked to Peter and said how
can I get more of these and peers like
[SPEAKER_03]: well tomorrow I'm having an interview you
want to come over and I'm like you just in
[SPEAKER_03]: my head thinking you just met me Yes,
of course, you know, let's go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's do this Like that's so weird that
you're gonna invite a random guy to sit in
[SPEAKER_03]: on the interview You know, but okay and I
went in sat on the interview and the guy
[SPEAKER_03]: that he was interviewing offered me a job
I got a job in the legal industry for like
[SPEAKER_03]: seven months like as their quote-unquote
like lab manager, you know Wow,
[SPEAKER_03]: and again, it's not all what they say,
you know I was told a licensed facility,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know bells and whistles.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was nothing I had more my shed than
he had ready for me, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: but uh, it was experience that I was gonna
I was chasing and I got the experience and
[SPEAKER_03]: walked away when that situation just
realized it was all like make-believe,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I'm like, alright, I'm gonna go
You know build my own tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: Wow, it's been great.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been crazy, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been Like destiny tested No,
no weird, but it's cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I totally hear you on that man.
[SPEAKER_05]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's that's very interesting And
actually this is uh, that's what it's all
[SPEAKER_05]: about.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really like having people like telling
Story and kind of like, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: the way I feel about it's all like
everyone I've met at least, you know It's
[SPEAKER_05]: passionate people that want to change this
industry make it better make it into
[SPEAKER_05]: something that we all like feel
Represented by you know where everything
[SPEAKER_05]: else all the other industries are
destroyed by like some unattainable goals
[SPEAKER_05]: and shit It's like this is stuff that's
like we all really want this to you know
[SPEAKER_05]: Remain how it is and we're trying to keep
it that way by putting our passion in at a
[SPEAKER_05]: hundred percent And I feel like everybody
that's involved is the same way So I felt
[SPEAKER_05]: that from you when I when I met you on
Pete's program So you're just talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about a future cannabis project and shit
and I felt the same way I was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just a guy from Instagram,
you know Like anybody else is taking
[SPEAKER_05]: pictures because I'm in awe of stuff I'm
working with or around and stuff like that
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm amazed that that you know,
he'd asked me for my opinion on some stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: and and all that But it's good.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's really cool to hear your story man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like that's really badass So I have a
bunch of questions for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we work with that farm on your hat
growls Valley.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh Yeah, yeah, we've worked with them
before we bought a bunch of material from
[SPEAKER_05]: them They actually literally make some of
the best material I've ever watched I got
[SPEAKER_03]: this from
[SPEAKER_03]: And This is a cool story man, this is a
really actually pushed me to actually quit
[SPEAKER_03]: my job I stood up what I didn't know and
I'm like, I'm gonna quit my job and I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna you know chase the dream and like,
you know Hold it to your eyes as
[SPEAKER_03]: standards, you know the grassroot guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Dude, that's fucking awesome.

[SPEAKER_05]: their symbol on your hand if I had to
point that out I actually want to talk
[SPEAKER_03]: about this meeting dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was their first coalition meeting that
baby and your TG genetics He he held this
[SPEAKER_03]: coalition meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about the grassroot guys standing
up and building their own seat at this
[SPEAKER_03]: table before all the corporations come in,
you know and for all the big money come in
[SPEAKER_03]: and I want to be a part of that so bad and
I think I was like one of like two people
[SPEAKER_03]: that came from like the LA area drove up
there I gotta do I think it was beer bros
[SPEAKER_03]: myself and I think one more guy from LA
was heck up there but um, it was Surreal
[SPEAKER_03]: man being in a room full of people like a
whole like a Whole speed of bomb the
[SPEAKER_03]: Vaughn farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was held at his spot.
[SPEAKER_03]: That is actually building out now,
man Crazy man that guy Kyle is killing it
[SPEAKER_03]: and People like that do the people that
I'm trying to work with and that people
[SPEAKER_03]: are trying to become as well You know,
I want to be someone like that industry
[SPEAKER_03]: killing it
[SPEAKER_03]: That was what I'm like, I decided like I
finally found my place, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, dude I feel the same way about the
cannabis industry man for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why I want to put everything into

[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's great to hear your story It's

[SPEAKER_05]: That's not a thanks brother.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah Like I said, man, there's so many
people like me out there and you're like
[SPEAKER_03]: don't we all have the same story man It's
different books.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_05]: Love it up straight up Fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so you grow too.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's an interesting aspect.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I I Used to grow, you know, I can't do I
can't allocate over My time right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm trying to and that's the goal actually
and I was hoping this year was gonna be
[SPEAKER_03]: the year I do my single source I had a
volunteer's pop-up because sometimes I
[SPEAKER_03]: wash the seeding material Sometimes
farmers get you know how it goes seeding
[SPEAKER_03]: material and if it's not like pollinating
material if it's just like seeded and not
[SPEAKER_03]: like, you know dusted You can wash it and
get some fire from me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh totally
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I got some volunteers man and my
wife's kind of crazy I do she's been
[SPEAKER_03]: topping it down because she's kind of
against growing it and for the neighbors
[SPEAKER_03]: to see we live in a close neighborhood,
but uh One made it through man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I made it all into flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is about like a foot and a half long
plant and I am my first single source.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just washed it and pressed it Just like
last last week or so.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome though I'm sure you could
manage to put a lighter to in somewhere
[SPEAKER_02]: and just do a couple of little something
for yourself, too I'm building whether she
[SPEAKER_03]: likes it or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm building a little tiny greenhouse
there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for vegetables.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have raccoons So I have a reason to
build it, you know to keep raccoons out,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, we're gonna have these sticks in
there We're gonna have some fire fresh
[SPEAKER_05]: frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's the shit man.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's it So you're in LA?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like right outside of LA.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh sweet sweet sweet So so what is it like
looking for material for solvent list down
[SPEAKER_05]: there?
[SPEAKER_05]: That is my question I'm blessed man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm blessed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to make right?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, they I can't speak for everybody but
there I know a lot of them are buying out,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and I'll have to I'll have to
say that I've been blessed to just work on
[SPEAKER_03]: splits and partnerships, you know Because
I'm willing to work with the farmer that
[SPEAKER_03]: is only willing to give up their dry trim
or something, you know And I'm willing to
[SPEAKER_03]: grow with the farmer from there and get
their nugs and get their fresh frozen,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know I'm starting out small so I'm not
picking you know a lot of some ash makers
[SPEAKER_03]: they want the best all the flour all of
it, you know, but I'm gonna put long fall
[SPEAKER_03]: in the long term I'm willing to start
small take the trim and get to the big
[SPEAKER_03]: nugs and you know Because I know the
growers have systems already like,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, 10-15 years from doing it,
you know and they're flowers Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: I totally know exactly for sure I agree
and I mean honestly being able to work
[SPEAKER_05]: with trim is going to be something that no
not a lot of people are able to do And as
[SPEAKER_05]: we chatted about in the past like,
you know, not a lot of people know how to
[SPEAKER_05]: make the best material out of trim So it's
like you have to know how to actually make
[SPEAKER_05]: hash if you're working with trim So that's
interesting and your stuff is fire dude.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know Straight up.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it's like For me, it's kind of kind
of easy for that aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I don't have a few farms I work
with But I know some I think it's kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: accessible in my area, you know,
I feel like everywhere I look it is but I
[SPEAKER_03]: have to remember that I'm now like in a
world that's that's uh, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: so foreign to so many people, you know,
and like My brother for example is he just
[SPEAKER_03]: drove down here from Missouri and he's
been here for about a week I put him in
[SPEAKER_03]: three different farms and he's hashed out
like two different times I give him like
[SPEAKER_03]: five different tastes, you know,
and it just blew his mind of like he
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't Know it was even like it was like
this, you know I'm saying So I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: pretty easy.
[SPEAKER_03]: But for the average Joe, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know it's gotta be tough,
you know, but It's a great thing we need
[SPEAKER_02]: to continue to spread our message and end
the message right now just like that
[SPEAKER_02]: Because some people have looked at it
like, you know hoard the secret and poured
[SPEAKER_02]: the gold type of thing that What what
right disposal and it's nice to be able to
[SPEAKER_02]: share and just tell people, you know If
you really have the passion for it,
[SPEAKER_02]: you will be able to make it happen the
same way you made it happen I made it
[SPEAKER_02]: happen Frank and anybody else and those
that will come after us It's as easy as
[SPEAKER_03]: that man.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you if you want to get in here,
you're already in here He's got to put in
[SPEAKER_03]: the work and time's gonna catch up It's as
easy as that it's easy as that we'll solve
[SPEAKER_03]: this to people are always tripping on like
Bag sizes and this and that it's as easy
[SPEAKER_03]: as having good starting material and
making good hash, you know And there's no
[SPEAKER_03]: secret everything else.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is all preference in my opinion,
you know Tell us though.
[SPEAKER_05]: What is good starting material to you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Fresh, you know fresh.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's what I've been saying too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how fresh?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, I say ideally You know and it's
stretching it, you know, it's pretty like
[SPEAKER_03]: stretching it as far as like you stretch
it I would say no More than two weeks
[SPEAKER_03]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, no more than that Shooting for
really no more than ten days off the
[SPEAKER_03]: plant, you know, but if someone's like
Really want to try it out and you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know two weeks max, you know Ideally
five days right off the plant like fresh
[SPEAKER_03]: as possible, you know, and and you got to
keep it cold You know preserve it,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know wash washing right away is good,
too I found with trim Washing right away
[SPEAKER_03]: is good freezing the nose you got a
freezing nose, but Cool dude, fuck yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: sweet Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you have anything you want to talk
about specifically or anything any stories
[SPEAKER_05]: there anything like that about your
process and stuff like that?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a good story man, cuz uh,
and that's another thing everyone trips
[SPEAKER_03]: out on I feel like there's so much
paralysis analysis going on, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I Hope that I could put a stop to that
help people out to sharing my journey like
[SPEAKER_03]: just starting, you know, totally You know
just starting man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean this started with a hair
straightener people standing on it So you
[SPEAKER_03]: don't need the final $5,000 press right
away like this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let's go I don't know if I can turn my
camera around
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it's a CRD press it's just a DIY
press kind of oh, wow, do you know badass?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the best I've seen videos of it now
that I didn't realize it was a DIY but
[SPEAKER_03]: that's badass man Yeah, it's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll show you what it came like and the
first press I had It was a you know I'll
[SPEAKER_03]: say commercial press meaning it was like,
you know It was made commercially,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, it was a commercialized press.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was Like 500 bucks, but it was a two
ton It was a two ton press and the plates
[SPEAKER_03]: were two inches by two inches,
you know small little square So which is
[SPEAKER_03]: which is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It got me started because I didn't have
that much material So it was like the
[SPEAKER_03]: plate size is ideal, you know,
but uh, it was kind of You know,
[SPEAKER_03]: I just I worked with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But when I found this this press I was
blown away I was like it was day and
[SPEAKER_03]: night, you know this for a couple more
hundred dollars and It was a much much
[SPEAKER_03]: bigger place.
[SPEAKER_03]: These are four by eight plates.
[SPEAKER_03]: It came with originally sick and The
original Harbor Freight, you know 20-ton
[SPEAKER_03]: hand pump press I Never time it this timer
is used for my my washes, you know I just
[SPEAKER_03]: Every press is different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know that everyone's asking time
temperature The temperature is based on me
[SPEAKER_03]: loading the bags how it'll come melting
isn't the best and then Fuck then I go
[SPEAKER_03]: that I choose a temperature, you know,
and then what range what range do you
[SPEAKER_05]: choose from?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, so I think low range if it's like
really melting the bag like I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: press it at 160 170.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, maybe one maybe 180, you know,
that's like a Low-range like 160 to 179
[SPEAKER_03]: Mid-range is like 180 to 200 204 and then
anything between like 205 to 220 is pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: high, you know I mainly I mainly live in
the 180 to 200 degree range Even when I do
[SPEAKER_03]: get a great shit that melts awesome and I
can't press it out at 160 Sometimes my
[SPEAKER_03]: workflow and this comes kind of flowing I
have a lot of work to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just kind of get it done with the 180
But I'll do like one press at 160 just to
[SPEAKER_03]: check it out And then I'll finish like the
next five presses at 180 and just kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: get back in the rhythm You know I'm saying
awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah This press has done so good I've had
it for a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am actually Looking at upgrading,
you know, I've already did some upgrades
[SPEAKER_03]: to it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had him change up the plates because I
liked It fit better on these plates and
[SPEAKER_03]: the rosin flows off faster kind of got the
idea from Looking at peer pressures
[SPEAKER_03]: plates, you know how they're long and
skinny but I could have the bag sitting on
[SPEAKER_03]: here and Then they're just about like an
eighth or a quarter inch on both sides and
[SPEAKER_03]: the rosin will slow off pretty quickly
Dude, that's so I I like that a lot but um
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you know Always room for
improvement, you know with everything
[SPEAKER_05]: Totally.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's fucking awesome, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: I thought that was a machine that I just
you know, I am NOT too up You know
[SPEAKER_05]: up-to-date with all the machines.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just figured it was a legit one.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's fucking awesome One of the best
features too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't use it too often anymore,
but it was really fun It was like the trip
[SPEAKER_03]: mode.
[SPEAKER_03]: He has it on a cradle.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah It's against the wall a little bit It
can go full, you know 180 degrees flat.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah gotcha.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's badass You know, it's pretty
dope it could just trip all out right But
[SPEAKER_03]: my plates are so small the rosin flows off
quickly Having a straight up and down is
[SPEAKER_05]: nice Yeah, yeah So you said you had a
story on the press Oh my bad brother
[SPEAKER_03]: that's lurking slightly a little bit The
old basically the story pretty much kind
[SPEAKER_03]: of said a little bit It was it was a like
a 500 dollar press and it was small.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's two times small plates When I when I
would press it the whole thing with rock,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I have to like really hold it
with one hand press it with the other,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, and I You know, it was kind of
hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a learning press, but it was pretty
expensive learning press and This one like
[SPEAKER_03]: I said, it was only I was like 800 bucks,
you know, and it it kills it in volume
[SPEAKER_03]: It's 20 times the plates are bigger way
bigger.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's way sturdier way heavier I don't need
to like babysit it hold it with one hand
[SPEAKER_03]: and press it with the other hand so it was
just the real lesson there for me was just
[SPEAKER_03]: like I Always kind of had has been is like
going with family owned or going with a
[SPEAKER_03]: small guy You know at least first,
you know, if you're just getting into it
[SPEAKER_03]: go with the small guy first and check it
out and see if you like what you're gonna
[SPEAKER_03]: do before you invest on the big big big,
you know fancy stuff, but I Bought like
[SPEAKER_03]: the name-brand thing and then you know,
I found this guy and he's local Close
[SPEAKER_03]: fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah You know, he's a guy just like me
trying to build his name build a spot,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, go see at the table,
you know That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's also what I really enjoy about the
solid thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like representing the farming
Representing the quality of the farmer and
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a teamwork process, you know,
so that's fucking awesome 100% man 100%
[SPEAKER_03]: It's all about the farmer for me because I
feel like I've lived off the farmer like
[SPEAKER_03]: most of my life, you know, and that's why
I really want to like the solvent this
[SPEAKER_03]: wave seems to be Not gonna stop and gonna
be like the new thing and I think it's
[SPEAKER_03]: really gonna change as the industry is
becoming This new legal conglomerate
[SPEAKER_03]: Solveless is right with it and it's all
this is new The legalization is new and I
[SPEAKER_03]: think it's gonna be a pretty big thing and
a lot of these farmers man They're old
[SPEAKER_03]: school farmers and they've been growing
the weed for weed for a long time and I
[SPEAKER_03]: feel like it's my duty to help these
farmers and give back and just Share all
[SPEAKER_03]: my knowledge as I can, you know,
help them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay produce their own solvents lying,
you know, at least get the basics down get
[SPEAKER_03]: them started get the wheels moving and You
know, they're growers man.
[SPEAKER_03]: They know what to do from there.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I'm saying Fuck yeah,
dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you a grower?
[SPEAKER_03]: I Say I'm a grower.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew I grew up here and there something
giggles like, you know, nothing serious
[SPEAKER_03]: though.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't until I decided to like You know
that this is what I want to do I started
[SPEAKER_03]: growing seriously and then in growing like
in growing and finding my style which is
[SPEAKER_03]: like a living soil method That's the style
I put my preference if I were to grow a
[SPEAKER_03]: game would be that fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I started growing and I found my
style.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hadn't moved Circumstances changed and
then that's how I found my solvents,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know window So things often for a
reason, you know, I was really wanting to
[SPEAKER_03]: be a grower Never knew about solvents and
now I'm like super passionate about this
[SPEAKER_03]: like with my AC not working right now,
I haven't washed in about a week and I've
[SPEAKER_03]: been having a little depression with it
man and having to like Remember to refocus
[SPEAKER_03]: my energy that I'm kind of rebuilding the
room and when it's going again I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: crush it harder, you know, so that makes
me happy and it's like it's a weird
[SPEAKER_03]: balance that I'm playing with myself You
know, it's like I want to wash.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Be patient because you're gonna crush,
you know, it's like yeah, I'm gonna crush
[SPEAKER_03]: and then oh fuck I want to wash all this
beautiful shit in the freezer right now
[SPEAKER_05]: Seriously, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I feel that for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: What's going on with your AC?
[SPEAKER_03]: Basic capacitor went out and The part at
the stores it won't fit in the compartment
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have to order direct and it's like a
week out or whatever but I've been wanting
[SPEAKER_03]: to get an ice machine, so I've ordered an
ice machine as well and That's pretty much
[SPEAKER_03]: almost all I really need man besides some
new reservoir And maybe a sink and this
[SPEAKER_03]: will be a good machine man for for a good
time coming for a while But the ice
[SPEAKER_03]: machine is nice You guys smoke down
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been look at that though,
oh wow, that looks fucking beautiful,
[SPEAKER_01]: but oh Boy, this is a 160 micron Wow Cured
is that cured?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, for sure cold here in the fridge I'm
sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: So was the material cured that you
watched?
[SPEAKER_03]: No.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, no, it was fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that was fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's fire Yeah, I've never seen 160 that
fire Right Usually it's the trash each,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I usually kind of mostly throw
the 160 bag out in the 190 bag out right
[SPEAKER_03]: or save it if it's clean, but usually It's
all plant plant materials up or something
[SPEAKER_03]: But this shit was fire man fuck yeah Like
this is the kind of stuff that you could
[SPEAKER_03]: do like a True full spectrum like a two
washing the 220 Catching the 45 and that's
[SPEAKER_03]: it.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this stuff was really nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: Maybe double bag to 20 Just to make sure
no climate show gets in there But this was
[SPEAKER_02]: a really good guy Rose for resin How do
you like how that looks huh?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want me to hold your camera?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh dang could you yeah arrow fast?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just film this do it 2x Cheers Yes,
let me just
[SPEAKER_03]: Like whole plants
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: What'd you just say?
[SPEAKER_03]: I've waited so long for slurkey.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, sorry, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like a fresh frozen slurkey.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm washing trim and it's been fire and
expectations were met for sure Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: And yeah, I experienced it a few times in
full melt form, but not in like whole
[SPEAKER_05]: plant fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's fucking That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_05]: I remember seeing it and be like,
oh damn Now yeah, I got a new a new farmer
[SPEAKER_03]: that's actually That grows in soil,
you know, I'm super excited to work with
[SPEAKER_03]: him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: He's got some pretty cool flavors to man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's indoor Indoor yeah, he has
indoor and he grows in a bunch of soil
[SPEAKER_05]: pots, you know Awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if do you know any when you were
talking about growing indoor or am I
[SPEAKER_05]: growing living soil?
[SPEAKER_05]: Were you talking about growing doing
indoor grow?
[SPEAKER_03]: That's where that's where that's what I
was doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I was indoor and I had HPS at the
time But my goal was to get LEDs,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, but then you know, that's what
that's what my ideal was like Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: can you tell Jim about that situation
because basically he knows more than I do
[SPEAKER_05]: about the actual growing process But I
know a lot of and I'm very interested in
[SPEAKER_05]: the living soil thing So he said a couple
things like it would take a lot of
[SPEAKER_05]: ventilation and stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm very curious I'm curious.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many lights did you have?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it was a this was a closet grow,
you know, it's like experimental grows I
[SPEAKER_03]: was doing you know, it was it never got to
Like the real deal, you know, it was like
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very hard to do it on a large scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why to me what's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very hard to do on a larger scale to
me and I'm excited to find out how it can
[SPEAKER_02]: be done.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh Man, I've seen I don't I can't say I'll
hop my head by seeing some guys on,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know future canvas projects He did
some interviews of some pretty big
[SPEAKER_03]: facilities in in Nevada What's a place
called?
[SPEAKER_03]: Darn somewhere in Nevada close to Vegas
and That facility is on point like he had
[SPEAKER_03]: living soil down in my opinion,
like I'll send you three labs alien labs
[SPEAKER_05]: all those like Very well-known companies
that are all from LA and yeah big money
[SPEAKER_05]: and but big advertising stuff a lot of it
But the thing is what's cool to me is that
[SPEAKER_05]: nature ended up prevailing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like living soil ended up speaking so
loud that that's what's truly represented
[SPEAKER_05]: by that stuff is that the quality is in
the is in the soil being alive and feeding
[SPEAKER_05]: it properly and you know not just feeding
it salt or whatever the fucking you know
[SPEAKER_05]: bullshit, so it's very inches extremely
interesting to me, but um You know Matt
[SPEAKER_05]: rise are you familiar with Matt rise's
work?
[SPEAKER_03]: Uh, you know, like I have not until like I
I wasn't until I started getting to the
[SPEAKER_03]: game myself You know and hearing his name
more and more but he wasn't someone I
[SPEAKER_03]: didn't follow anybody man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just smoked weed love The plant and try
to like grow it and and and use it for
[SPEAKER_03]: free, you know And I wasn't following
nobody trying to get into it until just
[SPEAKER_03]: like past couple years But I didn't know
of them for sure, you know, and I see him
[SPEAKER_03]: I think he's viewed as like a leader in
the industry, you know, I Hear an
[SPEAKER_05]: interesting character for sure for the cat
with the hash stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just like recently I've just seen him
post a lot of stuff that's all living soil
[SPEAKER_05]: indoors.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm like, okay, it really is Like,
you know, it's the shit You can't fight it
[SPEAKER_03]: man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean You you see like no one can fight
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's weird.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a living It's like you feed the soil
the soil is gonna feed the plant and it
[SPEAKER_03]: just proves it and I'm not denying like
because I work with farmers like with grow
[SPEAKER_03]: assaults and then they crush it as well
and It's pretty clean solvent list.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know people kind of and some people hate
on me.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really interesting That's awesome
because the reason I asked originally here
[SPEAKER_05]: about about sourcing solvent list in LA is
just Because straight up and I mean you're
[SPEAKER_05]: posting all fire, but we literally like
tried to source on the on the rec market
[SPEAKER_05]: You know material out of LA and we found a
few good sources But more so we got stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: that we weren't able to wash You know,
like it didn't come out like and that's
[SPEAKER_05]: just from the rec market So I knew already
that you know Obviously people are growing
[SPEAKER_05]: a lot of material down there and stuff
like that But I was just curious how it is
[SPEAKER_05]: because I see you post a lot of fire and
stuff So it's very it's very intriguing to
[SPEAKER_03]: me It's all in the grower man because I
worked and I'm walking throwing them under
[SPEAKER_03]: the bus But I worked with his partner and
his ex-partner and watched his stuff and
[SPEAKER_03]: his grow No, but this dude his grow he
might nice, you know, this is like after
[SPEAKER_03]: they split up and I think maybe it's a
flush with the salt.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know I don't I don't grow you
know, but I actually Because I I'm working
[SPEAKER_03]: with a new farmer that's living soil And I
expected it to like kick its ass,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I'm like, oh man if the salt
hashes fire this guy's is gonna be great
[SPEAKER_03]: and it was great, you know, but When I go
back and forth, I'm like, ah, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the salt ones maybe cleaner But maybe
because I'm also very very familiar with
[SPEAKER_03]: that guy's interior material and the
living soil material is super new and The
[SPEAKER_03]: first round he gave to me it wasn't You
know his first round and it wasn't ideal
[SPEAKER_03]: and a lot of families in it, you know,
and I had to tell him to take the families
[SPEAKER_03]: out and We're gonna grow pretty well,
I think I'm pretty excited about this new
[SPEAKER_03]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, yeah, dude, that's awesome I love
that so much the grower and the hash
[SPEAKER_05]: maker.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what I call it So if you dude if
you work with somebody that you would like
[SPEAKER_05]: to do an interview with and help and like
talk to them and stuff I'd really like to
[SPEAKER_05]: do that.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's one of my things.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to write articles about that I've
written a few thus far and that that's one
[SPEAKER_05]: of my goals is to kind of You know the the
relationship between the farmer and the
[SPEAKER_05]: person that's making the stuff into hash,
you know, it's intense Oh, yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: everything it's all in the works right
now, man But once I once I get a
[SPEAKER_03]: harmonious relationship man, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll get in here.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll tell our story for sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Cool, man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, thank you very much man.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been fun.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's been awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: Appreciate you Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I appreciate it man.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Fuck.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah So Tim, thank you for coming on to
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I was just gonna say I'm doing an
indoor I'll send you a link to the indoor
[SPEAKER_00]: we're putting together in Oklahoma.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I figured you would be able to
answer some questions about the indoor and
[SPEAKER_05]: the living soil and scaling and stuff like
that I was gonna say he's he's on point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't get me wrong There's a couple guys
since I've seen a fellow in Oklahoma and I
[SPEAKER_00]: know quite a few they're doing living.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's just There's two different angles
to the you know, every piece has a fit And
[SPEAKER_00]: not every fit has a piece put it this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not everybody, you know should do the same
thing put it that way and the environment
[SPEAKER_00]: there because of the the weather and
different things if you're gonna do an
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor then you're sealing it up and if
you're sealing it up Then you bring in
[SPEAKER_00]: dirt and you have to have bugs to make
your living soil work So then you've got
[SPEAKER_00]: to decide what cover crops you want to
grow to keep the insects happy and not
[SPEAKER_00]: attacking your pop land So they're eating
the other things you're growing rather
[SPEAKER_00]: than your weed and it's a competition So
literally soil takes a couple of roles
[SPEAKER_00]: couple of turns a couple of grows to get
the soil, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you get into mode per se and even the
best are only is so good And that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference is if you're you know an
indoor the easier quicker and cleaner
[SPEAKER_00]: operation to keep your Everything FDA and
all that fun stuff is to go I hate to say
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's true and the living soil is just more
more work and and more attentive to say
[SPEAKER_00]: you So there's all kinds of things you can
do but not every operation is set up for
[SPEAKER_00]: that So look at you know, what are these
guys used to doing?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do they been doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do they do normally?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or have they even grown me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if I interrupted you guys I
totally believe in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I truly do But it's like anything else
when you're spending like the operation
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm talking about here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're spending a quarter million dollars
on LED lights Just for lights a half a
[SPEAKER_00]: million It's a relative, you know,
so you've already built a half million
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar building and then you've insulated
that You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just keeps adding up You know,
you've got to figure out how you can be On
[SPEAKER_00]: the market with a competitive product
pretty darn quick and not have to go
[SPEAKER_00]: through those getting your soil right
pains Maybe got to feed those plants They
[SPEAKER_02]: got a few you got to feed them something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh Yeah, yeah, we're feeding them food.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll be a salt base.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Five more acres of doing outdoors,
so I'm gonna know where he's there I'll be
[SPEAKER_00]: fine So I was already they grow trees
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this operation was a tree farm to start
with and that's what they do already I've
[SPEAKER_00]: already got the people already got the
equipment already got the land already got
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else He hired me and do the
consulting
[SPEAKER_00]: When we grow up, you know then back in
March I'll be there to start there a
[SPEAKER_00]: Program because you know, we got to get
things ready and then start early and do a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple light ducks Pretty quick and easy
I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: How big is the square footage like the
property?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm getting a five-acre parcel just for
the weed and then I've got the warehouse
[SPEAKER_00]: is 20,000 square going up Steam tape all
the scenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's certainly no light leaks now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they're gonna go to the phone spray
the whole thing Sorry, then all the PVC
[SPEAKER_00]: walls go in and everything else for all
the FDA cleanliness and blah blah blah
[SPEAKER_00]: Steal the cement $100,000 freeze-dried so
we're gonna do freeze-dried meat And we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to do the bubble house,
but I've already got 9-1-8-0-g is hooked
[SPEAKER_00]: up to do all the bubble hashing So we're
just gonna do the top buds the shelf buds
[SPEAKER_00]: That's gonna get freeze-dried That's a
great way to do it, you know See the big
[SPEAKER_00]: good buds with the packs wash the rest No,
and the other thing is there's nobody
[SPEAKER_00]: doing As good side is operation per se and
doing any freeze-drying there yet There's
[SPEAKER_00]: a couple little ones on the edges,
you know doing small stuff, but mainly
[SPEAKER_00]: half So it's like anything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's not there's very few doing weed
That's why I went talk to Richard again a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannon freeze and started working with him
and Can get new units because I basically
[SPEAKER_00]: ran out of reconditioned units The
markets, you know, there's no more they
[SPEAKER_00]: don't make that many, you know when you
get to in between a harvest Right and an
[SPEAKER_00]: industrial there's only a few like the lab
of rabbit pork, you know that Whistler's
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing around They did they have dealers
here too, and it's a very good machine You
[SPEAKER_00]: know if you're gonna buy two or three
harvest rights, then maybe you should buy
[SPEAKER_00]: one of those.
[SPEAKER_00]: I Think they replace roughly two they say
three, but I think that's pushing the edge
[SPEAKER_05]: So have you seen anybody I use the harvest
right a deal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was I was on with Tyler today
there with Whistler tech
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of times to where people get
interrupted with freeze-dryers is you
[SPEAKER_00]: gotta remember what you're doing when
you're sublimating bubble hash You're not
[SPEAKER_00]: sublimating the water through a tissue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not in the trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's outside the trichome So it's very
easy to sublimate water when it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: going through a tissue or a material or a
cell wall Okay, it's Simple that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: easiest thing a freeze dryer could ever do
trouble with them is their valving and
[SPEAKER_00]: pressures And their algorithm is just not
made for what we do and it's slow The
[SPEAKER_00]: plates only heat on the top of the bottom.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not each plate is heated That's why the
the leather bar, you know, it's 15 grand
[SPEAKER_00]: But basically by the time you get
everything right, you're gonna be about 20
[SPEAKER_00]: grand for one of them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can pair them up though.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could run two of those off one air
area that Tyler was showing that today
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good unit.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's nothing wrong with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, it's very good because you get
all the sensors you need and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else goes down to point Point one
atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it goes down to damn near
flat zero So it's really pulling the
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuum that's a key and then the
refrigeration units of the right sides and
[SPEAKER_00]: the temperature problems are in the right
Place that's what matters, you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: algorithm on that and that's where dry
weeds the same way There's been some
[SPEAKER_00]: issues with weed and that's where people
have had problems is harvest rights Don't
[SPEAKER_00]: don't evaporate properly involving.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's they're just bad You can actually
buy if you want a new weed in a harvest,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's about a $2,500 algorithm and a
couple of valving attachments you can buy
[SPEAKER_00]: through this other lab company that makes
them work better quote-unquote So,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know if you're already spending four
grand or five grand and now you get up
[SPEAKER_00]: spend $2,500 bucks to make it work,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on And then if your harvest right
breaks you shit out of luck you basically
[SPEAKER_00]: bought a boat anchor if you can't fix it
yourself I got a guy from Canada sent me a
[SPEAKER_00]: deal today three out of five of the brand
new ones They got in right the shelves in
[SPEAKER_00]: there weren't even riveted on one side and
like two of the shelves were just in its
[SPEAKER_00]: total angle And that was a brand new
unpackage getting ready to go out to a
[SPEAKER_00]: customer That's just what you can see
visibly Can you imagine?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not you know, I don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: I get no money from nobody that makes
these other than canopies I worked with
[SPEAKER_00]: him, but that's a very large machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean we're talking hundred grand and
stuff like that You know, the little ones
[SPEAKER_00]: 30 grand.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, those are the ones I told them to
put on the shelves and stop But it's equal
[SPEAKER_00]: to three harvest rights in size and volume
And it is a machine that will last you as
[SPEAKER_00]: long as you live until you die It's like
that Smallest unit is roughly about three
[SPEAKER_00]: not even quite four feet deep and maybe a
little over two feet wide Maybe three feet
[SPEAKER_00]: tall Wow, you know, they're not extremely
large.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's on a cart.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got from the floor up So yeah,
maybe it's four foot tall total right and
[SPEAKER_00]: two and a half wide and about three or
four deep It's not that big The key to
[SPEAKER_00]: that is its warming system It's not on the
individual trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why it takes longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what it is Is the machine is made that
way.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's Richard's role smart guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's been building these things for 30
years He's been to all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: countries where they make them the factors
that make them and that's why when he
[SPEAKER_00]: designed these that he's selling now He
designed it himself and he's having them
[SPEAKER_00]: built in the factory that he thinks is the
best in the world in England And he is in
[SPEAKER_00]: all the best parts that come mainly out of
Germany and England, but they've been
[SPEAKER_00]: building them for over 30 years Right,
and they know what the hell they're doing
[SPEAKER_00]: So he said, okay, here's what I want to
because the past few years I think people
[SPEAKER_00]: were kind of pushing them around as to how
they wanted it rather than how the machine
[SPEAKER_00]: really works It's like everything you
can't turn a barber's gear, you know into
[SPEAKER_00]: a sheep's year They just don't work the
same right, you know Make a Ferrari out of
[SPEAKER_00]: a Volkswagen.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care how many Volkswagen parts you
bring me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't make a Ferrari, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the same kind of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got to Understand the parts so
they're making the best stuff and and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a warranty it's Service you got a
problem bang.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's fixed.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, that's the big difference
there, too Because that's one thing that
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest right there really has been for
years that way I mean, I'm not speaking
[SPEAKER_00]: out of school.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think you can find anybody Hardly
that hasn't had a problem with them if
[SPEAKER_00]: they had a breakage with their machine or
something go wrong I feel I feel for the
[SPEAKER_00]: people because I say this guy up in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_00]: He ordered five Brought in five and only
two of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: He can sell the other three now.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's got a return back to China Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean come on and he's a dealer He's a
dealer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's not just a job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh buys it He's a dealer trying to do
business and everybody wants them and they
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay fine for bubble hash to be honest I
say that's why I tell people you know for
[SPEAKER_00]: the money and the fact that what they are
if you're starting out now then yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's probably your best bet because
You're just supplementing the water away.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not pulling it through the cells.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not pulling it out of the trichome
So it's a simple operation so it
[SPEAKER_00]: functions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It works But you know, the trouble is is
you're flipping the dice whether you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get a bad one a good one Hopefully
yours lasts forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean, but you never know
And I've seen too many of them fail when
[SPEAKER_00]: you say this guy today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, it was funny was yesterday It
was like we were talking about it two days
[SPEAKER_00]: before because you wanted me to do a zoom
up there in Canada with him doing Show and
[SPEAKER_00]: I you know, we were talking and we were
talking about this very thing And it's
[SPEAKER_00]: it's sad because there's not something the
11 core is probably the best in-betweener
[SPEAKER_00]: right now and the factor that you can Buy
one for roughly 20,000.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, and it's roughly three harvest
rights Okay, when you get to that volume,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's okay, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Then it's equal money more or less,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you can also though with one
vacuum pump then buy another machine for
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like 13 grand if you buy just the
machine parts without the vacuum pump and
[SPEAKER_00]: you can have two two machines up to one
vacuum pump You can save a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: there and double your volume Right and
operate that way But it's still you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all money now and I hate to tell
people but it's like the Morax gonna pass
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it passed through Congress.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll pass through this next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: No doubt Trouble is is that's when the
billionaires walk in not the millionaires
[SPEAKER_00]: down kids Because this is gonna be
hardball because now the bankers can get
[SPEAKER_00]: in and play and we can play stock market
and we can play all kinds of fun games and
[SPEAKER_00]: it ain't gonna be the junior league
millionaires and it's gonna be the
[SPEAKER_00]: billionaires that come in and just suck
shit up It's already happened,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean look at all the companies that have
sold out already General Hydroponics,
[SPEAKER_00]: who'd they sell out to?
[SPEAKER_00]: Was that Toro?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, I mean, you know you tell me it's
just gonna be that way they're gonna keep
[SPEAKER_00]: eating it up The thing that people got to
really watch and I'm very seriously for
[SPEAKER_00]: you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the local laws like right now They're
trying to make it so if you're say a
[SPEAKER_00]: patient you got a medical card,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you're sick and you want to make RSO
because you got cancer or something,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're making RSO for your patient or
yourself They're making it illegal to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that in your home kitchen Damn it's in the
law read it People gotta wake up and not
[SPEAKER_00]: just I think that the guy over there with
the politicians doing it for us because
[SPEAKER_00]: they're not dude look around Just paying
all these taxes in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's just squeezing everyone out of the
middle There's gonna be you might be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to grow a couple plants at home later And
then the corporate you're gonna have to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want you to buy everything so they
get their taxes period Sorry, that's life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the way reality Is and now they're
trying to squeeze out the middle And if
[SPEAKER_00]: people don't keep fighting, you know,
how did this all start?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did how did marijuana become medically
legal in California?
[SPEAKER_00]: How long ago and why was it?
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer patients and aid patients in San
Francisco were dying and It was found to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a remedy for things like gee,
you're getting chemo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey smoke some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll get hungry and it worked So we were
riding on the backs of medical patients
[SPEAKER_00]: here, but yeah, everybody's you know,
letting the corporate thing just fly off
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the old and it's like the BHL and
everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I say the same thing I was in the
pharmaceutical industry stepped into this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and put their foot in it just
like they did the pharmaceutical industry
[SPEAKER_00]: that corporate oil industry kept
petrochemical industry Went into the
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical market and took it over.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make sulfur.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can make this we can make that we just
mix it together and hey, there you go
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not on a homeopathic medicine or
organic medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, no We're making it by the barrel
full over here out of synthetic shit
[SPEAKER_06]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, what do they do with BHL and and
propane and all these other things now
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol is alcohol We've been doing that
for hundreds of years, but you know all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those processes Sure, they they're very
functional because you're liquefying the
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to all come They just got
liquefied Right in butane.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now we've sucked all them off and now
we're gonna bring them back And we just
[SPEAKER_00]: hope we can get all the butane out Granted
we test all that stuff here But you know
[SPEAKER_00]: in reality you can do anything solvent
listen you can do it butane propane and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the rest of them They just didn't
believe it back then because they didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: know how They did not know how It was like
making diamonds You know making diamonds I
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost hilarious because There was
people doing that and people go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: No shatters shatters it and you guys got
to be shattered Shatter it's no good
[SPEAKER_00]: Bullshit that's THC crystals.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, oh, no, that's not no.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it can't be better It's too good
shatters it you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was stupid And it's now I like I tell
people when you start a be a show or
[SPEAKER_00]: propane operation like that You know,
you're gonna initially need at least a
[SPEAKER_00]: million dollars right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Out the gate just for the building permits
and the bullshit then you get to buy the
[SPEAKER_00]: equipment all the rest of crap for the
next million Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well all those guys got all that money
invested and all those buildings and
[SPEAKER_00]: everything else that they did And they got
to pay it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't buy all the cash They bought
they took loans and everybody else did
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever they did And sure enough,
you know now they've got to keep them
[SPEAKER_00]: running because they got to pay for all
that crap But you can you can set up a
[SPEAKER_00]: bubble hash operation for 200,000 tomorrow
And have a commercial operation going if
[SPEAKER_02]: you got a permit All right, I needed to
know you're that Tim.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the fucking man Isn't it true?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it I don't know that it's that simple
Seriously you had 200 grand there deal You
[SPEAKER_00]: know if you had 200 grand you think you
could get you a small warehouse set up a
[SPEAKER_00]: wash operation get one of those nice
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever you want to buy it don't I don't
care get a Frenchie get an ice check
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever I'm just saying you can set up a
nice little commercial operation with a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice $100,000 sitting there just banging
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you don't have to go through all the
bullshit Building plus the permit plus the
[SPEAKER_00]: inspections to go with it plus the halon
gas Plus of this but you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean it's all more and more all that
you've got to do is have ice and water and
[SPEAKER_00]: you want a big water filter, you know,
I do them too, but Anyway, I'm throwing a
[SPEAKER_00]: couple plugs in here for fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a shit day today
[SPEAKER_00]: They're doing Kagan water, I don't I
shouldn't get into all this shit,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you know, they're making claims that
oh We're the only ones in the world that
[SPEAKER_00]: can do this and I'm like really well here
check this website because these guys do
[SPEAKER_00]: the same thing Oh, no, but they can't do
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, well, maybe you should read the
specifications because they do do that It
[SPEAKER_00]: does exactly the same thing exactly the
same ionic process exactly the same,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know alkaline process for making
alkaline water done, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're gonna be wrong But science is not
that hard and I got a master's degree in
[SPEAKER_00]: science So, you know, I can read that kind
of shit someone and you know, like I say
[SPEAKER_00]: then all of a sudden it's like you're
attacking me You know, you're being rude
[SPEAKER_00]: stops it like wait a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sending you facts You're saying it's
the only one earth that can do it You're
[SPEAKER_00]: saying this the only company that makes it
and I'm sending you links to companies
[SPEAKER_00]: that make identical equipment And you're
telling me I'm wrong It's because it's a
[SPEAKER_03]: it's bullshit corporate like It's called
this we're the best it's new.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're the other cultists.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah It's a cult you get a company like
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they do is they feed you full of all
this Yeah, they've been doing it for 48
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, the company in South Korea has been
doing it over 30 Okay, fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do it for the medical industry there
for the hospitals.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all approved in South Korea They make
some good shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We buy a lot of it and uh, yeah good.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other one's made in italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, here's the thing I send you the spec
sheets on them both Right, and you tell me
[SPEAKER_00]: if the other one's worth four thousand
dollars more Okay, because I guarantee you
[SPEAKER_00]: they're identical And actually the one i'm
going to send you this cheaper You don't
[SPEAKER_00]: have to clean it at all You don't have to
stop the machine every four hours and pour
[SPEAKER_00]: a special solution in and run it through
to clean it every five for five minutes
[SPEAKER_00]: And then once a year send it back to the
factory.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know the south korean one They
come up with a new technology and alter
[SPEAKER_00]: the frequencies and they bounce it off the
plates And they keep the place from ever
[SPEAKER_00]: growing anything on them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they sell clean So you never have to
shut it off and it runs forever What would
[SPEAKER_00]: you buy Right, and that's the point like a
you know that oh you you must be working
[SPEAKER_00]: for them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blah blah blah You're trying to destroy
me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like hey lady Look, i'm sending you
facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're the one Calling cussing me out
using foul language.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've never used that then all of a sudden
here comes her husband Now he said hey,
[SPEAKER_00]: what are you doing harassing my wife?
[SPEAKER_00]: You're you're a predator She's at home
trying to school her kids and and you're a
[SPEAKER_00]: predator attacking her i'm like dude I
sent her links to check specifications And
[SPEAKER_00]: told her she was wrong check the facts And
if that's being a predator then i'm sorry,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that's the trouble with the social
media.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys get all Burned up and then you
start using foul language because you you
[SPEAKER_00]: believe everything's free over here
Nobody's gonna know who you are or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever and I can call you or whatever
and you know Make all these foul
[SPEAKER_00]: accusations about you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, which I don't do I never do on any
social media people that know me know that
[SPEAKER_00]: No, i'll tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey look go check the facts So that's when
she started doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said well hell with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went online and yeah Hey, you guys want
to know where hydrogen water where you can
[SPEAKER_00]: get it get it here You want to know where
you can get this check it here Check the
[SPEAKER_00]: difference check the specs check the
models check the service check everything
[SPEAKER_00]: you decide I never tell people,
you know, unless I got a pan client I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't tell them what to buy exactly or you
know, give them my opinions because bottom
[SPEAKER_00]: line there's too many variables but When
you're telling people you're the only one
[SPEAKER_00]: in the world that does this and makes that
and there's two companies I sent her two
[SPEAKER_00]: links There's two companies that make the
exact same product one of them is
[SPEAKER_00]: identical to theirs and the other one Just
makes the cleaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually it was really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's me good thinking covid and all
that right now, right got to clean things
[SPEAKER_00]: So this comes as like a spray bottle kind
of like one of those 409 bottles,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's got a little base on it
electronic.
[SPEAKER_00]: You plug it in Well, you put the salt you
put water in you put salt in like two
[SPEAKER_00]: teaspoons of salt And then you got a
little squirter of vinegar you squirt a
[SPEAKER_00]: little vinegar in and it's even stronger
and a better sterilizer and cleaner than
[SPEAKER_00]: the kegan 2.5 Because you don't add
Vinegar to it, but that would comes out
[SPEAKER_00]: you put it on its little stand in like 30
minutes It makes that container sterile
[SPEAKER_00]: water to use anywhere in your you know
house whatever on your hands your surfaces
[SPEAKER_00]: clean whatever you want So it's a home
cleaner so you never buy 409 or up and
[SPEAKER_00]: cleaner or whatever again You just buy one
of those put it on the sink with this
[SPEAKER_00]: little stand and it's plugged in and ready
to go all the time
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's like anything I you know,
don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's there's too much information out
there and I've traveled the world I use
[SPEAKER_00]: those machines over in Asia and I knew
there was a couple of different makers
[SPEAKER_00]: There's there's always an Asian maker at
least the part of Asia the thing is Like
[SPEAKER_00]: when you go to where they sell motorcycles
There's at least three of them and in
[SPEAKER_00]: within a throw a stone's throw of each
other They always do that if there's a guy
[SPEAKER_00]: with a tire shop next, you know,
two stores down be another tire shop It's
[SPEAKER_00]: just the way it is they group together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know why I don't know why it's
just the way it is But it seems like in
[SPEAKER_00]: Asia is the same way if somebody's making
something that's working and it's good
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, we can make that too and they start
making it too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, I'm gonna say these guys that are
making these have been Doing it over 30 40
[SPEAKER_00]: years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're as good as the guys in Italy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I trust them They got a warranty
and everything and they're good for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They got actually an operation in LA so
you could actually go and you know get
[SPEAKER_00]: shit but the other company does a little
sales group accountants a little You
[SPEAKER_00]: remember Shackley vitamins you ever hear
them?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, okay anyone anyway, it's a progressive
system where you know, hey I we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: Friends and da da da and there's a
progressive deal where okay, we'll let you
[SPEAKER_00]: have this area That's your area to sell
right and then you get a percentage off
[SPEAKER_00]: the sales in that area or the contact fine
Just don't lie people Just don't lie.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of the streets.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is mine Well, then it cracked me up
because tonight I get a call from my
[SPEAKER_00]: buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's silly gloves.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like hey, man You know this lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, she's the one that's been
together He's telling me I'm harassing her
[SPEAKER_00]: in this and all I'm doing to say stop
responding But no, she wants to bitch me
[SPEAKER_00]: out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now she's gonna talk to you thinking
what you're my boss.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, yeah He laughed he goes he says I
ain't his boss, man I told him what's what
[SPEAKER_00]: he goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I just don't want the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said look, you know me I don't attack
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't use foul language never have
wouldn't do it, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bottom line is though these people
are insulted that I busted him Okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're insulted because they couldn't
refute the facts They just kept coming up
[SPEAKER_00]: with other excuses that I'm an asshole or
I'm a this or there's that or oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's an ISO standard Well an ISO standard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm a I'm a Sigma Sigma black belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, six Sigma black belt.
[SPEAKER_00]: You teach ISO I trained ISO in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what an ISO Certification is it's a
quality control certification for the
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacture of the equipment.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do with comparing that
thing to anything else Okay, you have
[SPEAKER_00]: labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the UL lab stamp on shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had my products go through UL labs.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what UL labs says?
[SPEAKER_00]: The UL labs takes whatever you say the
machine or the part will do whatever it is
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take this much heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll ask this long.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't wear this much It'll take this
kind of heat.
[SPEAKER_00]: It'll take this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whatever it is you say they test it and if
it does what you said it would you else
[SPEAKER_00]: now No problem, there's no comparison of
products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can't just say oh, well,
you know, this one's better because it has
[SPEAKER_00]: a stamp on it Well, maybe it is maybe it
isn't maybe it makes it safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe it makes it so everything they said
is true So if they take everything ice
[SPEAKER_00]: they said is true and I compare it to the
other stuff over there That's all true and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're both once better than the other
and I can choose right?
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it So anyway, it's just kind of
hilarious
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of what my friend said that's
the kind of way Sean said Colorado he kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of laughed he goes Well, you do what you
need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, uh, you know, send me your sign
up looking whatever I said, hey Sean,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know me I'll send you all the emails
I'll send you all the the Instagram
[SPEAKER_00]: bullshit that they sent me and you see who
said what and who did what?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay That's all I gotta say, you know me
man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I deal on facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't deal in bullshit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you go This is what I said,
please check these facts check the
[SPEAKER_00]: specifications check this company check
that company Is that being rooted
[SPEAKER_00]: obnoxious?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so I think it's like hey I'm
trying to prove a point that maybe you
[SPEAKER_00]: need to change your verbiage to say we're
one of The companies in the world that can
[SPEAKER_00]: make this That's me it's stupid but I knew
as well as you know, they wouldn't say
[SPEAKER_00]: that they wouldn't Wanted to believe
because they're in their little cult that
[SPEAKER_00]: if you name the water something else it
becomes something else No, it's alkaline
[SPEAKER_00]: water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's alkaline water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sorry, but you know that Kagan thinks
We call it Kagan and if we call it Kagan
[SPEAKER_00]: then that means it's special.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, but it's really Just alkaline water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but it's Kagan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, but it's just alkaline water
alkalinity you can get a lot of different
[SPEAKER_02]: ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I guess it's got to have some You
get 2.5 you have dad's salt to it or do
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to have some salt water in your
water?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it goes through an electroplating
and the electroplates then alter the pH of
[SPEAKER_00]: the water down to 2.5 But you need a lot
of salt in the water and it needs to be
[SPEAKER_00]: fairly cool to colder than that Actually,
but again on the other side when you go to
[SPEAKER_00]: the high side, you know If you're going
acid or if you're going, you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: salty so you can use them for different
things But you can you can be drinking up
[SPEAKER_00]: in the eight nines Right alkalinity
because an alkaline body cannot grow
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer Cancer cannot grow in an alkaline
environment period won't can't that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: fish don't have it At least ocean fish You
know an alkaline environment kills itself
[SPEAKER_00]: bottom line you should be drinking a
higher pH but then again for cleaning you
[SPEAKER_00]: want a lower pH Of course for your plants
you want something in the middle there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hey Tim Yeah, I get a lot of DMS asking me
about the pH and hash and they asked me if
[SPEAKER_03]: I've noticed hash and different pH's and
Talking with you
[SPEAKER_00]: First off you'd have to figure out how to
test the pH In the rosin or in the oil
[SPEAKER_00]: itself so that way you'd have to at least
get it melted and out of the trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: right and then You'd have to actually
decart it to get it to be the effect of
[SPEAKER_00]: when you're actually in taking it when
you're inhaling it Doing a nail or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to be decarbed at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where you need to take the test,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not if you water itself actually that
you're washing the material in Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: no, no, well when you're washing in the
water, oh the water you yeah, okay you
[SPEAKER_00]: wash water, excuse me wash water should be
somewhere in the neutrals as I would say
[SPEAKER_00]: and what you can do though is you See,
there's some tricks you can play with
[SPEAKER_00]: water If you over oxygenate water,
it can become an oxidizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: In other words, it'll eat biomaterial So
you want to eat out that microscopic
[SPEAKER_00]: biomaterial you have that everybody has
because it's almost impossible to wash
[SPEAKER_00]: away Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I've got a water that actually eats that
shit and takes it away and doesn't hurt
[SPEAKER_00]: the trichome There's different ways to do
that I've actually got a test running
[SPEAKER_00]: right now where we're just using oxygen
because I found that a lot of through the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing I was doing that I was able to
take away a lot of the the negative things
[SPEAKER_00]: of the arsenic suborons of whatever it may
be up to some of them leads and that are
[SPEAKER_00]: the toughest but I was able to to remove
them with just oxygen over oxygenated
[SPEAKER_00]: water You have to get up in the really
high percentages though You got to get up
[SPEAKER_00]: into 200% of normal and better,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's ways to do that that aren't that
expensive and then there's ways to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: are very expensive depending on your
volume period It's all a relative So
[SPEAKER_00]: that's why I offer that go to grow now
because it's actually an electronic air
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygenator water oxygenator It's not
really just like a bubbler.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, what it does is actually have two
plates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once again, they use electrostatic ions So
these plates are 25 millimeters or microns
[SPEAKER_00]: apart microns apart, excuse me And then
what that causes is it causes through the
[SPEAKER_00]: electrostatic action of the electricity
They actually split the molecule the H2O
[SPEAKER_00]: the H which is a small one It breaks off
easily and then it escapes through the top
[SPEAKER_00]: of the tank.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes out of the water The two oxygen
molecules are now small enough to then be
[SPEAKER_00]: absorbed into the water So that's where
you get a higher dissolved oxygen content
[SPEAKER_00]: in your water and that's something that
everybody should be testing and checking
[SPEAKER_00]: because If you're using a well actually in
the country, it can be very low You could
[SPEAKER_00]: have very little oxygen in the in the
actual water from a well where in the city
[SPEAKER_00]: they a lot of times pump or they use very
very Large alkaline systems like we're
[SPEAKER_00]: talking about here And when I'm talking
about that we're talking about plates that
[SPEAKER_00]: are the size of four by eight sheets of a
metal or a wood You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge and they do like 5 000 gallons a
minute kind of fucking pumping through
[SPEAKER_00]: them, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're just these giant plates and
what they're doing is once again,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're sending a they're changing it into
a hypochloric acid the water you actually
[SPEAKER_00]: Over pH it and you basically chlorinate
it, but you're not chlorinating over the
[SPEAKER_00]: salt You're calling it with hydrogen and
oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's hypochloric acid So then it's a
sterilizer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a cleaner.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can use to clean surfaces clean
yourself whatever Totally non-poisonous.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you got to get it way down.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got to be hypochloric to work
properly But you can do that and they use
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the sewage business for doing
sewage plants and that before it'll exit
[SPEAKER_00]: out to the ocean and shit They'll have one
of those giant machines like I said these
[SPEAKER_00]: plates the size of freaking four bay sheet
supply wood and they'll be running a
[SPEAKER_00]: Shitload of water through it from the from
the operation and they force it into that
[SPEAKER_00]: exit pipe And then it's kind of sterilize
the pipe and that last bit of the water
[SPEAKER_03]: that's going out So you're saying to the
pH to be neutral and it also needs to be
[SPEAKER_03]: oxygen oxygen I have oxygen in it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is where I say there's no books on
this That's why I've been doing this shit
[SPEAKER_00]: for a couple years now and I use ozone
when we get up into volumes and I used
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen because I found that oxygen over
using ozone And oxygen I found that I
[SPEAKER_00]: could just use the oxygen and get a
certain effect now I'm working on to see
[SPEAKER_00]: if we can make enough with these machines
to make it functional.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a reasonable price It doesn't cost
you an arm and a leg to get that right
[SPEAKER_00]: because that's the trouble with all this
like my small equipment for doing it
[SPEAKER_00]: Properly, I guess I'd say that way is a
starts at 20 grand and goes up Right and
[SPEAKER_00]: you and it pulls water.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for a 10,000 square foot indoor
Or doing a water remediation right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're working.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm working with all the different machine
makers on Remediating the waste water from
[SPEAKER_00]: from bubble hashing and returning the
water back and filtering out all the crap
[SPEAKER_00]: as well as the terpenes Some of the
companies want to recover the terpenes and
[SPEAKER_00]: like I've told them I don't want to I'm
not going there because then you've got to
[SPEAKER_00]: start using chemicals There's just no two
ways to do it out of water without using
[SPEAKER_00]: chemicals after it's in the water the
terpenes become liquid because they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: actually The water will go through the
cell wall of the terpene You know actually
[SPEAKER_00]: enter the trichome wall through the
terpene if you're not careful That's how
[SPEAKER_00]: you get that purple hash that people post
in like right well actually I you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I There's so many You know that the
purpling I mean back in doing this way too
[SPEAKER_00]: long But back in the day no one really
knew and then it made sense that in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fall they'd change color to attract
insects to pop And that's really where
[SPEAKER_00]: that gene comes from in the plant is a
change color So they get that red spectrum
[SPEAKER_00]: so that the different, you know bees and
different things see it more Because they
[SPEAKER_00]: they attracted to red specks, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they don't alter now that some of the
strains are that way to keep them,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, keeping bread basically to get
insects to come by and hopefully following
[SPEAKER_00]: But I see it if you get into the some of
the microscopic shots of trichomes you'll
[SPEAKER_00]: notice it a lot of times The terpenes are
actually changed the color the actual
[SPEAKER_00]: trichome itself the actual resin in the
trichome the stuff that we're really
[SPEAKER_00]: Dealing with more the sub inside the
shell, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have any color.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's clear as a bell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it'll be the trichome leafs You
know the daisy pattern on the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: track or turpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Excuse me will have turned purple and then
you'll notice it starts to go out because
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know French you agreed to I you
know, and I I think the same way it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: A human body, you know, we sweat poison
and pretty much the trichomes or someone
[SPEAKER_00]: like that The plant is putting off its
poison which is resin into that trichome
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, there's a few day window
there where it actually is It's ripest
[SPEAKER_00]: over the whole plant on an average and
catching that it's tough But everybody
[SPEAKER_00]: likes to really clear stuff now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everybody's picking it a little early
It seems to there's ways to play that game
[SPEAKER_00]: and a few of the big companies have been
doing it forever You know, they'll pull it
[SPEAKER_00]: 35 days that kind of shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're they're just going for you know
The clear the white the color And you know
[SPEAKER_00]: to each his own everybody's got their
process You know, I'm not gonna imagine
[SPEAKER_03]: they have a pretty good production 35 days
I mean, you know, it's like it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: anything else depends on every operations
different and that's why I like this one
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm gonna go out there and work with them
because you know you when you're Setting
[SPEAKER_00]: up something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was one of those were to be honest with
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was it was gonna be soil pretty much
until All the pieces and parts,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, he already had gotten halfway
there per se and when I looked at what he
[SPEAKER_00]: had I said look, you know, you've spent
You're gonna spend a small fortune here
[SPEAKER_00]: and what you're doing and I know you've
already done half of that And you're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: make this a sterile environment and then
you're gonna bring dirt in and we're gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: have to allow bugs To do certain things
right because they're gonna be there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can't kill them off and have a living
soil, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't work that way So then you've
got to put in control animals and so forth
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've got to play the game with
keeping them eating the food on the Cover
[SPEAKER_00]: crop you got going and that kind of stuff
and and play the game with them,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's that's a complicated
operation to explain to somebody and have
[SPEAKER_00]: somebody just start new at the 20,000 foot
square, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean that's some dirt and that's some
property.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: The simple operation for somebody who
doesn't has never grown weed Is to grow
[SPEAKER_00]: hydroponics because it's more controllable
plus the fact I'm bringing in all tissue
[SPEAKER_00]: culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's I've got a dog's doing all the
tissue culture for us a boom everything
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're exact replicas They'll go the
same.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know see green perfect the
same height same Width same everything in
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that makes it much easier to grow
inside too And especially hydroponics so
[SPEAKER_00]: we can roll them quicker.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you say, I'm hoping to do it,
you know 45 days or so I'd like to hit 45
[SPEAKER_00]: 50 days and roll and you know do it like
that We've got a freezer already bought
[SPEAKER_00]: and going down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything will go crowd-trimmed Will
be trimmed right well box trimmed and then
[SPEAKER_00]: put right in the freezer And then after it
does 24 hours in the freezer At minus 20
[SPEAKER_00]: then it starts to go to the freeze-dryer
and we'll be able to do roughly 30 pounds
[SPEAKER_00]: of finished dry per run 20 to 30 somewhere
in that range Per run and that's every
[SPEAKER_00]: less than 24 hours roughly and then I'll
have a 24 hour to a 48 hour combination
[SPEAKER_00]: time Before we'll be able to send it to
the distributor for packaging But we'll
[SPEAKER_00]: basically from start from harvest To
finish will be a week.
[SPEAKER_03]: I Need to learn to get on that level and I
don't mean for myself man.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to get there.
[SPEAKER_03]: I feel like We got like the new generation
and the now generation like the incoming
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you guys still using buckets and
canoe paddles right like I was 40 years
[SPEAKER_03]: ago And this is all I'm just a social
small minnow, you know This is a thing and
[SPEAKER_00]: I know there was no insult there at all
I've been saying this Frank will tell you
[SPEAKER_00]: this I've been saying this look man.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 20 20 you guys you kids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Come on Now you I know you know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, you got all these electronic
fucking things You guys can beat the fuck
[SPEAKER_00]: out of me and those games on TV and shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't play that my thumbs don't Do that
crap, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But you guys know all this computer shit,
but I don't see any computer I see a canoe
[SPEAKER_00]: paddle and a trash can Right, okay,
come on man, come on I Mean, you know and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the thing is is it does work But then
I look at the equipment that's being made
[SPEAKER_00]: and people are you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: All the everybody's trying to understand
how they can manipulate the weed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ice and water and not hurt the plant Well,
how about how about I answer that simple
[SPEAKER_00]: question you can't It will injure the
plant material How's that it will you if
[SPEAKER_00]: you've got ice in with plant material?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna run into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're gonna smash together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna cut stuff off on a sharp edge
It's gonna rub the things together or get
[SPEAKER_00]: squeezed between and chlorophyll is not a
tough material So, you know and yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: you're getting it cold So it gets tougher
as it gets cold and all that fun stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you're still gonna have all that that
micro biomass, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just rub off stuff So you got to
learn how to save it out and filter it out
[SPEAKER_00]: where that's where changing the water And
making it an oxidizer or using different
[SPEAKER_00]: things, you know Alkaline whatever
oxygenation whatever it may be and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: just depending on the volume again of your
operation is which one would fit for you
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they say at a certain level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean for the machine people I'm talking
with all them, you know that damage debt
[SPEAKER_00]: the unit to go on to their machine is
gonna start at 20,000 Okay, it probably
[SPEAKER_00]: will end up somewhere between there and 30
right and that's gonna be the add-on to
[SPEAKER_00]: that Hashitron machine that ice machine,
whatever it is that Whistler deck whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: it may be Because these people are
knocking out, you know, someone doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: thousand gallons of wastewater day Right
and that he's back east.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can't put it down the rain They won't
let them because after about 24 hours that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit because the turphees are mixed into
the water The bacteria is just love that
[SPEAKER_00]: shit and it starts to reek and stink It
just starts to smell if you keep it around
[SPEAKER_00]: if you don't wash it down a drain or get
rid of it somewhere You leave it around
[SPEAKER_00]: for a day to two days.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll guarantee you're gonna start smelling
it Water the garden with it you think
[SPEAKER_00]: well, no that the trouble Is is the
turphees have washed off and all the dirt
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it was on the plant is in that
water and then there's trichomes too
[SPEAKER_00]: because you know, it's the bottom end and
the top end whatever they flush so what
[SPEAKER_00]: they're doing is they're putting a
thousand gallons a day in a tank in the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground and then they had a waste company
come in and There's 75 grand a year to
[SPEAKER_00]: haul away the wastewater Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So now they can buy a water treatment
machine for 50 grand turn all that water
[SPEAKER_00]: back into water They can use and the waste
they can haul to the dump themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not hazardous anymore Because
I can take arsenic two and make it arsenic
[SPEAKER_03]: three different things like that See I
wasn't I wasn't insulted at all.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're facts for facts Like I'm literally
just starting this and you clearly have
[SPEAKER_00]: the experience and I want to learn that I
mean I've been doing this a long time and
[SPEAKER_00]: like, you know bird says this class I used
to say in my classes when I teach to I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't I'm not Smarter than anybody in the
room.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just work harder at it Do you have
anyone like under you that is likely
[SPEAKER_03]: you're training to be like you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, no.

[SPEAKER_00]: stuff and I always try and find that how
can we do it better?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we make this simpler?
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we make the process better,
you know and You know, it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: hand-trimming weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell everybody in the world
hand-trimming.
[SPEAKER_00]: We is the best way to trim As long as you
only got ten pounds Okay, but if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna do 90,000 pounds, how are you gonna
do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many trimmers you're gonna bring in
Sustainable yeah, you can't it's it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: scalable as we call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't Increase that business.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't make it go from five employees
To a hundred employees to a thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: employees to five thousand employees I
guarantee you something's gonna start
[SPEAKER_00]: killing people It's too many humans it's
just too many humans in the loop the more
[SPEAKER_00]: ways you can get humans out of the loop in
Production the better to a point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, a lot of times and and that's where
in bubble hashing I just kind of laugh
[SPEAKER_00]: because It you know you get in to use in
trash cans Well now you got to have two
[SPEAKER_00]: burly guys to haul that shit Well now of
course if you're legal, oh boy,
[SPEAKER_00]: you gotta worry about where it's comped
the guy hurt his back You got the right
[SPEAKER_00]: leverage is the way too much is this that
that is the distance between here and
[SPEAKER_00]: there right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's the floor non slip,
you know I mean it it becomes and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: right to tell people you got to understand
these rules aren't gonna get better
[SPEAKER_00]: They're getting worse and they will be
getting worse and they don't want you a
[SPEAKER_00]: little guy to make it period Okay,
keep pushing for the medical you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: keep pushing for the medical permitting to
be Stay there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be actually increased and prop
64 in my opinion needs to be thrown out
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's me, you know because it never
was with they they turned it over to every
[SPEAKER_00]: thief them Every city and county to charge
their own little thief them taxes and make
[SPEAKER_00]: their own rules like they always do And
what have they all done look around?
[SPEAKER_00]: right, you know as it
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to see this because I think there's
these super secret sessions and all that I
[SPEAKER_00]: I totally believe in them but in the same
side there what really bothers me because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's the medical, you know, that's the
215, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the one right and You go there and
nothing there is tested Generally,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you go to the dispensary where it's
all tested, but it's not medical Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you got medical dispensaries too,
I'm sorry, but then you go to the
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational one and oh, yeah Anyone can
come in here and buy anything and oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, and this is tested stuff So it's
like wait a minute We started off trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to help medical patients because we had
cancer and AIDS going on wild and
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody thought Yeah, this works that
yeah, let them be able to eat after
[SPEAKER_00]: chemotherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good Okay, they're dying.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, god damn it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let them eat And then what did that morph
into where are we now?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right, did it get better for the
patients?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't see these companies that are
making millions of dollars and millions of
[SPEAKER_00]: dozens I don't see them going to cancer
words and giving free free whatever that
[SPEAKER_00]: patient wants You want animals you want
smoke you want constant?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want?

and help them.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can't be that bad now Hopefully the
more act does allow for science studies
[SPEAKER_00]: and all that but once you throw the
banking in and allow it It's gonna get
[SPEAKER_00]: really wild and hopefully the people that
have got their foot in the door and that
[SPEAKER_00]: can keep their head above water is all I
can say because I just don't see it
[SPEAKER_00]: becoming easier and I know you're doing
great and I'm not putting down anyone and
[SPEAKER_00]: saying hey Start and do whatever you think
you need to do.
