[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Joe, and I'm with Sisu Extracts
out of Eureka.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a large toll processing facility
for biomass, trim, smalls.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also move bulk flour from Humboldt
County down to the rest of the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: I work in sales and procurement.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make sure that we've got enough material
to feed the machines on a regular basis,
[SPEAKER_01]: as well as getting the oil out to the
cities and bringing that money ultimately
[SPEAKER_01]: back to my farmers, like Ms. Lindsey here,
and just keep everything moving.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi, I'm Vanessa.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm with Left Coast Ventures.
[SPEAKER_02]: It recently merged with Soldistro.
[SPEAKER_02]: We manufacture, distribute, and sell into
all retail locations across California,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm responsible for the Northern
California sales team.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Lindsey, and my husband Ryan and I own
Aloha Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: He and I have been growing cannabis
together since 1998.
[SPEAKER_00]: We moved from the Midwest, and we've been
living in Northern California since 2002.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have our brand Aloha Humboldt,
and we do whole-flour pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also do jarred eights, and we're moving
into having half ounces as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell our biomass to Joe here,
and it's been a wonderful relationship.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any relationships with other
manufacturers?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, we do collaborations with Peak,
and we're also working with the Humboldt
[SPEAKER_00]: Turp Council.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have upcoming collaborations.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've actually been doing collaborations
with Peak since 2016.
[SPEAKER_03]: Why don't you guys talk a little bit about
the relationship between cultivator,
[SPEAKER_03]: manufacturer, and distributor in today's
California market?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it would just make sense to go
along with the timeline.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you just want to talk about right up to
what you produce, and then I'll jump in
[SPEAKER_01]: right up to what we produce, and then we
can describe the handoff to the rest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why don't you lead off, Lindsey?
[SPEAKER_00]: My year starts in January.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a farmer, we start popping seeds in
January, and we also keep mothers of
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics that we've had for years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a bubblegum strain that we've had
since 1998 growing together.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an heirloom strain from the Midwest,
and we still grow it on our farm today.
[SPEAKER_00]: Farming is an extensive process.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's vetting new strains, figuring out
what works on our farm, and then
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately giving love and attention to
all of our plants all season long.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have greenhouses and full season,
so we do two runs in our greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_00]: We farm with lunar cycles, so we harvest
our first depth in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year, it was really nice because we
harvested under a lunar eclipse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had some extra help, and we were able
to pull down our greenhouses all under the
[SPEAKER_00]: full moon at night, so we keep the
temperature under 70 degrees while we're
[SPEAKER_00]: harvesting to maintain the highest terpene
profile that we can.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a really long season, and once that
happens, we harvest, and we process,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we replant, and then we're kind of
gliding then in July.
[SPEAKER_00]: At that point is when we're doing
processing of our pre-rolls, and we're
[SPEAKER_00]: jarring eights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ryan and I have done most of that process
ourselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we'll have other pieces to the
puzzle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we have trim, and we have the smaller
buds, and that's where we can come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: do collaborations with other companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of our packaged branded goods are sold
through Up North Humboldt Distribution,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they've been really great to us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our pre-rolls are manufactured at True
Humboldt, and then we work with a couple
[SPEAKER_00]: of different extractors and SISU has been
really wonderful for us this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You really have to have big partnerships
because you can't do it all yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have a distributor to move
your product to market because farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: can't do direct to consumer sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Having relationships with other people
that you can trust that have transparency
[SPEAKER_00]: and integrity means a lot to the farmer,
and it's sometimes hard to find.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where her world would end with trim,
it'll then come into my world in that same
[SPEAKER_01]: form.
[SPEAKER_01]: We basically work for farmers and
distributors of finished goods,
[SPEAKER_01]: like both of these ladies.
[SPEAKER_01]: When her trim enters our system,
we go through a pesticide testing process.
[SPEAKER_01]: We split every load up into 50 pound
batches and do micro-extraction using
[SPEAKER_01]: acetone.
[SPEAKER_01]: This allows us to see the concentration of
pesticides at a crude oil level,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is about half of that what it would
be in a finished concentrate product.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the way we pre-screen materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: I can tell you after multiple rounds of
testing, the lady here produces absolutely
[SPEAKER_01]: fantastic non-detect material,
which is rare.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even in Humboldt County, it's rare to hit
full non-detect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: The standards are incredibly high.
[SPEAKER_01]: We search for material like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It then goes into our extraction process,
which involves cryogenic ethanol
[SPEAKER_01]: extraction, falling film evaporation,
degassing, devolatilizing, and deterping
[SPEAKER_01]: of the oils.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we go into thin-film distillation to
produce a finished distillate oil,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is what you commonly see in vapor
cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used to manufacture edibles and a
variety of other things.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'd say the lion's share really goes
out in vapor carts like yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: From there, we'll take the finished
distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll recombine with cannabis-derived
terpenes to produce a formulated oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then companies like Sol Distro here,
who manufacture finished brands,
[SPEAKER_01]: will purchase from us in bulk.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also handle transportation from the
farm to us, from us to the buyer,
[SPEAKER_01]: and then we bring the money back to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of the money made from her oil,
we return 70% of that total back to the
[SPEAKER_01]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you produce your distillate according
to your client's specifications?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that how it is?
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you put ellenies, when you put
turps back?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like these guys, in fact, very much with
these guys, we sent out 12 sample
[SPEAKER_01]: formulations from three different
cultivars and allowed them to select from
[SPEAKER_01]: those and then went and chased down the
rest of the source material to generate
[SPEAKER_01]: that terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we do the actual formulation and
blending in-house.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way, we have a completely finished
oil ready to go so that when they approach
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing, they can load in their
feedstock, load in their hardware,
[SPEAKER_01]: and just go right to production
immediately and not have to worry about
[SPEAKER_01]: sourcing or selection of all those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: We kind of remove that burden to let her
focus on farming and let these guys focus
[SPEAKER_01]: on selling.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because those are both much more involved
jobs than our position.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of a mechanical, industrial
approach to most processes.
[SPEAKER_03]: With you again, I have another follow-up
question.
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to working with small,
sustainable farms, you also work with,
[SPEAKER_03]: like, all different farms, do you not?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like different sizes and different types?
[SPEAKER_01]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're looking for a variety of materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, all materials with over 3 to 5%
THC work well for us, as long as they're
[SPEAKER_01]: compliant with state regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: The majority of the farms I'm dealing with
by number definitely come from Humboldt,
[SPEAKER_01]: Mendocino, and Trinity counties.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been through around 200 farms,
and around 150 of them are from that
[SPEAKER_01]: three-county region.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really home base for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do, however, source from outside the
region as well, because also the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation in Humboldt is seasonally
limited.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because of the mountainous climate and
because of actually having a real winter,
[SPEAKER_01]: unlike some other parts of California that
stay relatively warm, there are lags in
[SPEAKER_01]: production that cause us to go source in
warmer climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do work with farmers throughout the
entire state.
[SPEAKER_03]: So do you see biomass of varying quality
and with different things in it?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk about that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, and I think she's a great
example of this, the farther you are from
[SPEAKER_01]: humans, the better your chances are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Humans have created quite a few problems,
and the regulations facing us from a
[SPEAKER_01]: pesticide standpoint are the toughest that
you can imagine in anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cannabis on the shelves today is cleaner
than any food you can go buy at any lovely
[SPEAKER_01]: grocery store.
[SPEAKER_01]: The testing is absolutely incredible.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've spent close to $20,000 in testing on
her farm alone in the past one or two
[SPEAKER_01]: seasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's incredibly intensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these guys have to work an enormous
number of creative ways to get their
[SPEAKER_01]: product complete.
[SPEAKER_01]: And finished without using something
somewhere along the line that's
[SPEAKER_01]: inadvertently contaminated, whether it be
a water stream coming from a spring or the
[SPEAKER_01]: neighbor's spring.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, Humboldt County, we find much
more clean material.
[SPEAKER_01]: And down south, we find significantly more
material, but higher contamination rates
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're surrounded by industrial
agriculture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have to kind of ask this question
because it's where we're at now in the
[SPEAKER_03]: larger vape market now.
[SPEAKER_03]: With the deaths and what's happening out
there in the world, will that impact your
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis world?
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it something that you think about and
will it have any impact, marketing wise,
[SPEAKER_03]: in any way?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, a very timely question.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're definitely very concerned.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think especially if you got into
cannabis, you probably got in.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of people did when it was medicinal.
[SPEAKER_02]: The thought is protecting people,
helping people, actually, the opposite of
[SPEAKER_02]: getting sick, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're not concerned about the marketing
just because it doesn't affect our
[SPEAKER_02]: products, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Clean products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it is very sad and we want to reassure
people that.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to speak to that, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I think that a lot of farmers up in
Humboldt County have for the longest time
[SPEAKER_00]: been using these practices that give you
clean tests before they were required.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think for us, when there is all these
changes and new testing and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: there is always the hiccups with needing
new tests and maybe relabeling and things
[SPEAKER_00]: like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is never a concern that our
flower or trim would fail because we've
[SPEAKER_00]: always used practices that are
environmentally conscious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that it'll affect the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could affect the industry in a really
positive way, because when you look at the
[SPEAKER_00]: testing and the stringent testing that's
done, you're, like Joe said, finding the
[SPEAKER_00]: cleanest products in the legal market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be much more concerned to go and
get, you know, your cartridge from your
[SPEAKER_00]: friend down the street because he's not
going through the heavy metal testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't know what kind of material is
actually in what you're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's scary to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're doing it for a health reason
or for just relaxation, nobody wants to
[SPEAKER_00]: have lead in their distillate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty important.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you know, cartridges have been on
the market for years and years and years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is only happening now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think there's really clear
correlative evidence that shows that there
[SPEAKER_01]: is an agent being used in the black market
as a cutting agent that turns one jar of
[SPEAKER_01]: high-potency distillate into two jars of
medium-potency distillate, allowing you to
[SPEAKER_01]: make twice as much money.
[SPEAKER_01]: Its primary function is to look stable and
firm at room temperature because that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: mark of high-potency distillate.
[SPEAKER_01]: The opposite is true with everything that
we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need terpenes with very low viscosity
so we can get a good flow rate so the
[SPEAKER_01]: cartridges can function right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can get a great vapor rate and
vapor production rate given the aperture
[SPEAKER_01]: size in the cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this material is not present in any
licensed or permitted facility at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the exact opposite of the effect that
we're trying to generate.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really used to rip people off.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the reasonable responses that we could
see to this from a regulatory perspective
[SPEAKER_01]: are significant enforcement on cartridge
manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_01]: The heavy metal contamination is a real
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's an issue with that across the
board.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it is difficult to find clean
materials and the testing has to be
[SPEAKER_01]: rigorous to make so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regulations, if anybody wants to add
vitamin E acetate to the testing
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements, you absolutely can.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll spend the money to do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not in anything on shelves.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is really occurring in the black
market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the most reasonable response that
we could see would be governmental
[SPEAKER_01]: measures created to help clamp down on
production and transport of this bad
[SPEAKER_01]: material and really allowing cannabis
legalization into multiple states.
[SPEAKER_01]: The black market will continue to exist
until there's higher quality, better
[SPEAKER_01]: priced product available everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the best way we can get there is
allowing legal companies like these folks
[SPEAKER_01]: who put a lot of time and effort and
enormous amounts of testing into producing
[SPEAKER_01]: something that meets all of these
regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: You just have to let them go do their
jobs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if these guys are making it for you,
you have nothing to worry about because we
[SPEAKER_01]: know when we put cannabis in people,
nobody dies.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's really folks out there in the
black market who are responsible for this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of along these lines,
but I know a few months ago there was a
[SPEAKER_03]: real lack of biomass available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there going to be enough for your needs
of clean biomass?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the whole game in extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Lots of people have built really,
really big extraction facilities.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I refer to them as big guns,
but they're all out of bullets.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people are running out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think there's also very specific issues
coming online with metric.
[SPEAKER_01]: Metric is online and big operators are
using it now.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had a 30 day window in which
pre-existing materials could be brought
[SPEAKER_01]: in.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now that that wall is completely
closed down, they can only operate with
[SPEAKER_01]: fully metric compliant farms and fully
metric compliant distros with fully metric
[SPEAKER_01]: compliant materials.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so because of that, a lot of the
loopholes are really kind of ending.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why are you saying that there could be
an issue with availability?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a significant issue now.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not impacting us as hard because we
have a really spectacular farmer network
[SPEAKER_01]: throughout the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our tradition of paying farmers more has
gotten us more farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we've built our business to be 100%
metric compliant from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because of that, when this change is
occurring, it's not negatively impacting
[SPEAKER_01]: us in the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I don't think that's the major
sentiment in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think a lot of people struggle with
finding consistent supply of both flour
[SPEAKER_01]: and trim across the board.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everything is in scarcity right now and
harvest is right around the corner.
[SPEAKER_03]: OK, this is really, really super
interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I have a question for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because SolDistro is really a unique
company.
[SPEAKER_03]: You started as manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You had products on quality products and
brands on the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you were distributing yourself
and then you opened up redistribution.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's kind of like the retailer has
their own products, does their own growth,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're also selling other products.
[SPEAKER_03]: How do you manage distributing your
products?
[SPEAKER_03]: Your own products and other people's
products?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we're really, really careful how
we curate our portfolio.
[SPEAKER_02]: We want all the brands to actually feel
like family.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not like 3PL versus in-house
brands at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: Most of the brands we manufacture and some
of our in-house brands, most we do
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacture and distribute.
[SPEAKER_02]: The few that we just distribute,
we treat them the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: We love them just the same.
[SPEAKER_02]: We really curate the portfolio so there
would be something for everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: And no one would overlap.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no fighting between the brands
for shelf space at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: We believe there's room for everyone in
the industry, but we want to make sure we
[SPEAKER_02]: highlight the best brands, the cleanest
brands, for sure, as well as sustainable
[SPEAKER_02]: when it comes to other ingredients,
trying to make sure they're organic,
[SPEAKER_02]: healthy, and more wellness, honestly.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we know,
[SPEAKER_03]: there are far more brands than there are
shops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that shelf space and forcing people to
pay for shelf space, that all these
[SPEAKER_03]: dynamics are going on right now,
it's extremely competitive, cut growth,
[SPEAKER_03]: all of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look, we don't have a retailer here,
but this is the reality, that there's tons
[SPEAKER_03]: of brands and we've been hearing this time
and again.
[SPEAKER_03]: So how are you managing the reality of
California in this state?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's definitely highly saturated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And honestly, people will tell you
cartridges the most are some of the most
[SPEAKER_02]: saturated part of the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you go into a new buyer meeting,
spoiler, they probably don't want to hear
[SPEAKER_02]: about your cartridges.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, one of the things we do is
partner with good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of our big brands and the brands that
we work with closely together is Marley
[SPEAKER_02]: Natural.
[SPEAKER_02]: And part of that brand, it started by the
Marley family with us.
[SPEAKER_02]: So part of it is giving back to the
community, working with smaller farms,
[SPEAKER_02]: farms that were in the black market,
getting into the legal market,
[SPEAKER_02]: helping them through, mostly in the
Emerald Triangle.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is why we get along so well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Marley Natural is all cannabis drive
charts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's really just the highest quality as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, marketing has something to do
with it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But honestly, you have to be real,
transparent, good people.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think people, especially in Northern
California, I can speak for mostly,
[SPEAKER_02]: can see if you're authentic or not.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're trying to bring healthy,
amazing products to the market,
[SPEAKER_02]: support the community that has been around
us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't currently.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll do what needs to be done.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, we got to stay competitive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that hasn't been an issue I've come
across that much recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are your feelings about this?
[SPEAKER_03]: About, listen, it's your product.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your hard work.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's your brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's only so much space on the shelves.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's only so much space in our
brains for brands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I've seen this so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what are your feelings just about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that there's going to be more
consumer education behind the holistic
[SPEAKER_00]: approach of FLOWER and also of working
with people that use cannabis-derived
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes and doing things in a really
environmentally and community-conscious
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that people will start to
value more where it's coming from.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there are a lot of brands out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you are authentic, you don't have
to be in every store.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in the right ones that align
with your brand, then I think that you can
[SPEAKER_00]: reach the consumer that will value the
small farms and sun-grown flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the point I was getting to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've spoken to other cultivators who are
real, serious, small-scale, generational,
[SPEAKER_03]: organic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that insistence that the retailer
represents their product the right way is
[SPEAKER_03]: really important to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think budtender education is really
important, too, because they're the door
[SPEAKER_00]: way to the consumer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if these budtenders can be more
educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I always like to bring up the analogy
of wine and beer and alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And right now, I feel like the market is
really ruled by the THC percentages and
[SPEAKER_00]: milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everything is all about, is it higher?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it the cheapest for the most THC
milligrams?
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I like to think, well,
I don't like to go to the store and buy
[SPEAKER_00]: moonshine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And drink moonshine because it's the
highest.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that if you can have a more
educated approach to your products and
[SPEAKER_00]: know where it's coming from, know that
there's value in what's going in,
[SPEAKER_00]: the intention that's going into your
product, and who's growing it,
[SPEAKER_00]: and what their intentions are.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think a lot of big companies have a lot
of just finance-based intention.
[SPEAKER_00]: And small farmers don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we just had this conversation,
and it came down to the difference between
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis as a commodity and as a craft
product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of us are existing simultaneously
in both.
[SPEAKER_01]: She is producing craft flour and then
producing a byproduct, commodity,
[SPEAKER_01]: of trim.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then selling it to me, which I further
commoditized by refining into an oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then I retrieve a craft product of
terpenes for the blending.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they formulate that into the
flavors and representations they would
[SPEAKER_01]: want to attach to one of their brand
lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they craft the finished product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it produced a craft product
that has gone through.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quality-focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not like this quantified THC,
higher THC, lower cost.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a quality that's really what we're
focused on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we've seen too, again,
our product lines, like 16 different
[SPEAKER_02]: brands, over 100 skews.
[SPEAKER_02]: But what we've seen specifically in our
flour, our Marley Natural brand,
[SPEAKER_02]: is that we only work with small local
farms that are just sustainably practiced
[SPEAKER_02]: organic in all other senses of the word.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that the farmers, and you can
probably speak better to this,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it seems like the farmers are more
worried.
[SPEAKER_02]: They know their quality, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's more worried about if a big company
is gonna come and rip them off and try to
[SPEAKER_02]: undercut them, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so the goal is never to do that,
to support the people that are giving you
[SPEAKER_02]: this quality product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Obviously, a lot of them have been in the
community a lot longer than some of the
[SPEAKER_02]: newer companies.
[SPEAKER_02]: And making sure we all rise together.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's interesting because I hear
the same thing from all three of you that
[SPEAKER_03]: as important as the final product is the
process.
[SPEAKER_03]: How you get there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you speak to that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: My husband and I knew that going into the
legal market was going to be incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt County has the most astringent
process to be compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We removed four greenhouses, fixed a rock
slide.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we started with 43,000 square
feet and we had to scale back to 28.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's because we needed to fix things
that had been done on our property
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-legalization that it was not
environmentally sound.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've taken all of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you going to be able to make up that
square footage in any way?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the efficiency or anything?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our farm is grandfathered in under the
legacy, you know, pre-2.0.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are not able to expand.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the middle of nowhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on the top of a mountain in the
middle of the forest.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're very far removed from any
city.
[SPEAKER_03]: How long did it take to get to your place?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I drove down today and it took about
six and a half hours.
[SPEAKER_03]: The labs love to come visit you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, we do.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a bad way to end your day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You lose health service.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everything's beautiful.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the best aspects of our jobs
is all of these folks out there,
[SPEAKER_01]: especially folks who are headed into the
compliant world and have the capacity to
[SPEAKER_01]: both understand, acknowledge and create
everything required to move through
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: They also tend to create really beautiful,
wonderful places and solid communities
[SPEAKER_01]: around them.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of the best parts about my job.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't get to do it as much as I used to,
but I used to every day be in the field
[SPEAKER_01]: driving to farms like hers, honking my
horn at gates, offering people cold
[SPEAKER_01]: drinks, doing everything we could to get
these guys' attention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when they let you through the
gates, you come into these beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: forested hills that just break with
breathtaking views, sometimes all the way
[SPEAKER_01]: to the ocean, or giant redwoods,
horses and cattle and like great dogs
[SPEAKER_01]: everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really heaven up there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the weather's mostly nice,
especially during the working season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's really good people around.
[SPEAKER_01]: I refer to them as high quality kooks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody's weird, but everybody's
capable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be a little crazy.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be a farmer because they work
really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would say also a really, really hard
worker, and not just in the dirt,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like also now with the paperwork and
metric and regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if you're coming from Black Market,
you work your ass off to do it,
[SPEAKER_02]: and you should be rewarded for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You should definitely be part of the
party.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I went into an independent wine
shop a couple of months ago.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was not here, actually.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was visiting.
[SPEAKER_03]: My brother was in Florida.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I walked in and they had cases of wine
and pieces of paper telling the story and
[SPEAKER_03]: the history of the wine, of the winemaker.
[SPEAKER_03]: And immediately I thought, this is exactly
how it should be when you walk into a
[SPEAKER_03]: business.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a connection to what you're
doing and what you're consuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And especially when it's something like
cannabis, you know, is giving you a
[SPEAKER_00]: lifted, you know, different experience and
perceptive change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really good to connect with the
origin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think anything you're putting in your
body, too, or on your body, you're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be wanting to make sure it's high
quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: And hearing where it came from always
helps with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it circles back to education,
though, what you were saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really hard.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, if you can imagine, part of the
education of Budtenders is on us,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like one of my favorite parts of the
job, honestly.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they're the ones really on the front
lines telling the end user what they're
[SPEAKER_02]: getting.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they only have, like, a couple minutes
at a register.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's hard to get the right info across.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also, does anyone actually want to
read, like, paragraphs about all of our
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, I wish they did, but it doesn't seem
to be the case, unfortunately.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to, marketing-wise,
figure out the snippets that try to buzz
[SPEAKER_02]: words, like, points to get across.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, this is the challenge.
[SPEAKER_03]: But, crazily, I keep thinking about it all
the time because it's a challenge that has
[SPEAKER_03]: to be met one way or another.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because the large players, the big
commodity producers, are there and they're
[SPEAKER_03]: not going away.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I know this because I cover them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have their story.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have the resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's a lot of different qualities
of each.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can say a lot of things, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We know this from marketing, going to the
grocery store.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can say naturally, you can say,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's, if you care, like researching,
making sure you're going with brands and
[SPEAKER_02]: products that you can trust, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think then you also have to try to
do, if you ever try to do, we have a lot
[SPEAKER_02]: of unique products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Other people don't have Cush Queen,
like, psychoactive body wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: No one has that or Delta 8 rich cartridge.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a different THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: I would say that for each one of you,
you have a secret army out there at your
[SPEAKER_03]: disposal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that is real traditional cannabis
consumers who care about what's in it and
[SPEAKER_03]: care about the differences.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're your secret weapon.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're reviled right now by everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm one of them and I feel that.
[SPEAKER_03]: But they are the secret weapon because
they are there to also, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: send this message and they believe it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not marketing for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what's really exciting about an
opportunity where I get to work in a
[SPEAKER_01]: system like this because some of the
products we feel like Marley Naturals for
[SPEAKER_01]: these guys are interested in carrying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we're not carrying a full paragraph
because you're right.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a lot to read there.
[SPEAKER_01]: They do help carry the farm name and the
genetic originators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we have some really exciting stuff
coming down the pipe with some really
[SPEAKER_01]: original local Humboldt County genetics
blueberry muffin done by some local guys
[SPEAKER_01]: out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's lovely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so when we can share that information,
like Aloha here is one of the best branded
[SPEAKER_01]: farms in Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's got beautiful packaging.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's everywhere all the time.
[SPEAKER_01]: The colors are great.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's professional.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really nice is when you see her
name on her package and then you see her
[SPEAKER_01]: name on another brand's package and then
you see these brands crossing places,
[SPEAKER_01]: you begin to become familiar with this
these farms and these entities,
[SPEAKER_01]: both as cartridge manufacturers and
extraction houses and farmers to support
[SPEAKER_00]: each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the way we support each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when these old school folks have
seen her name in two or three places and
[SPEAKER_01]: their name in two or three places and our
name in two or three places and all those
[SPEAKER_01]: things were good, we can kind of have a
rising to the top of your best players out
[SPEAKER_01]: there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it is important to tell the story in a
brief way that connects the whole supply
[SPEAKER_01]: chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the bummer is when you bought weed
a long time ago, you just got weed from
[SPEAKER_01]: Brad, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You couldn't you didn't even know the
strain you were getting with necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: true.
[SPEAKER_02]: But today they sprayed on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly how old it was mold in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You didn't even know what to look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so today we can know that I want to
smoke weed that has grown on a beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: mountaintop around bears and eagles and
then is extracted at a tier one lab using
[SPEAKER_01]: the best, you know, GNP processes
available and then assembled at a final
[SPEAKER_01]: place supporting brands and families who
are going to stand and be in the industry
[SPEAKER_01]: for a long time and have been here for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you have that complete story
and if you consistently make choices in
[SPEAKER_01]: that realm, you'll consistently contribute
to people like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what I think those folks who've
been around for a minute would want to
[SPEAKER_01]: see.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is important to do that education
because there are a lot of big companies,
[SPEAKER_00]: the big guns out there that are trying to
use and tell the farmer, the small
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer's story in perpetuity with with
working with them or without working with
[SPEAKER_00]: them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's a lot to be said
with doing the education and finding out,
[SPEAKER_00]: like, are they actually still working with
that farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are those people still involved with the
collaboration instead of just seeing that
[SPEAKER_00]: these bigger places claim natural or or
whatever like you do see in the grocery
[SPEAKER_00]: store and and seeing if it actually
trickles back to the farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like authentic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, authentic.
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: This has been a wonderful conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'd like to close it by you guys
talking about what you want to get out of
[SPEAKER_03]: this event, but also what the next year
looks like for you in terms of what your
[SPEAKER_03]: expectations and your aspirations are for
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so we have a lot of exciting things
going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have always loved to do food and wine
pairings.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there is a whole other
aspect to cannabis for these new newly
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of curious, you know, baby boomers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people that are, you know,
maybe not used to smoking because it
[SPEAKER_00]: always came with that paranoia of it being
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now they can come and check it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they don't want to have something
that's just going to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: be so strong that they feel uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that there's a lot of ways to
educate through events where you get
[SPEAKER_00]: together and talk to people like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were involved with a high dining event
at Joshua Tree last September on the full
[SPEAKER_00]: moon, and they paired our blue berry
cookies with a rose and a Moroccan dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was a really, really amazing
experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: The dank Duchess was there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had, you know, a bunch of other great
educators, roaming educators, they say.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get to come and have the wonderful
curated meal, you know, have like a
[SPEAKER_00]: welcome CBD spritzer and then have the
wine paired dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're doing more of that with our
dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's it goes well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that one only had five milligrams in
the whole dinner.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked because the trend is to go away
from a few dinners.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, if you want to, you know,
move or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, yeah, because they got a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's so strong, especially if you're
not used to consuming and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: edibles are just can be so, so strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was very light and it was a very
small group so that the host could really
[SPEAKER_00]: check in with everyone.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I've been working with this woman
named Kara and she does Food Flower
[SPEAKER_00]: Future.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done an event down in Venice Beach
and then also in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she does pairing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not infused and she just pairs the
cannabis with the course.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're doing an event with her on
October 5th down in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we're also doing an event with
the Herb Sommelier, Jamie Evans.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she does the pairings with the wine
and three course meal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're actually going to be
pairing three of our strains with a course
[SPEAKER_00]: dinner.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, right now we've been on our farm for
about four years, growing outdoor for much
[SPEAKER_00]: longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But every farm is so different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're at twenty six hundred feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we've been really trying to find
what works on our farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've done quite a few more strains
than we normally would.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're doing white tahoe cookies,
which we really it loves, loves where
[SPEAKER_00]: we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also did some forbidden fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've done golden lemons and we're doing
some more blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's going to be paired with with
three different courses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And ultimately, it just gives people the
chance to kind of delve into the terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: side of cannabis, because amazingly,
they paired Jamie paired a rose with our
[SPEAKER_00]: blueberry cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, you do the side by side
comparison and the bouquet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The scent was so similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was actually quite surprised that it was
really some it was really similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that is really fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're working with the
Humboldt Seed Company and we're also
[SPEAKER_00]: working with Hendrick's Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're developing some we're Fino hunting
this strain called the Liliquai.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll we'll be doing more of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also are doing the vanilla frosting
that was with Happy Dreams Farms and
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt Seed Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, we've got a lot of exciting
strains.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: We collaborate all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So for the live, live resin.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the Humboldt Terp Council, a really
good friend, Rob Gale of mine.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing a collaboration with him this
fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he hasn't chosen what strain he wants
to do yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm really excited to work with him.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, we've been working with
Peak for a long time and they do an amber.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a full spectrum amber oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a little different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what did you want to get out of this
event?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a great event for new beginnings,
you know, get great, great place to meet
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excuse the voice.
[SPEAKER_02]: First question was, what are we excited
about?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like the upcoming year and then what do
you want to get out of it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Honestly, expansion and innovation.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in like all aspects of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when it comes to obviously we
manufacture, distribute portfolio brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: So each brand is really working on a lot
of new, really cool, unique products you
[SPEAKER_02]: haven't seen on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I would say we just launched a
new brand Mind Your Head by Mickey Hart of
[SPEAKER_02]: the Grateful Dead.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So just bringing on like really cool
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then looking for new products,
expanding our current selection,
[SPEAKER_02]: new brands potentially, expansion,
maybe some vertical integration,
[SPEAKER_02]: some good stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then, yeah, just trying to be kind of
the leader in California for distribution
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturing, like just quality products
and the right people to work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then out of this event, I love this
event.
[SPEAKER_02]: It feels like a reunion.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just so excited to be here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So mostly other than like I'd like my
voice back, I love talking to everyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, because I was talking all day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody talks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just, you know, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there might have been some joints
involved, just maybe.
[SPEAKER_02]: So definitely joints involved.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, just the networking,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: The talking, the like seeing friends and
communing with the community, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like these are the people.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're really, really lucky to be in this.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's nice to have kind of a moment to
step away and have that gratitude for what
[SPEAKER_02]: we get to be a part of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Did you find that there were the number of
retailers here that you were expecting?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like is there the retailer presence?
[SPEAKER_02]: Business, I'm so mushy.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're like, oh, business-wise,
yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hopefully we connect with lots of
retailers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Call me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there's a good amount.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's really big.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like the first one, when you guys had the
first one, like so much smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful event.
[SPEAKER_02]: They did a great job, but it's a lot
bigger, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have a lot more rooms to get
around to.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, there was a ton of retailers
coming through.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's really nice to see them and then
to meet people that I haven't met before
[SPEAKER_02]: as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it really brings both NorCal and
SoCal together, this event.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So first question was, what are we up to
in the next year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I think we're all living in dog
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the next year is actually like seven
years of weed business time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll give you like the next 90 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's what mine was too.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we just added 4,800 square feet to
our distribution and post-processing
[SPEAKER_01]: manufacturing space.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're building out a significant white
labeling department to fulfill cartridges
[SPEAKER_01]: for these guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: A personal life goal of mine is being
fulfilled on Friday when I'm shipping out
[SPEAKER_01]: my very first order of cannabis turped
distillate for the Marley Naturals brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: I spent three years of my life with the
Bob Marley Legends album stuck in my CD
[SPEAKER_01]: player.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is like a big deal for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're actually doing we're doing
manufacturing and formulation,
[SPEAKER_01]: but they're actually doing the
manufacturing and packaging and compliance
[SPEAKER_01]: testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we produce the formulated oil and they
produce a finished good from that and then
[SPEAKER_01]: send out for compliance testing and
distribute to retail.
[SPEAKER_01]: So me and all my guys up in Humboldt
County and our fine farmers will be
[SPEAKER_01]: contributing the THC and terpenes needed
for the Marley line, which is kind of a
[SPEAKER_01]: dream come true.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I can't believe this is my real job.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're also going to get to do
follow up Mickey Hart right after.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that an imminent launch?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is that a new product?
[SPEAKER_01]: They've been out for some time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's currently available in a store
near you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So come get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But obviously there are some new things
that we can maybe not talk about that are
[SPEAKER_02]: coming.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_02]: Lots of new things.
[SPEAKER_02]: I said innovation, new products.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, it's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is dog years and it's really exciting
to see see that come online.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what were you doing at the show?
[SPEAKER_01]: Really, these are these are unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hunting opportunities, especially one of
the things the show does, it's
[SPEAKER_01]: controversial, but it's really worth it
from my perspective is limiting it to only
[SPEAKER_01]: licensed industry professionals of certain
license types in the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: They had one day where it was licensed
only and then today is everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: yesterday.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was easy to move around.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I would say is I've been to a lot
of conferences where I had to shake 10 to
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 hands to find someone who is the type a
type of person I'm looking for of any type
[SPEAKER_01]: here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really running 50 to 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we move bulk flour, bulk
distillate cartridges.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to start working on pre rolls.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chances are if you work in the cannabis
industry, I can interact with you in some
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: You either have flour, need distillate,
need cards or need one of those things or
[SPEAKER_01]: you retail some of those things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the number of connections that can be
made for our in here is really high.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would say one of the important
things for me is I just have to remember
[SPEAKER_01]: to keep moving.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many interesting people just
like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we've been hanging out for 30 minutes
and I haven't talked to an extra nine
[SPEAKER_01]: people because of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And who knows?
[SPEAKER_03]: It sounds like the show is doing a better
job of filtering out the unwanted material
