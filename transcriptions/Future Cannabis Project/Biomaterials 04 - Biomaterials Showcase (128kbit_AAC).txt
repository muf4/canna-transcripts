[SPEAKER_02]: I did want to show some of these materials
that I have here to everybody,
[SPEAKER_02]: things that I'm excited about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is, do you want to, does somebody
want to pass these around?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is restock, the hemp paper.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I guess what this one is?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, you can.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is this pineapple?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is pina tex.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I was in Copenhagen and went to a
materials library at this university
[SPEAKER_02]: called Kia.
[SPEAKER_02]: And here, this has, this is like my purse.
[SPEAKER_02]: But they have, they have this materials
library and they had a large sheet of pina
[SPEAKER_02]: tex, the largest sheet of pina tex I've
ever seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it listed what's actually in pina tex,
which it listed, unless this has changed,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's listed as 70% PLA, which I was really
disappointed about.
[SPEAKER_02]: So PLA is plant-based.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Plastic.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, it's called pina tex.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that is a pineapple, pineapple
leaf, waste pineapple leaf-based swatches.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And PLA is polylactic acid.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it could be any type of bioproduct
could, you know, there's different things
[SPEAKER_04]: out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So maybe they're taking the pina tex and
chemically it's considered polylactic acid
[SPEAKER_04]: when it's, it's not degradable.
[SPEAKER_04]: They say on their site that it will not
degrade, that it will never compost
[SPEAKER_04]: because they have to put additives in it
to make sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: That it's, you know, long lasting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was really bummed about that,
but that's why I love this material,
[SPEAKER_02]: which has nothing added to it at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called, it's a company called Malai
and it's a bacterial cellulose alternative
[SPEAKER_02]: leather, which I think we need like a new
term for, cause I feel like it's in
[SPEAKER_02]: between leather and textiles.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not pleather.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not pleather.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a problem with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a big problem with pleather.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that, that company they take waste
coconut water from some farmers that are
[SPEAKER_02]: raising coconuts for some other reason and
feeding it to bacteria and that bacteria
[SPEAKER_02]: creates layers of cellulose.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then they layer the cellulose together
and add some waste banana fiber also to
[SPEAKER_02]: give it some tensile strength.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's different colors that you can
see in those prototypes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I think that's super exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also love my friend's company,
Kombucha biomaterials.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making kombucha rolling papers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's just a hundred percent scoby.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can put that down for the reusables.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're down with that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Perfectly fine.
[SPEAKER_05]: Reuse, reuse, recycle, use.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, Michelle.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of cost of these materials,
if someone wanted to incorporate it,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's one person's waste is another
person's treasure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you able to get this for free or
harder?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a cost to it?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's that handled?
[SPEAKER_01]: How's it worked for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you asking me?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a product and a service, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We do not charge anything for our service.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're collecting all of the waste and
providing an opportunity to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivators to purchase that back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we do encourage them to purchase that
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we are getting it for free.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not paying for it and they're not
paying us.
[SPEAKER_00]: That might change in the future,
but that's the way it is currently.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is good because they legally have to
have it collected, not just because it's
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis, but because under state
regulation, AB 1826 and also new
[SPEAKER_04]: regulation SB 1383.
[SPEAKER_04]: So AB 1826 says that any commercial
account, business or multifamily
[SPEAKER_04]: residential, has to have, if they create
four cubic yards, so it's just a normal
[SPEAKER_04]: size dumpster of material, municipal solid
waste, so any type of trash, they have to
[SPEAKER_04]: have organics recycling in place.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is because the state of
California wants to have a 50% reduction
[SPEAKER_04]: of organics to landfill.
[SPEAKER_04]: If they don't reach that goal,
they're gonna go to, if you have two cubic
[SPEAKER_04]: yards, and that's gonna go to every single
business.
[SPEAKER_04]: So these businesses, because they
participate in, because they have an
[SPEAKER_04]: organic feed stock, they have to
participate in this.
[SPEAKER_04]: They have to have some sort of collection.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if he wasn't collecting it for free,
they would have to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they can find some other illegal
solution, I'm sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can compost on site.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can compost on site if they have the
opportunity to do so.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of these large-scale growers,
they have too much, and they would need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be a registered and licensed, fully
certified compost facility, which in and
[SPEAKER_00]: of itself is very daunting to be A,
certified in, and B, to maintain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Has to maintain under a certain
temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: 100 tons, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: They can only do 100 tons, and so they're
a large compost facility, and then they
[SPEAKER_04]: have to get regulated in a different way.
[SPEAKER_00]: To answer your question, we're saving them
money on, like we were talking about,
[SPEAKER_00]: percentages of organic waste, 60,
70%, in some cases, of the dumpster is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be organic green waste.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the dumpster cost for them,
by week or by month, is drastically
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced through using a service like ours.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, symbiotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because otherwise, I know that any sort of
farmer, they can burn their agricultural
[SPEAKER_02]: waste, which releases a lot of carbon
emissions.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they can just let it kind of rot and
not compost it in a certified way.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that promotes such a, it's a slippery
slope, because then you're promoting the
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem of toxic runoff and air
pollutants.
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's rotting and molding, and no one as
a farmer, especially a canvas farmer,
[SPEAKER_00]: you do not want mold on your facility.
[SPEAKER_03]: And doesn't the regulations say,
too, I was reading it, that they can't
[SPEAKER_03]: allow it to just sit on the land,
but it has to be removed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there is a timeframe associated with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's, again, it's up to each county to
kind of drill down on that, which is kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of a little bit more of the bottleneck of
what's happening right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the relationship, I mean, that's what
we're being told by Cowher Cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the county is telling us,
where it's not on us, to go talk to Cowher
[SPEAKER_00]: Cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's kind of like a game of hopscotch
or like pass the buck.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're doing what they can,
which is great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're very proactive.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Jessica, the cost for hauling and
disposing of waste, I'm assuming that's
[SPEAKER_02]: going up and up and up, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have a sense of how much it's gone
up, or is there a projection of how much
[SPEAKER_02]: more it's expensive it's supposed to get?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, it's all dependent on the contract
that your jurisdiction has worked out with
[SPEAKER_04]: the collectors in that area.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of cities in the United States,
around Los Angeles, around LA,
[SPEAKER_04]: Southern California, are franchised or
non-exclusive or exclusive franchise.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they have contracts with the people or
the businesses that can come in there and
[SPEAKER_04]: collect this material.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they set the rates.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because of the changing market,
some of these franchise agreements were
[SPEAKER_04]: extremely low and don't really cover the
cost of being able to transport and
[SPEAKER_04]: process this material.
[SPEAKER_04]: And because of the fluctuating market and
the market sort of heading downward at the
[SPEAKER_04]: moment, it will even its way up.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it has to reflect the actual cost.
[SPEAKER_04]: And for the longest time, in the 90s,
when we started pushing recycling and
[SPEAKER_04]: started setting recycling legislation and
diversion legislation, we said,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, there's this conversation about,
don't worry, recycling is free.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get so much money for the recycling.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you recycle more, your waste bill will
go down.
[SPEAKER_04]: But recycling is much more expensive than
landfilling.
[SPEAKER_04]: A tip fee in the state of California is so
incredibly low in comparison to other
[SPEAKER_04]: parts of this country.
[SPEAKER_04]: New York City, East Coast, the tip fees
are- What is tip fee?
[SPEAKER_04]: A tip fee is when you go take the
material, tipping a truck, when you take
[SPEAKER_04]: the material and you tip it at the
landfill, you have to pay to tip it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you don't own your own landfills,
you're really paying a lot of money to tip
[SPEAKER_04]: this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to tip it at a landfill, to get rid of
it, to dispose of it is so cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: To recycle it is, you know, heading over
$100 a ton, you know, 70, 80, depending on
[SPEAKER_04]: where you are, depending on the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you're getting up there in the
$100 a ton.
[SPEAKER_04]: Composting, because in our Southern
California area, our composting
[SPEAKER_04]: infrastructure is usually far away from
our larger cities.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that transportation cost,
because it is the heaviest material that
[SPEAKER_04]: you're transporting, it's one got to be
processed.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if it stops to get processed and has
all the bad material removed from it,
[SPEAKER_04]: and it gets put back on the truck and then
that truck goes to a facility that's like
[SPEAKER_04]: four more hours away, that cost is so
expensive.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have to compost it and you're
hoping that the people around you want to
[SPEAKER_04]: use the compost and that you're not
shipping out to farms two hours away and
[SPEAKER_04]: you're really losing all your money on
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're looking at something like $180 a
ton or more for just organics because of
[SPEAKER_04]: how the whole system is set up.
[SPEAKER_04]: The true cost of this is not taken into
consideration, but these cities that are
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at sort of subsidizing these costs
in a way where they make the landfill rate
[SPEAKER_04]: higher and they make the recycling rate
lower and the organics rate lower,
[SPEAKER_04]: they subsidize it by increasing how much
weight, you know, how much, yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: incentivizing and increasing how much the
waste is actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: going to cost them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So is it going to go up?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's always going to go up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Transportation is expensive, you know,
and we're running out of room.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, you know, I got to say, I got to say
too, we've got two really massive
[SPEAKER_04]: landfills here in Southern California.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had the like third or fifth,
at one time it was the largest,
[SPEAKER_04]: but third or fifth largest landfill we
have, which was here in the world or?
[SPEAKER_04]: It was looking at the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was looking at a thing the other day,
I think it was like third or fifth and it
[SPEAKER_04]: was Puente Hills at the time that it was
open.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know, looking at that list, I was like,
oh, where are these other landfills?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I know are pretty big.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some other big landfills here in
Southern California.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have one that's the deep, one of the
deepest landfills because they drilled out
[SPEAKER_04]: a mountain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we have another really,
where is that one?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then we have another landfill that is not
really being utilized.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's out near the Salton Sea and it's just
really large.
[SPEAKER_04]: And one of the reasons it's not being
utilized as much is I think they thought
[SPEAKER_04]: they were going to be able to use the rail
system in order to to transport the waste,
[SPEAKER_04]: but they really didn't tell the rail
system that they were going to be using
[SPEAKER_04]: the rail system.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's been some issues with that.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have the landfills.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it would have been a lower carbon
trip to the landfill.
[SPEAKER_05]: That didn't work out so well.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have the landfills.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, they are closing around the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we're going to not hopefully be
creating any more landfills, but we just
[SPEAKER_04]: we don't need to be relying on them in the
first place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
