[SPEAKER_00]: Okay so we're preparing to transplant a
whole bunch of clones into cocoa in the
[SPEAKER_00]: coir and so what do we have going on over
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: We have a Thrive Alive kelp fertilizer
that is high in B vitamins to help
[SPEAKER_01]: transplant shock so that the plants can
transplant smoothly into their new homes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're also going to add a little bit of
sulfur to this and we're going to add some
[SPEAKER_01]: trichoderma fungus as well which will help
fight off any fungal root diseases as well
[SPEAKER_01]: as any mildews and or small delicate
sucking insects like russet mites.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then today we're testing two different
types of or two different brands of cocoa
[SPEAKER_00]: coir.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're testing one brand from Global
Horticulture Industries.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're a local provider here in the
Carpinteria Valley.
[SPEAKER_01]: They provide the most of the flower
farmers in Santa Barbara County in
[SPEAKER_01]: general.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we're testing out California
Substrates which is a pH buffered that has
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium magnesium added into the cocoa as
well as it's been washed so that it won't
[SPEAKER_01]: have any dust and the claim with
California Substrates is that you can
[SPEAKER_01]: plant into it without needing to pre-treat
your cocoa.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is it on the right is the
California Substrates right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're going to do one row of California
Substrates and one row of what was the
[SPEAKER_00]: other brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: Global Horticulture Industries.
