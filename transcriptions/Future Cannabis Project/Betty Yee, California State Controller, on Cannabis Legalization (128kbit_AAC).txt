[SPEAKER_00]: We have to continue to make the case for
why we believe Prop 64 should become law
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I'm just honored to be here and to
talk about the possibility of California
[SPEAKER_00]: having a legal adult use recreational
marijuana industry potentially in the very
[SPEAKER_00]: near future.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as Californians begin to think about
how they're going to cast their votes,
[SPEAKER_00]: we know that there's been a lot of
information about Prop 64 that's been put
[SPEAKER_00]: forth, a lot of misinformation also.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think it's fair to say there are
still concerns on both sides, whether
[SPEAKER_00]: you're for or against it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally am still on the fence and I
will tell you why as I present my remarks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, clearly from a social justice
perspective, from the perspective that we
[SPEAKER_00]: have had this wrong-headed drug policy for
decades after decades, that really hasn't
[SPEAKER_00]: done much with respect to really
minimizing serious drug use, but also with
[SPEAKER_00]: respect to our incarceration policies.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is something that the time has come
to address that.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, when you look at what the
practical effects of this measure will be,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I've been doing public policy work
particularly in the finance arena for
[SPEAKER_00]: almost 35 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I like to think that I chose the
finance arena because it's a way to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually try to approach problems,
not necessarily by throwing money into it,
[SPEAKER_00]: but looking at how we can actually use
dollars as an incentive.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are lots of incentives for voting
for this measure.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first of which is the economic impact
to California, the entrepreneurial
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities this could create,
tax revenues for local agencies in the
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as I look at those numbers,
it portends well with respect to why we
[SPEAKER_00]: should be voting for Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: The initiative, as you know, allows people
ages 21 and older to possess and cultivate
[SPEAKER_00]: in their homes small quantities of
marijuana for personal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, supporters say it's gonna raise
significant funds for after-school
[SPEAKER_00]: programs, for job training, drug treatment
programs, and also reduce criminal justice
[SPEAKER_00]: costs by the tens of millions per year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, most of you know as I was introduced
by Susan, I am the state's chief fiscal
[SPEAKER_00]: officer.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I bring kind of an economic perspective
to this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Prop 64 would regulate the industry and
generate substantial tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is definitely true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Opponents, even some who believe that
marijuana should be legal, make strong
[SPEAKER_00]: arguments that Prop 64 does not address
enough of their concerns.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is, we've heard him, it is things
like not establishing DUI standards,
[SPEAKER_00]: it allows advertising that can be seen by
young people.
[SPEAKER_00]: One report touted by opponents of 64
suggests that marijuana should be treated
[SPEAKER_00]: like tobacco, legal but unwanted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been 20 years since voters
approved Prop 215, the Compassionate Use
[SPEAKER_00]: Act, allowing medicinal use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some 55.6% of California voters said yes
to Prop 215 back in 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was serving as the chief deputy to
State Board of Equalization Chairwoman
[SPEAKER_00]: Carol Bigdon from San Francisco when
Senate Bill 420 by the late Senator John
[SPEAKER_00]: Vasconcelos took effect about eight years
later in 2004.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, that bill allowed for the
formation of cooperatives and collectives
[SPEAKER_00]: to provide cannabis for medicinal use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also created the card identifying
qualified patients and caregivers who were
[SPEAKER_00]: authorized to procure cannabis on a
patient's behalf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this protected patients and caregivers
to some degree, but in the eyes of the
[SPEAKER_00]: federal government, they were and are
still engaged in illegal activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: None of that changes under Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: As the state's chief fiscal officer,
I view the possibility of a well regulated
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use medical, adult use marijuana
industry in California in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: potential and also in terms of challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a California tax official,
I've seen firsthand some of those
[SPEAKER_00]: challenges.
[SPEAKER_00]: After my predecessor, Carol Bigdon left
the Board of Equalization for a seat in
[SPEAKER_00]: the California State Senate and was
appointed to serve out her term.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in my first months in office,
I heard of dispensaries that the Board of
[SPEAKER_00]: Equalization had denied seller's permits
for medicinal marijuana because retail
[SPEAKER_00]: sales had not been legalized.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the BOE seller's permit itself
explicitly stated that it was not to be
[SPEAKER_00]: used for illegal activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some operators sold medicinal marijuana
for years without collecting sales tax and
[SPEAKER_00]: found themselves on the hook for back
taxes that were high enough to put them
[SPEAKER_00]: out of business.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in September of 2005, nine months into
my service on the board, the third
[SPEAKER_00]: district court of appeals determined that
Senator Best and Sellers bill,
[SPEAKER_00]: Senate Bill 420, did in fact sanction
marijuana dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I recommended at the time that we
revise the Board of Equalization policy to
[SPEAKER_00]: grant a seller's permit to anyone
requesting one for the sale of medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana as defined in the Compassionate
Use Act of 1996.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the medical marijuana program created
by SB 420 for the purposes of collecting
[SPEAKER_00]: taxes due to the state.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you remember back in 2004,
it was a very different landscape,
[SPEAKER_00]: very different landscape.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were seeing the DEA quite often in
California.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were subject to the direction of the
George W.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bush era.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had frankly been putting up the fight
with the feds because a lot of the seized
[SPEAKER_00]: assets were tax revenue that had been put
aside in bank accounts that belonged to
[SPEAKER_00]: the state of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, the compromise was to say that
the Board of Equalization should end the
[SPEAKER_00]: explicit refusal to grant seller's permits
to businesses engaged in illegal activity
[SPEAKER_00]: and to no longer require that cannabis
businesses disclose the nature of their
[SPEAKER_00]: sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this was a way that we felt we could
actually have dispensaries really operate
[SPEAKER_00]: as legitimate businesses in their
communities and certainly not have the tax
[SPEAKER_00]: board make any judgment about the illegal
or legal nature of their activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was a unanimous vote.
[SPEAKER_00]: I convinced my Republican colleagues to
vote for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the effect was to allow dispensaries
essentially to operate within legal
[SPEAKER_00]: guidelines and collect taxes due to the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even so, the wording of that
compromise highlights the fact that the
[SPEAKER_00]: state government still found itself
walking a tight line between state and
[SPEAKER_00]: federal regulations and did not want to be
seen as condoning federal illegal
[SPEAKER_00]: activity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember how much of a tightrope I
personally felt like I was walking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I felt this was the right thing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a way to get those who were
operating underground to come above ground
[SPEAKER_00]: to be recognized as legitimate businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yet at the same time, I had my chief
counsel of the board just essentially kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of put his arms out to say, don't get too
far out there because of the federal
[SPEAKER_00]: prohibition.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this conflict is not easily resolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And obviously, some further federal,
further effects of federal prohibition
[SPEAKER_00]: relates to banking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, when I think about some of
the issues that are still unresolved today
[SPEAKER_00]: that will continue to be unresolved when
Prop 64, should the voters approve it,
[SPEAKER_00]: become law, we still have the nasty issue
of banking that has not been resolved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to me, that is the singularly biggest
issue that we have got to make some
[SPEAKER_00]: movement forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's my hope that if California voters
decide that we should have an adult use
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational marijuana industry here in
California, that the federal government
[SPEAKER_00]: and our congressional delegation will
begin to move to allow banking practices
[SPEAKER_00]: to support marijuana businesses.
[SPEAKER_00]: For 45 years, the federal government has
had a banking secrecy act that outlaws
[SPEAKER_00]: laundering money obtained through illegal
activities through financial institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know there have been some financial
institutions, credit unions I know we've
[SPEAKER_00]: read about in other states, Colorado,
Washington, that have tried to be of
[SPEAKER_00]: support.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most big banks will not create an account
for a cannabis business regardless of
[SPEAKER_00]: state law because federally, it is still
illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now the Financial Crimes Enforcement
Network is an arm of our federal treasury
[SPEAKER_00]: charged with enforcing the Banking Secrecy
Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: And known as FinCEN, this enforcement
network laid out some very specific
[SPEAKER_00]: guidelines and said it will not take
action against financial institutions that
[SPEAKER_00]: follow them.
[SPEAKER_00]: The FinCEN reporting requirements are so
time intensive and labor intensive that
[SPEAKER_00]: financial institutions, if they allow
dispensaries to have accounts,
[SPEAKER_00]: will charge a steep monthly fee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for just your regular normal
dispensary, it probably is not worth it
[SPEAKER_00]: financially despite the risk of running an
all cash business.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many in law enforcement have conflicted
views on legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the one hand, they would love to
eliminate the danger people face when they
[SPEAKER_00]: encounter illegal grow operations guarded
by well-armed individuals.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I look at our tax board as not
necessarily law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are there to facilitate tax collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I do have to say it continues to give
me pause when each month or every quarter,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have to make special arrangements with
medical dispensaries, medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries, to accept their sales tax
payments in cash.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, from a public safety
perspective, and you can imagine that
[SPEAKER_00]: getting magnified under broader
legalization, that's a huge concern.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on the one hand, while I don't
necessarily agree with our law enforcement
[SPEAKER_00]: community that the typical public safety
issue of law and order is going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: front and center with Prop 64,
it does present other public safety issues
[SPEAKER_00]: including this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Washington State has been very good,
as I said, with helping its credit unions
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the FinCEN guidelines and make
accounts available to state authorized
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis sellers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope that this is something that
our state of California government can
[SPEAKER_00]: also help facilitate.
[SPEAKER_00]: The state of Colorado is leaving it to the
feds to provide stronger guidance and
[SPEAKER_00]: leaving it to financial institutions to
decide the level of legal risk that they
[SPEAKER_00]: are comfortable assuming.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is estimated that Colorado will have
1.2 billion in cash transactions this year
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a problem that is not going
away and in fact will probably come
[SPEAKER_00]: exacerbated given the growth in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Overall, about 40% of cannabis businesses
nationwide say they have been able to open
[SPEAKER_00]: a bank account.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a start, but it leaves six out
of every 10 cannabis businesses in a
[SPEAKER_00]: potentially unsafe position.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly, there are challenges to address
in order to successfully launch a legal
[SPEAKER_00]: recreational cannabis industry in
California, but there's also amazing
[SPEAKER_00]: economic opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I believe that's why most of you are
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Colorado, Washington, and Oregon are
averaging a combined 123.5 million in
[SPEAKER_00]: monthly sales of legal recreational
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Oregon has not even opened its retail
stores yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: If steady increases continue, there's a
potential for them to have $2 billion in
[SPEAKER_00]: total sales this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: There are between 100,000 and 150,000
people already employed in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Colorado, they are even seeing what
some call Canada tourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now tourism in California, Susan was
asking me about this, we have a tourism
[SPEAKER_00]: business that amounts to about $122,
$123 billion a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And leisure travelers to the state of
Colorado spent $98 million at recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: marijuana stores last year, which
represents 17% of total sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is becoming a tourist industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're seeing bumps of potentially
20% in tourism dollars, which certainly
[SPEAKER_00]: can help the economy as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 20% of $122, $123 billion is a pretty
big gain for California.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sales could be $1.6 billion in the first
year in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by 2020, the legal market in
California could be well over $6.4
[SPEAKER_00]: billion.
[SPEAKER_00]: The California Legislative Analyst's
Office estimates that state and local
[SPEAKER_00]: governments could collect net additional
revenues that could eventually top $1
[SPEAKER_00]: billion a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And recent polls by the Public Policy
Institute show that support for
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization has increased since the
failure of Proposition 19 in 2010,
[SPEAKER_00]: when 53% of California voters said no to
the prospect of allowing recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: adult use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the needle has moved actually pretty
quickly in the direction towards
[SPEAKER_00]: legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today, 55% of likely voters say they
support legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: In fact, some of the more recent polls
have that higher.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the partisan divide is not as wide as
one might think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Republican support has increased 10 points
since 2010 to 44%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the only demographic that has not
increased its support for legalization are
[SPEAKER_00]: people 35 to 45 years old, and
particularly those with children under the
[SPEAKER_00]: age of 18, perhaps reflecting some of the
concerns I mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, as a person who pays the bills for
the state of California and as a member of
[SPEAKER_00]: the board charged with tax collection,
I am looking at the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_00]: the adult use, legalization, legal
cannabis industry as an eventuality.
[SPEAKER_00]: We will get there, whether it be this
November or sometime soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as such, I look at the challenges
faced in terms of seeking the solutions
[SPEAKER_00]: necessary to overcome them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's imperative that when we do
legalize cannabis, we do this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is enough public opposition to this
measure, whether it be from concerned
[SPEAKER_00]: parents, whether it be from law
enforcement, whether it be from just those
[SPEAKER_00]: who believe that this is the beginning of
what we're seeing being developed as big,
[SPEAKER_00]: big corporation cannabis being
established.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's even, frankly, opposition within
the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we look at this opposition,
it's imperative that we understand what
[SPEAKER_00]: the arguments against the measure are and
to also look at how we're going to get
[SPEAKER_00]: them addressed because they are not going
to go away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, the opposition interests are
all going to be looking for missteps as we
[SPEAKER_00]: carry out the mandates of the initiative
should it pass.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one misstep could really upend the
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a public perception,
but there's also a public reputation
[SPEAKER_00]: associated with this issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think, you know, I've been one to
where I feel my role, certainly as a tax
[SPEAKER_00]: collector, certainly as a CFO,
I'm not going to be part of any of the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulating authorities in California under
Prop 64, but we have to do this right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm committed to rolling up my sleeves
and figuring this stuff out.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've long advocated and have made the ask
of our federal officials to allow
[SPEAKER_00]: California to actually have a banking
pilot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, just give us a chance to just
interface with our financial institutions
[SPEAKER_00]: and just see what it is that is so
problematic that we have dispensaries be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to do business with our traditional
financial institutions.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have a panel that's coming up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be talking about different
perspectives about adult use.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the other thing I just wanted to say
is this.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we look at what the proposition
provides for, you know, the other great
[SPEAKER_00]: concern I have is that we haven't had a
track record with respect to the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulatory framework that was developed by
the legislature for medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some of you know this in the room and
others may not, but I've spent the better
[SPEAKER_00]: part of the last 15 years working with the
medical cannabis community.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has been a tough fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a tough fight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're still not done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So aside from banking, we need to be sure
that the federal government recognizes
[SPEAKER_00]: these businesses as legitimate businesses
for tax purposes so we can have business
[SPEAKER_00]: expenses deducted and all of the other tax
benefits that it may use to reduce their
[SPEAKER_00]: cost of doing business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But also, as I look at just even the
regulatory environment as it will evolve
[SPEAKER_00]: with the passage of Proposition 64,
you have the Department of Consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: Affairs that will be the lead agency for
oversight of this adult use cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the Department of Public Health
that will have jurisdiction over testing
[SPEAKER_00]: and manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I will tell you right now,
that department has zero bandwidth to do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how are they going to develop that?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Department of Food and
Agriculture that will oversee all issues
[SPEAKER_00]: related to cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know that when agencies delve into
their specific jurisdiction, other issues
[SPEAKER_00]: will emerge.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't know how you speak about
cultivation without looking at issues
[SPEAKER_00]: around pesticide use, energy use,
water use.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm surmising that when all is said and
done and we actually get a regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: framework, which now looks like if 64
passes, we'll piggyback on the work that's
[SPEAKER_00]: currently being done for medical.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that is, I can easily foresee over a
dozen regulatory entities at the state
[SPEAKER_00]: level overseeing adult use recreational
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, it doesn't give you confidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you comfort in terms of being a
part of that industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I think what we have
to do is to be honest about these issues
[SPEAKER_00]: that still remain thorny relative to what
we have to resolve in getting an industry
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just need to applaud all of you
because I don't know of no other industry
[SPEAKER_00]: that essentially has stepped forward to
say, regulate us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who does that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who does that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And frankly, that's your selling point.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's your selling point.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be looked at as legitimate
businesses under the guise of the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to be regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know what happens when we're not
regulated.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want a black market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, but kudos to you for doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to say particularly to the
medical dispensary folks who just really
[SPEAKER_00]: paved the way for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was not easy for them to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they've opened that door.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what we need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: But here's what I'm going to say in my
closing remarks.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, as I said, we've got to get this
right because the forces that oppose this
[SPEAKER_00]: still are quite strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can't afford any misstep.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the other thing I'm going to say is
that this is going to need to be very
[SPEAKER_00]: exacting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not okay to speculate what will be or
won't be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there is more that the body of science
behind this is becoming more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And certainly, with respect to
cultivation, there's a whole lot more
[SPEAKER_00]: track record and experience that can
inform what we do here in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I say this to you because,
you know, when we are regulatory bodies at
[SPEAKER_00]: the state level, and particularly
regulatory bodies, you know, up to a few
[SPEAKER_00]: dozen potentially if Prop 64 becomes the
law, we don't have the expertise or the
[SPEAKER_00]: bandwidth at the state level.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to need to reach out to
industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have got to have your act
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, to the point of being very
exacting, being able to point to the
[SPEAKER_00]: resources that have been demonstrated,
that have been researched, that have,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, just shown what works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, from a government to government
perspective, we'll be reaching out to our
[SPEAKER_00]: colleagues in Colorado, Washington,
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: But from a business perspective,
from a cultivation perspective,
[SPEAKER_00]: from what you all have already begun to do
and will continue to do more and expand
[SPEAKER_00]: into California, we need your expertise.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has got to be robust.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has got to be based in hopefully
research and empirical evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has got to be such that when we
develop this regulatory framework more
[SPEAKER_00]: broadly, that there is a understanding and
kind of a standard and foundational level
[SPEAKER_00]: of understanding such that when there is
state oversight and local jurisdictions
[SPEAKER_00]: decide how much they want to get into this
area, that they have the comfort that the
[SPEAKER_00]: state has got their back.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what's at stake here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And part of the reason I'm on the fence is
that I don't know that we're there yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have faith in my own state
government, frankly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I also feel that we can't be casual
about the opposition that's out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very real.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, there are days that I still get
mail from parents who are on me about what
[SPEAKER_00]: I paved to kind of make 64 possible today.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, frankly, wake up,
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's out on the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: Your kids are getting their hands on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, when we talk about
regulation and that's why, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what you all have done to be
responsible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulate us.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you say regulate us, give us the
tools to be able to do that effectively.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so while I stand before you on the
fence about Proposition 64, I also am very
[SPEAKER_00]: hopeful about the kind of industry this
could become in California.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm going to say, but I'm also going
to say, within your community,
[SPEAKER_00]: within your community, come together.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's been a lot of work done in this
arena.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just need to applaud those who are
in the medical cannabis arena because a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of that work was pioneering,
groundbreaking, and frankly, a very lonely
[SPEAKER_00]: time for many of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Many lessons learned from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, for me, I want to continue
to see some recognition of medical
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis when we do have adult use,
legalized recreational use.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because at the end of the day,
what we're all after, I hope, I hope,
[SPEAKER_00]: is safe access to safe products.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as any of that is compromised,
the whole industry will tip on its head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's precarious, but it's exciting at
the same time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is serious, but also the possibilities
are, you know, quite limitless.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it is one where it can be a game
changer if all of you really step up to
[SPEAKER_00]: the plate and begin to inform how we begin
to get a system in place that is
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible, that begins to set some
standards, and also where, as local
[SPEAKER_00]: governments decide whether they're going
to get into this arena or not,
[SPEAKER_00]: that they have the comfort knowing that
the state knows what it's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot of responsibility back to
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, I'm going to say
that I'm one state-level official who is
[SPEAKER_00]: not going to be shy about rolling up my
sleeves, whether a tax official or
[SPEAKER_00]: otherwise, or in any of the other number
of boards and commissions on which I
[SPEAKER_00]: serve, that when the voters approve POP
64, it will be the law of California,
[SPEAKER_00]: and my job is to enforce the law.
[SPEAKER_00]: But my job is also going to be,
as the chief fiscal officer, how to be
[SPEAKER_00]: sure that this is a successful industry,
successful for you, successful for the
[SPEAKER_00]: state, successful for our local
governments, but also successful in terms
[SPEAKER_00]: of the state providing the type of
oversight that will help make this
[SPEAKER_00]: industry thrive and hopefully be a model
for the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you all very much for the invitation
to speak.
Thank you.
