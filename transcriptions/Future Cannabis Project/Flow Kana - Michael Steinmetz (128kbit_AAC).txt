[SPEAKER_02]: My name is Michael Steinmetz, and I'm one
of the co-founders and CEOs of Flowcona.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm here today to tell you three
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, I want to start off and tell you a
little bit about Flowcona and our story.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then second, I want to discuss the
incredible opportunity that California has
[SPEAKER_02]: to really build a totally unique,
different kind of cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: and even take that further into
agriculture at large.
[SPEAKER_02]: And three, I want to talk a little bit
about the capital markets and especially
[SPEAKER_02]: some of the irregularities that that's
causing in our marketplace and in our
[SPEAKER_02]: industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, to start off with Flowcona,
simply speaking, we are a branded supply
[SPEAKER_02]: chain company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We take a different approach than the
traditional large-scale, big ag model,
[SPEAKER_02]: big farm model, where instead of growing
our own cannabis, we partner with small
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers in the Emerald Triangle and only
exclusively source sustainable,
[SPEAKER_02]: organic, and kind of zero carbon emission
cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_02]: At a high level, we have two components to
our business.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have kind of the flow distribution arm
of things and the flow processing and
[SPEAKER_02]: manufacturing side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: The flow distribution, very simple,
distribution company.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have three hubs across the state in the
Bay Area, in LA, and in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the flow processing and
manufacturing side, we're headquartered in
[SPEAKER_02]: the heart of the Emerald Triangle in
Mendocino, and we have three separate
[SPEAKER_02]: aggregation hubs strategically located in
the Emerald Triangle, where we source the
[SPEAKER_02]: product from the farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: We intake it, we grade it, we sort it,
we trim it, and then that product gets
[SPEAKER_02]: sent down to our main processing facility
to get value-add, process-manufactured at
[SPEAKER_02]: scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: The main processing facility we have used
to be home of the old Fetzer Winery,
[SPEAKER_02]: so we bought the old abandoned winery from
the Fetzers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's about a 200,000 square feet
facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: It used to be home of the third largest
winery in the U.S., and we are repurposing
[SPEAKER_02]: it to do a centralized cannabis campus
that brings all the pieces of the supply
[SPEAKER_02]: chain under one roof.
[SPEAKER_02]: So lab testing, distribution,
manufacturing, packaging, all the services
[SPEAKER_02]: a small farmer needs to really give them
the ability to scale and to compete with
[SPEAKER_02]: the larger forces coming at bay.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the good fortune of being the
number one flower brand of the state,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is kind of not only a testament to
kind of our hard work and our commitment
[SPEAKER_02]: to this industry, but rather a testament
to the conscious consumers of California
[SPEAKER_02]: that are really voting with their wallets
for brands that are more ecologically
[SPEAKER_02]: minded, environmentally minded,
and sustainably focused to really build a
[SPEAKER_02]: different kind of industry, which we most
definitely need to do.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I kind of always say we're at a very
fragile state in the cannabis industry,
[SPEAKER_02]: a time where the fate of this industry and
the livelihood of so many is really at
[SPEAKER_02]: stake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And California has the incredible
opportunity to really build something
[SPEAKER_02]: radically different and radically amazing
something that I don't think even
[SPEAKER_02]: agriculture as a large has really seen.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, prohibition has been really
devastating to mankind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's cost the nation billions of dollars.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's destroyed communities, separated
families, disproportionately affected
[SPEAKER_02]: minorities, just to name a few of the bad
things.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in California, prohibition did leave
us one gift, and that gift was that it
[SPEAKER_02]: gave us a totally fragmented supply chain
of more than 53,000 cannabis farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these cannabis farmers not only live
totally off-grid, lives with solar panels,
[SPEAKER_02]: rain catchment, totally fully diversified
farms with carrots and cabbage and
[SPEAKER_02]: tomatoes and celery and cucumbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a beautiful and inspiring ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only is it beautiful and
inspiring, but they're literally the
[SPEAKER_02]: largest supply chain of the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: These 53,000 cannabis farmers produce
about 85% of the cannabis that's consumed
[SPEAKER_02]: nationwide.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are powering the black market of the
nation from this state.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is a very, very unique
agricultural model that instead of having
[SPEAKER_02]: the traditional, the number one and number
two players at the top that command 90,
[SPEAKER_02]: 95% of the market share, that whole market
share of 85% is split among 53,000
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this beautiful gift and this
incredible model of agriculture is at a
[SPEAKER_02]: great threat right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a threat to being lost by the
wayside of the traditional big ag model,
[SPEAKER_02]: the same big ag model that has decimated
our planet for decades.
[SPEAKER_02]: And is a single largest contributor to all
of the climate crisis we are exhibiting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Monocropping, which is a common practice
in big ag, to make it easy and simple and
[SPEAKER_02]: more efficient, has totally made us lose a
lot of the biological diversity we have in
[SPEAKER_02]: the fruits and vegetables we consume
today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Soy, for example, wheat and corn,
we enjoy maybe one or two varietals in a
[SPEAKER_02]: universe of hundreds of varietals that
we've already lost as mankind.
[SPEAKER_02]: Imagine if that happened to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the loss of these worlds, these
fertile soils in the bio diversity,
[SPEAKER_02]: pose a mortal threat to our future
survival.
[SPEAKER_02]: We are literally killing ourselves with
our food production models that we have on
[SPEAKER_02]: our planet today.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, modern agriculture has turned our
food production into a business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in order to win in business,
you have to scale, you have to lower your
[SPEAKER_02]: cost, and you have to make more margin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So fundamentally, it's caused our food
production to drive to use more chemicals
[SPEAKER_02]: and pesticides and cut corners.
[SPEAKER_02]: And really, you know, pay people lower
wages and produce it cheaper and cheaper
[SPEAKER_02]: and cheaper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know why, but I feel like that's a
fundamentally flawed model to really
[SPEAKER_02]: produce the food and products that we
consume.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now we have an opportunity to do it in
cannabis with our medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why would we go on the same route to
produce the cheapest possible cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: From our perspective, we want to produce
the best possible cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this is the mission of Flocona.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, we believe that the future of
agriculture is small, fragmented,
[SPEAKER_02]: decentralized farmers working with
centralization and technology to reach
[SPEAKER_02]: scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are models that literally exist
in our world today.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, the largest taxi cab company
in the world, Uber, doesn't own a single
[SPEAKER_02]: vehicle.
[SPEAKER_02]: The largest hotel chain in the world,
Airbnb, doesn't own a single room.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe that the largest supply chain of
cannabis doesn't have to come from one
[SPEAKER_02]: source and one producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one big ag farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So as we look to build this new
agricultural industry, why do we want to
[SPEAKER_02]: do more of the old?
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's learn from the past and let's build
something different and imagine something
[SPEAKER_02]: new.
[SPEAKER_02]: After all, that's part of the pioneering
and adventurous spirit that all
[SPEAKER_02]: Californians like us hold dear.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's up to us, the operators,
the distributors, the retailers,
[SPEAKER_02]: the manufacturer, the other cultivators,
to really work in synchrony and harmony
[SPEAKER_02]: and use your dollars and use your time and
use your resources to invest in the brands
[SPEAKER_02]: that are pushing the industry forward and
are trying to build a better industry for
[SPEAKER_02]: all of us to enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The opportunity is grand and the
responsibility is even grander.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that responsibility is most evident
when you go take a visit to Canada,
[SPEAKER_02]: our neighbors up north, and you understand
a little bit of the industry that they are
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to build.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll tell you, it is the polar
opposite of the industry that we have here
[SPEAKER_02]: in California.
[SPEAKER_02]: Canada contributes about zero agricultural
products to the world, yet they're
[SPEAKER_02]: building the biggest production facilities
for cannabis in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of them have to be these massive
indoor facilities.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the rules and the regulations,
they've got to be GMP certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have to be ISO certified.
[SPEAKER_02]: They literally have to use full body suits
to go in with a face mask, goggles,
[SPEAKER_02]: a hair net, gloves, and booties.
[SPEAKER_02]: I literally felt like I was walking into a
spaceship, yet instead I was walking into
[SPEAKER_02]: a farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I couldn't help but think about
my home in Mendocino and the farmers that
[SPEAKER_02]: we work with and really think about the
times where we are down in the ground and
[SPEAKER_02]: playing with the little worms and
collecting the worm castings and getting
[SPEAKER_02]: real dirt underneath your fingernails,
real live dirt to create real live high
[SPEAKER_02]: quality products.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a very, very different industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an industry not with farmers,
but with lab coats.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's not a single agricultural
product in the world that's grown indoors.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I deeply feel that California must
lead the way in building the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry that we deserve.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also learned that a lot of people out
there are trying to wrap a story around
[SPEAKER_02]: empty jars and air, literally,
and taking it public.
[SPEAKER_02]: These companies have no long term value
and no sustained kind of growth potential.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not really thinking about the
industry that we're building, not really
[SPEAKER_02]: thinking about the value you can create or
how many communities you can empower and
[SPEAKER_02]: what good you can do to the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's simply wrapping a story around a
public process and playing a little
[SPEAKER_02]: fictitious game on a computer screen
around value.
[SPEAKER_02]: And why are people rushing to get an exit
so quickly when we haven't even begun the
[SPEAKER_02]: regulatory process of this industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm not trying to dismiss the public
process.
[SPEAKER_02]: After all, capital is an incredibly
important component of building any
[SPEAKER_02]: business.
[SPEAKER_02]: And at Flocona, we've raised probably as
much capital as any of the bigger players
[SPEAKER_02]: here in California, and we will continue
to raise capital but not to build air,
[SPEAKER_02]: but to build a business of value,
to build a difference that makes a
[SPEAKER_02]: difference to the communities that we work
with, and to really bring more wholesome
[SPEAKER_02]: products to the California cannabis
industry at large.
[SPEAKER_02]: And see, I grew up in Venezuela,
in a third world country, and I learned
[SPEAKER_02]: really early on that countries grow at the
pace that their capital markets grow,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: You need capital to give it to the
entrepreneurs and the business owners to
[SPEAKER_02]: create more value, to create more jobs,
to create more opportunities, and that's
[SPEAKER_02]: what helps economies develop.
[SPEAKER_02]: And like countries, industries are the
same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need those capital markets,
we need those investors, we need the
[SPEAKER_02]: Canadian public process, and we need it to
build the industry that we really want to
[SPEAKER_02]: enjoy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Without them, it would be impossible for
this industry to get off its feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: So in kind of closing remarks and now
opening up for questions, I think that as
[SPEAKER_02]: entrepreneurs in this room and a lot of
business owners that I see and a lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: the cool brands that I see and a lot of
responsible operators that I see,
[SPEAKER_02]: let's remember that this gift that we have
to build our business is collectively
[SPEAKER_02]: building the industry together.
[SPEAKER_02]: And every single thing that we do and
every single day that we spend and every
[SPEAKER_02]: resource and every dollar that we put into
this industry is building the collective
[SPEAKER_02]: of the industry that over time and over
decades will soon stabilize.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's in its very nascent forms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's the gift that we have as
entrepreneurs and business owners,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a gift to like take our dreams and
bring them and manifest them into reality,
[SPEAKER_02]: to shape and mold humanity, to propel us
forward, to build the dreams and the
[SPEAKER_02]: things that we want to see in the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's not forget that gift and let's
not forget that responsibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we must remember that in life,
what's truly valuable is not what we get,
[SPEAKER_02]: but it's what we become.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not what we get out of what we do
that matters, but it's who we become in
[SPEAKER_02]: the process of getting what we want that
truly is valuable.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what industry are we trying to become?
[SPEAKER_02]: What companies are we trying to become?
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is California's place in the
grander market of the world?
[SPEAKER_02]: And with that said, I just want to thank
Susan one more time because she's a very
[SPEAKER_02]: dear friend of mine and I'm a very big fan
of this conference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm happy to open it up for questions
because I think I have more time to
[SPEAKER_02]: answer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think if that's allowed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm Jamie Padilla.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with United Farm Workers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the labor union of Dolores Huerta and
Cesar Chavez.
[SPEAKER_00]: I found your message really encouraging.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what excites me most about cannabis is
the potential I see for the kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: overflow of innovation and positive change
that can happen in agriculture overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm particularly interested in how you
were talking about tapping into that
[SPEAKER_00]: positive consumer power to drive some of
this change.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you all think through that,
I'm curious as to when you talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: social responsibility and sustainability,
the labor piece of that, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did a lot of work in the coffee
industry where there was so much focus on
[SPEAKER_00]: small farmers, folks forgot about the
labor that went into coffee.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm concerned about that happening
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm curious how you're factoring labor
into your work on social responsibility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's two parts.
[SPEAKER_02]: So one, she first asked about,
you know, what are we doing to kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: encourage positive consumers to kind of
engage in these types of products in this
[SPEAKER_02]: type of industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: And two, talk about the forces of labor
and how important that is to building an
[SPEAKER_02]: industry, more or less.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll start off with the second.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, we are one of the largest
employers in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been working with the county of
Mendocino and the CEO of the county very
[SPEAKER_02]: regularly.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've actually been talking to a couple of
the labor unions as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd be curious to get your card as we
kind of build this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think you're absolutely right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I think agriculture as large as
suffered from kind of improper treatment
[SPEAKER_02]: to small farmers and they're marginalized
workers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I came from Venezuela and I used to work
with actually coffee cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not sure exactly where your coffee
cooperatives work, but it's much in the
[SPEAKER_02]: same way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think right now in cannabis,
it's a different consciousness that these
[SPEAKER_02]: farmers have in a different culture that
people live in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's very much about that community,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think them at large, it's not never been
maybe because the profits have been so
[SPEAKER_02]: large, it's never been about the bottom
line.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really been about how do they share
this product with their farmers,
[SPEAKER_02]: with their neighbors, with the people that
work at their farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that ethos, we have to
preserve it and try to keep it forward as
[SPEAKER_02]: we keep on growing this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And secondly, addressing to the consumers
and the cannabis market, it's a tough
[SPEAKER_02]: task, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think we live in a very, very noisy
world, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We live in the attention economy,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Every brand is struggling to get the
consumer's attention.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I really believe that the best
marketing is a marketing that comes from
[SPEAKER_02]: the heart, that comes from talking about
values.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's really what we focused on.
[SPEAKER_02]: At Flocona, yes, we're like sustainable
and we're organic and we tick all those
[SPEAKER_02]: boxes of like the fact driven kind of
behavior patterns.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the end of the day, consumers
choose product because of an emotional
[SPEAKER_02]: connection, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: They'll pick up a brand or they'll read an
article or they'll see a clipping and
[SPEAKER_02]: they'll connect either emotionally with it
or not to that brand.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's kind of how we focused
on building kind of our customer base is
[SPEAKER_02]: always being true to what we believe and
kind of wearing our values kind of on our
[SPEAKER_02]: sleeves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you help me understand when you're
dealing with that many supply outputs,
[SPEAKER_01]: how you maintain quality control?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that in our kind of our
model, you know, we don't have a large
[SPEAKER_02]: scale farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't have all the work and all the
investments required to get that off the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the flip side, we work with so many
fragmented and separated farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we do have is a big farmer
relations team.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the farmer relations team is working
with the farmers to work on strain
[SPEAKER_02]: planning, strain mapping.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of a lot of what we're seeing
right now is that, you know, I think that
[SPEAKER_02]: industry's naturally moved towards,
you know, consistency and standardization
[SPEAKER_02]: and brand consumers at large look for that
in a brand that have the repeatable
[SPEAKER_02]: experience.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for us, we have to work very,
very closely with our farmers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we have monthly meetings with
them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have quarterly retreats with them.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're always constantly reviewing what
they're producing, what quality came out
[SPEAKER_02]: of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: We developed a kind of a grading system
internally at Flocona between triple A
[SPEAKER_02]: flower, double A flower, single A and
single B, which is the same grading system
[SPEAKER_02]: that happens in any other form of
agriculture, whether you go into the
[SPEAKER_02]: citrus industry or the coffee or the cacao
industry, there's a universal grading
[SPEAKER_02]: system.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've built that over the last few
years at Flocona.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we kind of open sourced it to a
lot of the co-ops in the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they've been able to give their input.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've been able to give their comments.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then we've then given that to kind of
ICFA, which is the International Cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: Farmers Association.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they've been, you know, they said this
then have been improved the grading system
[SPEAKER_02]: and have taken a kind of a life of itself,
got input from the market, from the
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're really trying to establish kind
of standards in the industry that we can
[SPEAKER_02]: all work with.
[SPEAKER_02]: And these are the same standards that
happen across all other industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say that kind of dealing with
the supply is about, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: having a baseline understanding of how we
talk about the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: The grading and the sorting is a key
component.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would say the second is just farmer
relations and just being really constantly
[SPEAKER_02]: involved with the community and being very
strategic.
[SPEAKER_02]: The challenge with cannabis is,
you know, you're already picking the
[SPEAKER_02]: strains today that you're planting in
March that are going to be harvested next
[SPEAKER_02]: October.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you have to have so much planning and
really have to predict what the market is
[SPEAKER_02]: going to want in the future.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a it's a tough task, but it's one
that we take on every day, really.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right, guys, we'll enjoy the rest of
the conference.
