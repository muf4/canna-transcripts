[SPEAKER_00]: But what I'm saying though is that it's
the point of sale that education can
[SPEAKER_00]: occur.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way this can occur is if people
who can control shelf space, which are
[SPEAKER_00]: larger entities, they're able to
understand that their criteria dictate
[SPEAKER_00]: that they produce things that fit into
that five categorical breakdown I gave
[SPEAKER_00]: earlier, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where they sell their product.
[SPEAKER_00]: The only way they get out of that loop is
to work collaboratively with a small farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Curaleaf was the example.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Curaleaf has a rough public opinion
because they've gone after home grows and
[SPEAKER_00]: they've done all kinds of crazy shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But nonetheless, when they sent their
fucking head of sales through a program
[SPEAKER_00]: that we worked with, I showed her the
program that we did at Humboldt where we
[SPEAKER_00]: tied small farmers into cookies and said,
do you see the impact it had on these
[SPEAKER_00]: small farms where their product is now
being elevated and promoted and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: giving them market share and it's giving
them validity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Instability.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and validity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The validity that you are, the problem in
America is that if you're not on top,
[SPEAKER_00]: what's that Ricky Bobby shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: You ain't first to last, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no second fucking place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Second place is first loser.
[SPEAKER_04]: First loser.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem with that is that's not
really true in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just this hyper, you know,
I want to say like macho fucking behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't really work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what you have to do is you got to
be able to say, okay, we're the biggest,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what we want is we want really quality
products in addition to the things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: can produce at our level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only way you can do it is in
collaborative form.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Curaleaf took the program that we
created in Humboldt and then copied it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I bumped into their head of sales
at one of the events and she was like,
[SPEAKER_00]: yep, she goes, we cleaned that shit out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes, the public absorbed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that means that it works for
Curaleaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will then be copied by other MSOs
because once you succeed in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody just copies you because people
really aren't inventive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I learned from businesses,
most people are only good at competing in
[SPEAKER_00]: a room they've been educated in.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you take them out of that room,
they drown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's kind of how I like to play
the cannabis game is I want to take you
[SPEAKER_00]: into a room you don't know where the fuck
you're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to drown you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to fucking drown you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the kangaroo drowns the dog.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to drown you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately, who am I not trying to
drown is the customer.
[SPEAKER_00]: The customer is who I'm trying to satisfy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I want is the customer to be able
to buy something that they desire.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I know is as a craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's beneficial to them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as a craft farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why we all smoke weed, because it's
something special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's beneficial to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just that the craft farmer means
small scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is no such thing as craft at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an oxymoron.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't touch it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can't do both.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't have cheap and best.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have an idea that's simple and
best.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when you put that fucking together,
it costs money.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can have one or the other,
but not both.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can have price, delivery, or quality,
but you can never have all three.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the rule of distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we have is the ability for
small farms to be able to say,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, let me release the products that were
not hot five, six, seven, ten years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a little prior to this turn of events.
[SPEAKER_00]: And why did they sell prior?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they were really, really
desirable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then a lot of those people.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because when somebody got that pound back
to wherever they got that pound,
[SPEAKER_02]: everybody loved it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They loved the weed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you remember getting that one bag of
weed from that one guy that one time?
[SPEAKER_02]: And you're like, oh my God, if I get that
forever.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the customer doesn't give a fuck about
the struggle at a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about your legacy story.
[SPEAKER_00]: The customer is legacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The customer was legacy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The customer is also engaged in a criminal
drug deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what makes them any less fucking
important than you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the one that produced it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Who gives a fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the one that bought it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You wouldn't have a business fighting by
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's about the genetics, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a legacy argument.
[SPEAKER_00]: Craft farmers fucking focus on their story
too much about their struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're telling someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in Colombia, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in the jungle of Colombia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was outside of Bichada.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we light up fucking Jenny and put on
the YouTube.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Colombians are in hysterics
laughing at the fucking, what they call
[SPEAKER_00]: them, hipsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: The hipsters.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the Colombians are working for
fucking 400 bucks a month at a level of
[SPEAKER_00]: work you couldn't handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been fucking with weed for
centuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're telling them about your
struggle and your hardship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're all cracking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: When other countries are laughing at them,
we used to be revered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we became less revered.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we didn't catch the fact that the
customer absolutely did everything we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: They took the same fucking risk.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody was taking a risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody took the risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the story isn't about my struggle.
[SPEAKER_00]: The story is about my desire to give you
something of quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: However hard I have to do to get it,
who gives a fuck?
[SPEAKER_00]: No one asks the Olympian, Usain Bolt,
that motherfucker ran a million fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: hours to really only run like 18 total
minutes on the track.
[SPEAKER_00]: His whole track career is like 18 fucking
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many hundreds of thousands of plants
are you going to look through to find the
[SPEAKER_02]: one that's actually going to do that thing
that's going to help that one person?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or it's just about your effort to produce
and give.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it has to be one of honesty where the
customer understands, I'm trying to meet
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need you to pay me for this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm not trying to fuck you over.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying to give you the best I can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm doing my part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a friend in Humboldt who is
weighing these decisions and exploring
[SPEAKER_01]: long flowering stuff, being unique,
but then how much you risk doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What canopy level does he devote to that
to try it out?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, no longer is there a bottleneck of
how much to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's no ceiling anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's all about if you can get rid of
it, if you have a customer that wants it,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you have that market that wants that
long flowering sativa, which in
[SPEAKER_02]: California, I would say right now,
that's the number one thing I hear from
[SPEAKER_02]: most dispensaries is, can we get some more
sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't even know what the fuck
that means.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just as a basic... Yeah, yeah,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Me too, me too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear it too and I'm laughing and I'm
like, what you want, you don't want to pay
[SPEAKER_00]: for though.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't want to pay for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What they want is they want these hybrids
that are trepidoline based.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, but that doesn't
indicate an ethereal high.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, trepidoline is connected to energy as
a fucking, as a terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: We can identify that its impact on the
human upon scent does this.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, there's zero fucking data.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's zero data on smoking it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So zero data on smoking it, but plenty of
data on aromatherapy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the cannabinoids and all the other
volatiles combined that make that effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what people want is they want what
they used to get from overseas production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was so diverse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it was also, you're equatorial,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're fucking with equatorial work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it depends where you were.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you were in Europe, it was coming out
of Morocco, Pakistan.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's hash though, but that's still
not going to be considered a sativa.
[SPEAKER_02]: The states, we had the sativas.
[SPEAKER_02]: The states, we had everything coming up
out of Colombia in the 50s and 60s.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had access to India though,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Europe has access to India.
[SPEAKER_00]: So India and those parts of Asia,
Africa feed Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: America was fed by hash moving from Asia,
and then herb moving from Colombia,
[SPEAKER_00]: and herb moving from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was our flow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jamaica was the weight of the layover
point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Jamaica was moving herb too,
but a lot of Colombian coming in was in
Mexico.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, Jamaica was just halfway between
Colombia and the states.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a great growing zone too.
[SPEAKER_00]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's still a type.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the thing is when people talk about
what they want, you realize you can't grow
[SPEAKER_00]: that in the United States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then we hybridize it, and we're
hybridized it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We modernize it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You modernize it and change it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I'm not getting the same clear lucid
effect that last house.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that's why we have to quantify that
lucid effect, and then be able to identify
[SPEAKER_02]: it in the phenohunt.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you can modernize things, look through
1,000 or 100,000 of them, and find that
[SPEAKER_02]: one that has the bud structure,
the COA you're looking for, but also
[SPEAKER_02]: carries through that effect that you
started off looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when people are asking for sativa
though, they don't give a fuck about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't care about anything other than
that part.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the problem is it's effect driven.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's really hard to do 100,000 plant
population sifts and accurately determine
[SPEAKER_00]: the qualities.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I think the most I've done in a
day was like 50.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where I ran through 50, and I pulled out
the two outliers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone challenged me and said,
there's no way you did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I said, I'll do it again tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me the whole batch again.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do it again.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you did this at what?
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant was growing, the plant was in a
bag?
[SPEAKER_00]: It was in a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had samples in a thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're fully sampling.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through 50 of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went through 50 of them and said,
these are the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: And someone was like, that's impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no, no, it's quick.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I'm calibrated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means that I'm pretty clear where
I'm sitting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Spent my whole life becoming a cannabis
calibration machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, where I'm believing that these
things stand out and I can explain why.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, respect, I feel that.
[SPEAKER_00]: This tastes great.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is this, by the way?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a Testerosa to a skittle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I want to say it's cherry pie,
black lime reserve, and a skittle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from Dutch Blues.
[SPEAKER_02]: I guess I can kind of taste the skittle in
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, the skittle is in the middle,
but light.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the lime and the cherry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is from Dutch too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even at the end of this, it's still super
tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it holds to the roach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's super resistant.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think there's a problem with consumer
education.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because again, it's just like,
I think lack of education has provided for
[SPEAKER_04]: this huge overflow of shit weed on the
market versus something good like this,
[SPEAKER_04]: where you're not going to roll a joint,
taste it at the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: But even if they were educated,
it doesn't change the fact that the
[SPEAKER_00]: production, the main problem in cannabis
to me, if I had to put my fucking finger
[SPEAKER_00]: around, say one thing about this that you
think is real, is that the customers were
[SPEAKER_00]: not considered in legal cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're a tax generator.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their only consideration is how much tax
can be drunken from their pockets in the
[SPEAKER_00]: deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's because that's what regulation
creates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Regulation creates industries that are
meant not on your happiness, but on the
[SPEAKER_00]: tax revenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you got that tax revenue,
everything's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one's asking the customer, what can you
afford?
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the price range that is reasonable
to you that would allow us to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: figure out what we have to do to make that
happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: How many of you really would like to have
ethereal?
[SPEAKER_00]: How often do you want to consume it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know the patterns because I research the
patterns, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I see- Just observe them throughout
life, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and I observe them through life,
but I also look at the data.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can use my intuition and then I can
ask questions and then use the data to
[SPEAKER_00]: prove the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I know is certain demographics
just do certain things no matter where we
[SPEAKER_00]: are.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you know where there's zones of
high sales and you have zones of no sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you want to be able to do is try
to understand how do we get the products
[SPEAKER_00]: that have the velocity into the right
velocity areas at the right rate of
[SPEAKER_00]: production so that we don't slow it down
so that they never get anything that is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be less than satisfactory.
[SPEAKER_00]: We all know that you can age herb well,
but when the herb leaves your farm,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's rarely refrigerated till sale.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's out of your control at that
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's out of your control.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where a major disconnect
between the farmer and the consumer is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Huge disconnect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the consumer just knows that they're
unhappy.
[SPEAKER_02]: The conversation is gone, where there used
to be a farmer-consumer conversation
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and that's where they made the sin of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so farmers can go to stores and talk
to some customers, but all you did was
[SPEAKER_00]: talk to a cluster of customers at one
counter or you were in the building
[SPEAKER_00]: sitting and people had to walk there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a desire to talk to you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you had one day and there was 364
other days you weren't there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many fucking potential customers
did you really catch?
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many days of the week can you go
sit in a dispensary?
[SPEAKER_00]: Who's running your operations?
[SPEAKER_00]: No craft farmer has squads of workers
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're a worker owner and part of the
distribution process.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the marketer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all them things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what it does is... You're the
regulator.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're the compliance officer.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're your own sales team.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're your own everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the only way that... So to me when
he was asking, what do you do with these
[SPEAKER_00]: really long flowering things, it's the
same thing that I do with odd products.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow weird shit all the time.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for the fun of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and what it does is it allows me
to... Because I meet so many people,
[SPEAKER_00]: it lets me say, hey, you want to check out
some really interesting shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I get some rosin in my pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll break out, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's the example it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't even smoke rosin that much
anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And my buddy sends me some rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where
[SPEAKER_01]: is this pocket?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, it's in here, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bam.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'll smell this right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just came out of the fridge at my
house.
[SPEAKER_00]: And thankfully it's cold here,
so it's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it was cold.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was shipped cold because it's winter.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so this is a Bicket OG from Lime
Rising out of Michigan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Bicket was a GMO that got
pollinated by a cherry pie, accidental
[SPEAKER_00]: pollination, except that Nick was able to
say, I went out the seeds turned out,
[SPEAKER_00]: cracked a bunch of the seeds, and lo and
behold, out comes this outlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just unbelievable quality, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can smell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's batter right there, boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Beautiful consistency.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think TerpWizard made these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I'm getting like strawberry,
cream, a little orange orange strawberry
[SPEAKER_02]: cream.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's got an interesting citrus to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It almost has like an alcohol that's
coming off of it, almost like when you're
[SPEAKER_00]: fermenting fruit to make like a fruit
booze.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can smell that sweetness coming from
the back end.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something like Hawaiian fermented
pineapple.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Killer product.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's stuff that's off the norm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what you're able to do is you take
stuff like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is what I would share with
somebody that I met.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you would ask the question,
that's what we're answering.
[SPEAKER_00]: That if one wants to grow some of these
odd varieties, what do you do with them?
[SPEAKER_00]: What you're doing with them is you're
using them as your differentiator and
[SPEAKER_00]: you're not necessarily producing even
enough to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're producing enough so that when
you're present in the world, you can say
[SPEAKER_00]: to people, these are the things that I'm
into that I would like to sell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you can let them experience and
then gauge the interest and talk about
[SPEAKER_00]: what would you be willing to spend for
this because I have to charge 22% more
[SPEAKER_00]: because I can't get it to the market any
fucking less.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm somebody that used to run 140 day
shit, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I mean, I went out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went out there to the 140 day fucking
like indoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would run, I was on a haze quest for a
while where I hooked up with, I had hooked
[SPEAKER_00]: up with Neville, but I hooked up with
Scott Blakey out of, at the time he was in
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Blakey was sending me every fucking
haze variety that I had boxes of this shit
[SPEAKER_00]: coming in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was going on this quest and I was
cracking up because- Some fire stuff came
[SPEAKER_02]: out of Switzerland.
[SPEAKER_02]: People don't think of Switzerland as an
epicenter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was they moved from Holland.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francisco was the birth of cannabis in
California in terms of medical cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francisco turns its back on the
medical community.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakland said, we will embrace you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how Oakland became the new
medical marijuana capital of California
[SPEAKER_00]: was that San Francisco birthed it,
rejected it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakland adopts it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oakland stands up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland is the hot spot in Europe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holland tightens up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland opens up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland compresses.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland opens up again right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Switzerland just went legal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the point of it is, was that I had
access to all this European haze stock
[SPEAKER_00]: from guys that were playing around with it
at every level.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every hybrid, every derivative of it,
I was getting stocked.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stuff you haven't seen since the 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kinds of crazy shit?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I went on this crazy run for a while
and I had a building that I could play
[SPEAKER_00]: with and I was just sifting and hunting
and looking and playing and learning of
[SPEAKER_00]: what it's like to go 142 days into a
flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it done yet?
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it done yet?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's not done yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to learn about- Then all of a
sudden sometimes you turn around and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: done.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the nuance is that any fertilization
more than optimal in the plant just folds
[SPEAKER_00]: up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you're having to learn how to
manipulate a plant that wants to be 25
[SPEAKER_00]: feet tall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get all that work done and you
realize that out of that population,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go 142 days and it's pretty good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to find the outlier,
someone's got to be able to commit a
[SPEAKER_00]: tremendous amount of detailed research
work to find it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now what is it worth and who's willing
to do it?
[SPEAKER_00]: How much of it can move into a market?
[SPEAKER_00]: It depends on the individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the problem with these varieties is
that they're really fragile and that's why
[SPEAKER_00]: they were created as flower because they
held together better because they're all
[SPEAKER_00]: equatorial so they always stayed moister
and softer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't crumble.
[SPEAKER_00]: You took an equatorial and put it into a
dry environment that shit turns into
[SPEAKER_00]: sawdust in a bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: Will not handle transit, does not handle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that creates problems for sellability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so to me what you do is you realize
that the market can only take so much of
[SPEAKER_00]: any one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what I do is I break up a division
into at least four or five categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because really a distributor wants indica,
sativa, hybrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Distro asks for three things.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have indica?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have a hybrid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it have color?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it over 25%?
[SPEAKER_00]: You answer one of those fucking questions
correctly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're selling some weed to a distributor.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the problem though is that...
Originally it had to come from the equator
[SPEAKER_02]: somewhere.
[SPEAKER_02]: It cuts out so much, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: But within that grouping though,
it lets you say, okay, well if they want
[SPEAKER_00]: some sativa then, and even though we're
going to say all cannabis is sativa
[SPEAKER_00]: because it is, that's interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, you got to give it a good pinch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's all hazy shit, that old shoe
leather.
[SPEAKER_02]: Super loose structure, but I bet you
there's probably all kinds of weird little
[SPEAKER_02]: things in there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It looks like a rice head or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the strongest herb I ever smoked
was, I was working out on this island
[SPEAKER_00]: called Panape, out in Micronesia,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you go from California to Hawaii,
continue on that same equatorial line and
[SPEAKER_00]: you go another couple thousand miles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get into the Micronesian island
chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you keep going a little further,
you start getting into New Guinea and then
[SPEAKER_00]: Australia, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're around that side of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on that island of Panape, I was in the
military then, but we were hanging out
[SPEAKER_00]: with this dude in the bar and there was a
brawl and we backed the guy up we were
[SPEAKER_00]: hanging out with.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I didn't know that the guy I was
hanging out with was really a criminal.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were just hanging out.
[SPEAKER_00]: But me and my partner, we fought with him
against them dudes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was so happy that he was like,
man, he goes, he finds a graze.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you really want?
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, man, I'm looking for some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he was like, oh, I got you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the next day we went to the other side
of the island and this cat in a little
[SPEAKER_00]: tiny pickup truck meets us and says,
I brought you some weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, right, where is it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And he pulls back the tarp and it was the
whole back of the pickup truck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was fucking great.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in the service though, so I'm like,
that's more than I can fucking take.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need this much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Much like I threw my backpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I filled my backpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I filled the backpack.
[SPEAKER_00]: They didn't even smoke it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then stashed it in the ship.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when I got to port and back home
in Hawaii, I shipped some to my buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm still not holding it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was getting drug tested constantly at
the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're getting constant drug tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: They would test you Friday night.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then Monday morning, they would be in
the bathroom with the piss test cups.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you come in the bathroom with the
fucking piss hard on.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no way you're telling them you
don't go to piss at 5 in the morning when
[SPEAKER_00]: you're holding your dick in your hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, no, I don't go to piss.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they get you on these Friday,
Monday fucking tests.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I was in the service when they were
skimming people out for dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was like, fuck.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had just fucking been in trouble as
a kid for dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just didn't want to fucking
embarrass my grandmother.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I didn't have a good grandmother,
I would.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my good grandmother, I won't embarrass
her.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I do my best not to get caught.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm holding the weed until I can have a
little break where I know I'm safe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I smoked it, I got so fucking
hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't figure out how to get the car
off the highway.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I kept driving in circles until,
finally, I came down and could navigate an
[SPEAKER_00]: off-ramp.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I sent it to my partner.
[SPEAKER_00]: This shit looked like, hey.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the worst looking herb you ever saw
in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I just knew that it was, and I was
already herb knowledgeable at that time,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I just knew that these people that
were cultivating and consuming it weren't
[SPEAKER_00]: casually using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had a relationship with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I knew that this equatorial cannabis
would be unbelievably psychoactive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sent it to my partner, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: He hits me up, and he's like, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, you sent me that shit,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, it looked like shit.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I didn't even think nothing of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, so I sat down, and I smoked a
joint on the toilet before I went to work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, by the time I was done
smoking the joint, I couldn't get off the
[SPEAKER_00]: toilet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't really navigate standing up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he goes, and I had to have my girl
call in and tell him I was sick.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was fucking dying, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, it was fucking brutal.
[SPEAKER_00]: He goes, can I have some more?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was some of the strongest herb I
ever smoked in my entire life,
[SPEAKER_00]: the impact it had on me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember driving that car around the
island of Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time I got to the off ramp,
I would panic and not be able to navigate
[SPEAKER_00]: getting the car off.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would drive around the island again
for three hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just was like, at some point,
I'll come down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just hoping the gas stays in the
rig.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's still between the white lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone said it was because of this or
because of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I said, no, no.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was because of the psychoactivity.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was just really unique.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it's a marriage of things that are
in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stuff we don't even understand yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I don't think we will.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's almost a theoretical stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope we don't.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's still terpenes that are being
named and cannabinoids that are being
[SPEAKER_02]: discovered.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like when you take toxins and
you mix them in the ground, they form new
[SPEAKER_00]: toxins.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can have toxicology experts to tell
you, hey, the dioxin does this.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we don't know what dioxin does when
it's mixed with fucking chromium.
[SPEAKER_02]: You start mixing alphabazolol in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, yes, yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: A little glyol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, some other stuff in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really know.
[SPEAKER_00]: How about this 0.3%?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's just see what happens with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes a new deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so for me, what you're looking at is
most farms are going to pick up clones
[SPEAKER_00]: from a nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of them, unless you're running your
own nursery, which is expensive,
[SPEAKER_00]: because you're having to actually keep
living plants alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a whole different full-time job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get it from a nursery.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you want to do is you want to get as
many nursery lists as possible and put
[SPEAKER_00]: them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you could, you could put them into
a fucking spreadsheet and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, give it to me by overproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to see some numbers come
out that are going to be unbelievably
[SPEAKER_00]: overproduced, where you're going to say,
listen, they know this is hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to flood the market with
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's going to happen is anybody in
those zones, if you don't catch this first
[SPEAKER_00]: little initial wave, you're sitting on a
river of it, because there's too many
[SPEAKER_00]: choices.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then you have to go through the list
and say, OK, where do we see reasonable
[SPEAKER_00]: numbers?
[SPEAKER_00]: And does that work for me in my situation?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because so much of the stuff that's being
created and worked on is from either mixed
[SPEAKER_00]: light or indigo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most operations that are doing outdoor are
not doing the release and testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're releasing outdoor for indoor
groups, you're fucking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're releasing indoor for outdoor
groups, you're fucking up, because you're
[SPEAKER_00]: extrapolating data that's not really
accurate.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're saying that this means that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not applicable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It lets you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use indoor heavily for flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it lets me go through 100.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can put 100 plants on a table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the only thing I'm looking for is
which one had the best mouth, which one
[SPEAKER_00]: flavored all the way through.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pull that one out, bump the rest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then I can take that outside.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it work outdoor?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately, what I'm seeking is a
transfer of quality, where growability I
[SPEAKER_00]: need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if I don't have quality as my primary
criteria, I can't compete, because now I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: in the mid-market, and I'm competing
against 500,000-pound players.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I have to go with really, really,
really full flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I have to be aware that not all
flavors are attractive.
[SPEAKER_02]: But some of the unattractive ones are
attractive to certain groups.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you need to make sure that you
understand how many people want cheese.
[SPEAKER_00]: It goes along regionally, though.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you're in Michigan, cheese and earth
are by far your two dominant flavor
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles that you see.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're in California, and you're
looking for some kind of citrus and some
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the Caribbean, you're looking for
fruits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where did the skunks go?
[SPEAKER_04]: The skunks fucking disappeared?
[SPEAKER_04]: Where the hell did those go?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the real skunks, man, I've been
digging for years, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't expect it to be this difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I find stuff that's skunky,
and we would say skunky just means that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's got a high sulfur content and it's
high volatility, so that when I touch the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, it releases and fills a room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I cut clones, when I'm cutting
clones and it fills a building with no
[SPEAKER_00]: combustion, no finished plant,
but the problem is it doesn't transfer to
[SPEAKER_00]: that ammonia-like skunk and what it did to
you, where it was an ultra-narcotic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the impact on you was profound,
where you never had such bloodshot eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You never had such a dry mouth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you were never so like, wow,
that stuff is sedative.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't find it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's gone, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm digging through.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm sure it exists somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: The genetics are still there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, this is somewhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it wasn't that I was trying to.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the stuff I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just hasn't been looked for in a long
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the stuff that I do is just
interest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: But just even the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have the smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't have the key.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've got some killer ones that I
got out of the mid-'80s out of Europe that
[SPEAKER_00]: are more like, they remind me really of
when you were a kid and you would drag in
[SPEAKER_00]: your shoe, your sneakers on the concrete.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pencil eraser, burnt rubber.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the one I got that was from the
first of the 80s that I got from Ringo
[SPEAKER_00]: when he passed away.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super pungent, but it's this musky
tropical fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the pungency of it is supernatural.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it had the same problem that acrid
skunk had, where you couldn't grow it in a
[SPEAKER_00]: house without it permeating through every
square inch of the fucking thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And without getting busted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it doesn't have the aggressive,
full-bodied smack you down.
[SPEAKER_00]: So back in the day, to me, skunk,
chemical, and gas are all the same
[SPEAKER_00]: category, because really they serve the
same purpose with extremely impactful
[SPEAKER_00]: highs.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things that have a very chemical scent,
things that have a very fuel scent,
[SPEAKER_00]: things that have a very skunk scent,
all of them are really aggressive on you
[SPEAKER_00]: in the smoke, in a very specific
direction, impactful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like slowed down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, I need it at times.
[SPEAKER_00]: Otherwise, my mind moves too fast,
and I wear out the people around me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's better if I consume weed.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're doing it for their benefit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm serious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have to slow the fuck down so that I
don't wear out my fucking family members,
[SPEAKER_00]: because my old man is a fucking lunatic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your wife wants to divorce you.
[SPEAKER_00]: So narcotic cannabis balances out with me
pretty well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I like ethereal stuff when I'm
working by myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just want to be able to mentally
just fucking fly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I use them in the way I need.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I can't find that exact profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people try to say, it didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have memories.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had a whole collection of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they were all in different
morphological forms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they weren't all the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of them looked like leafy cabbage.
[SPEAKER_00]: Others had full.
[SPEAKER_02]: And back then, a lot of stuff was grown
from seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what skunk was to one farmer was
slightly different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, completely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I had a collection of clones I lost in
201 in a raid.
[SPEAKER_00]: After I lost that collection in 201,
I didn't collect again for probably two
[SPEAKER_00]: and a half years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just produced.
