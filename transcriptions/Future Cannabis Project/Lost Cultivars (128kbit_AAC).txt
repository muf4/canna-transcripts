[SPEAKER_00]: Strawberry cough, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a deep question for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It would be something that no one in the
cannabis community knows.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the Rapture.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an old NL G13 hash plant cross from
North Carolina.
[SPEAKER_02]: The question was what do you regret losing
the most?
[SPEAKER_02]: I lost a plant that would have come out of
like the late 80s out of Brycelin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when you lit it, it looked like a
burning tire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I got so high when I smoked it that
I'd lay down on the couch and my girl
[SPEAKER_02]: would come in and I'd wake up and she'd be
wiping my face with the rag asking me if I
[SPEAKER_02]: was sick because I was feverish.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I would mumble, no, I'm just really
high.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had the most complete effect I've
ever experienced.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it was stunning cannabis in every
aspect.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a visual quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a growth rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had growth quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: It had a quality, a high that was unreal.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it got killed by mistake.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, oh, we'll go find more like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I realized quickly that that was a
memory.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that was the one I wish I had back
more than anyone.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was so green, it was almost like blue.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I used to call it like the blue
varietal.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it literally would make regular people
ill.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would fold you over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And kick you in the ass and send you home
and say, come back when you're grown up.
[SPEAKER_02]: The beauty of cannabis is that all of us
have that special thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I've always been trying to
explain to people, you don't have to be a
[SPEAKER_02]: big banker, but you got to bank a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to make sure you keep some stock.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got to make sure you're involved in
some breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't let anybody talk shit to you because
you're a pollen chucker.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're somebody who has historically done
what we've done since the dawn of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've chosen things to put together for
your desire.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when people ask me, you know,
what should I smoke?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I'm not qualified to tell you
because I'm not you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can put you into things and I can help
you understand why you like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But fundamentally, I'm not you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not qualified to tell you what you
should like.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like telling someone who they should
love.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not qualified.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know you lost something good,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've had a lot of stuff in your hand,
boy.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't cry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't cry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, my God, I lost the one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where you come in with the
sharing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like being a being breeding seeds
and taking these times.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like they're your children.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like that's like the one thing
it's like spreading that right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was like back in the, you know,
the early 90s and running into walls and
[SPEAKER_03]: getting losing these certain genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's like what was drove me back to
go to like Southeast Asia.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like finding this, you know,
that was happy pizzas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you've been to Cambodia,
but you eat this fucking pizza and you're
[SPEAKER_03]: tripping.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you're in Cambodia and there's a
different level to that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this was something when you could grow
this and it was a nice producer,
[SPEAKER_03]: it would grow under the man's need as well
here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you could put it in a mixed bag of
tricks and get fifty six hundred a pound
[SPEAKER_03]: for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It had different colors.
[SPEAKER_03]: It wasn't that name, but that's like these
some old Southeast Asian, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: these these long flowering times,
but just the soaring psychedelic highs and
[SPEAKER_03]: that different feeling.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's part of that backtracking and
finding what exactly like one of them was
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was reaching out to, you know,
with Ringo and like Jaime when this was
[SPEAKER_03]: when people were first introducing that,
you know, the Juanita la Gramosa and that,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, that can a tonic of those old
genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's like, OK, well, this was Oaxaca,
this region, Colombia.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, where were these things coming
from?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then trying to search those out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's like when you mentioned that
with Africa, what's is getting is we're
[SPEAKER_03]: losing this, you know, these unique ones
that are out there and it's being able to
[SPEAKER_03]: find these special ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: But at what point you want to share these,
but you don't want them to go under the
[SPEAKER_03]: wrong hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something we're going to be
facing right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Being breeders, I think, coming more and
more as we've got bigger players that are
[SPEAKER_03]: coming in and are just they don't realize
the time and the energy that's put into
[SPEAKER_03]: these certain cultivars and how rare and
special they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that that's something that we have to
protect.
[SPEAKER_03]: True, true.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think you lose it.
[SPEAKER_01]: The strawberry cough I lost that I had
right away, and I thought about it a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: like I've popped some beans and I haven't
found anything that was that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure it was the strawberry
cough because I've seen the cough and it
[SPEAKER_01]: had that, you know, that's very
distinguished, like real thick smoke,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was the first plant that we ever
remember.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did two plants under two lights and we
got six pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we were like, it was like blown away
the first time that ever happened.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was very easy to trim just these
little golf ball nugs, which most of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cough is not in the strawberry cough.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's his bigger, you know, denser,
fluffier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was was really anyways.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was it was really because I was
medicine for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: I came into cannabis from a bicycle
accident.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I was fucked up.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got hit by a car.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was fucked up really hard for a couple
of years and just like learning to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: weed, walking around the house,
smoking as much weed as I could.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was that strawberry cough that like
really was able to help me manage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was a damn shark's breath that I
lost it, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got stuck with the shark's breath
cutting and I hated that thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I took a cut and I thought it was a
strawberry and I messed it up and it was a
[SPEAKER_01]: shark's breath.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I could never get rid of that fucking
plant.
