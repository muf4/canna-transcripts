[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so Tom sent the SOS distress
call out because when I was here two weeks
[SPEAKER_05]: ago all these buds were looking beautiful
and And not so much anymore so we called
[SPEAKER_05]: our IPM specialist Saul in To come help us
out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and everything kind of went south
very quickly I went away for literally
[SPEAKER_01]: overnight to go visit a grow in Las Vegas
got back and Noticed right away the next
[SPEAKER_01]: morning that there was something wrong and
I know I didn't know what it was and it
[SPEAKER_01]: and It it was then quickly rampant.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me hear Tom bring the camera over here
We'll tell you exactly what it is.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this is what remember what I grabbed
last time that one caterpillar So look
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah, you can come over here and see his
buddy over here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Wait Tom first.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look do you see this one?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Right there right there right and then his
buddies hanging out over there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where's the other one or of the many?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh Wow, that one's huge Tom that one is a
fat caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's That's gorging itself and then the
other clear sign their turds everywhere
[SPEAKER_10]: Look around and you'll see them there As
they feed they just put their dry.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's a little black.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah pretty much You can see them on many
of the buds.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what is this that we're looking at?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the what are these?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just looking at some caterpillar
signs and symptoms.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, here's some more It's a very likely
that we were doing damage.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah But you can see it Basically where we
where we see our our foe Over here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's this guy?
[SPEAKER_10]: Where did he go?
[SPEAKER_10]: He's been roaming around here.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's been laying his turret And he's been
chewing everything here you see all that
[SPEAKER_10]: chewing damage Does it take just one to do
all this damage you have I've seen two in
[SPEAKER_10]: a bud.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but When you see this damage,
it's not long before you find them if you
[SPEAKER_10]: just start looking for them So you go you
look for this here looks like chewing
[SPEAKER_10]: damage and then you look for their turds,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: You already saw what those look like you
see that they're not far Is a great
[SPEAKER_10]: picture of a Caterpillar Feces right there
right where exactly leaf right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what that is.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me get this huge guy Where's the huge
one?
[SPEAKER_09]: Here's some more feces There looks like it
Look at it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This guy is his head buried into the Right
into the middle of the of the bud.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's something to shoot at Which one
their feces isn't always dark brown dark
[SPEAKER_10]: brown there's some lighter colors,
too Okay, so let me take a picture and
[SPEAKER_10]: then start down here, too You see that all
this you see these all that right there
[SPEAKER_10]: all the dark stuff doesn't all have to be
Dark brown other there's sometimes almost
[SPEAKER_10]: orange or even yellow yellowish brown
[SPEAKER_04]: Some fresh poo as violent as my daughter
tells me yeah chewing damage poop Look
[SPEAKER_10]: around and you'll find them and it's it's
important as soon as you see them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh Look here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's what I meant That's two different
colors.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, look at broad colors.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, he sees right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay So let me take a picture of that and
they're dried they look like yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: so that dry it can range it can range
anywhere between those those colors are
[SPEAKER_10]: Here's a bunch more right here,
it's actually looks like pellets Wow,
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah Easiest way to distinguish I don't
know if you can see that here come over
[SPEAKER_10]: here easiest way to distinguish between
slugs or snails and caterpillars because
[SPEAKER_10]: they do a lot a similar chewing oh So the
feces is the feces is caterpillar and
[SPEAKER_10]: slime trails is slugs and snails.
[SPEAKER_10]: Can you see that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_10]: I hope I can get that from you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Okay, so so is that pretty much the
main problem we have going on here I mean
[SPEAKER_05]: you see other well, this is all poop
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it looks like bud rot, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Did you one question ask is what was the
weather like before you left?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it overcast and kind of muggy or Not
particularly it was you know out here it
[SPEAKER_01]: hit that what the 117.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was super hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay weeks ago super hot Yeah,
and just a few miles from here.
[SPEAKER_01]: He hit the 121 in Woodland Hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we did have You know and yesterday
it was 105 one of you know, so it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: triple digits and but that was extreme
heat and Shortly before I loved mm-hmm The
[SPEAKER_05]: praying mantis have been slacking I mean,
I assume they they would chow on we're
dead.
[SPEAKER_01]: They would yeah if they're big enough I've
been so I mean I have a big enough you I
[SPEAKER_01]: did get a little complacent because I had
like two praying mantises in here They
[SPEAKER_05]: were all so it's interesting because when
we were here Two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: I saw a caterpillar and I took it off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I found one the other day I took it off,
but I didn't I obviously missed so so Some
[SPEAKER_05]: of some of this could come around this
side because the camera is right there So
[SPEAKER_10]: some of this could be partly because of
the caterpillar, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: so bud rot or Gray mold is botrytis
scenario It's a fungus that affects all
[SPEAKER_10]: kinds of different plants Strawberries and
grapes being other big crops that it's
[SPEAKER_10]: actually a big problem and Usually it's
something that Appears or shows itself
[SPEAKER_10]: Once you've got ripe fruit or in this case
right flowers, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: They have you know been growing and their
sugar contents high and That's exactly
[SPEAKER_10]: what but try this can grow on but But it's
a it's a disease and that's That's not all
[SPEAKER_10]: well.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was getting that the caterpillars will
wound the tissue and Spores find it easier
[SPEAKER_10]: to get into the plant tissue and and
germinate, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's a very common cause of a bud rot
and so they're almost symbiotic in a bad
[SPEAKER_01]: way Yes, I mean reading the environment
for the for the yeah Yeah, so you're
[SPEAKER_05]: seeing bud rot and caterpillar damage.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're seeing I'm seeing yeah Well,
I mean it's tough to see the caterpillar
[SPEAKER_10]: damage on the buds themselves because it's
just a hole You can't really see you can
[SPEAKER_10]: pull that guy out and you can see that
You'll see the hole No, let me do you have
[SPEAKER_05]: a knife or something to what about that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Here hold this yeah Tom goes into his
toolkit.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, what about the scissors sure?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah Yeah Want to show you something I see
here and something to focus I don't know
[SPEAKER_10]: if I don't know if I could go back in time
here, but Tom did you cut a Piece of these
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers off right here It looks like you
Yes, yeah, is that where you first saw it
[SPEAKER_05]: probably on this plan look through the
viewfinder when you're talking That was
[SPEAKER_05]: the one thing I noticed from the Steve
Cantwell video is what I'm saying,
[SPEAKER_05]: but you're You're like holding it over
here talking.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so here so you found Two two
specks of it here, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yes, and then you came in with a knife
where the thing is Pulled right off and
[SPEAKER_10]: pulled right off.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, but it was already in infected,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So some people are of the mind cut it if
I'm close to harvest and I can keep what's
[SPEAKER_10]: below Some are of the mind You know cut it
down low right eliminate another source of
[SPEAKER_10]: the spores, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: If you're early right like you are now,
you know, so well you were right I tried
[SPEAKER_01]: earlier Early on but I realized I mean it
happened so fast within literally a day I
[SPEAKER_01]: know within a day viewfinder that yeah
that it was out of my out of control Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't know what to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's it's quick.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah Yeah, it's like with any disease.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, so I guess my question is for
something This is obviously not a large
[SPEAKER_01]: grow if you do see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_10]: So What do you do when you see it?
[SPEAKER_10]: Basically, I can do is what we call
roguing You know you remove tissue.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's about what you can do if you find a
caterpillar in here You're gonna look down
[SPEAKER_10]: below You see all these turds that drop
down on all these buds below could have
[SPEAKER_10]: been he was just feeding up here Looks
like he was feeding up here But all these
[SPEAKER_10]: all that feces that dropped onto these
very right flowers And then given the
[SPEAKER_10]: right conditions those contain spores,
too I mean if he had been feeding on them
[SPEAKER_10]: at that not just that, you know,
they begin to decompose The tissue around
[SPEAKER_10]: where they land it also begins to
decompose It's usually that combination of
[SPEAKER_10]: like something wet and the caterpillar
feces and then it it blows up so get rid
[SPEAKER_10]: of that cola and If that's where it
started and do a major so looking because
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously those are in much worse these
have Sort of been trying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah to maintain themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Are these too far gone?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you can still save this for extract
There's you know, you'll get some extract
[SPEAKER_10]: there but But get in there every hour that
passes stand right there every hour that
[SPEAKER_10]: passes is lower yield, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Because you're not gonna get much out of
these dried up, you know Yeah pieces of
[SPEAKER_10]: flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So basically if you start noticing it's
almost like you want to chop early to save
[SPEAKER_10]: what you have it may not be perfect but
Yeah, yeah, I mean if you could afford to
[SPEAKER_10]: you could liquid what we would do where I
where I managed IPM is You know that it
[SPEAKER_10]: was kind of susceptible strains were
susceptible to this this fungus.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you'd start seeing it blowing up on a
particular particularly sensitive strain
[SPEAKER_10]: You would see I'm gonna take a picture you
might harvest that early for you know for
[SPEAKER_01]: fresh frozen So say you haven't seen any
of the bud rot, but you've seen a couple
[SPEAKER_01]: of the caterpillars What is their pest
management we can do to sort of keep these
[SPEAKER_01]: caterpillars?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's there are lots of strategies
The caterpillar at this stage that we saw
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's not much else other than picking
them off Because the materials that you
[SPEAKER_10]: might use at that advanced stage aren't
allowed in California cannabis,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Which are what?
[SPEAKER_10]: Substances their natural substances called
spinosad's Number of products have them.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a stomach neurotoxin for for insects
the insect shoes on plant Material that's
[SPEAKER_10]: been sprayed with it and it it basically
poisons itself, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's something you'd want to do
during veg when it's yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean you would you can't though.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not So the other you know,
this is This could be done this could be
[SPEAKER_10]: done when it's just starting let's put it
that way and if and if you see big
[SPEAKER_10]: Caterpillars, you're not gonna get them
with the other strategies only spray
[SPEAKER_10]: strategy You might have with a big
Caterpillar is to spray spinosad's what
[SPEAKER_10]: which we can't and that's kind of a
question that Tom was asking is what can
[SPEAKER_10]: we do at this stage?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what about if you first see a
caterpillar?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so that that's yours That's where
the answer lies.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, okay is If any of you heard the
other Video or streaming that we stream
[SPEAKER_10]: that we did you probably you probably
recognize that I'm big on monitoring,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So you need to know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: Caterpillars and their adults look like
and when they're present as soon as
[SPEAKER_10]: possible.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that usually comes in in in catching
the flying adults right so males and
[SPEAKER_10]: females Will meet up with each other.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll fly male will you know mate with
the female female will go off and lay
[SPEAKER_10]: eggs, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're good about monitoring for
moths, right you catch that before all
[SPEAKER_10]: that Exchange has gone on right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So and then what like you you might so you
see them How do you prevent those them
[SPEAKER_01]: from laying their eggs?
[SPEAKER_10]: So you you you trap right?
[SPEAKER_10]: There's very little you can you can do to
like reduce their numbers But it's really
[SPEAKER_10]: important at that point to identify the
species that you've got right and it's
[SPEAKER_10]: hard to do it from looking at the moths So
for instance that one is That one looks
[SPEAKER_10]: like it's like the cornea worm,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So would this be like like the white moss
that I see flying around everywhere is
[SPEAKER_10]: that one?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it is a white moth.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm really bad at moths and butterflies
But yeah, I think it is it's like it's not
[SPEAKER_05]: like a monarch butterfly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know wait it is and it's a Brahms
Sorry, it's helicoverpa zea and I think
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a brown one So I have a question like
looking up here at at all of these up here
[SPEAKER_01]: Did where the caterpillars hitting each
one of these or is there I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't think so if this is You know,
but try this it does look very dried up
[SPEAKER_10]: and then yeah, usually it's You know
something going on within the plant
[SPEAKER_10]: usually yeah the Botrytis has actually
entered the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, not not the whole plant but the
tissue that's affected now, maybe The
[SPEAKER_10]: botrytis flared up on you because of some
some climate event like some Humidity or
[SPEAKER_10]: something that happened, but then after
the heat this is this could be why you got
[SPEAKER_10]: all this quick Browning.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you know because the tissue was dead
already.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you just probably weren't aware of
the symptoms I mean we'd have to we have
[SPEAKER_10]: to break some of these buds open so that
you could see what Although there is a lot
[SPEAKER_10]: of caterpillar damage.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a lot of this could have been from them
Yeah So this was not just caterpillars
[SPEAKER_10]: although geez I'm finding Yeah,
and I didn't think that one should have
[SPEAKER_05]: had any So basically you're seeing a
one-two punch of botrytis and caterpillar
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah, yeah the disease that Here's this
for you another seed What's that a seed
[SPEAKER_10]: nice yeah, so there's a disease and then
there's I guess effectively what you might
[SPEAKER_10]: call it the vector all that's not really a
vector it's there's what's causing a
[SPEAKER_10]: Susceptibility to the plant and then it's
the the caterpillars injuring it Yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: right but back to monitoring if you if you
can ID mods Those are gonna come in
[SPEAKER_10]: earlier, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so mods are Hard to control there
are strategies, but They're very difficult
[SPEAKER_10]: for the ones that are normally attacking
cannabis but That could be the trigger for
[SPEAKER_10]: certain applications for example the the
Bti have you heard of Bti?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a Listerine Genesis Good idea Also
listen there's these plants over here
[SPEAKER_01]: while you're talking all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've got a few more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you see You're getting it here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just very bad.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah And
[SPEAKER_10]: here you don't see the chewing damage You
might be some here, but I doubt it
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I'm seeing feces right here that
looks like feces I Would say a good chunk
[SPEAKER_10]: of it is because of that feeding I mean
these They seem to be in a lot of your
[SPEAKER_10]: buds like Right there, so there was a
caterpillar here at one point feeding It's
[SPEAKER_10]: possible it's It's a primary reason,
huh?
[SPEAKER_10]: I Mean, I've not seen I can't find them
either.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the other part.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah Yeah, but yeah, there's quite a bit
if you look in here That's a clean flower
[SPEAKER_10]: right there right more or less.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but it's just been completely shot
on And yeah, so any humidity change any
[SPEAKER_10]: injury just The fact that you have a
little fermenting Little compost pile of
[SPEAKER_10]: caterpillar turds on tissue.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's already Well advanced and nearly
ripe close to harvest.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's it's setting yourself up
for another site where Where the fungus
[SPEAKER_10]: can blow up on you, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right and then the spores from this plant
here Looks like this cola appear you cut
[SPEAKER_10]: back to right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you took it you chop this one off,
too When you first saw it, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: So he started up it started up here can
send it that way you have more injuries or
[SPEAKER_10]: really soft tissue and then you get the
right weather conditions and Now you've
[SPEAKER_01]: spread it that way It sounds like once
it's it's spreading.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of hard to uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah very difficult There's really I mean
this one looks actually well now there's
[SPEAKER_05]: the bud rot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah Top cola and what's interesting what
we've been finding a lot of is almost
[SPEAKER_10]: every diseased Even the this kind of the
less diseased buds are covered in
[SPEAKER_10]: caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_10]: You see so I At this point, I might say
it's the main reason.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean it's Any flower that's got any so
you think the caterpillar just overwhelmed
[SPEAKER_10]: it and then the betrays a weird part is
that we only found those two but that was
[SPEAKER_10]: a quick glance and Yeah, it's that's what
I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I've been out here every day
looking at caterpillars It's hard to find
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You saw they're green.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is like for it's like a grow where
you only have a couple plants They're not
[SPEAKER_05]: like all bunched up.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not hot and humid and no air
circulation You know, there's there's
[SPEAKER_10]: there's also strain susceptibility.
[SPEAKER_10]: So are you are you aware with the disease
of the disease triangle?
[SPEAKER_10]: I've heard of that before it's this
concept that was developed and Related to
[SPEAKER_10]: disease implants, but it's the same for
humans disease disease triangle consists
[SPEAKER_10]: of it's a way to explain how disease
Happens how it proceeds and now can Damage
[SPEAKER_10]: you economically, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: There's three components to it.
[SPEAKER_10]: The first component is the presence of
Whatever pathogen so what come out of the
[SPEAKER_10]: heat good idea Whatever pathogen we're
talking about right in this case.
[SPEAKER_10]: It would be actually botrytis scenario
right Spores could be the presence but
[SPEAKER_10]: there's also what are called sclerotia and
that's it's Near the end of the season it
[SPEAKER_10]: goes into a sort of like a hibernation
type, you know suspended animation
[SPEAKER_10]: basically, it's a survival structure and
then that structure can stay in the area
[SPEAKER_10]: and Once again germinate in the right
conditions when there's on in the next
[SPEAKER_10]: crop You know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, it can survive on plant debris.
[SPEAKER_10]: It can survive on rich soil I mean it can
survive in rich soil So it's just waiting
[SPEAKER_10]: there to germinate again.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the presence is is One of those
components of the disease triangle
[SPEAKER_10]: Obviously, then there's the susceptible
host, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's where I was getting here This is
obviously a susceptible host.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a problem in all cannabis production
grape grapes also, it's a problem in many,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know vineyards In strawberries,
it's also a problem in strawberry.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're talking about hosts that will can
be parasitized by the fungus, right and
[SPEAKER_10]: And yeah, if we think about it,
we've got different susceptibilities,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a in the vineyards, for example
There are a couple grapes that are very
[SPEAKER_10]: thin skinned varieties That are much more
susceptible To the botrytis sponge.
[SPEAKER_10]: They call it bunch rot in vineyards versus
a loose Versus a hard skinned grape right
[SPEAKER_10]: that has you know, tight tight little
berries.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're less susceptible They're not it's
not as easy for the fungus to penetrate
[SPEAKER_10]: the tissue So varietal differences in
grapes make it make a difference.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_10]: They also do in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know what strains you have here,
but If you have those susceptible strains
[SPEAKER_10]: You you can see the difference between you
know, five percent in one strain Let's say
[SPEAKER_10]: and thirty percent in another strain,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So strain is big.
[SPEAKER_10]: We still don't understand that very well
mirror implore Cannabis growers to take
[SPEAKER_10]: notes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are there certain pasts like you say
even Just for a small home grow like this
[SPEAKER_01]: that I might want to keep around to sort
of counteract the butterflies or the yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: let me get to that so The last component
of the disease triangle is actually the
[SPEAKER_10]: environmental conditions for the disease
to infect right And basically the concept
[SPEAKER_10]: of this disease triangle is you have to
have all three of those components present
[SPEAKER_10]: in order to have disease or Have disease
that's economically You know problematic,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: If you can break with one if you can
control one you can control the disease,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you had if we had a kind of a strain
that was not susceptible to To you know to
[SPEAKER_10]: this to the fungus Zero percent
susceptibility and you grew only that
[SPEAKER_10]: guess what you broke that triangle there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You eliminated a susceptible host,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Another part of susceptibility we talked
about it the chewing damage caused on the
[SPEAKER_10]: on the on the flower being an area where
the fungus can infect and get to the
[SPEAKER_10]: tissues easily and quickly and Feed on it
and sporulate and pretty soon destroy that
[SPEAKER_10]: but alright, so if you don't have that
damage Then you've not you've made it less
[SPEAKER_10]: susceptible whatever host it is so you can
see how you can focus on these areas,
[SPEAKER_10]: so the big one for botrytis honestly is is
environment environment is by far the
[SPEAKER_10]: largest the most important part of that
disease triangle so That doesn't look too
[SPEAKER_10]: tight let's put it that way but what I
mean by that is fungus likes humidity
[SPEAKER_10]: fungus like likes a certain range of
temperature if you grow plants too tight
[SPEAKER_10]: to their canopies or to Yeah, you're not
you won't allow for airflow.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, we were talking about botrytis
and grapes The the two susceptible grapes
[SPEAKER_10]: that I that I was talking about the
thin-skinned ones also have very very
[SPEAKER_10]: tight bunches, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So if a spore gets in there, there's no
way to change the environment in that
[SPEAKER_10]: cluster To be other than just humid and
dark right and when the grapes get sweet
[SPEAKER_10]: now, it's got food, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So you've you've got this strain.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's got a tight grip tightness Cluster
formation whereas a loose one like you see
[SPEAKER_10]: in table grapes You know how you you you
can see every grape inside the cluster on
[SPEAKER_01]: table grapes So not as susceptible even if
these plants had been a farther apart They
[SPEAKER_01]: still the nature of these plants was the
large leaves.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were growing abundantly Yeah,
leaving a lot of shade underneath and
[SPEAKER_01]: probably still a lot of opportunity for
The bugs to be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean it I've not seen this before where
every bud Seems to have some feces.
[SPEAKER_10]: So a big I think a big part of it must
have been the caterpillars but but I mean
[SPEAKER_10]: again, what strain is this?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you have?
[SPEAKER_05]: What's the high CBD strain it's it's a
high CBD cross by with an alien fire So we
[SPEAKER_05]: know it's like harlequin, you know even
less about but what's interesting is these
[SPEAKER_05]: are these are two different Cultivars,
so all these over here one, but those are
[SPEAKER_05]: all autos that are totally different.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mm-hmm And this this one that over here
that was simply destroyed just that was an
[SPEAKER_01]: auto Now these here are newer ones and
they haven't been quite Affected yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are our younger plants this one.
[SPEAKER_10]: However, you're not yes, that's probably
not gonna go very far Yeah, and you've
[SPEAKER_06]: already got it there that won't go very
far I think and I think I can see in here
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, you've got quite a bit of feces down
here so and you got quite a bit right
[SPEAKER_06]: there so Wow, well, how about this?
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so what what keeps the caterpillars
back?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's our yeah, so, okay Well,
I wanted to wanted to talk about that
[SPEAKER_10]: disease triangle just cuz you know,
then you You see the impact of the of the
[SPEAKER_10]: caterpillar, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's making a host more susceptible right
sit on the couch.
[SPEAKER_10]: So obviously this destroying that
particular component of the disease
[SPEAKER_10]: triangle is You know, it's gonna be
helpful to ending the disease or keeping
[SPEAKER_10]: it from hurting you economically,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's the strategy?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we talked about monitoring.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the foundation All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: You want to know as early as possible,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: You have a you have an insect who's gonna
lay eggs They're gonna hatch or we're
[SPEAKER_10]: gonna want to feed you've got some time
before that happens to put in some control
[SPEAKER_10]: out action for for caterpillar so Fastest
that the earliest sign would be when the
[SPEAKER_10]: adults are flying into your grow,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So monitoring for the moths is super key,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it's very very important.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of ways to monitor for the
moths But when you see them you can begin
[SPEAKER_10]: initiating actions that Don't even require
for the larva to be out and about yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right such as You can be you can Start
your bacillus thuringiensis.
[SPEAKER_10]: I was saying BTI.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a another it's a bacteria that When
the caterpillar feeds on it, it grows in
[SPEAKER_10]: its stomachs and its stomach in it So so
would that be like a foliar spray or
[SPEAKER_05]: something or spray?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so you'd put it what like in water
and yeah, it would be a foliar spray,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You see you see the mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have used that I mean, why wouldn't
someone just use that anyway as a
[SPEAKER_01]: precautionary measure?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you know, there's philosophies about
not wanting to spray For any number of
[SPEAKER_10]: reasons, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, there's there's there's disease
and there's potential for burn and then
[SPEAKER_10]: there's there's expense, you know,
every spray is labor and material I turn a
[SPEAKER_10]: number of reasons why not to but you'd
make a very good point This this
[SPEAKER_10]: particular bacteria specific to
caterpillars It really doesn't it doesn't
[SPEAKER_10]: really hurt any other insect or any other
animal So it's pretty safe for the plant
[SPEAKER_05]: like an aphid wouldn't really be effective
But that's not at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it's specific.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it's I guess you could call it a
disease It's it's a disease specific for
[SPEAKER_01]: caterpillars Well for me in particular
knowing that I really have a caterpillar
[SPEAKER_01]: problem back in this yard.
[SPEAKER_10]: It might make sense Yeah, all the dog food
and you can decide, you know, yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: absolutely.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm aware.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been working with some Cold crop
growers and Salinas and right now Salinas
[SPEAKER_10]: and other parts of the cold crop cold
crops like cabbage That kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay the Salinas is going through a big
problem with diamondback moth and They're
[SPEAKER_10]: using these sprays for the caterpillars
and some of the growers have sprayed geez
[SPEAKER_10]: like a dozen times and you know where they
would have only done three sprays and in
[SPEAKER_10]: in previous years and it's just this real
big problem and there will be years where
[SPEAKER_10]: certain caterpillars are going to be more
problematic than others, but you're right
[SPEAKER_10]: if if you kept up on it early enough You
can put those sprays out and what's
[SPEAKER_10]: important to know about those sprays is
the caterpillar has to feed on them but
[SPEAKER_10]: once the caterpillars Advanced in other
words far along on its development one of
[SPEAKER_10]: the later larval stages They're not
they're not as susceptible anymore to it
[SPEAKER_05]: So like our friend right here would be an
example of you would probably yeah He
[SPEAKER_10]: would just he would eat the the BTI Gemma.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you be our caterpillar model?
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you show it?
[SPEAKER_05]: You just put your hand out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, he would eat the BTI and then just
Give you the finger.
[SPEAKER_10]: That is some caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so all right, so Early at so there
aren't like okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what else what other what else can you
do?
[SPEAKER_10]: So so so when the caterpillar is young and
it feeds on this stuff, that's when it
[SPEAKER_10]: gets Okay, you if you can put that stuff
out right about when they're hatching So I
[SPEAKER_05]: saw yeah, we saw some pretty small
caterpillars about two weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that would have been it You could apply
like four weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: We should have sprayed you had if you had
known right the week before that and had
[SPEAKER_05]: started eagle eyes on the Well,
we saw them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just didn't I would have done all of
you.
[SPEAKER_05]: I didn't know Tom was feeding them Instead
of instead of yeah, that's what I'm here
[SPEAKER_10]: for But yeah, you know that's that's
strategy there's more good to it than bad
[SPEAKER_10]: that usually The formulations for that
bacteria aren't really dangerous and
[SPEAKER_10]: sprays So they're very safe sprays and you
know, if you're doing it everything right
[SPEAKER_10]: way And you get those on early enough and
you can't just do it once and expect it to
[SPEAKER_10]: work you know, you've got to come back at
whatever the label recommends and and Just
[SPEAKER_10]: just know I can't find the eggs.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know where the tiny larva are.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're really difficult to find They're
green.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're smaller than than most of the
leaves.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you're not gonna find them always there
that they're in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're Chewing if they chew on this if
they just happen to chew on a leaf that I
[SPEAKER_10]: sprayed with this then they're toast and
Control can be achieved now before that
[SPEAKER_01]: that part like Keeping like even trying to
do something so that you don't have to
[SPEAKER_01]: spray Would that be just limited to like
trapping the moths or because I'm outside
[SPEAKER_10]: mass trapping for mass trapping for for
moths is is Really that I know not a
[SPEAKER_10]: really good strategy for control because
they can fly in from everywhere But if you
[SPEAKER_10]: want to dive in a little deep There are
pheromones and you know what pheromones
[SPEAKER_10]: are right?
[SPEAKER_10]: They're what males or females emit to
attract the other sex for mating There are
[SPEAKER_10]: some all moths.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is how females attract males through
pheromones, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean they they they could be miles away
even and the male can pick up the scent,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well for some of the some moths not many
and actually None yet that I know of that
[SPEAKER_10]: that Hits the the cannabis plant,
but but you know, we never know when one
[SPEAKER_10]: of these mods that I'm talking about will
start hitting us We've been scientists,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know have been able to Synthesize
these pheromones in the lab and then you
[SPEAKER_10]: can use something that's called mating
disruption So if you take the synthesized
[SPEAKER_10]: pheromone you put it in your farm You put
it, you know, you distribute it through
[SPEAKER_10]: your farm and you have this huge cloud of
pheromone like a like a million or a
[SPEAKER_10]: Trillion females are in that field Would
attract all the males it'll attack track
[SPEAKER_10]: the males, but the strategy is where is
she?
[SPEAKER_10]: He's blind and there's this huge cloud
that he uses himself to guide himself
[SPEAKER_05]: directly to where she is So if there are
females you scrambled his radar everywhere
[SPEAKER_05]: and he can't find the female so he can't
mate Yeah, that's called mating because
[SPEAKER_05]: where I thought you were going is like,
you know when I was growing up We always
[SPEAKER_05]: had beetle traps where you have the
pheromones to which attract Them and they
[SPEAKER_05]: go into the trap that they can't get out
of and you have a thousand in there the
[SPEAKER_10]: next day There are some Some pests where
that really works effectively.
[SPEAKER_01]: I thought you were going where we put the
Merit pheromones near a pigeon and then so
[SPEAKER_10]: they'll start mating with pigeons Yeah,
yeah anyway But yeah, but like I said as I
[SPEAKER_10]: said there's there aren't very many
Species where we have these pheromones for
[SPEAKER_10]: we do have a Few I know I used to battle
light brown apple moth in in herbs and
[SPEAKER_10]: there happened to be a mating disruption
pheromone and that's exactly one of the
[SPEAKER_10]: arms of the strategy we used as well as
the BT sprays well it sounds to me like
[SPEAKER_05]: have you seen something of this Decimation
scale in a in a commercial grow recently
[SPEAKER_10]: The odd part is is I can't find the
caterpillars, but I can see all Their
[SPEAKER_10]: feces in there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So they're crap.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it's about looking.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure there's more I mean it took me
about what two minutes to find two of
[SPEAKER_10]: them, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Look look in the fluffy flowers Yeah,
so again, I don't think mating disruptions
[SPEAKER_10]: a good strategy for cannabis because we
just don't have You know, we barely know
[SPEAKER_10]: which caterpillars are gonna hurt us and
the ones that are hitting us I don't
[SPEAKER_10]: believe we have mating disruption.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you've got is that pheromone
applicable?
[SPEAKER_05]: To all different butterflies and moss or
like only one species species specific
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not even it's not even a family
specific, you know, like insects have
[SPEAKER_05]: families So you'd really need to know
which one is infecting your plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: So like that was cornea worm, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: But what's the strategy there?
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well There's nothing specific for cornea
worm But but we'll get to the bio control.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so so the pheromone wouldn't work
for cornea cornea Worm, but the BT toxin
[SPEAKER_10]: would work right?
[SPEAKER_10]: What else is available?
[SPEAKER_10]: Then you can talk about you know Macro,
you know predators beyond just the
[SPEAKER_10]: bacteria.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a micro predator, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a parasite of the of the caterpillar
right there are what are called the
[SPEAKER_10]: parasitic wasp the Okay, trick of grandma
wasps.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Have you heard of these?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so Wasps are really interesting
order of insects in that they're very
[SPEAKER_10]: commonly parasitic Their lifestyles is
parasitic.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm sure you've heard of the tarantula
hawk and how it It'll inject its eggs into
[SPEAKER_10]: a tarantula and then the eggs the larva
will eat the tarantula from inside out New
[SPEAKER_10]: adult hatches right or emerges,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: There happened to be small teeny wasps The
same thing with yeah except except that
[SPEAKER_10]: they inject their eggs into the moths
eggs, so they'll Search for and find the
[SPEAKER_10]: cluster of eggs or the individual eggs and
inject their egg and then during the
[SPEAKER_01]: development So you want so say you were
gonna do a wasp treatment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would want to do that Yes,
when you have the food available for them
[SPEAKER_10]: when you've got it's they're not eating
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: No.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's not if it's not food Yeah,
they're putting their eggs.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're putting their eggs in them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so you need to know why wait Why
wait?
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, have them have them there so they
will so if you if you Bring the wasp and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're not gonna go away.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're gonna stick around.
[SPEAKER_10]: They will go away Yeah, so that's the
thing is you know, they will be they will
[SPEAKER_10]: search for caterpillar eggs and then if
they find a Hornworm egg and it happens to
[SPEAKER_10]: be one of the ones that species that likes
hornworm there in your in your tomatoes
[SPEAKER_10]: Then they might just fly over there and
and work on that and then eventually get
[SPEAKER_10]: distracted and go look But that's the
whole point with monitoring.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's say you spot the adult you you know
how to identify the cornea Worm adult
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's when you start your BT sprays,
but you also start your wasp releases
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, and you can you do so we would we
would like you guys breed parasitic wasps
[SPEAKER_05]: So we would bring a container and Tom
would what like just put it like at the
[SPEAKER_10]: base of the there's a couple options.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's There's loose eggs that you can
put they're not eggs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Actually.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're pupa They are the eggs of another
moth right that was that have have a
[SPEAKER_10]: Develop what about all the feces?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you tell from the feces what we're
dealing with?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's really difficult You mean like which
caterpillar I mean small feces might mean
[SPEAKER_10]: a small species of caterpillar But it
could also mean a larval a younger larval
[SPEAKER_10]: stage of a big species of catch all right,
whatever But no the the way to do it and
[SPEAKER_10]: it's even difficult.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's even difficult collecting the you
know when you collect the individual
[SPEAKER_10]: Caterpillars because you know,
they go through numerous stages.
[SPEAKER_10]: They molt through their Life stages,
so and they don't look identical.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have a slide on a presentation which has
Five different looking caterpillars and I
[SPEAKER_10]: asked people how many caterpillars do you
see here?
[SPEAKER_10]: They say five I say no, that's the same
one It's just different larval stages.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you you got a kind of at some point you
guys Sometimes have to rely on an expert
[SPEAKER_01]: with the so yeah, not only do you need to
monitor?
[SPEAKER_10]: But you need to be idea and entomologist
because here's the thing Is those wasps
[SPEAKER_10]: there are different species of us and like
we rear three, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Sure tend to target different species of
moths So if you release the wrong one,
[SPEAKER_10]: you might as well not be releasing at all.
[SPEAKER_10]: No doubt, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So you got to know not just which ones you
have but which other ones, you know You
[SPEAKER_05]: may have more than one caterpillar Okay,
so so challenges are huge parasitic wasp
[SPEAKER_05]: only Focuses targets one type of
caterpillar egg.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, they do Cross over to different
things.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's just it's just the research has shown
That this particular wasp can can control
[SPEAKER_10]: this particular Caterpillar in these
crops.
[SPEAKER_10]: Whereas this one can't even though it may
on occasion inject its larva Maybe it's
[SPEAKER_10]: not a preferred choice for it or maybe
just didn't evolve on that particular
[SPEAKER_10]: Caterpillar and the egg is not viable and
or the larva dies, you know, it's just
[SPEAKER_10]: almost you know The research had that
there had to be a lot of research and
[SPEAKER_10]: you'll often see where these trichogramma
wasps will all target one species But
[SPEAKER_10]: there may be one that's Really good at
controlling it.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so that's why you want to know
what you got.
[SPEAKER_10]: Who are they?
[SPEAKER_10]: What's where when did they come and and
who are they and you can distinguish
[SPEAKER_10]: Caterpillars not just by their appearance,
but their moths.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if you're catching a big Dark moth and
you're also catching this little tiny
[SPEAKER_10]: yellow moth That's two species,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, that was gonna be my question.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you think Tom has multiple species of
we only saw that that that cornea worm?
[SPEAKER_10]: But I didn't but we saw two of them.
[SPEAKER_10]: We thought there's yeah, they're the
species.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so So possibly there's another one,
but it could just be it could be but we
[SPEAKER_10]: haven't found it, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah, there could be although it's not
so the cornea species Is there a specific
[SPEAKER_05]: parasitic wasp species that love?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's you know, the trichogramma is like
I said at a I can give you more details on
[SPEAKER_10]: a list of you know We have three species
of trichogramma of a list of what which
[SPEAKER_05]: ones they tend to prefer and can't have
been shown to control So next season we
[SPEAKER_05]: would be we bring those out early yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's always preventative.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean I I'm I Focus on biological
control, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I've been doing pest management now for
six years in different different crops
[SPEAKER_10]: several different crops But the the bulk
of those years have been putting together
[SPEAKER_10]: what what are called bio intensive IPM
programs basically they're founded on on
[SPEAKER_10]: the idea that we're gonna try to control
our pests and diseases with biological
[SPEAKER_10]: agents such as that you that okay continue
but such as BT that's a bacteria At these
[SPEAKER_10]: wasps, they're also they're they're also
they're insects, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And there are other predators of
caterpillars, too So that is kind of so
[SPEAKER_05]: basically anything that's living that
would attack the thing you don't want
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's a bacteria a fungus another
bug What about the soil biology?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean can't do does it begin there?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean Soil I mean that that's where
everything starts, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know the Plants evolved in soil,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So and we know that nutrition and the
right kind of soil, but but but something
[SPEAKER_05]: like a Caterpillar would love to eat a
super healthy plan.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, that's what I love These flowers
were so beautiful Caterpillar is a tough
[SPEAKER_10]: one to say that the soil soil plays a big
big part of it, but You know you have good
[SPEAKER_10]: soil You can have a healthy plant with
better defenses to fight off certain
[SPEAKER_10]: things like the botrytis Let's say you had
a flower that was grown in very good soil,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know And by good it's a broad
definition of what we mean by good which
[SPEAKER_10]: includes microbiota, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: But we're talking also struck structure of
the soil and you know the food and As well
[SPEAKER_10]: as the microbiology going on there But any
number of these things that can strengthen
[SPEAKER_10]: the plant one of the ways That the plant
is strengthened is by its tissues Its its
[SPEAKER_10]: cell walls thickening, you know,
and what's that mean?
[SPEAKER_10]: That means it's a lot tougher for a
disease To to injure to actually some of
[SPEAKER_10]: these diseases actually send what are
called these fungal diseases Send what's
[SPEAKER_10]: called an apresoria, which is like a drill
and they'll drill right into tissue into
[SPEAKER_05]: the cells cells of the plant well if they
like hold on to and just to get in and
[SPEAKER_10]: start And then start proliferating inside
of it, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: They don't even need an opening for them.
[SPEAKER_10]: But you know if you have Tissue that's
it's more you know, that's that's tougher
[SPEAKER_10]: right because you took care of giving it
absolute perfect soil conditions Then you
[SPEAKER_10]: have some level of there's less
susceptibility, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you've weakened that one component
of the susceptible sure right sense to me.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah a little disappointed because that
way Was what this was all about was,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know our trend to really, you know,
yeah My question with caterpillars like I
[SPEAKER_05]: think a super healthy planet caterpillar
would love to eat Yeah, sure.
[SPEAKER_10]: And and at that point you're you know,
you're talking it the Thickness you
[SPEAKER_05]: remember these things looked amazing two
weeks ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: They were just like yeah, that's why
that's why botrytis and caterpillars are
[SPEAKER_05]: are a bane in outdoor growing So okay,
so but right is is that something that
[SPEAKER_05]: lingers like like doesn't fusarium linger
in the soil So even if you like clear all
[SPEAKER_05]: your plants out and you plant again,
it's just like sweet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah so a lot of fungi will go into we
were talking about earlier the the state
[SPEAKER_10]: of suspended animation You know normally
called a survival skill to have yeah a
[SPEAKER_10]: survival structure.
[SPEAKER_10]: So like powdery mildew has one that It can
occasionally at the end of its life Form
[SPEAKER_10]: one of these structures that keeps it
essentially alive in this structure and
[SPEAKER_10]: botrytis definitely has one a matter of
fact one of the managing techniques for
[SPEAKER_10]: managing strategies for managing botrytis
and strawberry is to remove infected fruit
[SPEAKER_10]: from From the rose so dead fruit from the
rose when you harvest the harvesters go
[SPEAKER_10]: through and if they spot botrytis they may
I leave it or cut it if Or they may see a
[SPEAKER_10]: They may drop strawberries that are
infected with botrytis Well, that's a
[SPEAKER_10]: source for more botrytis for the way
you're saying they're doing this an
[SPEAKER_10]: accidentally right not intentionally Some
sometimes they they cut them to squash
[SPEAKER_10]: them and keep them from you know being at
least above the ground Alright,
[SPEAKER_10]: so others if you ever see a harvest in a
strawberry field It's it's riddled with
[SPEAKER_10]: you know dead fruit afterwards If you
don't get in there and clean it up soon
[SPEAKER_10]: and you have infection in that tissue Then
you're just risking the next flush of
[SPEAKER_10]: strawberries, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Same thing if you grow outdoors in an
environment where you leave filthy plant
[SPEAKER_10]: residue after a harvest Let's say you're
an outdoor grower and you happen to be
[SPEAKER_10]: growing in soil and you don't do something
about the Survival structures that
[SPEAKER_10]: botrytis may have left in dead tissue You
know you you you'll have it there for next
[SPEAKER_05]: year and it's just waiting for So the
physical manifestation of botrytis is bud
[SPEAKER_05]: rot basically.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you got it.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's good That's a good way to look at
and then what about fusarium?
[SPEAKER_05]: What would be its physical?
[SPEAKER_10]: Manifestation that's a number of different
symptoms The most common so fusarium is
[SPEAKER_10]: one of the wilt diseases, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So the plant everyone knows what a wilting
plant looks like What's interesting about
[SPEAKER_10]: fusarium is you know if you have a plant
that that wilted because you forgot to
[SPEAKER_10]: turn the water on for an hour And then you
run out there you turn it back on it'll
[SPEAKER_10]: it'll Pops right back up, but you you
won't do that It won't do that if it's in
[SPEAKER_10]: fact effective with fusarium right because
because what fusarium does it it gets in
[SPEAKER_10]: from the soil and It it actually plugs the
vac vascular system of plants,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So even if the wall even if the soil is
wet, they just can't pull water up.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so there's this Chronic wilt where
they're not getting the water they need
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's typical the other one the other
fusarium Symptom would be when a plant
[SPEAKER_10]: dies and let's say I didn't even die from
wilt you can cut the the base of the stem
[SPEAKER_10]: usually Usually the further down you go
the the pith the inside is is is brown
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not the healthy light green color
almost, you know yellow color.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's brown and soft and that That could be
one of these wilt diseases Best thing to
[SPEAKER_10]: do, you know, you know, we know we know
fusarium Lives in soil too, and that's how
[SPEAKER_10]: it moves around through the roots You know
if you have old soil and it's in there,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, you're you're risking the next
crop, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So what can you do?
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of things you can do right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I just that was gonna be my question Yeah,
so let's think about what the strawberry
[SPEAKER_10]: growers do they suffer from these wilt
diseases as well They conventional
[SPEAKER_10]: strawberry growers will use what's called
methyl bromine Have you heard of that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Substance that's been it doesn't sound
it's close.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it's close to being to being banned
completely but If they did my
[SPEAKER_10]: understanding is if they banned it
outright strawberry the strawberry
[SPEAKER_10]: industry would really suffer Because so
like everybody's using it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, well, no, no, not everyone's using
it But but it's still it's still something
[SPEAKER_10]: that could I think really hurt the
strawberry industry if somebody just
[SPEAKER_05]: organic strawberry growers It's a toxin so
by organic strawberries Yeah, it's a toxin
[SPEAKER_10]: that's actually fumigated into the soil
and there are fields out there where if
[SPEAKER_10]: you didn't do that within a maybe two
cycles You're you're just losing money.
[SPEAKER_10]: You might as well not plan.
[SPEAKER_10]: What is it combating a rock the the the
storage the the the survival structures of
[SPEAKER_10]: the fusarium in this oil and other other
soil diseases not just what when apples
[SPEAKER_01]: Rot what is it that's rotting them the
famous?
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, there are a lot There's a lot of
rotten rotten apple rot diseases out
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not an apple expert But there there's
there's quite a few fire blights a big one
[SPEAKER_05]: that bacteria That that was so how come
banana growers are so fucked with a
[SPEAKER_05]: fusarium Is it like more vicious once it
gets into soil that bananas are in because
[SPEAKER_05]: it's like you're like Oh strawberry
growers get it all the time, but they're
[SPEAKER_05]: not like we need to abandon these 10 acres
for the next 30 years Not 30 years or like
[SPEAKER_10]: burn the fields not 30 years But they will
they will take breaks and grow something
[SPEAKER_10]: else because if you just keep it going,
you know You just don't not allow enough
[SPEAKER_10]: time for that fungus to those survival
structures to to you know Not you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: but I thought that period is like years
and years and years It depends like I'll
[SPEAKER_05]: just hang out until you come back,
but it depends on the pathogen,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: What is fusarium feed on it?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a bacteria.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so it's a fungus that gets yeah It
gets into the plant through the roots
[SPEAKER_10]: Makes its way up the vascular system feeds
on whatever Sap is going through begins to
[SPEAKER_10]: multiply As it grows it causes clogging of
the vascular.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's kind of like I guess arthrosclerosis.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I was gonna say getting like Like
clogged arteries or whatever.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah pre heart attack Okay,
[SPEAKER_05]: but the good news is Tom doesn't have
fusarium in addition to betrayed us but
[SPEAKER_10]: and yeah, we know but you know Going back
to our conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: We had last Sunday with with Chris,
you know, we talked again about endophytes
[SPEAKER_10]: and you know relationships and you know,
we We ourselves have all kinds of
[SPEAKER_10]: microorganisms living in us right and on
us, you know the Microflora in some cases
[SPEAKER_10]: they're beneficial in other cases.
[SPEAKER_10]: They could kill us but They may not they
may just be living in us Because we have a
[SPEAKER_10]: nutrients nutritional source for them,
but they don't explode to such levels of
[SPEAKER_10]: infection that They will harm us,
you know, so we could have all kinds of
[SPEAKER_10]: pathogens in us that could kill us and And
the way it happens with with humans is
[SPEAKER_10]: it's the same thing that happens in plants
is Some kind of susceptibility is increase
[SPEAKER_10]: in the human can be from a stress it could
be from another disease for example some
[SPEAKER_10]: of the immuno Some of these diseases that
affect the immune system for example AIDS
[SPEAKER_10]: AIDS affects the immune system right lupus
and then it's something else that kills
[SPEAKER_10]: and then something that was already in you
that was being kept at bay because you're
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and it pops that same deal.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I mentioned a plant pathologist that
I've worked with for years now Steve Koike
[SPEAKER_10]: and He's seen enough.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's seen enough plants now I mean I've
asked him this question a number of times
[SPEAKER_10]: and last I saw him was about a month ago
and He he was still wondering about that
[SPEAKER_10]: is how much fusarium is there out there?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're just not seeing is it really a
problem or is it a problem?
[SPEAKER_10]: under certain Circumstances is is this
host?
[SPEAKER_10]: Susceptibility do we mean a problem?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, or in humans?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no in plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so in cannabis specifically.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I mean we found We found fusarium,
but it was interesting.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was first time I took it to the lab I
think we collected 30 plants that had
[SPEAKER_10]: symptoms.
[SPEAKER_10]: We sent them in and two of them had
fusarium You know None of the rest could
[SPEAKER_10]: be detected by any of the symptoms.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean Steve plated them out for us once
Once it grows a few days.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's pretty easy for any Mike
microbiologist pathologist can identify
[SPEAKER_10]: usually by looking at the Petri dish it
was grown in right so You know,
[SPEAKER_10]: okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So what's the deal here?
[SPEAKER_10]: These do these have it obvious?
[SPEAKER_10]: It sounds to me like the symptoms in these
plants Even though the same as in these
[SPEAKER_10]: two plants is the same as these eight over
here It may not be related to fusarium,
[SPEAKER_05]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: So 30 of the 32 plants Did not have it
even though they all expressed this.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it was they know what those other
plants had They didn't test.
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, they had mosaic appearance of
the leaves.
[SPEAKER_10]: You've you've heard about the mosaic
viruses You know also affecting the the
[SPEAKER_10]: crop They looked like mosaic.
[SPEAKER_10]: They did not have any mosaic he put them
through a panel of different pathogens and
[SPEAKER_10]: basically all he found was Fusarium now,
this was before we knew about the viroids.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if We don't know because at that at
that time, I don't think the viroid I
[SPEAKER_10]: Think they're called the primers,
which is the what you need for the test
[SPEAKER_10]: wasn't really Commonly available because
it was just kind of we were barely
[SPEAKER_10]: learning about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I Very clearly remember coming back from
that You know from when we sampled It
[SPEAKER_10]: wasn't until months or probably even a
year later when I first heard about the
[SPEAKER_05]: viroid, right and Had you seen what turned
out to be the viroid much earlier?
[SPEAKER_05]: And then when people told you that there
was this viroid and this is what it does
[SPEAKER_10]: you were like, I've seen you know,
you know the testing the heavy testing for
[SPEAKER_10]: viroid happened after I left Where I
worked and and moved to beneficial
[SPEAKER_10]: insectary that was really when everyone
started a really key in on testing and
[SPEAKER_10]: Some places went out and tested all Their
you know, their mother tissue every single
[SPEAKER_10]: plant and eliminated every one that that
had the viroid in it So it was it was a it
[SPEAKER_10]: was some time ago that you know,
I I learned about Fusarium actually,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know potentially being a problem in
cannabis before I learned about the virus
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's some new disease.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, it's not even every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's everything I wanted on this cannabis
party too and few certain Where does it
[SPEAKER_01]: come like where would it come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: How would it be introduced?
[SPEAKER_05]: It could also be a survival structure a
mommy and a daddy Fusarium have a baby
[SPEAKER_05]: Fusarium.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that what?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, how do they get into your garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean brought in It could come in with
your soil.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, it could have it could be in There
could be that some other plant here in
[SPEAKER_10]: your garden is susceptible to it and there
are survival structures and You were
[SPEAKER_05]: watering your lawn one day and so the same
strain of Fusarium could be infecting
[SPEAKER_05]: other plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well there I know if at least two I think
it's three Species of Fusarium that we
[SPEAKER_10]: found at in our soil, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: One of them the one that's thought to be
the main culprit is Fusarium oxysporum and
[SPEAKER_10]: that's the same one that hits Other crops
like give me an example of another crop
[SPEAKER_05]: that it loves that strawberries.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's the main Fusarium So basically it's
like yeah I mean that that that's like a
[SPEAKER_05]: super disease that can like you know how
like coronavirus it's like They don't
[SPEAKER_05]: think necessarily cats and dogs like we
couldn't transmit it to a cat they can't
[SPEAKER_05]: transmit it to a person but with this it's
like it could go from like Tom's cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: plant to like the neighbors strawberries
and then like the next neighbors growing
[SPEAKER_05]: weed and it's like what's that like I can
find food sources.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there's a there are there are really
interesting strawberries and weed and so
[SPEAKER_01]: Cal well like I got one for you The middle
of the state where you have all these
[SPEAKER_01]: different central coast.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you're surrounded by them.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got another one for you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, so So they bought this so that we I
was talking about grapes and Botrytis,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So the grape that the grapes are typically
affected by Botrytis are the pinot noir
[SPEAKER_10]: and chardonnay grape doesn't very commonly
That's a very common fungal problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: These are thin skinned grapes from we
talked about that.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're not very tolerant of very high
temperatures so they could eat Easily get
[SPEAKER_10]: sunburned and damaged.
[SPEAKER_10]: So that's why they're normally grown in
coastal coastal cool climates that also
[SPEAKER_10]: happen to have high humidity so that they
have a very susceptible host with the thin
[SPEAKER_10]: cluster thin skins that are clustered
tight and then they have the Perfect
[SPEAKER_10]: environment and then as soon as that spore
lands there, guess what you have the
[SPEAKER_10]: disease the triangle components,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So But try this scenario is happens to be
this Triangle here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah At some point that there had to have
been some kind of weather event I'm pretty
[SPEAKER_10]: convinced.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was that the heat wave.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: How about this?
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a new batch of auto babies that I
just brought over so They'll be
[SPEAKER_10]: susceptible.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah But wouldn't it imply that they need
the same shitty like weather event?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but let's think about this where we
can talk about macro environment,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Since it's already here It could easily
get some okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: So let's talk about the macro environment,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's behind you as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't forget.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we got it everywhere Yeah,
so there's not a plant that does not
[SPEAKER_10]: essentially there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like COVID right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, exactly even in the white house.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay Have you have you ever noticed how
your biggest?
[SPEAKER_10]: Buds that top cola are the ones that are
normally first affected by the tritus,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So I mean you can see it have you and then
sec second question is Those were the ones
[SPEAKER_10]: that you were trimming where you saw it
first, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: You cut those off because they were the
top bud, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's usually a really big bud up there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we cut those because Tom didn't want
the neighbor to see his gigantic plants
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, so you injured the plant we
gave it gave a botrytis and entry but but
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah, so What about that micro environment
inside the flower have you noticed that
[SPEAKER_10]: botrytis starts from inside the flower?
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, the gray mold usually I mean
I'm not saying it doesn't on occasion
[SPEAKER_10]: start on the outside tissue even even on
stems.
[SPEAKER_10]: You'll see botrytis I haven't seen that
routinely, but I have seen it that big
[SPEAKER_10]: flower, which is tight That's not one
solid piece of plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's nooks and crannies in there,
right and we're talking about microscopic
[SPEAKER_10]: Spores, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So we're talking about a very humid
environment in there, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's also dark and cut and you know,
so even something like raising the
[SPEAKER_10]: humidity for a few hours at the Wronged up
that that big bud once it's closed up and
[SPEAKER_10]: gotten tight.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's close to harvest, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: What happens to fruit once it it's closer
to harvest it softens, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: All of a sudden now that host is much more
susceptible Because it's began to it
[SPEAKER_10]: started to decompose.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's part of the natural plant process to
decompose Tissues get thinner and more
[SPEAKER_10]: easy to for the for the week Fungus what's
that?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's weak It's it's weaker.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's softer.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's full of sugar.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it's it's it's got spores inside It's
like a salmon that swum all the way
[SPEAKER_05]: upstream and the bear is just sitting
there being like this is too easy Yeah,
right.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a good analogy good analogy So so
each part of these this triangle can can
[SPEAKER_10]: can give you a different impact in this
case You had us the susceptible host was
[SPEAKER_10]: cause you know, if you notice it started
on your biggest bud So the ones That were
[SPEAKER_10]: the ripest were more susceptible and the
caterpillars came bit holes into them and
[SPEAKER_10]: allowed faster entry into the flower and
You you basically you got susceptibility
[SPEAKER_10]: of hosts.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe the environment didn't have as much
to do with it this time around,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, but there was presence there of
the of the fungus there was a
[SPEAKER_10]: Susceptibility and and the environment had
to have been at some point perfect for it
[SPEAKER_01]: to have germinated We did it Tom Actually,
you know, this is learning is cold is the
[SPEAKER_01]: ones at the top were the last one they
seem really Yeah, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were pretty brown up there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well now they are Yeah, you you've got I
mean, it's kind of remarkable.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know like To see I mean how much
feces is out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's practically every bud.
[SPEAKER_05]: Have you never seen Have you is this like
the most feces in a like plant that you've
[SPEAKER_05]: seen my god, we are breaking records and
he's seen a lot of Commercial facilities.
[SPEAKER_10]: Hey, listen, you learn you learn about a
really important symptom And you know now,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know to monitor for mods early,
you know, okay, right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the recap for next year's start What's
our prescriptive strategy again?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's what I do what I do is I is that your
daughter?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is that your daughter Gemma?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, give her a quarter For every
caterpillar she brings to you right and
[SPEAKER_10]: then get everyone and maybe it is only
cornea worm, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Now, you know now we can look at
sandwiches.
[SPEAKER_10]: There you go Now now we can look for what
does that moth look like now?
[SPEAKER_10]: You're gonna have to set up traps probably
at some point right start setting up Light
[SPEAKER_10]: traps are a good way, you know moths are
attracted to light.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is there a pheromone trap?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's like literally the zapping light
Any light right moths fly around these
[SPEAKER_10]: light bulbs, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, but but you're saying put a trap
out.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah You don't have to put a zapping trap
that'll destroy it but a sticky card trap
[SPEAKER_10]: or something like that You can buy moth
traps that are based on glue to you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: so maybe that's a way to do it There's
also what are called the Delta traps.
[SPEAKER_10]: You may have seen them The county puts
them out for different flying pests.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a little folded looks like a little
tent little paper tent That's hung in the
[SPEAKER_10]: tree that has glue all on the inside and
it has a little pheromone Which is
[SPEAKER_01]: actually intended to attract the male if
you capture some of those moths That'll
[SPEAKER_01]: tell you what kind of caterpillars you're
gonna wind up with right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe yeah Maybe perhaps maybe well,
okay, so I'm never I'm never asleep
[SPEAKER_10]: roller.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it a problem in cannabis?
[SPEAKER_10]: I've never heard of any of these leaf
roller families being a problem in
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis I have heard of them showing up
and feeding a bit But what's the one Tom
[SPEAKER_10]: has but here it's a corn earworm and what
what's the adult version of that called?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same corn corn corn ear.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, it's a corn ear moth corn ear
butterfly It's helicoverpa is there what's
[SPEAKER_05]: the difference between a moth and a
butterfly?
[SPEAKER_10]: Mostly moths are night fliers Okay,
that makes sense.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah Likewise most cat most butter.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that's I mean there's there's
families.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's I mean there's there's I'm I'm
really yeah, I never really see
[SPEAKER_05]: caterpillars flying around at night I'm
not good at the what I call the the order
[SPEAKER_10]: lepidoptera.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a tough one It's I mean
distinguishing leaf roller moths from each
[SPEAKER_10]: other That gave me fits in school That'll
be I'll train I'll train Gemma in that
[SPEAKER_05]: skill Yeah, what's up?
[SPEAKER_10]: So we we don't know but but we I've never
seen mealybug in in in cannabis and I've
[SPEAKER_10]: heard some people say oh, yeah I've seen
it and I kind of found it hard to believe
[SPEAKER_10]: it's like I've never seen it Well,
that's that's a little bit arrogant just
[SPEAKER_10]: cuz I haven't seen it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I got a photo of some from Texas a few
months ago, so Maybe leaf rollers aren't a
[SPEAKER_10]: problem in California cannabis,
but what's it gonna do to Oklahoma,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So knowing what's around and what's
regional pests?
[SPEAKER_05]: So what were you seeing a lot of them in?
[SPEAKER_05]: Norca well actually and so Cal two you're
up and down the coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what were you?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's that's the main one.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, so we have what everyone's getting.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it's not the only one they're getting
I actually But like this is a noticeable
[SPEAKER_05]: uptick in this across, California from
previous years No, no, in fact,
[SPEAKER_10]: it could it could have been a pretty okay
year, but actually the some of the Lake
[SPEAKER_10]: County growers I work with they They are
reporting They are reporting a bad
[SPEAKER_05]: caterpillar like okay Lake County Yeah,
so like the caterpillars are honed into
[SPEAKER_05]: some different regions.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I was at a greenhouse operation in
Salinas There's a caterpillar and you
[SPEAKER_10]: know, we found the damage we found the
damage I could see it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a matter of time No turds.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't see any feces at all just about
looking around and there he was about that
[SPEAKER_10]: long.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is not Does not look like a cornea
worm, but I'm not positive like I said a
[SPEAKER_10]: lot of a lot of these Is that the one from
here?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, this is from a grown Salinas like I
caught yesterday It could be a younger
[SPEAKER_10]: one.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it was bright green it even painted
the alcohol green vials You have like
[SPEAKER_05]: hundreds of vials with different insects
in them not anymore not hundreds Well,
[SPEAKER_10]: so I'm gonna take it back and I'm gonna
look at it under a scope and I'm gonna
[SPEAKER_10]: look at features Sorry, where was that one
from?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a Salinas Greenhouse Do you need to
develop a program from them based on that?
[SPEAKER_10]: It helps because then you can target to
the most effective wasp, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right that that okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: So by the way next next season you you
need to show up What's today like October?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we what day?
[SPEAKER_05]: October 3rd, so he should have shown up
here like September 1st for like the IPM
[SPEAKER_05]: inspection We just didn't we did want to
have this yeah, like two months ago.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah a month and a half Yeah, I mean have
monitoring starts monitoring starts when
[SPEAKER_10]: you bring the first plant into You're
growing never ends after that here.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm gonna leave these for you and I I give
I hand these out to some of our custom.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do we just put alcohol in it or what?
[SPEAKER_10]: Just isopropyl alcohol or and then the bug
and if you find it catch it kill it if You
[SPEAKER_10]: don't I mean we live close so you I could
actually get it from you come pick it up
[SPEAKER_10]: We can show up here.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah But if not, if you're far off
somewhere, you know another okay,
[SPEAKER_05]: so people send you Guys bugs you don't
have to send the bug.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just just catch it catch it kill it in
alcohol then stretch it out So it's not
[SPEAKER_10]: moving around on you and take photos very
close photos very clear photos from
[SPEAKER_10]: different angles and Off not often.
[SPEAKER_10]: Sometimes it's not enough We've got a
really good.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what are what are some of the
interesting?
[SPEAKER_05]: Bugs that have come across your radar
recently that that people have like done
[SPEAKER_05]: that and taken pictures and something to
you guys Oh geez, there's a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I just saw do you have that scale?
[SPEAKER_10]: Insect where did that leaf end up?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, oh, it's over on the the straw Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, cuz I took pictures of it while it
was uh, would you leave it on the straw
[SPEAKER_05]: over there?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but I'm gonna see about you know
taking this thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what did you find interesting about
that?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's a scale insect.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh a scale in yeah, but I think I think I
think it may be dead now actually Because
[SPEAKER_10]: it was it was on green tissue.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was green Oh, wait, so here put it
down.
[SPEAKER_10]: I can actually get a I have you I have a
photo anyway It's a it was a it was a lot
[SPEAKER_10]: lighter orange color.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's right there that brown thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I can I took a photo before it
before it met its end Here here's a really
[SPEAKER_00]: good one here Wow, wow, is that that yep
Super and what is that?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a soft scale.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know which one yet, but it's a
soft scale.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's another insect that sucks on plant
sap and feeds on them and Is a problem in
[SPEAKER_10]: some crops citrus has the California
citrus scales It looks like a little know
[SPEAKER_10]: a lot about scales, you know what it look
at this photo Does it look like a turtle
[SPEAKER_10]: shell to you?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah kind of Yeah, that's what they look
like them a little and what is it?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a it's a soft scale.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know which one That's the type of
insect.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mm-hmm What what's like that family common
for like known for well they they'll feed
[SPEAKER_10]: on plant sap, right But do they become a
problem?
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't know enough yet, but that's
brand new.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the first time I've seen that Yes,
these the adults are the adults can fly.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right, the males can fly I believe it
is mostly but there's They're so small
[SPEAKER_10]: that they'll yeah it on them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and if there's females around then
they'll mate and the females will eggs
[SPEAKER_10]: these these often actually these have a
These actually are have keep their eggs
[SPEAKER_10]: inside of them So if you flip them over in
fact, if you had a scope we could do it
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, I think it's fried now because it's
sat in the Sun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, but um Yeah, well look at the color
difference look at the color difference.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's this was a green leaf like half hour
ago, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah And it's cool.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's I probably still have enough to make
some kind of close identification of it
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, right there Yeah, it still kind
of looks like a like a turtle right but
[SPEAKER_10]: now it's more shriveled I haven't ever I
mean we suspected a possible
[SPEAKER_10]: My my colleagues and I had had a few
photos that a grower sent that we argued
[SPEAKER_10]: was is it scale is it is it a Seed a seed
that that's I'm sure if I went to a scale
[SPEAKER_10]: expert They'd be able to ID that that's
him.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's an okay photo right there.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can see that's that could be This
little dot Here could be where it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: where its waist drops out of So yeah,
so I will take him to see what I mean is
[SPEAKER_06]: if I don't get him I can't positively ID
him because I haven't seen him or her.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's actually her Is Laura the best host
ever so so so Tom look around some more of
[SPEAKER_05]: this Look around for more of this Yeah,
yeah text me that picture and I'll send
[SPEAKER_05]: you these ones.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not difficult, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so Tom had let's recap again
Tom had betrayed us You're gonna you're
[SPEAKER_05]: rubbing it in now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now you're rubbing it in you had the scale
bug, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, which again we don't know if this is
even a problem, right could have been a
[SPEAKER_05]: confused But you've never seen it before
so not this even if it's not causing
[SPEAKER_05]: problems.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's never been No, and yeah, but we're so
new at this, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure I'm sure someone else has seen it
Oftentimes they'll see it but not be I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: just saying like it hasn't been like if
you've never seen it It hasn't probably
[SPEAKER_05]: been commonly seen like maybe one guy's
seen it a couple so that bodes well,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: If no one's seen it and you find one
there's there's a bug that particularly
[SPEAKER_05]: what's the last thing that's kind of been
like the What's the Asian wasp like the
[SPEAKER_05]: big garbage one?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's what what's it's called?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah the That like the killer killer wasp.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah that one That giant one.
[SPEAKER_05]: But anyway, like something where if
someone saw the first one and then it's
[SPEAKER_10]: like shit like I guess it would have to be
you know Most recently was that the
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis aphid you know that that blew up
So I heard about it and again,
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like what was the last year?
[SPEAKER_10]: No one talked about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: No one talked about it in in Salinas cuz
keep in mind tiny area That I worked in
[SPEAKER_10]: nobody talked about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's see not 18.
[SPEAKER_10]: We've saw it 17 sometime around 2016
sometime around 2016 Nobody was talking
[SPEAKER_10]: about and then suddenly like some people
were talking about no Oregon and Colorado
[SPEAKER_10]: and it had been described It's not like it
got discovered on cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: It it it's a hemp aphid, you know,
it evolved on hemp But we're Oregon
[SPEAKER_10]: growers and Colorado growers seen it even
earlier than 2016, you know, I'm not I'm
[SPEAKER_10]: not great about exactly when it happened,
but there was there was a bulletin sent
[SPEAKER_10]: out by the Oregon Department of
Agriculture to all the cannabis growers is
[SPEAKER_10]: they legalized a little earlier,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: They there that hey, this is a pest of
cannabis be wary of it It it got to
[SPEAKER_10]: Salinas.
[SPEAKER_10]: Like I said, the first infestation I
experienced was in 2018 we were At first
[SPEAKER_10]: it was difficult to figure out what to do
about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now we have some strategies How
problematic was it what at first was it
[SPEAKER_01]: destroying whole crops?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's a problem is we never we never took
the data and that's again I want to stress
[SPEAKER_10]: that is we really really need the growers
to get diligent about that There was one
[SPEAKER_05]: reporting it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there was a situation where that
first infestation hit me It was about
[SPEAKER_10]: probably an area of about 500 square feet
that it was a mess.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was a total mess And I begged that we
harvested it earlier so it wouldn't spread
[SPEAKER_10]: to the rest of the crop in the end We were
able to contain it to one area,
[SPEAKER_10]: but it was bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was really really bad where to the
point where they crawled off of I mean it
[SPEAKER_10]: looked like an army crawling off of it
when it was Where it's dry and where when
[SPEAKER_10]: we were drying the the buds they crawled
off and you know I That's right right when
[SPEAKER_10]: I left harborside and I said hey,
I beg you Check the potency and yield on
[SPEAKER_10]: this, please, you know, but unfortunately
nobody went that next step and said hey
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's look at what this aphid in this
extreme situation did to this bud I mean,
[SPEAKER_10]: we're not gonna know what it what
potential it had you mean did well That's
[SPEAKER_05]: what I was gonna say that was there a
baseline of no, but you could rest itself
[SPEAKER_05]: this amazingly last year Well,
there's that there's that you could you
[SPEAKER_10]: could compare it to the rest of that crop
in that and the different maybe there was
[SPEAKER_10]: a the same exact strain in the same exact
greenhouse well, but in a Another corner.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like years and wine grapes,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like there are certain years that are
like, yeah Exceptional years and the
[SPEAKER_05]: bottles reflect that in their price.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah some something like that I guess
yeah, so but you know, that would have
[SPEAKER_10]: been a great one where okay Take good
record of the yield of that particular
[SPEAKER_10]: strain And then do it again the next time
you grow that strain and and then do it
[SPEAKER_10]: once, you know Keep them under you know,
keep them from being attacked.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe put special special You know More
resources into keeping that strain from
[SPEAKER_10]: being attacked and then now grow one where
you have okay I had a successful crop with
[SPEAKER_10]: it here and compare your yields per square
foot and compare your potency in the
[SPEAKER_10]: flower and then if you found a drop in 1%
yield and half of a percent of potency.
[SPEAKER_10]: Was it a problem?
[SPEAKER_10]: It looked ugly Right and it yeah,
it made it stick around in your garden in
[SPEAKER_10]: your grow And it moved to other crops.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah, that's a problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: But how?
[SPEAKER_10]: Problematic is it really how damaging is
it's just really early although at a
[SPEAKER_10]: certain point, you know We know in other
crops aphid infestations when when you see
[SPEAKER_10]: a plant covered with aphid that can't be
good Right, but how many are tolerable?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: We just don't we just don't know the
research.
[SPEAKER_05]: What if the point of like some pests is
good lots like of a species like having a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple aphids like Not I wouldn't use good
but like not negative.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's put it this way and then like but
having a ton is obviously the Nature's
[SPEAKER_10]: typically balanced right?
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't see massive infestations,
you know, well unless like Somehow humans
[SPEAKER_10]: might have been you know interfered but
you do see them on occasion But nature
[SPEAKER_10]: balances itself right populations of
predators climb with the populations of
[SPEAKER_10]: the pests pest populations drop off
Populations of predators drop off.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a site.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like my compost bin where like
There's a food source Outside my house
[SPEAKER_05]: where there never had been one and now
black soldier flies are like and they're
[SPEAKER_05]: larva I mean, it's like millions of or not
millions, but like yeah hundreds of them
[SPEAKER_05]: in In like in my worm bin, they're in
there too.
[SPEAKER_05]: The worms aren't very they're just like I
love those guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: I gotta tell you I gotta tell you a story
sometime about those because that's I was
[SPEAKER_10]: playing about worms or black soldier fly
soldier fly larva Yeah, and cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I love them, but they keep the Larva keep
finding their way under the the
[SPEAKER_05]: floorboards into the house.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so my wife sees like these larva
crawling across the floor Yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: I was I was growing them indoors myself
and I would like when I see them I'm like
[SPEAKER_05]: sweet like let me release you outside
Yeah, that's cool your job.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like the fuck but yeah, it's it's
like that something's gonna come you plant
[SPEAKER_10]: something something's gonna come You know,
we've you've made something artificial
[SPEAKER_10]: here, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Some of the pests Well, it's less
artificial than just the grass though.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's getting back to but you've
brought a Non-native plant into this
[SPEAKER_10]: environment and who was here waiting corn
earworm was here waiting susceptible all
[SPEAKER_10]: the native pests that have been waiting
corn earworm Was probably around here for
[SPEAKER_10]: since you bought the house, you know,
it's been here forever.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where has it been feeding?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe your neighbor has some corn or Does
it love corn?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: Actually likes corn ears Interesting so
focuses specifically with the ear be the
[SPEAKER_05]: outside part.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now the ears are is The actual yeah
kernels so it'll it'll do the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: It'll go inside It'll go into the the
court like yeah, I'll tell you what go to
[SPEAKER_10]: your farmers market if there's anyone here
that grows corn locally You know that bad
[SPEAKER_10]: basil is during Genesis Is that bacteria I
told you about one of the first successful
[SPEAKER_10]: Monsanto GMOs They they took corn and and
inserted the gene of the bacillus during
[SPEAKER_10]: Genesis into the corn So the corn
naturally produces the BT toxin and when
[SPEAKER_10]: the corn earworm feeds on it it dies The
corn is poisonous to it, but not to us.
[SPEAKER_10]: We do the same thing with now.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's about to eat poison That's exactly
what Monsanto Like it starts munching on
[SPEAKER_01]: the but they'll make a BT cannabis they'll
grow BT make a BT cannabis and then you
[SPEAKER_10]: you if it's a set short for a bacillus
during Genesis So and they've done it for
[SPEAKER_10]: corn and guess what in it made the
difference between people in Africa You
[SPEAKER_10]: know having something they eat having
crops and not But it's it's a around here
[SPEAKER_10]: But but on that front though Tom,
what if you grow some BT corn out here?
[SPEAKER_05]: around the As like what do you call it a
banker plan trap trap clap?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I'm getting that would be the
power move some Monsanto out corn.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah on the perimeter.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, not to even eat just for its is keep
in mind it it evolved it we think it
[SPEAKER_10]: evolved on grasses Gross put some out to
grow out here and because these
[SPEAKER_05]: Caterpillars You can buy it you can
definitely buy by BT corn You just
[SPEAKER_05]: couldn't like breed and then sell them to
other people or use them grow it actually
[SPEAKER_10]: that's the crazy thing The moth will fly
to it lay its eggs on it as soon as the
[SPEAKER_10]: caterpillar hatches and starts feeding and
It doesn't move into your crop It's
[SPEAKER_10]: possible that corn earworm moth likes the
smell of corn better than cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So maybe more moths will go I mean that
doesn't I mean they would they were so
[SPEAKER_01]: Pungent, you know, they were amazing
They're still fun.
[SPEAKER_10]: They had huge potential but but but GMO
crops.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's uh, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not really sexy and cannabis,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: But but it's interesting to have it as the
trap plant Yeah to be like I'm not even
[SPEAKER_05]: gonna eat the corn.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, there are other BT crops out there,
too You know again, I don't want to be
[SPEAKER_01]: well GMO cannabis is an inevitability,
you know It could be you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but not in Tom's backyard No, but you
know, there's genetic modifications that
[SPEAKER_05]: are not Tom maybe rethinking that after
remember Remember that there is more than
[SPEAKER_10]: just outdoor grown cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: You have greenhouse and indoor cannabis
and typically they have that extra
[SPEAKER_10]: protection of Exclusions so they have
screening where they have the question is
[SPEAKER_01]: is there are there unintended?
[SPEAKER_01]: Consequences to making the BT corn that
oh, yeah, that can be very yeah there we
[SPEAKER_10]: don't know for sure yet, but There there
can be you know that that that is yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you're making it resistant to these You
know to these disease to these disease and
[SPEAKER_01]: this this predator, but you know,
what's the trade-off?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you killing?
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a lot of trade-offs We don't know
what it does to your body Well,
[SPEAKER_10]: we don't know that yet But you know
imagine you've you've heard these stories
[SPEAKER_10]: right a farmer down the road from a
Monsanto farmer And then it's It's the
[SPEAKER_10]: wind's fault and he can't use his seed
there and there are no laws I guess
[SPEAKER_10]: between from pollen flying from one farm
to another so You trespassed onto my
[SPEAKER_05]: property and now I have to pay you you
stole.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, I had to pay you now I can't use my
own seed, you know But you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: it's it's it's all handled in the in the
courts and if you've got the money you've
[SPEAKER_05]: got the lawyers Yeah Yeah, I think that
was Monsanto strategy just a bulldoze
[SPEAKER_10]: legally Yeah, so there are those and then
and then you know, you could you consider,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know corn has wild relatives out there
And if then if you you know, if there was
[SPEAKER_10]: some kind of cross pollination with a wild
relative I mean that's possible now you
[SPEAKER_10]: created this wild plant that with that
that is protected from caterpillars and
[SPEAKER_10]: then what happens with that can it now
dominate and outcompete Other plants in
[SPEAKER_10]: the same, you know, yeah this Cornibus,
it's a cross.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Fuzzy bear I Don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a it's a topic.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a it's fun to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you'd have this wild mutant gene
that's like Sees its path to like total
[SPEAKER_05]: freedom by not being controlled,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: But again, you know, like I said Your core
caterpillars are are a problem Usually an
[SPEAKER_10]: outdoor cannabis and then the necks would
be in greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could get you can have problems Tom's
gonna move into it.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, we are gonna maybe this is our
inspiration to finally set up the Well,
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah, they're tough to battle pops But the
strategy is once again monitoring and and
[SPEAKER_10]: acting early You know as soon as you have
any hint that it's time to act with these
[SPEAKER_10]: guys with these With these bugs then then
act, you know the start your BT sprays
[SPEAKER_10]: Start this is hemp, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no, this is can't this is high THC.
[SPEAKER_10]: Is it okay for some reason?
[SPEAKER_10]: I thought you said it was this high CBD.
[SPEAKER_05]: Why not?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: This one's like right down the middle The
autos are actually but you're selling it
[SPEAKER_10]: as THC cannabis or I mean you're growing
it for us Yeah, if you were growing it
[SPEAKER_10]: commercially, you'd be selling it as THC
Yeah, right.
All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So so yeah, cuz I was gonna say in hemp
I'm not I'm not as aware of the laws But
[SPEAKER_10]: then you still have that other weapon that
that's been a sad I told you about I I'm
[SPEAKER_10]: not sure that's legal in hemp still I know
it's not good if not in cannabis,
[SPEAKER_10]: but in hemp it might be so you have
another weapon You got your sprays start
[SPEAKER_10]: your wasp releases early.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're really not that expensive You
know, just we you know, we recommend a
[SPEAKER_10]: certain frequency and a certain amount
some growers say I'm gonna double the
[SPEAKER_10]: frequency and I'm gonna triple the amount
that That's how bad I want to protect and
[SPEAKER_10]: that's how that's the kind of investment I
want to make to just have one more weapon
[SPEAKER_10]: To throw at them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you deal mostly with obviously with
with commercial growth But obviously
[SPEAKER_01]: everything would be less.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, oh, yeah for just a little home
The smallest container we sell the trick
[SPEAKER_10]: of grandma wasp is gonna be you know
Tenfold more than more than yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So how much so what is that?
[SPEAKER_10]: I'd have to dig into Well go to our
website green methods calm and that's
[SPEAKER_10]: that's kind of the retail that's our
retail website So you can see what that
[SPEAKER_10]: but of course if you're commercial then
there's I mean, no there there,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, we rear them ourselves You know,
we're yeah, they're not they're not that
[SPEAKER_10]: expensive.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it's totally worth it Let's put it
that way for prevention.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's I mean you can see this I go through
count Cut your heart I would if you're
[SPEAKER_10]: gonna harvest this for oil or whatever
you're gonna do with it, but take the time
[SPEAKER_10]: to to give them to your to your daughter
and and have her go through every one and
[SPEAKER_10]: and see how many of them have the turds in
them because I saw I don't think I saw one
[SPEAKER_10]: that didn't it seems like they all hit you
and You know, it's and it could just be
[SPEAKER_10]: the drying of the the chewed up bud too,
you know, it's Yeah, so it's well worth
[SPEAKER_10]: it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Look at look for other caterpillars worm
poo.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean the question is Then also where's
it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are all the caterpillars or question
or could one caterpillar?
[SPEAKER_01]: I bet it we started digging in there Can
they they can they can't but normally they
[SPEAKER_10]: don't move like they don't move they kind
of like yeah But this could have been any
[SPEAKER_10]: number of events.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean, I I did not see classic botrytis
You know mycelia, you know the the the
[SPEAKER_10]: hyphae I didn't see it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So you know, I'm still like what the hell
it's dry So does that mean that
[SPEAKER_05]: potentially it's not betrayed us at all,
you know It looks a lot.
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like botrytis It looks like that
end stage of botrytis I was in here,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know a few weeks a week ago to see
what it was like but but Yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah that See Yeah, there's some gray
there It's tough I am I've seen a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: botrytis but this is This is odd So but
yeah, look for more caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_10]: Just find as many as you can and Send them
my way or I can pick them up when I'm out
[SPEAKER_10]: here again So you live in LA yeah,
I live in Palms just all north of Culver
[SPEAKER_10]: City Yeah, so I I have a few growers that
out here in the valley I was just here
[SPEAKER_10]: last week or the week before Visiting some
guys indoor guys.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and what do they have to deal with?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well indoor and greenhouse pet pest
complex is a lot more It's lots more
[SPEAKER_10]: similar Indoor guys have a really a harder
time with rude aphid then then maybe the
[SPEAKER_10]: greenhouse ones do and then Outdoor guys
have very little problem with rude aphid.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it seems to be like the opposite with
the caterpillar right with the That you
[SPEAKER_10]: you get a lot of indoor growers that are
saying I can't get rid of these rude aphid
[SPEAKER_10]: whereas in greenhouse You might have
easier control and then the outdoors are
[SPEAKER_10]: rarely a problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've not heard of a problem outdoors
Usually what happens an infested plant if
[SPEAKER_10]: it gets if it's got them in the pot and it
gets transplanted to the soil They'll off
[SPEAKER_10]: that'll end you just that'll often end the
infestation of rude aphid just
[SPEAKER_10]: transplanting outdoors, you know,
so it's like So different environments
[SPEAKER_10]: interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: So people who are like propagating in
greenhouses for outdoor grows They could
[SPEAKER_05]: have rude aphids on the indoor part and
then bring them out It's been seen before
[SPEAKER_10]: and we have hypotheses on why that's the
case Well, that's a clue right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's something in that indoor
environment that is conducive that the
[SPEAKER_10]: rude aphid likes I tend to think more so
my hypothesis is Those are not very good
[SPEAKER_10]: diggers.
[SPEAKER_10]: The aphids are rude aphid.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's rice rude aphid actually came from
rice It was a pest of rice.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's say That's how it was identified So
it was called rice rude aphid,
[SPEAKER_05]: but it does like so this this is it jumps
plant species, too Yeah, I know it's a
[SPEAKER_10]: problem in you know, the the monocots like
the grasses rice being one of them So
[SPEAKER_10]: would it be a problem with corn?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know but I know it's also a
problem in broadleaf because I know it's a
[SPEAKER_10]: problem in Salinas celery right the same
exact aphid and we know that it it infects
[SPEAKER_10]: it infests cannabis but what I was getting
to is is I don't I mean I'd like more data
[SPEAKER_10]: on this but I've done a lot of this where
you know found infested pots of aphid and
[SPEAKER_10]: then after harvest cut the cut the The
root ball in half and looked for them and
[SPEAKER_10]: they weren't in Inside the pot they were
populating that space between the soil and
[SPEAKER_10]: the pot that that Which makes it that that
border there which makes it a Lot easier
[SPEAKER_10]: with all those spaces and caverns in there
for them to move around and for them to
[SPEAKER_10]: find roots So that's their optimal place
to hang out there.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, if you notice indoor doors rock wool
growers You know the the rock wool cubes
[SPEAKER_10]: are wrapped guess where they are They're
in between that plastic and they might
[SPEAKER_10]: have gone into you know, the rock was just
like fiberglass, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a bunch of laminate, you know,
just layers of glass feed on the roots.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they feed on the roots Yeah,
they can get into some of those little
[SPEAKER_10]: those little crevices too.
[SPEAKER_05]: So but so hydro growers deal with them So
hydro growers deal with them, too.
[SPEAKER_10]: I I often say like soil is probably the
best because Like like I would be
[SPEAKER_10]: hard-pressed think that you're ever gonna
find your root aphid become a problem in
[SPEAKER_10]: that setup because They have to they don't
dig.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, like I said, they can they can move
in those cracks To get to the roots.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well roots are a little bit farther away
from the walls And by the time the roots
[SPEAKER_10]: do get to the walls of those pots there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean that plant might be So large enough
to yeah where it's not a problem Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: so the the environment really defines
where the vulnerabilities are it could
[SPEAKER_05]: yeah, it could Tom I remember this same
view two weeks ago was beautiful and epic
[SPEAKER_05]: of these lush I know and and you know
what?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's actually I mean hate to learn from
this experience, but How long really was
[SPEAKER_10]: that two weeks ago?
[SPEAKER_10]: You said what if you'd cut what were your
yield have been if you'd cut last weekend?
[SPEAKER_10]: Double what you have now, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So it's it's a lesson for some growers.
[SPEAKER_10]: They most growers They're aware of this as
soon as they see one flower there.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're in there cutting Lesson is if this
was but tried it this looks like it and
[SPEAKER_10]: You know it it may be I always used to say
Salinas is our place to grow cannabis if
[SPEAKER_10]: you don't have good good environmental
control And I used to say if you know
[SPEAKER_10]: Without the good environmental control.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't call the harvest but try this
cause of harvest It's the one that decides
[SPEAKER_10]: you either pick me the other harvest me
now or I will lose everything or I'll take
[SPEAKER_10]: it all right, so and you know,
sometimes growers that that's tough to do
[SPEAKER_10]: you've gone through the whole life and
then the last week or two is when this
[SPEAKER_10]: starts up and you're like what the hell
and at that point it's smartest thing we
[SPEAKER_10]: did once when we did have a little problem
was was harvest early and send that out
[SPEAKER_10]: fresh frozen to live resin and Yeah,
the yield suffered, but it was not as bad
[SPEAKER_10]: as if we had let the Cologn go to a dried
up crumbly, you know I mean this might
[SPEAKER_10]: still have THC in it and I've I've you can
use the the turbo over there Yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: there's there's mech.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's I mean we probably all smoke
Mexican weed that looked worse than that
[SPEAKER_10]: right Yeah, but Yeah, I don't think
originally not for a very long time Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: well this is has been really interesting I
mean I thought about that but I didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: even know I mean how I mean because the
flowering cycle was really started
[SPEAKER_01]: relatively recently too and that was
really fast to everything was Beautiful
[SPEAKER_01]: and we saw that one caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is like we killed the first time I've
done this That's what you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know now as soon as you see it a moth
You know, you got to set up traps next
[SPEAKER_10]: year once you as soon as you you start as
soon as you Tom's like Rocky knocked down
[SPEAKER_05]: by Apollo Creed and it's an eight count
and he's getting back up to plant again
[SPEAKER_05]: next season.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, it's not too late, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: But yeah, you just you know, the other
thing we talked about is we are talking
[SPEAKER_10]: about botrytis, which you know again I'm
not I'm not really convinced yet Wait,
[SPEAKER_10]: you're not 100% that that's what's going
on.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're like 98% Yeah, it's just I don't
see like typical structures of the fungus.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all dried out and the fact that I see
all that You're seeing a unique disease to
[SPEAKER_05]: the scale which is unique we also have
Well, I mean there's no question that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's something like Go, you know,
it's not yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's I mean, but it's like a disease
rather than just like this It's just it's
[SPEAKER_10]: just again break those buds open and if
you find Feces in every one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean I did I looked at a lot of you
quite a lot of you then it is then it is
[SPEAKER_01]: the cat.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and then Where are they?
[SPEAKER_10]: Where did they go?
[SPEAKER_10]: Did they finish there?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you know they've got to go into and
you become an expert in?
[SPEAKER_05]: identification of the different fecal
matter from different Species of
[SPEAKER_05]: caterpillar.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, but you know, there's a difference
between like snail you aspire to that
[SPEAKER_05]: Eventually, I'll get there.
[SPEAKER_05]: I guess I'm able to train that that's one
of our Gemma trainings to be able to
[SPEAKER_10]: identify the different Caterpillar poop by
flavor Cornea work cornea worm tastes a
[SPEAKER_05]: little corny All right, well I think that
was a good well, yeah a good deep dive and
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we have a Semi game plan for
earlier in the season next year.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, I mean just start monitoring
look into again first step Let's ID those
[SPEAKER_10]: collect as many as you can and put them in
jars.
[SPEAKER_10]: I left you these and then you know cuz
That that's where it starts and then okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, we we have at least we know who's
hitting us Yeah, we know the one we had on
[SPEAKER_05]: the table What is it what is a caterpillar
do inched It inched away.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Anyway, it's it's you Let's say,
you know, you have three of them eating
[SPEAKER_10]: your buds three different species eating
your buds Then you go look for what the
[SPEAKER_10]: adults look like you figure out I identify
them and that's what you that's what you
[SPEAKER_10]: look for in your traps as soon as you see
that one of those that would be epic if we
[SPEAKER_05]: actually Identified two different this
specific species.
[SPEAKER_05]: It happens.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're totally prepared for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually discover them So then we get
there also new undiscovered.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well right now I think Gemma jet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I have to name them.
[SPEAKER_10]: What's it the corn ear?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, the corn ear worm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, that's that's a car worm of choice
In the valley of Los Angeles, but it's not
[SPEAKER_01]: the only one Gemma can a killer or
something like we'll name the new
[SPEAKER_01]: discovery after Gemma So when you're
called in is it is it I would assume it's
[SPEAKER_01]: better for you to be working with grows
like from the get-go Yeah, so I do I I
[SPEAKER_10]: work for a biocontrol brought in once
there is a problem Yeah, is that your
[SPEAKER_10]: least favorite time to come in?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I work yeah, unfortunately,
so that's that's a big message,
[SPEAKER_10]: too So I work for a biocontrol company,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: We we sell insects for crop protection and
other predators for crop protection,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: so in in our industry, it's it's all about
vigilance because If we rely on sprays and
[SPEAKER_10]: try to integrate a biological control
program You will struggle because some of
[SPEAKER_10]: those sprays will hurt The predators
you've put into like how are the maroon
[SPEAKER_10]: products?
[SPEAKER_10]: I have some experience with them.
[SPEAKER_10]: They They do say I've attended some of
their presentations Some of their webinars
[SPEAKER_10]: and they do say that they are softer on
beneficials, but I personally haven't seen
[SPEAKER_05]: the research So I don't know so they're
like while this may do something to
[SPEAKER_05]: beneficials It is not as bad as what it's
doing to the thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't yeah, and that's a it's a tough
one You got to say okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll give give me the mode of action.
[SPEAKER_10]: How is it behaving because for example BT
that basilister and gents is if you told
[SPEAKER_10]: me, you know what?
[SPEAKER_10]: This is dangerous to your to the
caterpillars, but it's not dangerous to a
[SPEAKER_10]: fit That's absolutely true because the
mode of action is only for caterpillars,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: so if we knew the mode of action of some
of these other products that claim that
[SPEAKER_10]: they are harmful to Pests but not to the
beneficials and we find that it made sense
[SPEAKER_10]: and there's some research and made sense
that They would they would hurt your pests
[SPEAKER_10]: and not your beneficials and could say all
right Well, you know, there's something to
[SPEAKER_05]: this, you know Tom I'm digging those
flavored waters I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: I Thought they were new purchases when
they showed up mysteriously in front of me
[SPEAKER_01]: I drank I Had soup No, I didn't well So
you do you take the video and then you do
[SPEAKER_10]: it you edit out and everything all that
kind of stuff Yeah, like a two camera.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean this is like It actually I mean
this camera I think overheated but uh Like
[SPEAKER_05]: it's effective and it's budget like I Can
easily carry two iPhones around and two
[SPEAKER_05]: microphones and be like I could actually
do a cool conversation.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh Shit, yeah, that's the same worm It'll
hit you at the right at the same time
[SPEAKER_05]: right about close to harvest is an
inchworm a caterpillar Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just called inchworm.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they're actually the the more common
name is a looper like and Butterfly or
[SPEAKER_10]: moth Butterflies and moths produce
caterpillars.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, no an inchworm.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh a loopers a moth.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay So even they look they look cute and
see they call them loopers because okay
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, yeah, great.
[SPEAKER_10]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: Appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_10]: All right.
[SPEAKER_10]: I drank your previous one Thank you
[SPEAKER_10]: You can turn that one off this is uh,
I guess this is a They just call that a
[SPEAKER_10]: green looper.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah So common cute inch.
[SPEAKER_02]: So let's look up if you know, I'm pretty
sure that that's cornea worm.
[SPEAKER_05]: It looks like many they I Took some macros
of it, but then it got away Here's here's
[SPEAKER_02]: what the adult looks like, okay,
it's a brown moth It's not Tom we should
[SPEAKER_05]: also know what the adult form looks like
so you don't kill All the ones that aren't
[SPEAKER_02]: doing here's corn.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's cornea worm What one?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's it's not noctuid I think is a family
noctuity thing looks big My noctuids can
[SPEAKER_10]: be very Did you see any of these around
Tom That's what the adult looks like it's
[SPEAKER_10]: a brown Tanish brown moth, you know beyond
the lookout for that one Yeah,
[SPEAKER_05]: that thing is okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: What size is it?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's kind of big again I've it's
not a pest that I commonly battle look at
[SPEAKER_10]: this this wedge shape is like that's it's
a noctuid right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think it is Yeah, well that's what you
know, that is what that's the other place
[SPEAKER_01]: where we come Like for example after I
came two weeks ago I'm bummed that like I
[SPEAKER_05]: didn't come five days later because we
would have started to notice stuff Here's
[SPEAKER_10]: a good photo.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it's it shows you that kind of
triangular You know, they look like that
[SPEAKER_10]: you got to look for things like the
spotting on them and you know You see this
[SPEAKER_10]: on the on the second wing.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's two wings like that,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't know I'd have to look but you see
the brown you see the second wing You
[SPEAKER_10]: don't have butterflies have two wings.
[SPEAKER_10]: This bottom wing has that browning on the
edge That could be a big identifying
[SPEAKER_10]: feature.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, what happens when it lands?
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it gonna land just generally any big
moth take out?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, don't kill it don't kill them catch
them catch them because we can ID them if
[SPEAKER_10]: you if you catch them on glue,
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: But once we ID it, yeah catch them on glue
put them in there put the glue in the
[SPEAKER_10]: refrigerator and and a guy a guy I work
with a another grower a cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's in Dorand out there up in Santa Cruz
County.
[SPEAKER_10]: He Last time I visited him.
[SPEAKER_10]: He's like a time you put the pin through
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I found a bug You said I found a bug a
weird red bug I'd never seen before at the
[SPEAKER_10]: base of one of my plants and it it was
just Like a hundred of them just at the
[SPEAKER_10]: base and I said did you catch any said?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and he caught it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But the mistake he made is he didn't put
it in alcohol It shriveled in the fridge
[SPEAKER_10]: at least he put it in the fridge So when I
ID it luckily this bug is so distinctive
[SPEAKER_10]: It was easy to tell what it was and it was
a bug called the Bagrada bug Which is
[SPEAKER_10]: common in coal crops and a problem in coal
crops brought it on his cannabis on a
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_10]: So okay, is that coming first?
[SPEAKER_10]: Exciting a Bagrada bug that I know of
okay, but and when was this it was on the
[SPEAKER_10]: base of the plant and this the trunk of it
the very bottom trunk, right and and it it
[SPEAKER_10]: was a What is it?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know gathering there, but how could it
be feeding on stuff such tough tissue?
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean hemp tissue is really strong and
this was a nymphal stage.
[SPEAKER_10]: This was just a nymph No, it had not
molted to an adult yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: It was in the process of molting So it
didn't have its wings yet.
[SPEAKER_10]: You could tell it was a nymph.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's how you can ID that You can tell
okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: This looks like the second stage.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, and you can fight you can ID them
with their eggs So what could have
[SPEAKER_10]: happened is a Bagrada bug from a local
cabbage farm or some wild mustard out
[SPEAKER_10]: there Flew in got confused laid its eggs.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's what could happen with that scale.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh and maybe won't eat The plan.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I mean it won't be a problem at all
It's like it's like a whale that went up
[SPEAKER_05]: the river and then like couldn't figure
out how to get back Yeah, that doesn't
[SPEAKER_10]: mean that we should block all rivers.
[SPEAKER_10]: So the whales won't go in right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Where's when's it a problem, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's although I could see California doing
that Let's overregulate this Cripple
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody Yeah, so
[SPEAKER_05]: Like do they have like an acceptable
percentage of crop loss to yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: so great I mean you're hitting on you're
hitting on the subject that I like to talk
[SPEAKER_10]: about them We're asking good questions.
[SPEAKER_10]: So yeah on fire.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so okay, so You know, obviously we
have We can see what pests can do right?
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll harm your they harm your property
and they harm your your yields and
[SPEAKER_10]: therefore You're you know what you make
what what what you what your money maker?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so but Tom shakes But but but BT is
not free right you have to pay for it.
[SPEAKER_10]: So at what point is using BT a Good idea,
right all year long every you know from
[SPEAKER_10]: start to finish Yeah, you probably stand
more chance protecting from Caterpillar if
[SPEAKER_10]: you do it that way, but did you Did you
really?
[SPEAKER_10]: Make more money or did you throw it away
and your material you use?
[SPEAKER_10]: Alright, so there's there's what we call
the concept of the economic injury level
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd have to I'd have to really look that
up honestly
[SPEAKER_10]: Usually a lot of these soft materials are
pretty inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_10]: So But but again, you know, it's you put
labor into it also You know you you put
[SPEAKER_10]: you had to put labor into it you There's
all that involved in it and and that's why
[SPEAKER_10]: we've developed this concept of the
Economic injury level where at a certain
[SPEAKER_10]: point it pays to do something Be before
that point it doesn't pay to do something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so This is an extreme situation
because everything here has been impacted
[SPEAKER_01]: by this but you but and this is not a
commercial but in commercial you certainly
[SPEAKER_01]: would not like want this which is why I
asked about is there a percentage like
[SPEAKER_01]: that like there's a trade-off but if But
how does how does a former know what
[SPEAKER_01]: percentage of their crop they might lose
to a situation like this?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a very simple salute very simple
answer research University research and
[SPEAKER_10]: how long we've been researching this crop
at the university level Now let's talk
[SPEAKER_10]: about other lucrative California crops.
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's talk about the top two almonds and
grapes Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: Do they have guidelines?
[SPEAKER_10]: They actually do You could get on go
online.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's resources available where they'll
tell you if you have x amount of this pest
[SPEAKER_10]: Per leaf after sampling 20 leaves in a 100
square foot area Then you must act but
[SPEAKER_10]: before then you don't See what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_10]: We don't we just don't know yet So we
don't have those and the guidelines for
[SPEAKER_10]: the crop are very can be very detailed I
mean for grapes and for grapes and almonds
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they're they're fairly For other
crops there's guidelines so if you see a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain percentage of pests in a certain
Area Then it's then it's a time to act and
[SPEAKER_01]: those are very specific guidelines.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's it's it's a it's a mathematical
Equation but that none of those guidelines
[SPEAKER_10]: have been established for cannabis not yet
not and that's when I think we blew past
[SPEAKER_01]: the And neither did we It's not all loss
you could you could still you could pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: close you can get some live resin out of
that We can make some Like would you make
[SPEAKER_05]: hash out of that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, you can make like like like ice
water hash.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, like you There's trichomes on the
leaves, there's you know, but there's also
[SPEAKER_05]: a whole lot of betrayed us, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, but you're filtering it.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're filtering it out, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Your bags filter that out a lot of it not
the spores.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay What do the spores do when you burn
them?
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't inhale them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I I would I would venture to guess not
much You probably have less betrayed as
[SPEAKER_05]: spores.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's not I mean if we're talking
about aspergillus and his lungs Yeah,
[SPEAKER_10]: if we're talking about aspergillus mold,
then don't forget does aspergillus grow on
[SPEAKER_10]: plants Dying tissue.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so I can guarantee you that I know
but that would be only like you could eat
[SPEAKER_05]: it It's just if you smoke or it actually
now the spores inhaling the spores.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah Well, I mean if you if you think
about it you you have a joint,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And you lied it and pre-roll you lied it
that first puff isn't all burning smoke
[SPEAKER_10]: There's some whatever spores were in there
went right into your lungs alive And they
[SPEAKER_10]: got shot right into your lungs.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nice So, you know, but yeah, I mean in a
resin, you know in a in a in a live resin
[SPEAKER_10]: You're gonna do go through all this
purification.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, I know live resin I'm saying ice water
hash solvent lists.
[SPEAKER_10]: I couldn't tell you I you know dive into
the research but tritus lung problems And
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm sure someone's done something but I
haven't heard that it's prominent All
[SPEAKER_05]: right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, let's so I just realized that Gemma
missed not Only her three-hour Chinese
[SPEAKER_05]: class this morning, but she also just
missed her dance class, too Is she happy
[SPEAKER_10]: of from that?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, so she wasn't gonna remind you she
wasn't gonna remind you Yeah, the dance
[SPEAKER_05]: class was and I and I knew it was 245 and
I texted her mom being like what like is
[SPEAKER_05]: there a zoom link for her 245 class.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's like I'll check on the link.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think class is at 345.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I was like, okay, and then I come back
and Like she forwarded something for the
[SPEAKER_05]: teacher.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's like we'll see you at 245 and it's
now like 410 Well, you learned about Corn
[SPEAKER_10]: earworm, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it was a good use of my time Yeah,
I mean my interest in this was like really
[SPEAKER_01]: literally first of all Doing it
experiencing it, but then also Well,
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah, I've been smoking it and all of that
but like it was it's the homegrown aspect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's right, you know, it's trying to
Bypass having to go and pay all those
[SPEAKER_01]: taxes if you do all of that So obviously
there's risks and there's all of that and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's costs and there's time and there's
there's all of that but and it's a
[SPEAKER_05]: learning process, but Generally,
there's sadness right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, this is not you know,
the outcome that you want right now My my
[SPEAKER_01]: dominant feeling is sad like a lot of
other people who might you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: like and everyone's doing their gardening
now And you know, there's a big argument
[SPEAKER_01]: for like people crowing their own cannabis
Especially if you need more, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you want to you know, if you're a
patient and you want to do that But you
[SPEAKER_01]: you really got to get past this it takes
so others.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a there's a there's a learning
curve You just have to remember we've
[SPEAKER_10]: taken a plant from nature and have We have
bred it for a certain characteristic right
[SPEAKER_10]: production of Cannabinoids and terpenes
high in oils, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, there's a cost to that right there's
a cost to that it's the same as you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: like we've taken cows and it used to be a
wild animal that that used to have better
[SPEAKER_10]: defenses against predators and Nowadays,
we've you know, we've created cows our
[SPEAKER_10]: entire life is intended, you know They're
just producing milk and they're also in
[SPEAKER_01]: like cow cities Potentially, yeah,
and if you look if you compare indoor
[SPEAKER_10]: growing with outdoor growing You know a
lot of indoor grows your your further
[SPEAKER_10]: cuddling the plant, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: You're giving it everything it needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're making it an indoor so now you've
got a coddle So that's often this is set
[SPEAKER_10]: why these these plants are more
susceptible I mean There there's there's
[SPEAKER_05]: told my wife.
[SPEAKER_05]: She's an indoor plant She lives inside the
Brentwood bubble, yeah, I mean you can see
[SPEAKER_10]: the difference You can see the difference
in indoor grown plants versus outdoor
[SPEAKER_10]: grown plants and their susceptibility to
certain things It's you know, it's an
[SPEAKER_10]: artificial.
[SPEAKER_10]: These are cultivars that were artificially
produced, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Would they do as well if you put them back
out in the wild probably not as well as
[SPEAKER_10]: they're you know wild type relatives Out
there right run free Chihuahua.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah We've bred you to be tiny and
helpless at one point that Chihuahua was
[SPEAKER_10]: hunting rabbit, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but also they've been bred to
have these extremely desirable
[SPEAKER_01]: characteristics Yes, look the smell and
other creatures.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're equally as attractive or even
better.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean more attracted it's you know,
there's there's a What's starting to you
[SPEAKER_10]: know, like come out of a lot of you know,
the Growers that are paying attention is
[SPEAKER_10]: is you know, the susceptibility of certain
strains with certain terpene profiles I
[SPEAKER_05]: think I mentioned this at the high with
one terpene It would it potentially could
[SPEAKER_10]: attract a certain pest it could or a
certain terpene profile Represents a plant
[SPEAKER_05]: that's more susceptible not just to insect
it represents a female to the male
[SPEAKER_10]: So We just don't know enough yet that's
just it is interesting like like terpene
[SPEAKER_05]: profiles are kind of like Frequencies and
at different like for example the moth
[SPEAKER_05]: like our pheromones would like is it a
smell which would imply It's a terpene.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're hormones They're actually hormones
that you and I can't smell but the male
[SPEAKER_05]: moth can but does that imply that it does
have a smell to to him It's a pheromone,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a pheromone, so it's not a smell
thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so it's not a terpene It's like it's
but it's a in the same way you think about
[SPEAKER_05]: terpenes with smell a pheromone is to like
a chemical Yeah, I mean it could be that
[SPEAKER_10]: but let's let's keep in mind that a lot of
these So mods for example, let's just
[SPEAKER_10]: think about mods and and what does the
butterfly eat?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well that the adult nectar and water so
would it make sense for nectar for adult?
[SPEAKER_10]: flying moths and Butterflies which are
nectar feeders to have the ability to
[SPEAKER_10]: smell flowers Nectar Find the nectar that
way But if you put like a gallon of nectar
[SPEAKER_05]: in front of me I would probably be able to
smell it But what if they're not what if
[SPEAKER_10]: they're not only focusing on nectar what
if they can smell?
[SPEAKER_10]: Terpenes that those flowers are producing
and what if they prefer a certain plant
[SPEAKER_05]: that produces a certain flower that says
so you could in breeding cultivars,
[SPEAKER_05]: which all kind of are going off and like
the berries and the desserts and the
[SPEAKER_05]: whatever but like You may cross paths with
some insect and you're and the insects
[SPEAKER_05]: like holy shit That's my favorite like
most good or maybe it smells like
[SPEAKER_10]: something that you really like so it
smells like it I mean limonene.
[SPEAKER_10]: What is limonene?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a terpene that's in lemon in every
can in cannabis, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: But it's it's prominent in in limes and
Citrus right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's a it's one of the I mean it smells
like limes That's why it's called limonene
[SPEAKER_10]: right smells lemony, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Could could that lemon smell be something
that attracts a you know a Citrus pest to
[SPEAKER_10]: the citrus trees.
[SPEAKER_10]: You just don't know is it it could be
right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And if it is with more limonene and
attract them to where a plant with more
[SPEAKER_10]: lime that produces more limonene attract
that Same pass I just you know and as the
[SPEAKER_05]: idea that they taste a leaf that they've
never tasted before and are like I
[SPEAKER_10]: actually like this So get to it so okay,
so yeah I'm not smoking Yeah, I mean it's
[SPEAKER_10]: it is I mean, okay, we work close with a
lot of people that are in the research
[SPEAKER_10]: side of it and You know I mentioned Steve
as one person would be one easy give me
[SPEAKER_10]: some other people well, you know We we
know people that you know different
[SPEAKER_10]: universities that that are animal I would
assume UC Davis is very strong UC Davis is
[SPEAKER_05]: strong Are there any are there any like
professors Cornell is also?
[SPEAKER_10]: There's a lot of these these these
universities that you know we have some
[SPEAKER_10]: contacts there.
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean there was the recent find of the
cannabis aphid we add up until they it
[SPEAKER_10]: came to Salinas we weren't sure whether
one specific species of a wasp was capable
[SPEAKER_10]: of parasitizing the aphid Until we were
actually able to together until we were
[SPEAKER_10]: actually able to have some Adult wasps
emerge from a dead aphid and send it to an
[SPEAKER_10]: expert in that particular family of wasps
in Florida and they Because there was no
[SPEAKER_05]: one in California who had that specific
expertise or maybe that's the Only person
[SPEAKER_10]: we knew who was an expert in bracon and so
they they well I didn't know them,
[SPEAKER_10]: but I was introduced to them We sent them
the the merged adults and they came back
[SPEAKER_10]: and told us yes In fact, it is this wasp
that is commercially produced from us I
[SPEAKER_10]: heard about it the aphidius colmani wasp
up until then we really weren't sure if
[SPEAKER_10]: colmani did do it So yeah, the research is
ongoing and that's when you guys were like
[SPEAKER_05]: we got a new bug.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna
[SPEAKER_10]: I found this yesterday as well,
which is exciting See that aphid right
[SPEAKER_10]: there, it's black.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's actually dead and it could be It
could be that it is one particular species
[SPEAKER_10]: of wasp that when it puts its egg in the
aphid the aphid turns black if It is we
[SPEAKER_05]: might have another weapon So you may see a
wasp emerge from there like in the next I
[SPEAKER_10]: collected it That's what I wanted to do
with the that's what I want to do with
[SPEAKER_10]: this I want to cut it out and look
underneath to see what there is down there
[SPEAKER_05]: And you're like this may be a wasp that we
don't currently have in our lineup.
[SPEAKER_10]: I suspect It's one that is commercially
reared.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay That's my suspicion That if it's
dead, yeah, he's dead, but he's not dried
[SPEAKER_10]: up and he's black and actually it looks
like the cannabis aphid it could be
[SPEAKER_10]: another aphid But this grower had the
cannabis aphid this is about all they had
[SPEAKER_10]: And it doesn't look like the other black
colored aphid that I've seen attack
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis Yeah, yeah, so what we've been
talking about Yeah, the hemp aphid for it
[SPEAKER_07]: on for it on cannabis Are there any vials
that you Haven't pulled out and shown us
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, I just I keep these I tell I tell
growers give a handful of them to your
[SPEAKER_10]: crew have them carry them around with you
always Catch it so I you I can remember we
[SPEAKER_05]: had the leaf hoppers Yeah, I still have
one at home.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_05]: I Could send you actually I have a picture
of it on my leaf hoppers are interesting
[SPEAKER_10]: We were just talking about be curly top
virus, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah last week now a reason to start
really thinking about Whether or not leaf
[SPEAKER_10]: hopper is gonna be a pest of cannabis
because it we had them It's what transmits
[SPEAKER_05]: that virus but yeah, and by the way,
we had them too and that's what we had We
[SPEAKER_05]: had like the praying mantis were like
what's up?
[SPEAKER_10]: This place is amazing so you can imagine a
situation where a farm is infested with
[SPEAKER_10]: the beet curly top virus and Those that's
being transmitted within the farm by a
[SPEAKER_10]: Leaf hopper and that somebody decides to
put a farm of hemp Right like in the same
[SPEAKER_05]: way that a mosquito Transmits from Canada.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it's exactly that it's maybe the
virus has been around forever and The leaf
[SPEAKER_10]: hoppers been around forever, but it wasn't
until you put the virus That got into the
[SPEAKER_10]: plant that the leaf hopper was feeding on
I posted a picture of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I posted a picture of a different one from
home Leaf hoppers this one was yeah I was
[SPEAKER_05]: like, you're kind of cute Yeah,
there's a but now yeah, that reminds me
[SPEAKER_10]: It's beet curly top virus, it's uh,
well it makes the tops of beets curly
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, it's it was it was found in be just
like the name says I guess and that's
[SPEAKER_10]: where they came up with the name be curly
top virus We're very literal in the naming
[SPEAKER_05]: of pests Yeah, sex and Tomato spotted wilt
virus.
[SPEAKER_10]: What do you think it does?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: So but yeah that but it's not exclusive to
beets.
[SPEAKER_10]: It has other hosts apparently now Cannabis
or hemp is a host nice Plane that thing is
[SPEAKER_05]: cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: Looks like it's made of wood.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably looks like a wood plane
right for the wildfires.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe I'm now that seems more like a
vintage like All right, well let's that's
[SPEAKER_05]: a strong Yes strong ending Tom's mind's
blown.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a lot to think about Well,
hey, you know, I didn't know you at the
[SPEAKER_05]: start we'll take this disease head now,
you know, I'm intimately.
[SPEAKER_05]: Do you feel like that kind of like Like
you get to come and intimately evaluate
[SPEAKER_05]: people's gardens like their grow
Essentially, yeah, that's my job basically
[SPEAKER_10]: burying themselves That's why I don't
mention names of people I work with I
[SPEAKER_10]: don't want to tell anyone where who where
who I might be selling bugs to so this
[SPEAKER_05]: specific Grower had this disease.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's the way you gotta do it
terrible Yeah, there's growing saline.
[SPEAKER_05]: I wouldn't buy I wouldn't buy their weed
in a shot.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah exactly.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's like no, that's uh Yeah, there's no
reason to mention anyone under the bus.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah
[SPEAKER_05]: Thousands of people right now,
so you're very brave Yeah, I mean,
[SPEAKER_10]: but then again, there's there's a reason
for this right you're learning you learn
[SPEAKER_10]: through, you know Now you have one more
strategy, but hey, you know, we didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: know each other Sacrificing you to teach
others The perspective like my perspective
[SPEAKER_01]: that will always be a non-commercial
perspective That's not what this is about.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, so everything is Considered
from a home-grown point of view and the
[SPEAKER_01]: cost what I'm going to do How can I
protect this and that doesn't mean the
[SPEAKER_01]: grief isn't you know, this is real,
you know in the sense of The time and all
[SPEAKER_01]: of that, but you know whether that changes
your decisions Maybe not because the the
[SPEAKER_01]: lessons are still the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, you have to you have to be
vigilant from the beginning The question
[SPEAKER_01]: for me has always been is there something
I can do even before all that Oh,
[SPEAKER_10]: yeah Yeah, what so I'm not a biocontrol
Specialist although I I know a bit about
[SPEAKER_10]: biocontrol I'm an IPM specialist and that
stands for integrated pest management the
[SPEAKER_10]: keywords integrated It means one not one
strategy like one of my profs used to say
[SPEAKER_10]: All right If you had a boxer come out if
you had Mike Tyson come out and all he
[SPEAKER_10]: knew how to do was throw an uppercut It
wouldn't take long before his his fighter
[SPEAKER_05]: knew that is the killer punch and punch
out.
[SPEAKER_10]: It is his Killer punch, but he but he's
also throwing everything else at you But
[SPEAKER_05]: if all he did is that the one where it's
like left left, right, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: I never played I never played it and I
think I did once and he killed me like in
[SPEAKER_10]: the first round and then I stopped it But
let's say all he did was come out with an
[SPEAKER_10]: uppercut and he just like wound himself up
Soon, you'd know how to how to defeat him,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's the same idea.
[SPEAKER_10]: You got to use everything you got to use
right crosses jabs The pests are like we
[SPEAKER_05]: saw that strategy last year.
[SPEAKER_05]: You're not gonna fool us again.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, you just Had to throw everything at
him.
[SPEAKER_10]: So there's so there's all kinds of it's
not just about when we talk about
[SPEAKER_10]: pesticides And when we talk about
biological control, we're talking about
[SPEAKER_10]: one arm one strategy in IPM That's the
eradication strategy.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's kill it.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's the last thing you do believe it or
not That's a that's like your last straw
[SPEAKER_10]: kill it, you know, you have things like
keep them out of the grow How do you do
[SPEAKER_10]: that or under control select select
strains that are more resistant,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: How what about hitting their life cycle
something that you know, the disease
[SPEAKER_10]: triangle we talked about that Yeah,
you can think of strategies right off the
[SPEAKER_10]: bat We talked about strategies if you
control the if you control the caterpillar
[SPEAKER_10]: you make it less susceptible to the
disease because there's less injury Right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's all these it's a myriad gonna
become a black belt in the understanding
[SPEAKER_10]: of the disease triangle Well, you know,
it takes a lot of reading and time and but
[SPEAKER_10]: to think thinking about it But you know,
that's kind of my job is you know design a
[SPEAKER_10]: program That is, you know more bio
intensive in other words trying to work
[SPEAKER_10]: around bio control so that we can reduce
or eliminate sprays But at the same time
[SPEAKER_10]: integrate as many strategies I can think
of and it also again coming back if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: dealing with commercial grows These are
grows that will have different strains in
[SPEAKER_01]: different, you know seasons and all of
that so but I assume that what they don't
[SPEAKER_01]: want is to have to fight the same battle
year after year or Face, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess this is just the challenge of
agriculture anyway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So It just seems that that cannabis in
particular, which is now only now really
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to scale up is dealing with these
issues on You got it and There are things
[SPEAKER_10]: we're doing that are good and they're
probably more things.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're doing that are bad.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's It took a couple of years before the
cannabis aphid really became a problem in
[SPEAKER_05]: Salinas from when I first was it on a
different plant Like do people know like
[SPEAKER_05]: it came from this or just came out of
nowhere.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, it's I Mean obviously the we talked a
bit about it on that last Sunday,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Remember Ford on that they totally honest
if it's a G in the genus Ford on and it
[SPEAKER_10]: has a relative that's very closely related
to it, which is the Hops aphid hops and
[SPEAKER_10]: hemp are related so that pests that feed
on them happen to also be related So is it
[SPEAKER_10]: is it outside the realm of possibility
that the hops aphid can?
[SPEAKER_10]: Host on cannabis and vice versa.
[SPEAKER_05]: Is it outside that like it did a
Neanderthal like diverging to what are we
[SPEAKER_05]: hominid?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are we?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're hominids hominids Neanderthal was
hominid too, but but it but we're not
[SPEAKER_05]: Neanderthal.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my Point is like do you think maybe in
a short period of time the hop aphid like?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like diverge like No, they're there.
[SPEAKER_10]: They are clearly different species,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: We don't know and we don't have a point
like a million years ago or even a
[SPEAKER_05]: thousand like because bugs Recycles like
they they have so many cycles in the in a
[SPEAKER_10]: year versus us I don't know how many for
it on a fit there are out there But it is
[SPEAKER_10]: a family of aphid and so they're they're
related in some of their genetic Didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: they recently find Like amber of and I
want to say something like a Fly wasn't
[SPEAKER_05]: it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Did you see something in the news in the
past?
[SPEAKER_05]: Of of what and it was a fly insect,
right?
[SPEAKER_05]: It was a sperm of an insect, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: And it was I think it was still stuck to
the female.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think she I think So does that mean that
they she was inseminated and but what does
[SPEAKER_05]: that mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: Could they recreate that fly like in VTRI?
[SPEAKER_10]: I at this point the technology is not
there yet as far as I know, you know Like
[SPEAKER_05]: a prehistoric fly I was here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's probably like this big No,
they you know, it's a sperm inside Is it
[SPEAKER_10]: possible that the hops aphid can can is a
is it possible at the hops aphid can bring
[SPEAKER_10]: hops late and viral to cannabis?
[SPEAKER_05]: And everybody by the way, this is our
Tom's expert opinion What about those of
[SPEAKER_05]: us who like disclaimer do well Tom is not
an expert.
[SPEAKER_10]: You can like weed too Beer buds and we
didn't wine if I liked hot.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I do like beer and I do like weed.
[SPEAKER_10]: So Yeah, so I am like the so that but the
cannabis aphids known only to host on On
[SPEAKER_10]: the cannabis although, you know,
it obviously has to follow some something
[SPEAKER_10]: somewhat of the life cycle of like the
hops aphid which goes which hosts between
[SPEAKER_10]: cannabis and Stone fruit prunus prunus
species.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but sorry before cannabis was around
the hops aphid was going obviously hops
[SPEAKER_05]: are grown all over I mean not all over but
like Where what's the other one dragon?
[SPEAKER_05]: What?
[SPEAKER_05]: The the you're talking about the trees.
[SPEAKER_10]: No, no, no, you mentioned it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah stone fruit Like prunes and peaches
and all that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Okay, that's the definition and it hosts
on But yeah, it's got the so when there
[SPEAKER_05]: are no hops fields around it's like all
hang out on the You know, it's I still
[SPEAKER_10]: don't understand it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Although I do know that it will can
overwinter basically feed and actually
[SPEAKER_10]: also, you know believe it can it can you
know reproduce on prunus, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: like the stone fruit and then back to hemp
or hops You know, we I'm not sure about
[SPEAKER_10]: this aphid whether whether eliminating and
there is no aphid yet But eliminating all
[SPEAKER_10]: the prunus trees in the area will just
break its ability to overwinter and then
[SPEAKER_05]: help with control I don't know because
hops die at the end of the season and
[SPEAKER_05]: those trees linger on and it's in
temperate climate like do those trees most
[SPEAKER_05]: like Let's say I assume they grow well in
like the Central Coast Do they lose their
[SPEAKER_05]: leaves in the winter?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are they just going full year?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, it's it's it's even just it
doesn't necessarily have to feed on
[SPEAKER_10]: leaves, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: It could be feeding on on branch tissue or
something, you know I don't a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: aphids when they overwinter will
overwinter on a naked tree That's you know
[SPEAKER_05]: in in the bark or you know How about in
cold environments like I grew up in New
[SPEAKER_05]: England?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I mean because here it's like look
if you can survive all year long and Where
[SPEAKER_10]: did prune or did prune trees come from
originally?
[SPEAKER_10]: You know, I haven't researched it.
[SPEAKER_10]: But at some point they bred them to grow
in different climates, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: in Iran, so they were bred to grow in
different climates and you know if There
[SPEAKER_10]: could be you know, there could be a prune
that grows here prunus species that grows
[SPEAKER_10]: here that doesn't back east and vice versa
Yeah, this is very interesting I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think have you dealt with a lot of any
these large grows where the farmers
[SPEAKER_01]: transitioned over to hemp from other crops
and so yeah, so You know because we've
[SPEAKER_01]: been hearing about this for three years,
you know Large grows and a lot of them
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't make it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They kind of didn't know what they were
doing They didn't know what they were
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna do with their crops after they
harvested them But now there's this other
[SPEAKER_01]: component worth did they know what pests
they were up against with this with these
[SPEAKER_01]: brand new crops and and and all of that
Yeah, no you you to grow something
[SPEAKER_05]: completely new there's definitely I mean
that the blueberry farmer up I think in
[SPEAKER_05]: Washington State I talked to a couple
months ago He then grew hemp at scale And
[SPEAKER_05]: he was like my first season and he's like
a world-class blueberry farmer And he was
[SPEAKER_05]: like it just slapped me around Yeah,
I mean if you're not ready for it,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know, it's like anyone, you know
There's a there's a learning curve for
[SPEAKER_10]: every crop.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some easy crops to grow How
would you like go away from a crop you
[SPEAKER_01]: know blueberry go?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, here's this new one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna make a killing and You know,
I I don't understand the mentality because
[SPEAKER_01]: here's like a smart person how could you
not even how could you do that and not do
[SPEAKER_01]: your bottom line research, you know Again,
there's the bottom line research isn't
[SPEAKER_10]: there you have to remember and then if
it's not there then you're taking a real
[SPEAKER_05]: challenge Yeah, well, it's like all the
people who are growing hemp and then we're
[SPEAKER_05]: like shit I have nowhere to store all this
stuff once I cut it down.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were saying they didn't they didn't
know how where they're gonna store it They
[SPEAKER_01]: didn't know how to cure it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They didn't know how to then you have to
dry sure this if you Want to sell the
[SPEAKER_01]: flower would you make that investment if
you don't know you could it be could it be
[SPEAKER_10]: that?
[SPEAKER_10]: The investor for the cannabis operation is
a different animal altogether.
[SPEAKER_10]: Could it be that somebody that wants to
switch?
[SPEAKER_10]: Let's say from ornamental flower
production to cannabis Here we're talking
[SPEAKER_05]: about the people who are doing hemp farms
at scale like not cannabis but like well
[SPEAKER_05]: same same deal Such a bigger scale of like
what you've never done this before and you
[SPEAKER_05]: haven't thought of Like and you bring
someone in who knows what they're doing
[SPEAKER_10]: But but see so that's what I was getting
at is you have it the chance of success
[SPEAKER_10]: for somebody that has grown another crop
and has done it for years and Understands
[SPEAKER_10]: everything that goes into the business of
farming having success with hemp I think
[SPEAKER_10]: is greater than you know, some somebody
that's just investing to try to oh a
[SPEAKER_10]: hundred percent Which is a lot of cannabis
which is a lot of cannabis and and a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of hemp I mean if you when I'm hearing
from you is that there's a Body of
[SPEAKER_01]: knowledge you need to every different
thing that you grow that you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: if you're not aware of it'll fight,
you know Yeah, absolutely on the pest
[SPEAKER_10]: side.
[SPEAKER_10]: I I tend I focus on cannabis I've had a
what three years now just almost
[SPEAKER_10]: exclusively focusing on this crop because
it's a new crop and so, you know It's like
[SPEAKER_10]: I am I am learning more and more about no
different indoor outdoor greenhouse,
[SPEAKER_10]: you know environments pests compasses
different different states and their pests
[SPEAKER_01]: My learning curves like that.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so that's so that's kind of my goal
is focus on this niche I know I couldn't
[SPEAKER_10]: tell you anything about plant nutrition,
you know, other than what a basic Botany
[SPEAKER_10]: class or plant physiology class taught me,
you know, but going forward that would
[SPEAKER_01]: probably be really helpful to you because
oh sure that not like yeah, you know when
[SPEAKER_10]: you're talking about well, don't get me
wrong I mean I do know I I did take I mean
[SPEAKER_10]: a fit a fit is known to blow up and Plants
are excessively, you know, they have
[SPEAKER_10]: excessive nitrogen, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Right.
[SPEAKER_10]: So so why wouldn't that apply to this?
[SPEAKER_10]: We're I don't know if we're sure about
that yet, but it's something I follow You
[SPEAKER_10]: know, and we we definitely you know You
can't get you can't get in the
[SPEAKER_10]: agricultural pest management without
knowing something about plant physiology
[SPEAKER_10]: But I would never jump into growing let's
put it that way I'm not I'd land fly.
[SPEAKER_10]: I could probably protect the plant,
but it would be a spindly, you know weak
[SPEAKER_05]: plant low yield But it survived unlike
Tom's might be pest free Yeah Robusto is
[SPEAKER_01]: that then I'm still letting them go.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's so funny because even some of these
back there It's sort of like they have a
[SPEAKER_01]: will to live.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, keep in mind if there is a disease
there You're harboring that, you know
[SPEAKER_10]: potentially harboring botrytis.
[SPEAKER_10]: So all that dead meat Tissue when when you
get it you want it you want to clean up.
[SPEAKER_10]: You're gonna want to clean that whole
area, you know Burn it strawberry growers
[SPEAKER_10]: like I was telling you they pick up the
strawberries and Tom towards the back
[SPEAKER_10]: yard.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, they clean up Yeah, it's because you
you've you've you basically have a proper
[SPEAKER_10]: Gule something that can Come back to life
once it has a susceptible host,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_10]: and and the and the environment and become
like like airborne like spore life,
[SPEAKER_10]: right and if Botrytis is a problem in
tomatoes and you have those there or if
[SPEAKER_10]: it's you know a problem in any one of
these other crops of yours, which is this
[SPEAKER_05]: one looks like a poo with leaves Coming
out of it It looks like a poo with leaves
[SPEAKER_10]: coming out of it Yeah, you you know you if
you have spores that landed on your lawn
[SPEAKER_10]: there and you watered with a sprinkler and
This is one way that spores can move from
[SPEAKER_10]: plant to plant the drops of water hit the
ground pick up the spores and splash onto
[SPEAKER_10]: the growing bed and then it happens again
and or the wind dries that spore now that
[SPEAKER_10]: it's gotten closer to the plant and spore
flies up and lands let's say on a pistol
[SPEAKER_10]: as it's Just beginning to show signs of
like the flower primordia, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's all you need that spores there and
that could be It could be the death of You
[SPEAKER_01]: know, you can see it happening it's
obvious but I didn't know I mean there's
[SPEAKER_01]: nothing I could do to prevent it I didn't
know I mean, you know, I mean,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm it was so fast literally within a few
days and also I'm like I need I rather
[SPEAKER_01]: than go in and do that I'm like,
alright, this is the first one I know
[SPEAKER_01]: what's happening, but I need I want to
have someone come here, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's what we're gonna do So that's why I
time we're setting up next I think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: the plan going and rip everything,
you know, like all the brown because I
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been that with a few of them and
there's nothing left Yeah, there's a
[SPEAKER_10]: chance that if you had harvested this last
week gotten rid of all the dead dry brown
[SPEAKER_10]: and Scott got him on maybe some kind of
really aggressive drying of everything
[SPEAKER_10]: else that you'd have saved half of it But
yeah, no, I mean that's I think once Peter
[SPEAKER_10]: and I met that was kind of a the idea is
if I become part of this thing You know,
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll be around next year or next time
lives in LA Yeah, yeah, yeah to to see
[SPEAKER_10]: what we could do to you know, do our best
to protect We need Eric Nugshot to come
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm so like such an advocate for home
grows.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had this I'm admire this for the
camera like, you know, like tending to
[SPEAKER_01]: people, you know That's why there was
another part of this like let's see if we
[SPEAKER_01]: can and we have an indoor thing Here can
we successfully do some home grows?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, no doubt and then I thought well,
you know take ten them for people,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know And I think that actually with
with with cannabis, you know People should
[SPEAKER_01]: want their home grows, but it's a lot of
work I'm realizing it's really a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: work because you know, you almost have to
have daily eyeballs on and I was wasn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really aware of that and even something as
small as this it's like You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I Catching like seeing like catching that
it's work.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's work like you were you know,
and I even got one of these This just so I
[SPEAKER_01]: can get in real cool nice I still didn't
catch all of them, but that's what it
[SPEAKER_10]: takes So it does and there are all kinds
of tools for it And you know, if you if
[SPEAKER_10]: you know me long enough, you'll know I'm a
preach I preach monitoring I preach it's
[SPEAKER_10]: it's you preach mono what monitoring if
you don't spend the labor resources on
[SPEAKER_10]: monitoring you could end up with you know,
a really bad situation quick and Really
[SPEAKER_10]: quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah Like within two weeks Even even more
than that because when I I let him know
[SPEAKER_01]: right away what was going on And he has
the text who's he it was and I was like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I think I've lost the whole thing Yeah,
that was a week and a half ago easily I go
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pretty sure this entire thing is gone
because I saw what was happening and That
[SPEAKER_01]: was a weekend.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was in Rhode Island.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, yeah that that that hot event could
have also been something to do with it,
[SPEAKER_10]: right?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes heavy presence of so when he texted me
that my response was Keep an eye on the
[SPEAKER_05]: other buds looking to them with a knife
And eyes to see if you can find any
[SPEAKER_05]: caterpillars like pry pry them up Like
look closely to see if there are any
[SPEAKER_10]: caterpillars in there Well now you look
know to look for the poop and the feeding
[SPEAKER_10]: the leaf feeding damage, right?
[SPEAKER_05]: You know, you need to you know,
you need to you have older dog on that
[SPEAKER_05]: smell and then have her bark When she
smells it that specific worm poop,
[SPEAKER_10]: I mean a caterpillar poo That's right,
that's an interesting idea using dogs dogs
[SPEAKER_05]: for scouting yeah your pests Okay,
I gotta go home and cook dinner but this
[SPEAKER_05]: was awesome strong work team Tom you you
are like Jesus Sacrificing himself for the
[SPEAKER_05]: good of other home growers everywhere But
but but He rose and next year will bring
[SPEAKER_01]: some new diseases and place to attack your
plans It's so demoralizing because that
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling like two weeks ago when I was
like, you know, cuz I That's that's when
[SPEAKER_01]: your hopes were at their highest a million
and so weeks ago and oh my god I have
[SPEAKER_01]: these and just not even because I don't
like touching them but and so like so
[SPEAKER_01]: sticky and I'm like, oh my god,
I Made this happen because I've been
[SPEAKER_01]: taking so much been care of them and I'm
like and so that feeling was Beyond if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a cannabis lever and go and because
that's how they were It's like I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: even touch them and my fingers would come
away still I'm not even touching them and
[SPEAKER_05]: contrast that with your current feeling So
how long have you been growing?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, so you just had to talk to a few
cannabis growers and ask them the messes
[SPEAKER_01]: they've had to deal with There's a
learning curve There's always a learning
[SPEAKER_01]: curve I know this loss is relative All I'm
saying is like that coming from that
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling down to the other one You really
have to do a little work to to revisit
[SPEAKER_01]: that, you know to jump back in and go back
but But like all the growers I've talked
[SPEAKER_01]: to you know, we've done it they're like,
you know, you know All your plants don't
you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they don't you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep You know, and you grow new ones and
it's the cycle of life and Yep But here's
[SPEAKER_01]: the other thing he brought these things
over See even even the one on the left
[SPEAKER_01]: just like I didn't he was gonna make it It
was like sickly it was nothing and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like every day and so they're like little
babies and nursing them back and it became
[SPEAKER_01]: this beautiful little plant He's bonded
with them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do have bonded with them.
[SPEAKER_10]: Mm-hmm.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have it's sad I know yeah, I've um,
but here's the other thing These are also
[SPEAKER_01]: designed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not a it's not living soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like everything was according to
these guys Organics alive great guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you're you're The caterpillar just
yeah Ignored ignored it's it's it's life
[SPEAKER_01]: that came so it's sort of like finding the
balance, you know I don't want to kill the
[SPEAKER_05]: caterpillar, but I don't want to we're
gonna basically these beds over the window
[SPEAKER_05]: We can build up and the beds.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just get some words in there Las Vegas
The only living soil grow I think in all
[SPEAKER_01]: of Las Vegas in the first one beautiful
fall.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is Steve Cantwell Steve Cantwell,
you know who he is He was a Martin X
[SPEAKER_01]: martial arts champion.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got this row.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this now He's an indoor living soil
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a grower and he uses these beds,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's all I mean, they're just it's so
it's indoor You know toe it's controlled
[SPEAKER_01]: environment get dressed in your little
booties all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is his weed this is his weed the
banana really cool guy and You know,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, so you know, we're just I'm going
going for for a living organic invite That
[SPEAKER_01]: was the idea.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when you come back next year Tom's
gonna have a four by sixty bed in those
[SPEAKER_01]: lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: He was at his 22nd, yeah, I think
Cultivation in that's in that same soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so he's supposed to get richer richer
as it goes on 22 is a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah It's a science and another like four
and a half over five.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think Yeah, it's it's all science and
it's an art You know people have to have
[SPEAKER_10]: worked with a crop in a specific Growing
system to really figure out how to make it
[SPEAKER_10]: work.
[SPEAKER_10]: Some people are gifted Yeah, it's a
consistent which is always impressive to
[SPEAKER_01]: go and see the plants everything was a
beautiful grow not even terribly large and
[SPEAKER_01]: He has his hands on everything this guy
who was a mixed martial arts guy in now
[SPEAKER_01]: and his knowledge is who he's totally into
him So that was basically the question
[SPEAKER_01]: because everything he produces he sells
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got a sweet little small business,
but everyone wants to get bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not selling any of this No,
no, but how you get bigger and maintain?
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe go slow.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe go slow.
[SPEAKER_10]: I've seen I've seen so I've seen so many
people fall Flat on their face just biting
[SPEAKER_10]: off more than they could chew And if
you're making it with a small business if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're paying your people you're making
some money.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's wrong with that, right?
[SPEAKER_10]: That's why people go to and major in and
get degrees in agricultural business
[SPEAKER_10]: because You know that teaches you how to
do that how to start a farm and make it
[SPEAKER_10]: successful and grow and and eventually
become rich from it Yeah, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: but you jump into it without really
knowing what's involved You you've kind of
[SPEAKER_10]: you've set yourself up, you know Well,
I mean would be interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you know, it's interesting to know
at what point You know in cannabis scaling
[SPEAKER_01]: up does it become like a real like a real
different type of product, you know,
[SPEAKER_05]: and you know less What is it let's cross
the Budweiser threshold Yeah, give us give
[SPEAKER_10]: us another five years.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll know a lot more No, that's done I
got what I needed
[SPEAKER_05]: That was Gemma was Feeds there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh my god on cue Gemma was feeding the
caterpillar, but then it got loose.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're going right now, baby girl No,
Jim.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're gonna leave now and let's go cook
some dinner and look at our plants at home
[SPEAKER_05]: You can if we get back quick, you can go
in the pool.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's your incentive To want to leave
quickly because we got to leave quickly
[SPEAKER_05]: When something we have to do aligns with
what you want to do Amazing things happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you ask Ryan about the little leather
pouches?
[SPEAKER_05]: No, that's the leather pouches What's that
they were in the bag?
[SPEAKER_05]: I was like, thank God
[SPEAKER_04]: Gemma we had some amazing conversation out
here that you missed But Gemma we decided
[SPEAKER_05]: some things you're gonna get really good
at where'd you go You're gonna become our
[SPEAKER_05]: caterpillar Identifier you're gonna be
like our patrol like on the what's the
[SPEAKER_05]: north wall and in Game of Thrones?
[SPEAKER_10]: What do they call it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Gemma the glasses Mike, okay,
don't I did Okay No, I assumed you had all
[SPEAKER_05]: right, so there's all right.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you?
[SPEAKER_05]: Baby girl
[SPEAKER_05]: The gardener brought that like from his
house Tom that's like a vector of in fact,
[SPEAKER_05]: he said probably has like mites and It's
like a spider mite and actually I would
[SPEAKER_05]: love for you to look at that right now and
be like dude this has All sorts of stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't want to be introducing
[SPEAKER_08]: Wait, so the gardener was like Yeah,
you know, I mean it's totally different so
[SPEAKER_05]: he was like flowering all right,
he was like you're growing weed I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: growing some weed at home really well and
he had it in Terrible soil and I so I put
[SPEAKER_01]: it into this and put some better dirt in
there Tom You are such a caregiver to
[SPEAKER_01]: these plants It's doing okay, but I
couldn't mess with the roots so I couldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: mess with his original He just had it was
just shitty.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was really Dense and you know Do you
see any like spider mites?
[SPEAKER_05]: Was do you know what it was he growing
inside or outside or And have you been
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping it in the shade the entire time?
[SPEAKER_01]: No Okay, but but it started to I'm not
sorry you had it over there It was yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: it was burning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It looked like it was burning a little bit
So I took it out of the Sun, but it's been
[SPEAKER_01]: getting right in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: There's definitely rot in there Nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not Tom.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're not the only ones It just got here
just got here Tom you are like the Grim
[SPEAKER_05]: Reaper for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, yeah weed plan, but this was it was
They're like, I don't want to go to Tom's
[SPEAKER_05]: house.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah Why not harvest it yes, baby girl Oh
my god, you're taking food to go my god
[SPEAKER_06]: she gave it to you just took it Get it
ground up.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean these do look like a little bit
like turds, but now I think this is just
[SPEAKER_05]: dirt Yeah, now we're finding them left and
right so show me how many This is one
[SPEAKER_05]: minute about a minute of scouting.
[SPEAKER_05]: How many are in there?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_10]: I lost time right hand Yeah, and it just
took about a minute.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I mean we've yet to see one bud here
that doesn't have All right, so basically
[SPEAKER_05]: in better non-blinding light we're finding
tons of caterpillar they they're probably
[SPEAKER_10]: gonna hide When it's hot, right,
right So now that it's cooling off they're
[SPEAKER_10]: coming out to feed they might they might
be more likely to come out and Chewing on
[SPEAKER_10]: social green parts me Yeah, I mean if
there is botrytis here that's More and
[SPEAKER_10]: more converts convinces.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not the real problem.
[SPEAKER_10]: The problem was all this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so we have predominantly a
Caterpillar infestation Then you can
[SPEAKER_10]: you'll find them and I mean that's That's
a lot for like a minute of scouting.
[SPEAKER_10]: Right?
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, this is But the turds give it away
interesting That the leaves weren't
[SPEAKER_10]: focused on they just came at the right
time the moth laid its eggs at the right
[SPEAKER_05]: time So sometimes they lay their eggs much
earlier and then you start Normally what I
[SPEAKER_10]: see is a lot of leaf chewing damage which
leads you to the area where you like this
[SPEAKER_10]: here Which which leads you to where to
look for them, you know So, okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: I see that leaf chewed.
[SPEAKER_10]: I see that leaf chewed there.
[SPEAKER_10]: There's got to be a caterpillar here I
look but normally Where you don't see leaf
[SPEAKER_10]: chewing you don't expect them to be there.
[SPEAKER_10]: So I'm wondering if what happened they
they hatched by the time there was
[SPEAKER_10]: significant amount of flower tissue and
started feeding unbeknownst to Tom and By
[SPEAKER_10]: the time you got to this stage They were
everywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were just hiding Well, I mean I have
had people out here who were more
[SPEAKER_05]: knowledgeable than me but they didn't well
I think when we saw that first one was
[SPEAKER_05]: kind of like the early days of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but that is exactly when I would have
started I mean if I Know but you know what
[SPEAKER_10]: there Peter does make a very important
point is when you scout is important I
[SPEAKER_10]: tend to like Cooler part of the morning
for scouting for exactly this reason it
[SPEAKER_10]: when we first came out here was nothing
like this and now we're seeing them I mean
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm picking them out of practically every
flower handed Yeah, so they got you good
[SPEAKER_05]: but you'll be ready next year Shake it off
Tom Okay, I'm gonna bring Gemma home This
[SPEAKER_01]: has been I mean the thing is is like you
just need to know I could bet I I could
[SPEAKER_01]: that that is you you can I could deal with
that I can I'm dealing with with
[SPEAKER_01]: caterpillars next time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, look at this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Look at When I just like the turds Yeah,
knowledge is power right absolutely So we
[SPEAKER_10]: know the strategy what scares me is not no
good thing is so far it's just been that
[SPEAKER_05]: corn you're like miniature rabbit pellets
All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll leave you guys so you guys are like
gorillas grooming the plant Show it to me
[SPEAKER_05]: sideways A lot of unhappy caterpillars and
alcohol So you'll basically ID these and
[SPEAKER_05]: be like they're all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: It looks like it's all the same
caterpillar Okey-dokey It's hard to walk
[SPEAKER_10]: away Like when did we find the last Easter
egg we don't really funny so young a very
[SPEAKER_10]: young They're brownish yellowish brown all
the way to this big fat green one,
[SPEAKER_10]: but it's all the same Appears to be all
the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: Did you get that piece in one thing?
[SPEAKER_10]: That was Gemma we have some more
caterpillar for you You have to dig in
[SPEAKER_10]: there and you'll find them Gemma more than
likely if you find this many.
[SPEAKER_10]: Oh, here's one.
[SPEAKER_10]: I forgot that one That one's a baby and
they're all the same species Okay,
[SPEAKER_05]: so that is the Corn ear.
[SPEAKER_10]: Yeah, that's what it looks like to me.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm like I said It's the striping that
that I showed you the photo, you know,
[SPEAKER_10]: I'll show you the two stripes that go
down.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's it's back You
