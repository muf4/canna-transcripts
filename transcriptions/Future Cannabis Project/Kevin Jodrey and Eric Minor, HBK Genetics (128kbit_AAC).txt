[SPEAKER_05]: This is my pod, Eric, and Eric was someone
that I had on an interview for the first
[SPEAKER_05]: Breeda series because I respect him as an
individual and I respect his work.
[SPEAKER_05]: But what Eric did was Eric transferred
over to Topicals because his ability to
[SPEAKER_05]: get a license was hampered because nursery
licenses to function as a breeder require
[SPEAKER_05]: a nursery license to sell, and that means
you have to have commercial real estate.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so commercial real estate's expensive,
and so for the majority of people that I
[SPEAKER_05]: know, they don't have the ability to
really have all the tools.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so Eric shifts over to Topicals,
but lo and behold, one of his flagship
[SPEAKER_05]: creations wins the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, oh my gosh.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, you're still a breeder in who you
are, and you're still alive in cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: because you just made an adjustment to
where you were gonna go forward with what
[SPEAKER_05]: you did.
[SPEAKER_05]: But I said, but I would love to have you
come up and be introduced because you're
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody who created a variety that won a
major competition and allowed the people
[SPEAKER_05]: who grew it to have sellability because
these wins give you publicity,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then it creates a demand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I just said, man, even though you're
not breeding in the normal sense anymore,
[SPEAKER_05]: your creations are resonating.
[SPEAKER_05]: And he also had done work prior that he
didn't get credit for that I had done huge
[SPEAKER_05]: movements of the material, and he gets
ahold of me one day and he said,
[SPEAKER_05]: hey, on the galaxy, my material and your
material are the same material,
[SPEAKER_05]: and I don't understand how that can be.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I said, oh, it's easy.
[SPEAKER_05]: Somebody fucked you, and I got ahold of
it, and you never got credit.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what we're gonna do is we're gonna give
you credit for the material you did
[SPEAKER_05]: because otherwise what happens is you get
diminished.
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitely not a one-hit wonder.
[SPEAKER_05]: Someone who's been in business a long
time, who's done a lot of good breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: work, who's developed a lot of varieties.
[SPEAKER_05]: We called the green ribbon, but it was the
hottest variety in the Sacramento cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: market.
[SPEAKER_05]: So before they wiped out the Sacramento
cannabis market, it was booming.
[SPEAKER_05]: The variety that he created was one of the
hottest varieties, one of the hardest
[SPEAKER_05]: clones to get your hands on because it was
hoarded.
[SPEAKER_05]: And when I realized that he had done this,
I said, my gosh, I said, you need to be
[SPEAKER_05]: able to bring this out.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so my whole thing with a lot of the
interviews is I just give you a chance to
[SPEAKER_05]: talk, and then we'll ask some questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then we open it up to the audience
quick because you're gonna want to ask
[SPEAKER_05]: people these questions of like,
what direction are you moving?
[SPEAKER_05]: What motivated you to do this?
[SPEAKER_05]: What was the source material you used?
[SPEAKER_05]: Where do you see the industry moving?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because these are the information that you
need because you're not gonna get this
[SPEAKER_05]: from anybody.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody in the mainstream, everybody makes
you sign NDs to even talk to them now.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so the thing is all the information
that's being generated is being preserved
[SPEAKER_05]: and held for a very specific group of
people, just like economics.
[SPEAKER_05]: Economics was a study paid for and funded
by the wealthy to understand how do they
[SPEAKER_05]: remain wealthy?
[SPEAKER_05]: And why do you not get economics education
in school?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because they don't want you to be wealthy.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so to me, this is the same information
as you get an opportunity to talk to some
[SPEAKER_05]: sharp people.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm gonna get off the mic and give it
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody hear me?
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, my name is Eric Miner.
[SPEAKER_04]: I own HBK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm second generation farmer.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm second generation.
[SPEAKER_04]: My father grew when I was really little.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I kind of picked it up in high
school.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm so Cal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I don't really have a lot of ties to
humble area except for the last few years
[SPEAKER_04]: as I've been progressing to get up into
this area.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a lot of success with my topicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started making topicals in the mid 90s.
[SPEAKER_04]: My daughter was born with a rare skin
condition.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I was one of the few that were actually
making topicals for people before there
[SPEAKER_04]: was excess material to just say,
hey, what the hell are we gonna do with
[SPEAKER_04]: all this material?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's dump it into a topical brand and try
to move it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there were a need for what I was doing
at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when I first started breeding in the
early 90s, there were no seed banks
[SPEAKER_04]: available to just go order seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you needed seeds, you had to source it
from somebody else and then create your
[SPEAKER_04]: own seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You just didn't go buy big lots of seeds
to then, oh, I want this strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm gonna go source it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, breeding was a necessity in the
beginning.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that kind of just led into me getting
the strains out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But realistically, the reason I got kind
of screwed on some of my strains was being
[SPEAKER_04]: an older breeder, we didn't tell people
what we were doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We stayed very quiet.
[SPEAKER_04]: We only dealt with certain people and only
ones that were trusted.
[SPEAKER_04]: So even into the mid 2000 range,
I was still being very quiet about what I
[SPEAKER_04]: was doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of strains got out because I
wanted those strains to get out to the
[SPEAKER_04]: farmers that needed them.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as some people do, they didn't be
forthcoming with that and made an
[SPEAKER_04]: advantage for themselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which ultimately brought me here because
as we all know, things come full circle,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: And so this year, my chili birdie hit big
at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so yeah, that was a strain that
actually came full circle.
[SPEAKER_04]: When I released that in 2014 at the
Emerald Cup, I kind of took a beating on
[SPEAKER_04]: that strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: At the time, those strains, the lavender
was played out pretty heavily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nobody was really interested in working
with it then because they had driven it
[SPEAKER_04]: into the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the key lime pie was taking kind of
not that great of reception because it was
[SPEAKER_04]: the cut of cookies that nobody really
wanted to mess with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And after I had done the work with it,
I was like, wow, this is something that
[SPEAKER_04]: really needs to get out to the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I tried to kick and stomp and tell
people and nobody really listened.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then when I met Kevin for the seed
series a few years back, I brought a cut
[SPEAKER_04]: up and I was like, hey, you know,
this is something you guys really need to
[SPEAKER_04]: check out.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it took another two years.
[SPEAKER_04]: And realistically, as a breeder,
it's not just you breeding something
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing and saying, hey, this is what I've
got.
[SPEAKER_04]: It takes a community of people to get that
out there to the public.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took several people with big social
media accounts and being able to get that
[SPEAKER_04]: strain out to customers who then told
everybody, hey, you know, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it created a buzz about that
strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's something you kind of want to
work with when you're working with your
[SPEAKER_04]: strains is make sure you have something
that you can get out to the public and
[SPEAKER_04]: that public's then going to tell
everybody, hey, you know, this was
[SPEAKER_04]: amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to work with this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that will then come back to you and
hopefully make your product more
[SPEAKER_04]: accessible and people will want it.
[SPEAKER_04]: The other thing is as a breeder,
you have to find your niche.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you doing?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you creating a commercial brand that
other farmers will then make a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: money off of?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you doing extract work?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you doing heirloom preservation?
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of that is acclimation to what
you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So some people don't have the ability to
do heirloom preservation because some of
[SPEAKER_04]: those strains just don't work in your
area.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then with that, so you kind of have to
find your niche.
[SPEAKER_04]: Who are you working with?
[SPEAKER_04]: Who are you selling to?
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're doing extraction work,
you know, you've got to find the ones that
[SPEAKER_04]: the extractors are wanting.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's really listically a two-year
process of being able to get those strains
[SPEAKER_04]: out there because the first year you're
creating those strains.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you're doing R&D research with those
strains to make sure they're even going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be acceptable and work with the people
that are using them.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have strains that you create and
you think, oh, wow, this is something
[SPEAKER_04]: that's got to be out there to the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then you get it into commercial
production and it doesn't transfer over
[SPEAKER_04]: well into the market because it's either
fluffy and the public is like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, you know, that's not what I wanted,
or the terpene profile isn't currently
[SPEAKER_04]: what's up to par with what everybody's
looking for at that time.
[SPEAKER_04]: So realistically, two years prior,
you need to be thinking about,
[SPEAKER_04]: well, what am I going to create that
people are going to want two years from
[SPEAKER_04]: now?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because as a breeder, you're not just
going to make something right off the bat,
[SPEAKER_04]: dump it on the market, and then
everybody's going to get it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not very many people have that
accessibility to the general population.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a breeder, you're going to need a
lot of motivation to blow their strains up
[SPEAKER_04]: unless you have a multi-million dollar
account with advertisers and social media.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a small-based farm, you really have
to talk to your customers, talk to the
[SPEAKER_04]: people that you're working with,
say, hey, what are you hearing from your
[SPEAKER_04]: people?
[SPEAKER_04]: What do they want?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it fruits?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it OGs?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it gases?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it autos?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from there, start to create your
plan of what you want to create and get
out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Get out to the market.
[SPEAKER_05]: What did you start with in the 90s?
[SPEAKER_05]: What was your beginning source material
for your topicals?
[SPEAKER_04]: That was from Jamie.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started working with Jamie at Resin
Seeds through advice through Ringo.
[SPEAKER_04]: We had talked about CBD production and
figuring out whether those would be more
[SPEAKER_04]: applicable to topical creams.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once I started experimenting with that
a little bit, we started realizing that
[SPEAKER_04]: CBD was really what was where the topical
applications were.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd been making THC-only creams for a
while, but I wasn't really getting the
[SPEAKER_04]: results that I really wanted.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then once we started doing work with
Ringo strains and then with Jamie from
[SPEAKER_04]: Resin, we really started to see a big
boost in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But now the CBD market has really started
to change.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are thinking about getting in the
CBD game, you have to really think about
[SPEAKER_04]: the new hemp production and how big that
is and what they will entail.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you are a small farm, you might
want to seriously think about one-to-ones
[SPEAKER_04]: that are even-based because that will get
you a little bit farther in the game
[SPEAKER_04]: because you're not competing against
multi-million dollar hemp productions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, the thing that with the new hemp
laws, FDA takes on hemp under the farms.
[SPEAKER_05]: And with hemp production, you can make it
into a product called, we call it Nobaco.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's not tobacco, but you smoke it like
it's tobacco.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you can use it as topicals.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in California, the BCC regs is any
cannabis that you use as consumption.
[SPEAKER_05]: So for individuals that produce
tincture-based medicine, it has to come
[SPEAKER_05]: through BCC regulations under that
umbrella.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that's something that's massive
because most of the people who got into
[SPEAKER_05]: hemp really sold most of their product as
an edible tincture.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you went to any one of these stores,
it was 90% of the products sold were
[SPEAKER_05]: edible tinctures.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everyone said, oh, man, I'm going to
get into hemp.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm just going to kill it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the FDA said, sorry.
[SPEAKER_05]: We want to do multiple licensing
agreements, so to speak, where you get
[SPEAKER_05]: regulated as a hemp producer.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can produce this.
[SPEAKER_05]: But on this level, you have to produce it
under the BCC.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for Eric, as a topical maker,
he can now source hemp material.
[SPEAKER_05]: But if he was someone who was a tincture
maker, he's not allowed to use hemp as a
[SPEAKER_05]: derivative to make into that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're into any of these holistic
medicine, you have to understand where to
[SPEAKER_05]: source it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And like he said with the 2014,
when he released the Chilli Verde,
[SPEAKER_05]: the gas was on fire.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's still on fire in the hot markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: But everybody wanted fuel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The market changes so fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: One day, they want one thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: One day, the next day, they want something
else.
[SPEAKER_04]: So diversify on what you're breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try to get a little bit of a ray on where
you're at, the OGs, the cheeses,
[SPEAKER_04]: the gases, the fruits.
[SPEAKER_04]: They come and go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you hold onto those stocks,
if you're ready and you're watching the
[SPEAKER_04]: market, you'll be able to drop those.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of the older stuff comes around.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you are primarily looking for the
hottest thing on the market, and you're
[SPEAKER_04]: like, oh, I got to have the Skittle Gelato
right now, you may be left behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because next year, that's not going to be
the hottest thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And realistically, in breeding programs,
get a good testing laboratory.
[SPEAKER_04]: Figure out where your numbers are.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single breeding project that I do
gets tested.
[SPEAKER_04]: All those genetics, I have to know whether
I'm getting good terpene profiles,
[SPEAKER_04]: what the terpene profiles are,
what the numbers on the percentages are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from there, that gives me a base
on what I'm going to do with those plants
[SPEAKER_04]: as far as are they getting good nutrient
uptake?
[SPEAKER_04]: Is the root structure good?
[SPEAKER_04]: Are the branches good?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from there, I can start to go
into how does it harvest out?
[SPEAKER_04]: How does it transfer over into the market?
[SPEAKER_04]: And then from there, how does the extract
company come back to me?
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's a lot of array of what you are
looking for when you start to breed.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just crossing the hottest thing
with the hottest thing and then dropping
[SPEAKER_04]: those seeds on the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are the guys that get in trouble,
because they're creating something that is
[SPEAKER_04]: based off something else, and they're not
doing the research and the time to develop
[SPEAKER_04]: the plant as a whole completely across the
board.
[SPEAKER_04]: I made genetics before that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, oh my god, this is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait to get this out to the
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then when we would get it into certain
areas, they would burn up, because the
[SPEAKER_04]: temperatures, they couldn't handle hot
temperatures, or they can't handle cold
[SPEAKER_04]: temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or you harvest them, and all the way
through the growth, the plant is just
[SPEAKER_04]: stinking amazingly.
[SPEAKER_04]: You harvest it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You cure it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get it in a bag and a jar,
and all of a sudden, it's like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, there's nothing there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those strains, those are the ones you have
to eliminate as you're going through.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got a bunch of friends from Europe,
and they're large industrial seed makers
[SPEAKER_05]: in Europe.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were having a conversation about the
success of the variety AK-47.
[SPEAKER_05]: We were talking about how when Simon did
the breeding on it, because he did huge
[SPEAKER_05]: populations of 10,000 to pull his parental
stock out of, and he had sourced all the
[SPEAKER_05]: material that he put together,
and he only did five strains total out of
[SPEAKER_05]: his catalog.
[SPEAKER_05]: What it did was it let him take AK-47 and
go into the genomic material and swing the
[SPEAKER_05]: direction.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the market wanted it to be more this,
he could go into it and pull it and
[SPEAKER_05]: compete as what we would call sativa one
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: He could compete as an indica another
year.
[SPEAKER_05]: He could compete as a mixed the year
after, all using the same genomic
[SPEAKER_05]: material, because he had enough paint in
that container to paint whatever picture
[SPEAKER_05]: he wanted from the tools that he had,
but ultimately, it let him still keep
[SPEAKER_05]: pushing AK-47 every single time.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that's what I was saying,
is that you got to have a bigger picture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Every one of the breeders you talk about,
they're going to say the same similarity.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to have a bigger long-term
picture of what it is you're trying to do,
[SPEAKER_05]: because when you chase trends,
typically, you catch the tail end of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like stock, where most people,
when they get into the stock, they get in
[SPEAKER_05]: when they see it hot, but by the time they
get in it, they're at the crest,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then they make a buy, and from that
moment forward, it's diminishing returns.
[SPEAKER_05]: No water for you, you've got to stay dry.
[SPEAKER_05]: Uncomfortable as possible on the stage is
the key.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kevin is used to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: He can talk forever on a mic.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is the third time I've ever actually
been on a mic, so it's kind of difficult
[SPEAKER_04]: for me.
[SPEAKER_05]: We brought you into the last event,
and we bring you into this one.
[SPEAKER_05]: We brought you into this event because
it's not on the mic that it's where you do
[SPEAKER_05]: your work.
[SPEAKER_05]: For you, you're a humble, quiet guy,
and it was just a fact that you have a
[SPEAKER_05]: true love of what you do, and some of the
work you've done has been incredible,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the HBK topicals have always been
well-received, and your varieties are
[SPEAKER_05]: well-received, and as you're sitting here
now, what direction are you looking to go
[SPEAKER_05]: with what you're doing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Are you trying to find hemp producers to
work with to get cannabis to source?
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you do now as a topical
manufacturer in 2019?
[SPEAKER_04]: Now as a topical producer solely,
I have decided to wait out to FDA,
[SPEAKER_04]: figure out what they want to do with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have some money set aside for FDA
approval and licensing, and then once they
[SPEAKER_04]: figure out what they want to do with hemp,
hopefully I'll be able to get some funding
[SPEAKER_04]: or finances to back me up on either
creating my own hemp production or finding
[SPEAKER_04]: somebody that we can partner up with to
then pull that material in.
[SPEAKER_04]: With the change in the hemp laws in
California in July, it kind of really set
[SPEAKER_04]: a lot of people back, and it really
hindered the consumer to find these
[SPEAKER_04]: products, and now everybody's scrambling,
running around, trying to figure it out,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so a lot of us just have to be
patient, and I'm just being patient and
[SPEAKER_04]: waiting it out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been developing my brand line.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been developing our testing to make
sure that we're producing clean meds,
[SPEAKER_04]: we just went through pesticide and
microbial testing as well as potency,
[SPEAKER_04]: and so that's always something I've been
focused on is making sure I produce good
[SPEAKER_04]: clean meds, but as far as the hemp market
goes, it's getting ready to blow up,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm glad I'm kind of in a position to
be able to take advantage of that,
[SPEAKER_04]: but at the same time, I'm not sure where
I'm gonna be at at this moment.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's kind of scary, and so I see a lot of
people out there struggling and worried,
[SPEAKER_04]: and I'm with them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, I'm there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, I'm really thankful that I did
create a topical company in 2010 that I
[SPEAKER_04]: can now rely on, and hopefully,
if we can be very successful, that will
[SPEAKER_04]: then hopefully transfer over into me
getting another farm license and creating
[SPEAKER_04]: my genetic brand again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now, that's just kind of on the
sideburner, and yeah, that's where it's
[SPEAKER_04]: at.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's awesome to see that you made the
transition, and I couldn't have been any
[SPEAKER_05]: happier when I saw you fly with flash
across the screen, and I was like,
[SPEAKER_05]: vindication.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Vindication.
[SPEAKER_04]: That caught me off guard too, and I was
like, yeah, it was really nice to see
[SPEAKER_04]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I spent so many years as a guerrilla
grower in the black market in the early
[SPEAKER_04]: days that it's still really hard for some
of us to come out and talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: and tell people what we are doing and how
we are doing it, because it's still really
[SPEAKER_04]: scary for us.
[SPEAKER_04]: The first time I talked with Kevin,
I broke down at the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was really emotionally tough for me,
but as the industry is changing,
[SPEAKER_04]: there are a lot of people like myself who
are now finding out that even though we
[SPEAKER_04]: spent 25 years doing this, the industry,
at some point, they respond and they
[SPEAKER_04]: respect that, but if you don't have an
education behind you and a firm
[SPEAKER_04]: understanding of what you're doing and how
you're doing it to give that back to the
[SPEAKER_04]: public, you will be left behind fast.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been told by several people lately
that I'm overqualified and underqualified
[SPEAKER_04]: at the same time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I dropped out of high school to grow
cannabis in the early 90s, and I spent 20
[SPEAKER_04]: years in the bushes learning how to grow
cannabis very well, but recently I've had
[SPEAKER_04]: problems with the new industry that came
in.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want paperwork behind them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They want to know what kind of
agricultural degrees I have.
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of plant science do you have?
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of college background do you
have?
[SPEAKER_04]: That has been tough for me because I don't
have that, but I know how to grow amazing
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what the plant is like.
[SPEAKER_04]: Courses like this, the more you can get
out there, get that put onto your resume,
[SPEAKER_04]: learn things, that will help you down the
road.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the natural Korean organic farming
will start to take over bigger in the
[SPEAKER_04]: commercial industry because a lot of these
people are realizing that they don't want
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical products.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you're using nutrient salt-based
products, those transfer over into the
[SPEAKER_04]: product that you're smoking.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of the consumers are now figuring
that out, so you see a decline in the
[SPEAKER_04]: hydro-based markets.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you can really start to learn how to
get your natural Korean IMOs down you get
[SPEAKER_04]: your organics down, you get your ugl
culture down, that is only going to help
[SPEAKER_04]: later on down the road with your overall
brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a market for CBD flowers or is it
totally dominated by extracts,
[SPEAKER_01]: tinctures?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's create the market.
No.
[SPEAKER_05]: In an answer, no.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's because what happened with cannabis
was a travesty occurred and the laboratory
[SPEAKER_05]: was created and no one really understood
how to use the lab.
[SPEAKER_05]: What they find is a 20 must be 20.
[SPEAKER_05]: It must be better than a 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: Five terp is better than three terp.
[SPEAKER_05]: All of a sudden this perception of
numerics became value.
[SPEAKER_05]: The customers started to believe that if I
spend 40 bucks for a bag and it's a 28,
[SPEAKER_05]: it's going to give me more usage than a
$40 bag that's 22.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a perception of efficiency and dosage
usage, so titration.
[SPEAKER_05]: How much I consume based off what the
numerics are.
[SPEAKER_05]: The problem is that nobody really was able
to get the education out quick enough
[SPEAKER_05]: because it was a new industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: This incredible dumbing down occurred to
where people don't really understand that
[SPEAKER_05]: what they want to do is consume a product
that gives them satisfaction and efficacy.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not necessarily numerically
connected.
[SPEAKER_05]: Over the course of time you'll see those
products rise up and move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Right now you're having to fight an uphill
battle to advertise it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that what's going to save us is
that the people that are coming into
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis who aren't caught up in numbers
and aren't caught up in the past of
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis, they're going to want good
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: I use people who are very light smokers
that are extremely heavily affected by THC
[SPEAKER_05]: dumb stuff.
[SPEAKER_05]: I try to find interesting ratios,
interesting terp profiles that they're
[SPEAKER_05]: happy with.
[SPEAKER_05]: We can't be used as the test case because
we're basically immune to normal smoke,
[SPEAKER_05]: so we're bad as a tester for that.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a bad yardstick.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that that's the case, but for what
he does with the topical blends and stuff,
[SPEAKER_05]: that's a different usage just like with
the extracts or the tinctures because that
[SPEAKER_05]: is about ratios, cannabinoids,
terp profiles in a form where the people
[SPEAKER_05]: that are buying it aren't looking at the
numbers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some of the most successful stuff we sold
almost had zero numbers.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now there's a big shift in the
market that's about to happen because you
[SPEAKER_04]: have the Central Valley getting ready to
come on with major hemp production.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you are a farmer, if you cannot farm
20 acres or more of hemp, you will not
[SPEAKER_04]: stay in the game.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you are making concentrates or
isolates or distillates from those,
[SPEAKER_04]: you need to be big in the game at this
point.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, when it comes to the cannabis
industry, you still have a lot of leeway.
[SPEAKER_04]: As a smaller farmer, you can still work
with that, but as the Central Valley comes
[SPEAKER_04]: online, you better be ready to compete
with those guys because they're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be dumping massive amounts.
[SPEAKER_04]: The general consumer population south of
Sacramento, realistically, the bait
[SPEAKER_04]: cartridge market is big with CBD,
but the general consumer is not really
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for flour that tests less than 20%
because they're not really smoking it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody that's looking for it is
concentrating it down and then selling it
[SPEAKER_04]: to the people that are making products
like myself.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like myself, it's easier and cheaper to
buy isolate than it is to try to buy a
[SPEAKER_04]: pound of flour and then concentrate it
down and to make it into my products that
[SPEAKER_04]: way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I told somebody recently that was asking
on the Hey, what's up, Garberville now
[SPEAKER_04]: page about growing hemp this year or CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, you might want to seriously think
about staying with Kraft Cannabis because
[SPEAKER_04]: once the Central Valley and the hemp
initiative comes online, you're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: be going up against multi-million dollar
contracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know if you're seeing that now,
but down in the Central Valley where I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: at, they are hot about going big.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm doing consultant work and relationship
work, and in Colorado, you're talking
[SPEAKER_05]: thousand acres.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thousand acre farm is a norm.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's frightening.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a tough one to compete against.
[SPEAKER_05]: My buddy knows a guy that is the largest
hops producer in Washington.
[SPEAKER_05]: His only client is Anheuser-Busch,
so he sells to one person only.
[SPEAKER_05]: He has a robotic automated hops farm,
and he has a $30 million extraction unit
[SPEAKER_05]: that does the extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: He can do 20,000 pounds an hour of
extract.
[SPEAKER_05]: He showed me a jar of hops diamonds and
hops turps.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, what the hell is that?
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, it's hops, bro.
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, what are you guys doing with that?
[SPEAKER_05]: He goes, that's how we sell it to
Budweiser.
[SPEAKER_05]: They don't buy it.
[SPEAKER_05]: They buy it as an extract, and they add it
to their beer mix.
[SPEAKER_05]: It blew my mind to see a $30 million
extraction device, robotic sorters,
[SPEAKER_05]: robotic sifting.
[SPEAKER_05]: The hemp industry is going to basically be
corn, and the part of it that won't be
[SPEAKER_05]: will be in the edible form because the FDA
won't let you consume that.
[SPEAKER_05]: They'll let you put it on your body,
and they'll let you smoke it, but they
[SPEAKER_05]: won't let you consume it.
[SPEAKER_05]: For you as an individual, we were talking
about genetics earlier, if you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: stratify what you're doing, then you
produce things that are going to catch the
[SPEAKER_05]: ethereal market, mental market lift,
and then you catch the stuff of people who
[SPEAKER_05]: want to have health and wellness.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that part of your product
diversity could be CBD material,
[SPEAKER_05]: but CBD and ratios that work with turp
profiles that work that lets you do some
[SPEAKER_05]: form of efficient cold extraction so that
you're able to actually get product out
[SPEAKER_05]: that goes under your label that lets
people who use your label now see that
[SPEAKER_05]: you're valid there and move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: I was involved in all the initial release
of CBD in the United States, so I'm one of
[SPEAKER_05]: the first people to touch CBD,
and I definitely released more CBD than
[SPEAKER_05]: anybody probably other than Stanley
Brothers, and they're working off the
[SPEAKER_05]: stuff they bootlegged from us.
[SPEAKER_05]: The point of this is that I saw the
evolution of this, and people asked me,
[SPEAKER_05]: why did you give up so much material for
free?
[SPEAKER_05]: I said, because when you have a necessity,
you have a validity.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we can get people to use CBD medicine
and get it fairly priced, in my case,
[SPEAKER_05]: free, what happens is they see all of us
as cannabis producers differently.
[SPEAKER_05]: They realize that we're not social pariah
that we were painted to be.
[SPEAKER_05]: If mainstream people can use a product and
use a topical from Eric and say,
[SPEAKER_05]: man, that made a radical difference in the
quality of my health, he's valid.
[SPEAKER_05]: When their son comes in and said,
did they sell weed too?
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's look it up, and all of a sudden,
they become your brand ambassador because
[SPEAKER_05]: what you've done is you've taken away
somebody's arthritis.
[SPEAKER_05]: My mother, who was a staunch anti-cannabis
individual where this shit was demonic,
[SPEAKER_05]: when she got cancer, I was able to help
her with CBD medicine, and my mother is
[SPEAKER_05]: now this cannabis advocate that's almost
hysterical because she's in every single
[SPEAKER_05]: thing I'm doing, everybody she's talking
to, and they're like, boy, your mother's
[SPEAKER_05]: so pro-cannabis, and I said, because it
did something for her that changed her
[SPEAKER_05]: opinion.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because of it, she realized that she had
chosen wrongly in a judgment, so she
[SPEAKER_05]: reversed her decision, and now she tries
to utilize that education and knowledge to
[SPEAKER_05]: help people.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's really where you take a look at
some of the CBD pieces because the
[SPEAKER_05]: tremendous amount of people that need that
are far more than need to consume it and
[SPEAKER_05]: smoke.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you touch that population and you do
it elegantly and graciously, it changes
[SPEAKER_05]: how not only do they view you,
but they view all of us that way.
[SPEAKER_05]: What I wanted to do is I wanted to be able
to continue in cannabis my whole career,
[SPEAKER_05]: and the only way I was going to be able to
do that is if I could get the mainstream
[SPEAKER_05]: not to see me as somebody that they wanted
to put in prison perpetually.
[SPEAKER_05]: The only way that can happen is if you
have a value.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have these abilities, but you have to
be very intelligent about how much of your
[SPEAKER_05]: product are you selling in that form.
[SPEAKER_05]: Some small portion of CBD, two-to-ones,
one-to-ones, high turp levels so that
[SPEAKER_05]: there's aromatic because on cold
extractions, it's this whole synthesis
[SPEAKER_05]: that actually gives you the efficacy that
you're seeking so that it works for you.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can put it under your label.
[SPEAKER_05]: It augments what you do as a flour
producer, so you get to do your flour,
[SPEAKER_05]: you get to catch a medical market,
and you stay out of commercial hemp unless
[SPEAKER_05]: you are a real farmer where you're talking
silos and you're talking John Deere
[SPEAKER_05]: equipment because you're going to compete
with some giants.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anybody with questions that
pertain to breeding?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you see seasonal trends with certain
genetics and profiles?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we do, actually.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll let you take that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You see more of that than I do.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you're doing what he's doing,
what he says is I see a quality,
[SPEAKER_05]: and as someone who's got career time where
I've spent 25 years doing it, I know that
[SPEAKER_05]: this is a quality product.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know that if it was presented in the
right form, it would sell.
[SPEAKER_05]: Then what you have to do then is be able
to figure out where it belongs.
[SPEAKER_05]: Seasonal shifts are based off of media
hype, based off of good advertising,
[SPEAKER_05]: based off of things that are usually
bigger than you.
[SPEAKER_05]: What you want to do is you want to create
a portfolio of things that allow you to
[SPEAKER_05]: fill those holes as they open,
and when they close, you just retract and
[SPEAKER_05]: put something else in.
[SPEAKER_05]: Good breeders are going to work a variety
of lines, but not so many that they don't
[SPEAKER_05]: have control of what they're doing,
and what it does, it allows you to deal
[SPEAKER_05]: with the realities of human nature,
where they don't always want the same
[SPEAKER_05]: thing every day, but they don't want too
many different things.
[SPEAKER_05]: Where you live is a huge situation for
that, where if you're in Southern
[SPEAKER_05]: California, it's exclusiveness.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's things that nobody has.
[SPEAKER_05]: As soon as it gets out, it's no longer
trendy.
[SPEAKER_05]: If I take a picture of myself smoking it,
I'm not that sexy, but if no one else has
[SPEAKER_05]: it, I'm incredible.
[SPEAKER_05]: The ability to understand the mentality of
how things move and work is huge,
[SPEAKER_05]: but that's why I like what Eric does is
because the stuff that he worked with that
[SPEAKER_05]: I used, he had done years prior,
and it hadn't lost its appeal,
[SPEAKER_05]: and so the quality of the work still
resonated because his desire to create a
[SPEAKER_05]: quality product was there, and his
knowledge of what the market wanted was
[SPEAKER_05]: there, and now the question is,
how do we move it into the right
[SPEAKER_05]: locations?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's where you have to have this organic
group so that you, as a cultivator,
[SPEAKER_05]: can say, hey, wait a second, my shit's not
trendy right now, and you find out
[SPEAKER_05]: somebody that, I got the trendy stuff,
I'll hook you up, and then you're able to
[SPEAKER_05]: catch the hole, fill the need,
get the check, continue forward,
[SPEAKER_05]: and then next year, your stuff is sexy
again.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right, and that's kind of, as a breeder,
you have to make a decision on what you're
[SPEAKER_04]: doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: For me, I have specific lines that I work
and I stay within.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not following the hottest trend.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have specific lines that I work,
that I like, that work for me,
[SPEAKER_04]: and that's where I stay at, and I have a
lot of people that look at my menu and
[SPEAKER_04]: they say, hey, there's no skittles on
here, there's no gelato, where's all these
[SPEAKER_04]: strains?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I said, well, that's not what I work
with.
[SPEAKER_04]: I work specifically in certain things,
and you have to make a decision as a
[SPEAKER_04]: breeder and what you're going to breed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you going to be trying to just follow
everybody else or are you working your
[SPEAKER_04]: specific lines and how those lines work
for you?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I've been working with the same
genetics since the early 2000s,
that he belongs only out of this region.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why do I somehow make a seed stock that
he's cleared off on the back burner and
[SPEAKER_01]: pull the seed stock around?
[SPEAKER_04]: That, you have to make a decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what he's asking is, he's holding some
clonal stock that's local, that he's had
[SPEAKER_04]: forever, but they're clonal stock,
and now he wants to create seed from those
[SPEAKER_04]: clonal stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, what you have to do is you have to
make a decision.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to, you can make feminized
seed from those by spraying them and
[SPEAKER_04]: making seed stock from those, or you can
cross-pollinate those with a male that you
[SPEAKER_04]: brought in, or you can do a sub-cross,
try to phenohunt back out those lines,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then use those genetics to make your
own stock with.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of, the only problem with that
is that the genetic package that you're
[SPEAKER_05]: holding sometimes is unique.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, how many times do your parents have to
recreate a child to get you?
[SPEAKER_05]: A lot.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, if it's cannabis varieties that
have specific properties, and we have a
[SPEAKER_05]: variety that seem to work for spasticity.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, I tell people, that's the one
thing I'm never gonna get rid of because
[SPEAKER_05]: it has a power that I haven't seen in any
other varietal because across the board,
[SPEAKER_05]: it works for a thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I tried to substitute everything to
find out something that was similar,
[SPEAKER_05]: and it didn't matter.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I don't think we're intelligent enough
at this point to understand these little
[SPEAKER_05]: intricate details because the synergy of
the turps, cannabinoids, oils,
[SPEAKER_05]: relationship between bacteria,
all those things create too much
[SPEAKER_05]: information to be able to just say,
it's that.
[SPEAKER_05]: So, what I know is you take that and sell
it, hold the material, keep the clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: If it is priceless, keep the clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can, people have huge collections,
but I'm like, what are you collecting for?
[SPEAKER_05]: Some things just are, generic.
[SPEAKER_05]: But some things, like if you have
something that you collected that you
[SPEAKER_05]: said, man, this is my core thing,
I love it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wish I could hold it and not have
to play with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: You might just find that the real truth of
it is, is that hold it in some seed form
[SPEAKER_05]: where you have some of the genetic
material and hold the clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Don't get rid of the clone.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because there's clones that I've had that
I cannot replace.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't give a shit how many seeds I go
through.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can't find them.
[SPEAKER_05]: There's a guy in the back that's been
grabbing it from me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Long-term, his question was about
long-term seed storage.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of, that's opening a can of
worms for me sort of because I'll take
[SPEAKER_04]: some abuse on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for me, I don't like to freeze,
long-term freeze my seeds because I've had
[SPEAKER_04]: bad problems with that later on down the
road because as a general consumer,
[SPEAKER_04]: I can only buy the freezer that's on the
market and if the power goes out or if
[SPEAKER_04]: that breaks down, I'm struggling to try to
get those seeds refrozen again.
[SPEAKER_04]: So for me, what I like to do is I'll store
them in sealed jars in dark area and just
[SPEAKER_04]: below room temperature.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've never had problems with my seed
stock lasting, I've had seed stock for 10,
[SPEAKER_04]: 15 years that still pop within 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens is a lot of people will
mis-store their seeds by freezing them and
[SPEAKER_04]: when you're opening and closing the door
constantly or pulling those, that whole
[SPEAKER_04]: entire seed batch out, you go through all
your seeds, they defrost and you put them
[SPEAKER_04]: back in the freezer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes that has a longevity issue and
you will degrade your seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I have other breeder friends that
swear by only keeping them fully frozen
[SPEAKER_04]: all the time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a personal issue with you but heat
will screw up your seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You get up above 80, 90 degrees and it's
prolonged, your seeds are not gonna last
[SPEAKER_04]: long.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just from personal experience
living in SoCal.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well the moisture fluctuation screw you
too where you get the seed to get moisture
[SPEAKER_05]: in it and it activates the enzymes and
then you re-chill it and dry it and it
[SPEAKER_05]: deactivates it except if you utilize some
of it and if you repeat that process a
[SPEAKER_05]: couple times, there's not much left in the
seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we can go into the lab and we can
go in vitro and get into the seed but the
[SPEAKER_05]: problem is that it's just like with tissue
culture.
[SPEAKER_05]: The number of mediums that you have to use
to find the right base formulation usually
[SPEAKER_05]: is around 10.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if you're trying to do a TC op,
you've got at least 10 base formulations
[SPEAKER_05]: you use.
[SPEAKER_05]: You find the one that's closest.
[SPEAKER_05]: From there you start to refine and that's
why it takes so long to do tissue culture
[SPEAKER_05]: with cannabis is because you don't have a
recipe book you can pop up like for
[SPEAKER_05]: orchid.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I can pop up a book and I can pull out
a recipe and say this has been formulated
[SPEAKER_05]: by these scientists from Duke and they say
use this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well if cannabis you don't have that and
anybody who does is holding that shit in
[SPEAKER_05]: their pocket because it's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm trying to crack seeds from the 70s
that I know haven't been held right but I
[SPEAKER_05]: know that there's still enough material to
salvage and it's just a process for the
[SPEAKER_05]: labs to be able to create the order
solution and the hormonal concentrations
[SPEAKER_05]: to allow it to open up and start to move
so they can get cellular activity so they
[SPEAKER_05]: can harvest some form of cell that they
can then micropropagate that and go
[SPEAKER_05]: forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: But you know for the average person you
know to scrub a plant at lowest cost at
[SPEAKER_05]: six grand for a Meristem scrub average is
10.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if every plant you touch is 10 grand I
mean it's kind of costly and so like for
[SPEAKER_05]: me holding seeds the difference I think
too is that when you're someone who makes
[SPEAKER_05]: seeds you're taking them to fruition and
you are running the mothers till the seeds
[SPEAKER_05]: are completely fully stacked with
carbohydrates.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you have a true time capsule then he
takes this seed that was fully developed
[SPEAKER_05]: and then he holds it at a humidity level
and a temperature range that buffers it.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you go buy a pack of seeds if it's a
trendy seed half of them are white because
[SPEAKER_05]: the money's there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So yeah they might crack but they're not
going to hold because they weren't
[SPEAKER_05]: developed enough so they don't have a
large enough sugar storage within them to
[SPEAKER_05]: be able to give you what you need.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so for guys like Eric that are seed
makers they have a far better ability to
[SPEAKER_05]: preserve seed than the average person
because the average person doesn't realize
[SPEAKER_05]: that that plant has to basically look like
shit when you harvest those seeds.
[SPEAKER_05]: You are taking it way past the visual
beauty because you're harvesting seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: Now once you do that I would recommend you
run a desiccant pack and you put them in a
[SPEAKER_05]: sealer meal and that way you can seal them
up so that you're not having any
[SPEAKER_05]: infiltration and it keeps them nice and
flat and what it does it lets you stack
[SPEAKER_05]: them up in a bin and if you can put them
in a cellar or a basement or a cold
[SPEAKER_05]: storage it's how it's done historically.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't like the freezers either
because I've always had power problems and
[SPEAKER_05]: so unless you have a full-time power
supply there's an issue and people talk
[SPEAKER_05]: about oh it's possible but I watched the
scientists running out of the seed bank in
[SPEAKER_05]: Antarctica with paper boxes with the most
valuable genomic material on earth running
[SPEAKER_05]: for their fucking lives and I said well
they spent a hundred million dollars to
[SPEAKER_05]: build that and they're putting things in
paper bags running for their lives the
[SPEAKER_05]: odds of me getting around that are
probably pretty slim so I kind of look at
[SPEAKER_05]: it the way he does where I try to hold
material but I hold it in sealed sealer
[SPEAKER_05]: meals so that I can flatten them out so
that I can hold more material other than
[SPEAKER_05]: big containers of jars and if I could do
it correctly when I do the sealing on it I
[SPEAKER_05]: seal up a second pack that's small so if I
want to pull something out and play with
[SPEAKER_05]: it I can I don't have to open up the whole
package.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise what I'm doing is I'm cracking
the whole pack and now you have to go
[SPEAKER_05]: through the process again and every time
we open it up we expose it to oxygen we
[SPEAKER_05]: expose it to change in humidity and if we
humidify this we activate the enzymes we
[SPEAKER_05]: start the biological process and then we
have to shorten it it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_04]: One and one of the things I like to do too
is I'll do an initial 24-hour freeze right
[SPEAKER_04]: after harvest and we shuck and clean the
seeds they will get frozen for 24 hours
[SPEAKER_04]: and for me it's kind of it's kind of like
winter set in it's told that seed that
[SPEAKER_04]: winter's come it's ready and then as you
pull it out of that 24-hour freeze then it
[SPEAKER_04]: goes into our humidity packs where we're
putting them away at just below room
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature so that seed has been gone
through its full cycle so it's you you've
[SPEAKER_04]: bred it it's gone through the full cycle
you've harvested it winter has been it's
[SPEAKER_04]: you know it's gone through its winter
cycle and now it's ready to be propagated
[SPEAKER_04]: once you're ready for that so initial 24
hour freeze for me has always kind of been
[SPEAKER_04]: initial but I always like to make sure
they're clean before we freeze them
[SPEAKER_04]: because I don't like to have plant
material in there because the plant
[SPEAKER_04]: material I've noticed will pull in
moisture and and I learned you know years
[SPEAKER_05]: ago from people that were running mountain
varieties that they vernalized before they
[SPEAKER_05]: cracked so they would take the seed they
would do a cold treatment and then soak it
[SPEAKER_05]: cold and then it stimulated growth because
that was the natural genomic pattern of
[SPEAKER_05]: the varietals but stuff that was
equatorial was opposite was higher higher
[SPEAKER_05]: warmth levels so depending on you know
where your original stock comes from you
[SPEAKER_05]: have different strategies but the main
thing is to make sure that you're doing
[SPEAKER_05]: enough preservation and you have enough
seed that you're able to actually go back
[SPEAKER_05]: in and mine and people that are doing
really work a good work on this what
[SPEAKER_05]: they're doing is they're refreshing this
population every five years you just can't
[SPEAKER_05]: put stuff away for the rest of your life
you have to basically go back in and then
[SPEAKER_05]: do an open pollination with your stock
where you're taking a variety of males and
[SPEAKER_05]: a variety of females so that you're
picking up as much genetic material as
[SPEAKER_05]: possible and then when you go back into it
you can steer the direction you want based
[SPEAKER_05]: off the needs that you have then
[SPEAKER_04]: you know that's kind of personal
preference also when selecting males I I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of looking for certain traits that I
want to add into my females so either
[SPEAKER_04]: structure or I'm looking for colors or I'm
looking for terpene profiles or I'm
[SPEAKER_04]: looking for diversity as far as nutrient
uptake or a stability as far as heat
[SPEAKER_04]: stress mold things like that and that
comes with a little bit of trial and error
[SPEAKER_04]: so a lot of breeders will do open
pollination so they have a little bit of
[SPEAKER_04]: diversity so that they're not choosing
just one male to make their population
[SPEAKER_04]: with it pre-testing them that's why I have
a lab I'll go through and pre-test my
[SPEAKER_04]: males you'll actually have a THC content
in your males and you can kind of tell
[SPEAKER_04]: through diversity of how far you think
that male will pull your THC content to a
[SPEAKER_04]: plant because I've tested males and they
show very little anywhere anywhere after
[SPEAKER_04]: six to eight weeks but normally I'll wait
until they start to drop pollen I'll cut
[SPEAKER_04]: some of those pollen sacks with some of
the leaf stem material and then I'll send
[SPEAKER_04]: that in and ask for a potency test and
that kind of gives me a low ratio of what
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing and I I like to use my test to
figure out where my my ratio is on what
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm doing but realistically you'll know
when you find your males and you're going
[SPEAKER_04]: through them there will be certain males
that are not doing as well or they don't
[SPEAKER_04]: have as good a structure or they just
don't have that smell that you're looking
[SPEAKER_04]: for and you can kind of eliminate them out
it when you're getting into big penal
[SPEAKER_04]: hunts then kind of some things change on
that but holding in males outside small
[SPEAKER_04]: property with a small section can be tough
you almost want an own separate greenhouse
[SPEAKER_04]: that you can seal off or an indoor where
you can keep them separated or work with a
[SPEAKER_04]: friend who's has a six plant license and
you can throw some males at their place
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's not going to populate anybody in
their surrounding area yeah that's why
[SPEAKER_04]: breeding is so tough because you have to
almost dedicate yourself to breeding or
[SPEAKER_04]: not breeding people that try to side breed
end up with a lot of material that ends up
[SPEAKER_04]: with seed later on and then your your
customers are like hey I got some I got
[SPEAKER_05]: some seeds what's up you know as a quick
one like what I would people were having
[SPEAKER_05]: problems because their their varietals
didn't have enough numerics and so I said
[SPEAKER_05]: look let me sift you out some males to
make this happen because it's easy because
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm gonna sick I'm gonna sift for a
specific trait and so I can do a say I
[SPEAKER_05]: crack 200 seeds within a week or two of
growth and I have my first true leaf after
[SPEAKER_05]: the Coital Eden I can take a stamp and sex
them and call out all my females right
[SPEAKER_05]: because I'm only looking for males then I
can let these males grow up till they're
[SPEAKER_05]: about eight to ten inches and I can take
the top four inches off and send it into a
[SPEAKER_05]: lab for predicated analysis their
predicated analysis is gonna tell me right
[SPEAKER_05]: at that moment what are my THC CBD CBG
levels and in ratios I always look for
[SPEAKER_05]: high CBG levels because that's the base
cannabinoid all cannabinoids are converted
[SPEAKER_05]: from so if I'm looking at numbers and I
have a huge CBG reserve I know there's a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot more left in the tank and then I can
look at these ratios and I can say okay
[SPEAKER_05]: we're in a ratio that we like and we have
disproportionate totals we start to use
[SPEAKER_05]: that population of males to go into other
plants that I want to increase and then I
[SPEAKER_05]: measure the progeny the children did I
increase what I wanted to increase and
[SPEAKER_05]: then we're able to find out which male
through the stamp then I can take that
[SPEAKER_05]: population do it again and I can start
narrowing down the amount of plants it
[SPEAKER_05]: takes me to get into a specific
characteristic and I was going after
[SPEAKER_05]: numbers heavily for people that I they
needed to sell pot and if you're in the
[SPEAKER_05]: dispensary business and you don't have
numbers that are real you're screwed and
[SPEAKER_05]: so what I did is I used the same tools we
used to go from 5% CBD to 20% CBD in a
[SPEAKER_05]: year to basically do it with THC plants so
it let me get a hold of material that I
[SPEAKER_05]: knew could throw heavy numbers on
something and then I gave those males to
[SPEAKER_05]: people who wanted to get into breeding
because they had an incredible collection
[SPEAKER_05]: but they were working with varietals that
were 14 to 17 and I needed to get them up
[SPEAKER_05]: to 27 so we found can we find males that
consistently added one thing which was
[SPEAKER_05]: numerics and then from the numeric
population you pull out the quality so
[SPEAKER_05]: ultimately it's always this sifting
process that you're going through but lab
[SPEAKER_05]: analytics are help incredibly and now with
marker assisted breeding and the ability
[SPEAKER_05]: to look at the plant to say you know how
homozygous or heterozygous is it meaning
[SPEAKER_05]: how much of the trade is going to be
carried and moved it helps you because if
[SPEAKER_05]: there's too much diversity then you're
having to do too big a population hunt and
[SPEAKER_04]: for regular people that's a lot of work
it's expensive to every time you guys all
[SPEAKER_04]: know what testing costs so every time you
throw in a lab test you know 100 200 300
[SPEAKER_04]: bucks and so as a breeder for me it gets
very expensive and at some point so yeah
[SPEAKER_04]: so when somebody says hey I'm asking this
much for a pack of seeds that's kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: why I'm looking for if I'm if I'm doing
what I was doing at that time all like
[SPEAKER_05]: just like with CBD all we cared about was
increasing CBD levels because the numbers
[SPEAKER_05]: were too low so once I get a population of
plants that produce a higher overall level
[SPEAKER_05]: of CBD now I can go through those
populations and do my resistance testing I
[SPEAKER_05]: can do my production testing but I can get
every other quality I want and if it's 3%
[SPEAKER_05]: CBD I failed and so with marketable
cannabis in today's industry I needed up
[SPEAKER_05]: in these higher numbers 28 to 30 well I
went into some of these chem lines and I
[SPEAKER_05]: started spending some time using
predicated lab analysis which just lets me
[SPEAKER_05]: all it all it means is that I'm doing
testing in juvenile stages and with CBD
[SPEAKER_05]: plants it's not as cement meaning that
with THC the numbers stay pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: consistent but with CBD sometimes you end
up having as the plant matures ratios
[SPEAKER_05]: shift a little bit not as not as accurate
but with predicated THC analysis I see a
[SPEAKER_05]: higher level of accuracy with CBD we saw
less but the bottom line is if I'm looking
[SPEAKER_05]: for one trait that's not hard look for 20
traits that's hard that's real breeding
[SPEAKER_05]: but so what I was doing was increasing the
sellability of cultivars that was sexy but
[SPEAKER_05]: not sexy enough now and I just use lab
analysis and because I was fortunate that
[SPEAKER_05]: I was involved with so many labs and I was
able to drive business to the labs once
[SPEAKER_05]: you make money for people people give you
a little better break on the deal and so
[SPEAKER_05]: it allowed me to have an incredible price
differential on what I was doing so I
[SPEAKER_05]: could play Frankenstein all the time and
ask these questions but no one else I knew
[SPEAKER_05]: had the funds and I had the funds only
because I was driving so much business to
[SPEAKER_05]: the lab that they just said we all play
with you but for most people they don't
[SPEAKER_05]: that's why for these you know younger
breeders that were coming up I would give
[SPEAKER_05]: them material that I said hey look we know
that this plant throws this turf profile
[SPEAKER_05]: it throws this morphological shape and it
throws this chemo type on the majority of
[SPEAKER_05]: plants it touches and yes there's outliers
but overall you'll get a population that's
[SPEAKER_05]: easier to sift because you'll have more of
what you like and in the more of what you
[SPEAKER_05]: like you'll find the one that's exactly
what you like it's the sifting process
[SPEAKER_05]: that's the it's the demon that's the one
where you have to hold all the plants in
[SPEAKER_05]: redundant copy and then you have to be
able to actually sit down and standardize
[SPEAKER_05]: your testing and be honest about it
because the one thing I've noticed about
[SPEAKER_05]: breeding is that if the progeny isn't
better than the parental stock you didn't
[SPEAKER_05]: do anything but because you made it it's
your baby and the reality is is that you
[SPEAKER_04]: got a three-headed kid and you know and
and as a breeder like he had referred to
[SPEAKER_04]: earlier you have to be you almost have to
be a robot at this time and state because
[SPEAKER_04]: you're creating things that you hold very
dear to you because you've worked on them
[SPEAKER_04]: and now you're going to release them to
people who are then going to do bad things
[SPEAKER_04]: to them and so that's tough you know so
that's something you have to get over is
[SPEAKER_04]: you got to be able to release your stuff
and be be able to stand behind it and hope
[SPEAKER_04]: that they do well with it and that's kind
of these two guys have been fighting over
[SPEAKER_04]: questions so what I'm going to do is take
him first and then Alan second.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that when it comes to doing
genomics work it's an assumption that A
[SPEAKER_05]: and B combined will give you this and the
reality is that often it doesn't it just
[SPEAKER_05]: doesn't match up and it it's it's what I
did is I took a look at all these other
[SPEAKER_05]: forms of breeding so I look at people who
breed cattle people who breed dogs people
[SPEAKER_05]: who breed fish and I realize that there's
an intangible genomically that is just is
[SPEAKER_05]: and what you have to work with is as much
skill as possible and then some good
[SPEAKER_05]: fortune and good fortune is a big one
because people always underestimate just
[SPEAKER_05]: the truth of that and and and that's the
that's what makes human beings so
[SPEAKER_05]: incredible because you can crush down a
population all you want but out of the
[SPEAKER_05]: ghetto comes somebody who can split an
atom because ultimately in that genetic
[SPEAKER_05]: code pops out something unbelievable from
parents who were normal you can get
[SPEAKER_05]: exceptional somewhere in the line prior
they had to be exceptional but it doesn't
[SPEAKER_05]: have to come out I use myself as an
example of I'm a good breeder male because
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't really screw up the good woman
that I chose to have kids with so the kids
[SPEAKER_05]: that come out are more like their mother
mom than me all they have for me is
[SPEAKER_05]: they're more stubborn so that's what we
notice is that my kids are stubborn and
[SPEAKER_05]: driven but other than that they're more
like their mothers in appearance and in
[SPEAKER_05]: personality and so I'm a good breeder male
because when you put me on top of it all
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm adding is some very specific traits
you know what I want to say real fast too
[SPEAKER_05]: before we get the question but if you
notice we've been having a sign language
[SPEAKER_05]: presentation you know what happened was a
friend of mine Kenny the mushroom man he's
[SPEAKER_05]: hiding somewhere he hits me up and he says
cap I have some friends that are farmers
[SPEAKER_05]: in Oregon that are hearing impaired and he
said you know this is something that needs
[SPEAKER_05]: to be brought into a conversation because
did you know that this many people in the
[SPEAKER_05]: country or globally are hearing impaired
and I didn't and I realized how ignorant I
[SPEAKER_05]: was to that situation and so he was like
we need to do some work so that we can get
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivation information into the hands of
the people that are hearing impaired
[SPEAKER_05]: because they have to build the vocabulary
to explain what you're doing and I said
[SPEAKER_05]: hey we're doing this incredible regen
event filled with really killer people
[SPEAKER_05]: breaking out incredible information maybe
we can work it out and Josh was gracious
[SPEAKER_05]: enough to say hey I would love to have
that and so what we have is we have people
[SPEAKER_05]: that are signing so that we can record it
so that we can share it because fun and
[SPEAKER_05]: mentally it's it's it's the world we're in
really a cannabis is inclusive and so I
[SPEAKER_05]: just wanted to say thank you so much for
taking the time to come
[SPEAKER_02]: I just wanted to bring some attention
because it's like what's going on and what
[SPEAKER_05]: it is is that you have this massive global
population people who cultivate cannabis
[SPEAKER_05]: cannabis to me was always the most
inclusive world and to be able to be tying
[SPEAKER_05]: more people into what we do is beautiful
and the individuals were lovely
[SPEAKER_05]: individuals and their cannabis farmers too
so it allows them to be able to have an
[SPEAKER_05]: ability to understand the material and
find a way to translate words that aren't
[SPEAKER_05]: translated yet and so that's what's going
on and I'm just really happy to be part of
[SPEAKER_04]: it yeah him yeah you know that's kind of
like that's you know I think personally
[SPEAKER_04]: okay the question is is what are what are
my competitors what's their biggest
[SPEAKER_04]: mistake that they're making right now and
that's kind of a two-part that's two parts
[SPEAKER_04]: for me personally I've made this mistake
over the last two years and I'm just now
[SPEAKER_04]: getting a hold of it is not being
aggressive and your marketing and your
[SPEAKER_04]: social media and getting your name out
there I'm I'm old school so it's been real
[SPEAKER_04]: tough for me to get out there and want to
feel comfortable talking to people and I
[SPEAKER_04]: wasn't aggressive enough to get a website
and get out there and really do a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: events like this that's a big problem now
because if you're not getting out there
[SPEAKER_04]: and they're not seeing you and they don't
know who you are you are not going to make
[SPEAKER_04]: it because this is a new a new age of
society where they want to be they want
[SPEAKER_04]: you to be there you know it's Kardashian
thing you know you got to be able to show
[SPEAKER_04]: your friends look I got this and I got it
from him and then that brings it in the
[SPEAKER_04]: other part is hyping up something too much
and releasing it too soon without knowing
[SPEAKER_04]: what you've got and then it screws you
later on down the road because all of a
[SPEAKER_04]: sudden you've got a hundred farmers that
are pissed off because they spent six
[SPEAKER_04]: months of their time and all of a sudden
they can't do anything with it because it
[SPEAKER_04]: didn't work out that and the same thing
with the social media you got to be
[SPEAKER_04]: careful don't over hype something and make
sure that what you release is good like I
[SPEAKER_04]: said it's a two-year program for me
because once I make something it's a whole
[SPEAKER_04]: year of doing depths indoor outdoor full
Sun you know shade how did it how did it
[SPEAKER_04]: go across the board did the consumer like
it did the did your vendors buy it you
[SPEAKER_04]: know there's a lot to it and that's where
people make the mistake it's over hyping
[SPEAKER_05]: something that's not ready for the market
with with commoditized crops crops that
[SPEAKER_05]: move globally so that's corn wheat those
those take ten years it's three years of
[SPEAKER_05]: doing the breeding and then and then seven
years assisting the Lions and so literally
[SPEAKER_05]: it's a ten-year process to release
something that's a commoditized component
[SPEAKER_05]: and with cannabis ten years is a lifetime
and so you know the thing is you want to
[SPEAKER_05]: get into the market right now but the
people buy seed stock from any other
[SPEAKER_05]: industry they're buying a very different
type of seed and so they have expectations
[SPEAKER_05]: of reliability repeatability and I think
like what he was saying but see he's
[SPEAKER_05]: honest so he says listen if he sent
something out that was untested he just
[SPEAKER_05]: say look I haven't tested it I put
together some interesting stuff if you
[SPEAKER_05]: want to buy it this is the cost and then
you can run through and do your test but I
[SPEAKER_05]: wouldn't commit my whole crop to it and
then they can find out if it works and you
[SPEAKER_05]: know it's important but when we really
take a look at what scientific breeding is
[SPEAKER_05]: and how we got to where we are with these
major crops and stability the amount of
[SPEAKER_05]: work required to get there is so huge that
it lets you realize most of the stuff
[SPEAKER_05]: we're doing is just basically throwing
darts with our eyes closed this gentleman
[SPEAKER_05]: right here before we forget no no I'm
sorry
[SPEAKER_03]: what's your opinion on
[SPEAKER_05]: I think that you have to first you have to
ask why is it hypey so why so I take a
[SPEAKER_05]: look at it and I look I touch hypey shit
all the time and I smoke it and I go quick
[SPEAKER_05]: quick turn it's gonna it's hot and it's
gonna not gonna be hot but when I consume
[SPEAKER_05]: it and I go whoa that is some good grass I
buy that see now I have something that
[SPEAKER_05]: that's second by cannabis where if I
bought it once I'd buy it twice and I can
[SPEAKER_05]: start to say whoa this has a quality that
resonates and if I was to smoke it in ten
[SPEAKER_05]: years it still be good grass that's what
you want to work with in your directions
[SPEAKER_05]: and sometimes I don't think that the
farmer is really qualified and they hate
[SPEAKER_05]: they hate to say this but you've got to
have somebody who can move pounds somebody
[SPEAKER_05]: who knows how to traffic and they're gonna
be honestly telling you this isn't the
[SPEAKER_05]: right choice and when what they tell you
is the one you have defined under under
[SPEAKER_05]: HDI in a quick turn and that the blunt
didn't change flavor I knew now why it had
[SPEAKER_05]: value and so I realized it was gonna stay
in vogue until that social change changed
[SPEAKER_05]: but then they took that and they modified
it and the perp is the cherry pie the
[SPEAKER_05]: cherry pie is the cookie it didn't go out
of vogue you just move the current to
[SPEAKER_05]: where it goes by adding little things that
keep you trendy but if perp was a bunk
[SPEAKER_05]: then it wouldn't still be current and
that's what you have to take a look at and
[SPEAKER_05]: don't chase trends unless you're involved
in Hollywood meaning that you have people
[SPEAKER_05]: that are setting the trends and they're
able to let you see we got traction and
[SPEAKER_05]: then you smoke it and you go that's real
now you can run it because you need at
[SPEAKER_05]: least two years when I release varieties
in clonal form I want to see at least a
[SPEAKER_05]: two-year life span where you can run it
this year and get paid next year you get
[SPEAKER_05]: paid and on the third year you can get
paid but it's not red hot because
[SPEAKER_05]: everyone's gonna pour into the market and
fill it so two years three three years a
[SPEAKER_05]: dream oh gee is like a legend where if you
had the same cup for the last 15 years you
[SPEAKER_05]: would have got paid but now has to be
spiced up
[SPEAKER_05]: I agree it's just that what's gonna happen
is it's gonna it's gonna change into which
[SPEAKER_05]: gelato which which subtlety it's kind of
like looking at wedding cake and birthday
[SPEAKER_05]: cake so wedding cake yields better and it
gives you better color but if you consume
[SPEAKER_05]: it next to birthday cake it's not as
satisfactory and so the thing is you have
[SPEAKER_05]: to be able to say okay why do they like it
I got the gelato 41 right so the 41 has
[SPEAKER_05]: this incredible cherry pie on top of that
that flavor profile that lasts in the
[SPEAKER_05]: joint it's gorgeous but the thing is if
you go only that route what we noticed is
[SPEAKER_05]: fusarium prone and so all of a sudden now
your whole library is prone to pathogenic
[SPEAKER_05]: pressure so maybe 15% of your line becomes
gelato or gelato hybrids and you've used
[SPEAKER_05]: them for years and had success and people
know when they come to you that they can
[SPEAKER_05]: get those things but you start weighing
everything heavy that one way oh you got a
[SPEAKER_03]: problem if it goes south that that depends
on the project that I'm working on depends
[SPEAKER_04]: on whether we're doing open pollination or
we're doing something specific that that's
[SPEAKER_04]: that's generalized and if I'm doing open
pollination I'm usually using at least
[SPEAKER_04]: three males depending on how many females
I'm using but yeah well he's saying open
[SPEAKER_05]: pollination meaning like when you're
laying pollen onto the plant are you
[SPEAKER_05]: allowing the male and the female to
naturally pollinate themselves are you
[SPEAKER_04]: directing the pollen okay I think I
misunderstood for me I like to collect a
[SPEAKER_04]: pollen and then I use it as needed with a
brush or I'm taking it out there and I'll
[SPEAKER_04]: have a paper bag put my butt in it make
sure you shake it yeah now I also do
[SPEAKER_04]: direct open pollination in the greenhouses
where the males are in there with the
[SPEAKER_04]: females the fans are blowing and they'll
be in there for a couple days to make sure
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting a full complete thing but if
I'm doing specific breeding in the in the
[SPEAKER_04]: garden and I don't want to contaminate
everything yeah take it in a jar take a
[SPEAKER_04]: fresh brush go out there you can actually
now get sleeves that you can put around
[SPEAKER_04]: your plant that's a mesh you can inject
your pollen right into a little thing it
[SPEAKER_04]: drops it right in there you seal it off
and it's not going to affect the rest of
[SPEAKER_04]: your plants so yeah it depends on what the
program you're doing I'm I'll be using the
[SPEAKER_04]: mid branches normally the whole plant
because I'm breeding for everything two
[SPEAKER_04]: years ago when I was with the Mendo
hideout we were just doing branch
[SPEAKER_04]: specifics on lower branches because we
were trying to maintain the rest of the
[SPEAKER_05]: flower for production so how deep into the
cycle of ego like you know this is going
[SPEAKER_05]: to depend on your varietals because all of
them have a different flowering period so
[SPEAKER_05]: if they produce an abundance of pollen
receptor sites early that's when you need
[SPEAKER_05]: to hit them right if you don't see that
happen and so say between 21 to 25 so like
[SPEAKER_05]: a little sweet spot but if you're going to
go into something that might finish it at
[SPEAKER_05]: 90 days then lo and behold there's no
sites at 28 days it's still in a
[SPEAKER_05]: transitional vegetative stage so you have
to basically choose your pollination times
[SPEAKER_05]: for the varietals that you're using and
that's trial and error and that's your R&D
[SPEAKER_05]: and then what you do is you record it and
so that you know hey when I pollinated at
[SPEAKER_05]: this time this way I only received this
much seed mass per square foot and it
[SPEAKER_05]: gives you a really clear idea of what's
the efficiency of your pollination and
[SPEAKER_05]: then that matters and people like only
want a couple but the thing about it is if
[SPEAKER_05]: you copy how they do it commercially then
it'll let you use someone else's brain you
[SPEAKER_05]: know it's better not to learn through
their mistake it's better to let someone
[SPEAKER_05]: else fuck up and you learn through their
mistake it's painful yeah and just admit
[SPEAKER_05]: it though don't be afraid to admit it you
know don't steal the credit that's my
[SPEAKER_05]: whole thing with breeders is that they
always get screwed because most of them
[SPEAKER_05]: are so passionate about the work that they
don't chase the protection the best
[SPEAKER_05]: example I have of brand protection is
Michael Buffa and Michael Buffa come up
[SPEAKER_05]: with one phrase let's get ready to rumble
do you know how much that phrase is worth
[SPEAKER_05]: half a billion dollars and you know why
it's worth half a billion because he sends
[SPEAKER_05]: a team of lawyers to beat you to death if
he finds out you're using it and what it
[SPEAKER_05]: does it lets him proprietary own that
phrase breeders rely on people like us
[SPEAKER_05]: farmers growers nursery operators store
operators to be conscientious of the fact
[SPEAKER_05]: that they put all the work in and so
instead of me taking his work and they're
[SPEAKER_05]: relabeling it myself I make sure I give
credit to him and and push it and then
[SPEAKER_05]: what it does it lets him do the work he's
supposed to so I'm riding on his coattails
[SPEAKER_05]: but I'm not stealing his coat thank you I
try man I try you know
[SPEAKER_04]: there's this one guy's been trying to get
a question forever okay one more question
[SPEAKER_04]: cracking or pollinating cracking yeah so
at a general level because I'm just a
[SPEAKER_04]: regular farmer I like coconut water or
hydrogen peroxide and I'll soak them Kevin
[SPEAKER_04]: has a whole way more intense laboratory
procedure he can explain to you but for me
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll either soak them in coconut water and
then they go in the ground yeah I use
[SPEAKER_04]: regular real coconut water because that
coconut is that life juice that's in that
[SPEAKER_04]: coconut is seed that's to get that seed
going it works amazing I'll soak them in
[SPEAKER_04]: coconut water then they'll go into either
paper towels and wait so I check my
[SPEAKER_04]: germination rates or they'll go straight
into the soil blocks there's hydrogen
[SPEAKER_04]: peroxide you can use the regular
store-bought hydrogen peroxide but it's
[SPEAKER_04]: not quite as great as the concentrated
quick little roll around in them and then
[SPEAKER_04]: back in yeah and then and then they'll go
into purified water packs with paper
[SPEAKER_04]: towels or into our soil blocks but Kevin
has a whole intense way of being able to
[SPEAKER_05]: do it a lot of it is does the seed have
the ability to break through the husk and
[SPEAKER_05]: so you can mechanically crack it and you
can also sometimes scarify it to make it
[SPEAKER_05]: so that it can be the liquid can imbibe
easier because sometimes you get a skin on
[SPEAKER_05]: the seed that's very resistant and so what
I do is I make these containers where I
[SPEAKER_05]: glue sandpaper inside the container and
then I can just shake the seed and scarify
[SPEAKER_05]: it and then once I've scarified it now I
have an ability to get liquid to penetrate
[SPEAKER_05]: easier and then I'd want to it depends on
on just how old this is but if I can use
[SPEAKER_05]: an h202 solution what it does it allows me
to be able to get a form of oxygen driven
[SPEAKER_05]: into it so that I start to have this this
metabolic process move forward and I can
[SPEAKER_05]: also use stuff like a grow kashi in a
liquid form because what I'm doing is I'm
[SPEAKER_05]: getting what I call bioprotectants I use
that on TC plants too where if I can give
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant a bioprotective form it allows
this to imbibe and it allows it to
[SPEAKER_05]: instantly have the bioprotectants needed
to survive as a child because a lot of the
[SPEAKER_05]: stock that's tough to crack is typically a
little weaker in general and so I want to
[SPEAKER_05]: give it everything possible so I don't
need to go through 300 seeds to get 50 out
[SPEAKER_05]: and what you're gonna find is some plants
just do that those aren't the ones you you
[SPEAKER_05]: work with in that form it's like the clone
ability when I'm looking for for
[SPEAKER_05]: cultivating cultivars that I want to work
at a nursery level if it doesn't clone I
[SPEAKER_05]: can't use it so I've had plants that you
couldn't strike roots for 30 days that
[SPEAKER_05]: makes it impossible to put into a clonal
operation and that's what maybe understand
[SPEAKER_05]: how many killer varieties we've lost
because they're so hard to propagate it's
[SPEAKER_05]: just the reality you know and so I think I
think that was the last question right
[SPEAKER_05]: thank you and thank you Eric from HBK band
always a privilege thank you
