[SPEAKER_07]: Style and fashion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, you can't teach style.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, Yves Saint Laurent said,
whereas fashion is an art that's
[SPEAKER_07]: notoriously difficult to keep up with
because trends change seasonally,
[SPEAKER_07]: style is impacted by much longer lasting
factors.
[SPEAKER_07]: Style is affected by religion,
politics, culture, subculture,
[SPEAKER_07]: weather, body type, profession,
upbringing, and lots of other things.
[SPEAKER_07]: So bravo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's what we think too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this is a fashion and beauty panel and
beauty is sort of at the top of this food
[SPEAKER_07]: chain because it's about looking good,
about bringing beauty and aesthetics into
[SPEAKER_07]: the world.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we want to talk about why it's
important.
[SPEAKER_07]: You may notice this is our first and only,
to my knowledge, all female panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: So whoo.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now, one of the things that we wanted to
do is we really wanted to talk with you
[SPEAKER_07]: about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're going to go really quickly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everybody's going to just tell you who
they are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Then we're going to start talking about
fashion.
[SPEAKER_07]: And it turns out we have some different
points of view about it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we invite you to have your points
of view and throw them in too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we really want to participate with you.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm going to start by letting my
panelists speak for themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hi, my name is Deborah Lindquist.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm an eco-conscious clothing designer.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've been in business for 35 years next
month.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I work with a combination of organic,
sustainable, and recycled materials.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the reason I'm here is I am working
with vintage cashmere and vintage leather.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I applique different kind of iconic
symbols on these things.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've decided a few years ago that the
hemp leaf was pretty.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I started to applique my leaves on my
cashmere.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I also work with other kinds of fabrics
like the sustainables, Modal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my very, very favorite sustainable
fabric is hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: I started working with that in around
2004.
[SPEAKER_06]: I put it on the runway when Mercedes Benz
and Smashbox were partners in LA Fashion
[SPEAKER_06]: Week.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I ended up putting a hemp wedding
dress at the end of that runway show,
[SPEAKER_06]: which ended up in the USA Today newspaper
in a story about industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here's my wedding dress on my model at
the finale of my fashion show in this
[SPEAKER_06]: industrial hemp article.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that was about 2005.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been in this for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: My mission is to really inspire people to
care about the environment.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm really concerned about the planet and
the people who live on it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And my business is focused on
sustainability for that reason.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Brandy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I am from Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm here from Toronto.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm the founder of EVO Beauty.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have been around now for five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are a non-cannabis category.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a non-cannabis company, if that makes
any sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I started the company with a mission to
break stigmas and create a more conscious
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was so important to me when I
started the company, because I started the
[SPEAKER_01]: company while living in a woman's shelter.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can imagine my life is drastically
different five years later.
[SPEAKER_01]: And recently, I just sold a part of the
company to Aurora.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're our partners in the cannabis
sector.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis is just a tool in our vast
tool belt to create a more conscious
[SPEAKER_01]: future, which is why I say we're not a
cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_01]: There were four main pillars that I was
focusing on in creating a more conscious
[SPEAKER_01]: future.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it just so happened that cannabis was
a tool that addressed all of those.
[SPEAKER_01]: If it was lavender that could address all
of those, I would be in a very different
[SPEAKER_01]: room right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But those four pillars were social
justice, which I think is a huge,
[SPEAKER_01]: huge, huge component of cannabis that is
often not spoken about enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another one is the excess use of
animal byproducts in cosmetics is huge.
[SPEAKER_01]: Also the excess use of plastics.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then also transparency in the cosmetic
world as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm actually watching somebody put on
their lip gloss right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know what's in that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Good, good, good.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's often a challenge in cosmetics
that you're unsure of what's in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so being from Canada, you just heard
them talk about the man who was previously
[SPEAKER_01]: talk about the regulations and how you
literally have to put on a marshmallow
[SPEAKER_01]: suit before you go in.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who's scanning in and out.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know who touched that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know every single thing about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that provides a lot of transparency to
non-cannabis consumers, who really the
[SPEAKER_01]: consumer of EVO Beauty are not cannabis
consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, most of them are not for it yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we were addressing that as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then towards the planet, we were
actually able to reduce the use of plastic
[SPEAKER_01]: by 45% by reinforcing our plastic with
hemp fibers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cannabis is just a tool that we use,
but we are not a cannabis company.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we really lean on our partners at
Aurora and others in the industry to be
[SPEAKER_01]: the experts in that area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we just provide a new platform through
our mass distribution in Canada,
[SPEAKER_01]: the US, Australia, and the EU as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're partners with Sephora as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it certainly gives us a different type
of consumer to introduce them to.
[SPEAKER_01]: The magic of cannabis that isn't in the
capacity of smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hi.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Elisa Marquez, stage name Miss
Marquez.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a burlesque performer, and I'm the
artistic director of a show called
[SPEAKER_03]: Marijuana Madness.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a live show that combines burlesque,
live jazz music, and theater to tell the
[SPEAKER_03]: true story of cannabis prohibition during
the jazz era.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all the music in the show is music from
the jazz era.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tale of the show tells the story of
cannabis prohibition and how it targeted
[SPEAKER_03]: jazz musicians, the racist roots of
cannabis prohibition during the 1930s.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a professional dancer who has been
focused on burlesque for about the past
[SPEAKER_03]: seven years.
[SPEAKER_03]: About four years ago, I decided to start
implementing cannabis into my burlesque
[SPEAKER_03]: acts as a form of cannabis advocacy to try
and change the stigma of what people think
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis consumers look and act like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I actually, my form of advocacy is
actually wearing cannabis on myself in my
[SPEAKER_03]: costumes and in my acts.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm partnered for Marijuana Madness with a
great organization called Grass Fed,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they provide amazing cannabis live
events.
[SPEAKER_03]: Their approach to cannabis is more like a
fine wine tasting, so all of our events
[SPEAKER_03]: are fancy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We encourage people to dress up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a smoke-free environment,
so it's also a very health-conscious
[SPEAKER_03]: company also.
[SPEAKER_03]: At our events, it's a smoke-free
environment that is only vaping and
[SPEAKER_03]: microdose edibles, and I'm very proud of
the show in the sense that it is the first
[SPEAKER_03]: live event and burlesque show of its kind
that only doesn't focus on cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_03]: storyline, but also provides a cannabis
speakeasy where you can actually consume
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis at the live event.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's me.
[SPEAKER_07]: And she's performing tonight at the after
party, so whoop.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, me and the band will be performing on
the top deck tonight.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll be performing some of my
cannabis-themed acts, so be sure to stick
[SPEAKER_03]: around for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna be lots of fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hello, everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Whitney Beatty, and I'm CEO and
founder of Apothecary Brands, and I
[SPEAKER_04]: actually came to the cannabis space,
I guess, differently than a lot of other
[SPEAKER_04]: people.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five years ago, I was a senior vice
president at a entertainment company,
[SPEAKER_04]: but I had a health situation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was diagnosed with anxiety, and I tried
a million different drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then my doctor prescribed to me,
and none of them worked, and offhand,
[SPEAKER_04]: she said, why don't you try cannabis?
[SPEAKER_04]: And actually, I was in shock and awe
because Nancy Reagan had told me to say no
[SPEAKER_04]: to drugs, and I listened.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why would Nancy lie to me, I said.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I did a lot of research, and I learned
a ton about the space, but what I did not
[SPEAKER_04]: like after coming into it was I didn't
find a lot of things that spoke to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Spoke to me as a mother, as a female,
as an executive, as a member of the
[SPEAKER_04]: community that I was in, and also,
when I looked at the other people that I
[SPEAKER_04]: knew used cannabis, they were all a lot
like me, and they kept their wine in their
[SPEAKER_04]: wine fridge, and they kept liquor in bars,
and they kept cigars in humidor,
[SPEAKER_04]: and we all kept our high-end cannabis in a
shoebox out of our beds.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, why is that?
[SPEAKER_04]: That compromises the experience,
it compromises to me the use of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Why am I saying that this medicine is so
useful to me, and now I'm going to put it
[SPEAKER_04]: in a place of shame underneath my bed when
it's not safe, it's not kept in the
[SPEAKER_04]: humidity?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I decided, like any high-quality
single mother, to quit my job,
[SPEAKER_04]: sell my house, and start a company,
and that's what I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I started Apothecary three years ago,
and since then, we went through the Canopy
[SPEAKER_04]: Business Accelerator, we've raised seed
around, and we've been in sales for almost
[SPEAKER_04]: two years now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing well, we're 140% up from last
year, and encouraging people to think
[SPEAKER_04]: about the way that they store,
use, and imbibe cannabis.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm Janine Moss, I'm CEO of Anabee,
and we have a luxury line, thank you,
[SPEAKER_07]: a luxury line of fashion accessories for
the sophisticated cannabis consumer.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have a table right over there,
so you can learn everything there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So let me just ask another question of
you.
[SPEAKER_07]: One thing I want to observe is the
character of the audience changed a lot
[SPEAKER_07]: here.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have to observe that there's a lot of
women here now, and much fewer men,
[SPEAKER_07]: so men, good on you for being here.
[SPEAKER_07]: Welcome to our fashion world.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me ask you, how many people in here
are thinking about, oh, I have a business,
[SPEAKER_07]: and I've got to up-level it, I don't want
to pull in fashion?
[SPEAKER_07]: How many are interested in that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, nobody, practically a couple people,
good on you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Are there any investors in this room?
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, what, do you want to figure out how
to wear your, how to fly your freak flag
[SPEAKER_07]: better?
[SPEAKER_07]: So all of those things, any other thoughts
out there, just shout them out,
[SPEAKER_07]: things you'd like us to make sure that we
cover, that you're interested in about
[SPEAKER_07]: fashion?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay, it's on us then.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, I'm gonna kick it off with a
question, but honestly, think about it,
[SPEAKER_07]: because we'd really like to talk with you
about how we can be helpful to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so our first question, my first
question, is we heard a lot about how
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis came into businesses,
there were businesses, and now they've
[SPEAKER_07]: incorporated cannabis, but how can fashion
influence cannabis, and the cannabis
[SPEAKER_07]: industry?
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it important, is it not important?
[SPEAKER_07]: Should we be thinking about it?
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's start with each, ask each of our
panelists how they think fashion can help
[SPEAKER_07]: us in moving this industry forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, fashion can help move this industry
forward by people embracing, I think from
[SPEAKER_06]: my point of view, I'm working with hemp.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the very beginning, when I first
started working with hemp, journalists
[SPEAKER_06]: would say things like, well, how can you
be making sexy clothes out of hemp when
[SPEAKER_06]: it's kind of scratchy and shapeless?
[SPEAKER_06]: Garments and boring kind of clothes,
and I was making bustiers, and I have a
[SPEAKER_06]: kind of burlesque connection with Miss
Marquez, I was doing pussycat dolls,
[SPEAKER_06]: so I was doing their costumes,
and I took all the, well, I was doing
[SPEAKER_06]: bustiers before I did them for pussycat
dolls, but I started putting my hemp into
[SPEAKER_06]: bustiers, like in a wedding dress kind of
theme.
[SPEAKER_06]: So they were so confused at first,
and just didn't know what to do with me,
[SPEAKER_06]: and they decided, well, we'll call you the
sexy eco-designer, which was fine with me
[SPEAKER_06]: instead of the dumpy eco-designer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's kind of, there's a stigma to how
this material could be used, for instance.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm not familiar with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, gee, look at how drapey and lovely
and sensual this fabric is.
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of really wearing the leaf,
which I've put on things, some people are
[SPEAKER_06]: a little afraid of it because they don't
want to be stigmatized, but I think it's a
[SPEAKER_06]: pretty leaf, and I apply flowers on
things, and it's just another leaf.
[SPEAKER_06]: I like maple leaves, too, and palm leaves.
[SPEAKER_06]: So as a plant, I think it's a great plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has so many uses from the industrial
point of view of hemp and to the cannabis
[SPEAKER_06]: point of view for medicine and so on.
[SPEAKER_06]: So does that answer your question?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure, for now.
[SPEAKER_07]: So again, how can fashion help us move
this industry forward?
[SPEAKER_07]: Fashion and style.
[SPEAKER_07]: And a focus on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that it's, in my opinion,
I think my answer kind of crosses over
[SPEAKER_01]: just fashion and beauty and style,
but I think cannabis is really similar to
[SPEAKER_01]: Uber in a way.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you would have said to me 10 years ago,
hey, B, you're going to get in the back of
[SPEAKER_01]: an unmarked car with a man driving.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not going to talk to him.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's going to take you to where you want
to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just trust him.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd be like, no, I'm not.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not getting in the back of that man's
car.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I took an Uber here, and anytime I'm
in Vancouver, which is the only city on
[SPEAKER_01]: the planet that doesn't have Uber,
I don't know what to do with myself.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hard to live without Uber now,
and I think that it's very similar with
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: So from our perspective, we actually did a
survey in April in the US, and it was
[SPEAKER_01]: between Sephora.
[SPEAKER_01]: We were part of their Accelerate,
and so we did a survey with 2,000 Sephora
[SPEAKER_01]: consumers, and we asked them, you know,
is it important to you to reduce the use
[SPEAKER_01]: of plastic?
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it important to you to reduce the use
of animal byproducts and animal testing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And is it important to you to have
transparency in your ingredients?
[SPEAKER_01]: And across the board, everybody said yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when we said, would you have
cannabis in your products, across the
[SPEAKER_01]: board, the majority of people said,
like, hell no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that if you're addressing
people's problems in any industry,
[SPEAKER_01]: then it's more likely to be able to
progress that forward, and it will take
[SPEAKER_01]: some time to break the stigma.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've now done what they have asked in
the products to address their problems and
[SPEAKER_01]: then can then say, surprise, it's
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that also helps break the
stigma, and it also helps move the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, the cosmetic industry forward by
addressing those problems that are major
[SPEAKER_01]: problems to those people, whether they
believe in cannabis or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jumping off of what you were saying,
Deborah, Pussycat Dolls is a great
[SPEAKER_03]: example, actually, because, you know,
back in the 2000s when Pussycat Dolls were
[SPEAKER_03]: a thing, bustiers were, like, quite as
fashionable as, like, now you see them all
[SPEAKER_03]: the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think with fashion, it's important
to note the trends of things and how
[SPEAKER_03]: people, like, you know, Lady Gaga or the
Pussycat Dolls, like, being a professional
[SPEAKER_03]: dancer that's worked in the commercial
industry, I see how the wardrobe they put
[SPEAKER_03]: on us, you might wear in a music video,
and then all of a sudden it becomes the
[SPEAKER_03]: next trending thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a burlesque performer, that's what got
me so excited about using my platform to
[SPEAKER_03]: promote cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started looking for costume pieces that
had pasties or, you know, a G-string that
[SPEAKER_03]: had a cannabis leaf on it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Couldn't find it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't exist.
[SPEAKER_03]: Created it myself.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I see it other places.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not to, like, tout my own, you know,
but, like, as a burlesque performer,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's very exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exciting to get really creative.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously I'm a bit eccentric.
[SPEAKER_03]: My hair color kind of shows that a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: And if I can encourage people to be
creative and eccentric with their own
[SPEAKER_03]: wardrobe because I'm wearing a cannabis
leaf on my head, that makes me pretty
[SPEAKER_03]: excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: I personally think that fashion has the
ability to really help us de-stigmatize
[SPEAKER_04]: the space.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think we have the ability to bring new
people into the cannabis space by
[SPEAKER_04]: broadening out what we see as cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, if we were here 10 years ago,
people were much more, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: thinking about stoner culture.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got, you know, college kids smoking
behind the gym and that, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: stoner guy who can't remember.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's all these stigmas and stereotypes
over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as we have the ability in fashion and
the way that we present things,
[SPEAKER_04]: the way that we brand things, we have the
ability to really broaden out and make
[SPEAKER_04]: people feel more comfortable in this
space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because personally, for me, I want to be
selling, you know, cannabis not only to,
[SPEAKER_04]: you know, the people that are already in
this space, but I want the 45-year-old
[SPEAKER_04]: white woman in Kansas to feel welcome
here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want the, you know, 65-year-old black
mother who has arthritis to feel welcome
[SPEAKER_04]: here.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we need to be able to show them,
you know, this space as where they are,
[SPEAKER_04]: meet them where they are.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have that ability through cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just in the same way as cannabis is not
one-size-fits-all, what I smoke might not
[SPEAKER_04]: have the same medicinal benefits for you
as it does for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: My anxiety works with sativas,
not indicas.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, everything is very personalized.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we have the ability to bring that
personalization to people through fashion
[SPEAKER_04]: and the way that we present this to them
and open them up to the plant.
[SPEAKER_07]: So fashion makes things accessible too.
[SPEAKER_07]: So one of the things I believe from what
you're all saying is, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: fashion's been democratized.
[SPEAKER_07]: It used to be that it was this rarefied
thing and only the very wealthy could do
[SPEAKER_07]: it and then there was Tarjay, you know.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there was a, it's really been
democratized.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think every American anyway has gotten
quite used to good design.
[SPEAKER_07]: So panelists, what do you think's not
living up to the good design, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: where are we in the evolution of whether
it's cannabis packaging, the design of the
[SPEAKER_07]: products, the consumers, you know,
where are we, where do we need to go?
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's start over here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just having a conversation today
about how, you know, as much as we work
[SPEAKER_04]: and do, I think as a community,
try our best to put our best foot forward.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that we still have a lot of
objectification of women and a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: billboards that you see on the side of the
road.
[SPEAKER_04]: I saw a picture today of two women's asses
with the cannabis, you know, company's
[SPEAKER_04]: name on the back.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm not naming any names, but I feel
that that's absolutely ridiculous in this
[SPEAKER_04]: space where we have more female CEOs than
anywhere else that we feel comfortable in
[SPEAKER_04]: objectifying women in that manner.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we're talking about women being one
of the fastest growing groups coming into
[SPEAKER_04]: this space, that's how you want to welcome
them and all the people who said,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, you know, we're scared of cannabis and
this is what we're showing them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that, you know, as a community,
it's our job to be able to stand up and
[SPEAKER_04]: say, you know, that's not what we want to
stand for.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand that there's a range
that, you know, just like there's pop-off
[SPEAKER_04]: and gray groups, that there are going to
be brands that fall between the range.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I just think that that is just
unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people have to stand up and say so,
or we end up with more of that.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's the objectification of women,
which we pretty much object to because we
[SPEAKER_07]: all clout.
[SPEAKER_07]: But what about the other things like
stoners and big joints and, you know,
[SPEAKER_07]: what do you think about what else you're
seeing?
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody have thoughts?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I can say from what I was speaking
about earlier about at Marijuana Madness
[SPEAKER_03]: providing a cannabis speakeasy,
we have chose specifically to make it a
[SPEAKER_03]: smoke-free environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there aren't any bongs, there aren't
any big ripped joints, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And not that I don't enjoy those things,
but I do think it is important to really
[SPEAKER_03]: showcase and provide people with an
experience that's not that typical
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis culture stigma that we associate
from, you know, like we were saying
[SPEAKER_03]: earlier, the Cheech and Shaw movies,
which I love, but remember that was a
[SPEAKER_03]: parody.
[SPEAKER_03]: And when you take that parody and then
make that your real life, that's not doing
[SPEAKER_03]: anyone in the cannabis industry any
favors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wish that we could say the same in
Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is very rare, actually, that we have
female CEOs or female director roles in
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis in Canada, which is interesting
because it is the country leading cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I do kind of understand a little bit of
the sexualization of women.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't agree with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have that opposite opinion,
but I do also agree that if there's a long
[SPEAKER_01]: way to go within that and I think that in
changing who's sitting on those boards and
[SPEAKER_01]: not saying that it needs to be women,
but it needs to be people there that are
[SPEAKER_01]: there for the right reasons.
[SPEAKER_01]: And actually something that I don't know
if this has to do so much with fashion or
[SPEAKER_01]: answers the question or not, but kind of
going back to the social justice and
[SPEAKER_01]: fashion has a huge part in cultural
changes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it has a huge part in societal uproars
and how we can change things.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we definitely use fashion and beauty
to protest our opinions in a very positive
[SPEAKER_01]: way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that some of the things
that we need to focus on is changing who's
[SPEAKER_01]: in that room and what we're talking about,
one of them majorly being social justice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm on a panel in Toronto tomorrow morning
that I'm on this panel with a man who now
[SPEAKER_01]: is a CEO of a cannabis company,
which awesome, but he was also a police
[SPEAKER_01]: officer in a ranking role that put most of
those people behind bars for marijuana
[SPEAKER_01]: crimes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think that there's an interesting
aspect there to be addressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that fashion and beauty is a
really cool platform to be able to kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of, I don't like the word protest because
I'm certainly that sometimes has a
[SPEAKER_01]: negative connotation to being angry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not necessarily how we progress
and move forward either, but I think
[SPEAKER_01]: fashion and beauty has a really strong
space because it's visual.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I think that we need to put the
people in the roles that have positive
[SPEAKER_01]: opinions towards cultural change and
societal change.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that's when we start to see
less naked asses on billboards.
[SPEAKER_07]: Deborah, do you want to talk?
[SPEAKER_06]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm a sustainable fashion brand,
eco-conscious.
[SPEAKER_06]: And when finally there was terminology for
what I'd been doing for quite a while,
[SPEAKER_06]: since 1983 actually, it was probably
around 2004.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all these names for, what do we call
this?
[SPEAKER_06]: We call it green, we call it sustainable,
we call it eco-friendly, eco-conscious,
[SPEAKER_06]: ethical.
[SPEAKER_06]: So back then it was about to change the
world.
[SPEAKER_06]: People were jumping onto the green
bandwagon like it was the next greatest
[SPEAKER_06]: thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Sometimes not really being true to all of
it, there was greenwashing like,
[SPEAKER_06]: oh, I'm doing this, but I'm not really
doing this.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there are many aspects to a sustainable
business.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's about the materials used,
the way you process your production
[SPEAKER_06]: methods, all comes down to carbon
footprint.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the main objective is to save the
planet and keep our environment healthy
[SPEAKER_06]: and keep ourselves healthy as people.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in the last decade, what's taken over,
something happened.
[SPEAKER_06]: We had an economic crisis and everybody
decided that, well, we're just going to
[SPEAKER_06]: buy fast fashion.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it gained a gigantic foothold with mega
brands giving us options of new fashion
[SPEAKER_06]: every day in these big stores,
which you probably know.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are four of them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I won't mention their names because we all
know them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But they've taken over the world,
actually.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they've created so much chaos and so
much unhealthy conditions for the people
[SPEAKER_06]: who make the product and also just for the
environment in general.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because it's really true, the butterfly's
wings do affect the world as a type of
[SPEAKER_06]: food halfway around the world.
[SPEAKER_06]: Small changes bring really big results.
[SPEAKER_06]: So now after so many businesses have been
operating in the shadows for 10 years,
[SPEAKER_06]: a lot of my friends have dropped out
because they couldn't make it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Retail stores have closed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So here we are back again talking about
sustainability.
[SPEAKER_06]: And interestingly enough, it's involving
cannabis and it's involving hemp,
[SPEAKER_06]: at least for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a brand, basically.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm really proud to say that what I do
out of hemp is really high-end fashion.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's wedding, it's really feminine,
sustainable, and it's not overtly,
[SPEAKER_06]: well, it's sexy, but it's not overtly
sexy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not like those billboard you're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_06]: I know exactly which one that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a little tired of all that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's be beautiful as women.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we can have all that as part of us as
well.
[SPEAKER_06]: But think about the greater picture.
[SPEAKER_06]: What are we really trying to do here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Can I jump in on that real quick?
[SPEAKER_03]: I like to what you just said about women
are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because I think not necessarily butts are
not beautiful, but it's context.
[SPEAKER_03]: And context is everything.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so what you're describing is very
different than what I do.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm a burlesque performer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's like porn.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know it when you see it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, it's the same thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's the difference between the
objectification and sexualization in this
[SPEAKER_04]: space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because when you show that without,
you're not showing their face.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't care about that person.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're not marketing to that girl.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're selling weed off the back of her
ass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's not okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just wanted to throw that in there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was you saying it's not objectification of
the person?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because the person, when you do your
burlesque, because you're the personified.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's amazing about burlesque is it's a
woman's choice to utilize sexualization in
[SPEAKER_03]: her performance in a way that is parody,
is comedy.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I love about burlesque is because I
get to use that sexual platform to make
[SPEAKER_03]: people reflect on their own insecurities
about sex in general.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a big reason why I loved
bringing cannabis into that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because just like sex has a big stigma and
people are very uncomfortable with it and
[SPEAKER_03]: nudity and that sort of thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are people really uncomfortable with
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, I totally agree with you guys on
all the objectification.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just want to throw out there,
butts are beautiful.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the right context.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we've heard about social justice,
ecological sensitivity.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've heard about gender parity.
[SPEAKER_07]: And there's a movie.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have you all heard about the Women of
Weed?
[SPEAKER_07]: Mary Jane's The Women of Weed movie?
[SPEAKER_07]: So what's great about that, I'm in that
movie, short little piece.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's great about that movie is that she
set out to find out whether women in the
[SPEAKER_07]: industry had these things in mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you guys clearly all have those things
in mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: And so maybe it's a new industry because
women have such a leadership position in
[SPEAKER_07]: cannabis now.
[SPEAKER_07]: Maybe we have an opportunity to create a
new industry that has those kinds of
[SPEAKER_07]: sensibilities.
[SPEAKER_07]: So my question then is, if we do have that
opportunity, how do we make it real?
[SPEAKER_07]: What do we have to do to keep this going?
[SPEAKER_01]: I am really eager to answer that question.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need more men in these seats.
[SPEAKER_01]: The fact that there is more women in these
seats now than there was before and less
[SPEAKER_01]: men, that's what we need.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to all encompass, be working
towards one goal together, not have the
[SPEAKER_01]: women's panels, but have women on the
panels because they deserve their spot
[SPEAKER_01]: there and they earned it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to stop segregating those things
and be all one together, working towards a
[SPEAKER_01]: common goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's how we really get there.
[SPEAKER_07]: So propel it by bringing men into the
ideas that we're putting forward,
[SPEAKER_07]: is what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: And men have some amazing ideas too.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be honest, my board of directors is
primarily men.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, solely men.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's not something I'm proud of.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that they really earned their
spots there and really moved this movement
[SPEAKER_01]: forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And our office is on Bay Street in
Toronto, which is like the Wall Street of
[SPEAKER_01]: Canada.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they're coming in for one purpose,
which is to make capital gains in the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm okay that they're coming in for
that purpose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But when they're sitting around our
boardroom table, they're coming in and
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, hey, tell me about Me Too.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me about women in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Tell me your opinion on this cannabis ad.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that having those mutual
conversations together is a really,
[SPEAKER_01]: really big movement in that direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's unfortunate that a lot of men
exit the conversation when it's a panel of
[SPEAKER_01]: women.
[SPEAKER_04]: Before I talked about the fact that
there's more female CEOs in cannabis than
[SPEAKER_04]: any other industry in the US.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that number has been trailing
downwards.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think it used to be 36, and now it's at
26%.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then also when you look at it,
those are not the companies that are
[SPEAKER_04]: getting the majority of funding.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not the ones who have the money to
buy the billboards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that it's important that we
have a seat at that table.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I talk this not just for women,
but also for people of color.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you haven't noticed,
I am a woman of color.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's just not enough of us here in
this industry having a word in this
[SPEAKER_04]: industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we come from communities that have
been disproportionately disenfranchised.
[SPEAKER_04]: By a war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't have a seat at the table
either.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so being able, I think, to have those
conversations at a higher level.
[SPEAKER_04]: Being in that C-suite where those
decisions are made become a very powerful
[SPEAKER_04]: thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so to piggyback on that, I think that
it's great that we're here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I love the fact that we have so many
women.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to see them have more power.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to have some decision-making.
[SPEAKER_07]: So how do we help everybody in this
audience get a seat at the table?
[SPEAKER_07]: What do you have to do?
[SPEAKER_07]: How are we going to help them?
[SPEAKER_07]: And how are we all going to do it?
[SPEAKER_07]: Anybody have any ideas?
[SPEAKER_00]: I think as far as the ethics of the
advertising, maybe reach out to some of
[SPEAKER_00]: the organizations and get the message out
that we want to maybe educate what is an
[SPEAKER_00]: area that we want to have change in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you said, the billboard is a great
example of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as far as Brittany talking about the
man of CEOs, and this isn't the judgment
[SPEAKER_00]: call at all, but I think that's
unacceptable because there's just as many
[SPEAKER_00]: women that have earned the right to be
there, and they're not.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think when you stop accepting it,
and I know it's difficult, obviously in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different situation, but that is one step
forward.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's not acceptable that it's all
men CEOs.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now one thing I've read in a lot of the
statistics is that women don't want to be
[SPEAKER_07]: CEOs as they start climbing up the ladder.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it inhibits you in your family
life.
[SPEAKER_07]: It means something to be a CEO.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have so much to say right now,
too.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to be CEOs.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to be in charge.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to set that culture that makes it
OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that when we are in charge,
we are allowed to set up corporate culture
[SPEAKER_04]: that allows it to be OK, that I'm a single
mother.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yes, within my company, we have ability
to have family time.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have work-life balance and those sort
of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that when you give us the
opportunity to be in those seats,
[SPEAKER_04]: we want to be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Don't believe the hype that we don't want
to be in that seat.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to be in the seat.
[SPEAKER_07]: But do you think anybody's going to give
us that opportunity?
[SPEAKER_07]: Are they going to go here, have that
opportunity, we love you?
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I took it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I sold my house and I started the company.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, I'll be a CEO.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to go by myself until I get the
team behind me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took me a while to be able to get
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I raised every penny of that first
seed round in order for us to get us off
[SPEAKER_04]: the ground.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I continue to go out there and pound
out the pavement.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't make it easy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm raising a bridge round right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: But is it worth it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Every damn day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I get to set these standards.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I get to be the company that I think
should be there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I get to show the imagery that is
diverse and shows fashion and shows people
[SPEAKER_04]: of all walks of life using cannabis in a
way that I think is responsible and
[SPEAKER_04]: medicinal.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's the powerful benefit of
being there.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many people want to do that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Create companies that have these kinds of
policies.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think we also have to, I don't want
to be the most unliked person on the
[SPEAKER_01]: panel, but we have to make a point too
that women have had less time in business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I mean, I am a feminist the most.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started my company while living in a
shelter there due to domestic violence.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know the sacrifice and what it takes to
start from nothing, $15 and raising money
[SPEAKER_01]: and selling part of my company to Aurora,
which is male CEOs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they actually, what they did,
and this is why the men are in those
[SPEAKER_01]: positions right now, is because they
recognize their privilege.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they recognize that they have the
power to invest in a young female CEO and
[SPEAKER_01]: let her guide where that money is going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let her decide how that billboard is going
to look.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the fact that they came forward to
that point to do that, I totally,
[SPEAKER_01]: I embrace that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I will take those funds from the male CEOs
and position that properly so that we can
[SPEAKER_01]: give more opportunity to young female CEOs
moving forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not going to happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's going to take time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And men have had, historically,
because they've been in the workforce for
[SPEAKER_01]: so much longer, historically, they do have
more experience in this space.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't make that experience better.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean that they're better at
their job at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But historically, they have been in those
positions much longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we can utilize that power
together, I think that's really how we get
[SPEAKER_01]: ahead because most females don't have the
capital funding.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got 2% of VC funding last year alone.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm really, really grateful that I'm part
of that 2%.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I want to use that to be able to
create positions where more women can have
[SPEAKER_01]: those tools and ability.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's not going to happen overnight.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm glad you brought up that number
because I think that becomes the key is
[SPEAKER_04]: why you see so many white male businesses
being able to survive and thrive is
[SPEAKER_04]: because they're getting that funding.
[SPEAKER_04]: When women are getting 2% of venture
funding and women of color are getting
[SPEAKER_04]: 0.02%.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have to do five times better to get
to an iota of that money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're holding that money.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we don't have the access to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It allows us not to be able to build those
brands.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: I closed around as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that doesn't happen as often.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you look at, I think the normal
number for a white male CEO was to raise
[SPEAKER_04]: $3.6 million.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's only been 18 women of color
who have ever raised over a million
[SPEAKER_04]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that you've got to look at
where that money is coming from as where
[SPEAKER_04]: that power play is as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to change with badass
women like this.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as the moderator, I have to bring it
back to fashion because this is a huge
[SPEAKER_07]: issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: But is fashion the way we can do it?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, are those inroads?
[SPEAKER_07]: Women have been enabled to have a historic
role, say, in marketing.
[SPEAKER_07]: They let us be nurses.
[SPEAKER_07]: They let us be secretaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then we became marketing people.
[SPEAKER_07]: We've made our inroads.
[SPEAKER_07]: And now we've had enough time that we have
the economic knowledge.
[SPEAKER_07]: We have the money now.
[SPEAKER_07]: The greatest transfer of wealth and
history to women is happening right now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And we have the education.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're there.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is fashion like the Trojan horse?
[SPEAKER_07]: Can it get us in fashion and beauty?
[SPEAKER_07]: Or does it have a role to play here?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think business is business is business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So whether it's fashion or beauty or
cannabis or whatever it is, it's business.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you all agree?
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I think we have to design our own
lives.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we have the opportunity to do that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we do that every day with our choices.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you end up with something you say,
I didn't want this.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't like this situation I'm in.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you made decisions all along the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: The universe provides you with the things
that you say that you have.
[SPEAKER_06]: So in terms of fashion, I think that you
learn to project yourself in a way that
[SPEAKER_06]: you want to be seen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you have choices.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can buy this.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can buy that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make your choices carefully.
[SPEAKER_06]: Buy less and buy better is my motto from
people like you.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like me, for instance.
[SPEAKER_06]: Over there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have a booth right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we have to decide that we want to
create more interest in what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: It does depend on how we look.
[SPEAKER_06]: How are you presenting yourself?
[SPEAKER_06]: How did we end up looking today when we
came to this panel discussion?
[SPEAKER_06]: We dressed in a certain way because we
decided we wanted to look this way.
[SPEAKER_06]: So those are choices you make every day.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what fashion does.
[SPEAKER_06]: You make choices.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might try something new.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might try waist-high pants.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's scary.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then wear a belt.
[SPEAKER_06]: Which I've done recently.
[SPEAKER_06]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the trends are the trends.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you can make them relate to your life
by trying them out, doing the best you can
[SPEAKER_06]: with it, and having a good time with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it should be something somewhat fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: So this leads beautifully into my next
question.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's going to be my last one before I turn
it over to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: OK, good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll keep mine.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just wanted to bring up that
[SPEAKER_05]: it's actually having the industry to
represent our cultivation, what we're
[SPEAKER_05]: producing as a brand.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I feel that it's kind of holding on to
the industry, even the makeup,
[SPEAKER_05]: social media, TV.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so we want to create a brand
[SPEAKER_05]: not showing booty like the beer industry
has done it, and the tobacco industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: even soda.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have one little thing to add to that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just have to consider you're the brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: You are the brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you want to look?
[SPEAKER_06]: How do you want people to see you?
[SPEAKER_06]: And then you make choices accordingly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so does your partner, as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think an important point, too,
is knowing who you're marketing to.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I want to talk about marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because clearly, that billboard that we've
addressed is not marketed towards women.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a huge billboard.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had the money for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's in their interest to sell to men.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's where, when you're talking
about having these conversations,
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it's really important to talk
about sex and talk about health.
[SPEAKER_03]: How sex is utilized in marketing so much
and explaining why that's not OK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that, for me, I think what we
take from fashion and bring into this
[SPEAKER_04]: space, besides the idea of not just plant,
we're talking lifestyle, we're talking
[SPEAKER_04]: broader context across the board,
is really being able to target in on a
[SPEAKER_04]: demo as a business.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know very clearly who an Apothecary
customer is.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just all women.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just all men.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm looking at men and women who are
medical users, urban professionals,
[SPEAKER_04]: or females who are between 30 and 60 who
are making $75,000 a year more.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's my target.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's no longer I can just put out cannabis
and people are just going to run just
[SPEAKER_04]: because it's there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think that in the same way that in
fashion, Forever 21 is talking to somebody
[SPEAKER_04]: and H&M is talking to somebody.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're starting to see that distinction
within this space.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that it's really parroting
what's happening in fashion.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, if you know who your customer is,
then you're brand, it's not about you.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's about what you want to mean to your
customer, I think.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's do some questions.
[SPEAKER_07]: I've got more, but you probably have
better ones.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm just a little curious because I think
sexy, that was something that got brought
[SPEAKER_09]: up a few times.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I think sexy can be more of a state of
being or an emotion that's invoked.
[SPEAKER_09]: I've seen your products, girl.
[SPEAKER_09]: You're killing it.
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's something that's sexy.
[SPEAKER_09]: It invokes something, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: So how do you go about creating your
personal brand as well as maybe you have
[SPEAKER_09]: something that you're actually selling,
clothing or whatever.
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you do that without going too far?
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you think is too far?
[SPEAKER_03]: I also teach burlesque classes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the brand for my burlesque classes is
called Empowerment in Heels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And with that, what's very interesting is
I've found that a lot of my students have
[SPEAKER_03]: been more empowered by taking sexy photos
of themselves and posting it on Instagram
[SPEAKER_03]: where, once again, it comes down to
context.
[SPEAKER_03]: They feel empowered by being a part of the
burlesque showcases that I provide to my
[SPEAKER_03]: students.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's not for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everyone wants to get up on stage and
put that much sexiness out there.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that's what's so interesting about
burlesque is really you can't go too far
[SPEAKER_03]: with it because it's based on your own
comfort.
[SPEAKER_03]: And watching a performer embrace that and
really channel that through their
[SPEAKER_03]: performance based on their own
comfortability is amazing to see.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think with each person it's
different.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we shouldn't criticize each other
for posting a sexy selfie or that sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Especially when you're incorporating it
within your brand.
[SPEAKER_03]: As long as it's a reflection of yourself
and you're embracing it, it won't,
[SPEAKER_03]: in my opinion, come off the same way.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, when they're probably
deciding this idea for the billboard,
[SPEAKER_03]: all right, what are we gonna do?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, we'll get the, okay,
yeah, all right.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in front of plenty of
photographers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've done plenty of shows with producers
that have made me feel uncomfortable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a big reason why I decided to
start producing my own show.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not a female CEO, but the nightlife
industry in LA is predominantly male.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so to be able to produce my own show
to make sure all my performers are
[SPEAKER_03]: performing in the safe environment is
really fantastic.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, it's sexy as hell, but we're
embracing it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think as long as it's organic to you
and you're not doing it for likes or just
[SPEAKER_03]: to sell your product, like the billboard,
then you can't go too far as long as it's
[SPEAKER_03]: organic and real.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think it also goes back to who your
target audience is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it depends who and why you're building
that brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: The biggest point being why you're
building that brand and who you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: address within that and what your mission
is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where is that line of sexy to achieve your
mission in an authentic way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think that that's a really
important thing to consider.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I would say too, along with your
audience is who you are, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: And that's true about all brands.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're sort of entities unto themselves.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it all starts with what you care
about, what your values are.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then how they're going to relate to
the external world.
[SPEAKER_07]: So start here first.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a question that I'm asked a lot and
have been recently.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I'm very interested to sort of get all
of your take on it.
[SPEAKER_08]: But it's back to the percentage.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think it's 36% of female executives
within this industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I wanted to know why each of you
thought that that is the case.
[SPEAKER_08]: Obviously we know this is a new industry
and more inclusive.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I wanted to, because I think you all
come from such individual places that it'd
[SPEAKER_08]: be interesting to ask why you think this
is the case.
[SPEAKER_07]: And let's just say that number's gone down
to 27% right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Personally, I think there's a couple of
things in play there.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that in the cannabis space right
now, there's a lower barrier to entry.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not that it's, you know, everyone knows
the difficulty with regulation and the
[SPEAKER_04]: license and all those things.
[SPEAKER_04]: But on my side, as an ancillary business,
there's a lower barrier to entry.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's not a lot of older legacy
companies that have been around.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there was more open space for me to be
able to build a brand there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that was very beneficial and helped
me want to get into the space.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that because the industry in some
ways is new, there is a lot more
[SPEAKER_04]: opportunity for females to jump in and
start their own companies in the space.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think that if you look at the
numbers, it also says that a lot more of
[SPEAKER_04]: the females are on the side that don't
need regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're doing consulting.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're doing ancillary side businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're not as much on the plant side or the
dispensary owner side, which is why I
[SPEAKER_04]: think that those numbers can be misleading
at some times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I really agree with that.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that the numbers are misleading in
a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know in Canada, for example,
there's one publicly traded LP founded by
[SPEAKER_01]: a woman.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that the number is decreasing
quickly, 10 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a huge decrease.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that that's happening because
we're separating ourselves in some
[SPEAKER_01]: capacities.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't mean we as women.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just mean in society, we all of us men
and women are separating ourselves and not
[SPEAKER_01]: working towards the same common goal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also women in these positions,
we do experience a lot more challenges
[SPEAKER_01]: than, say, a man would because it is a
boys club.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so often when you come up against
those challenges, you make a choice.
[SPEAKER_01]: You either exit or you continue moving
forward and you figure out how you're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes you have to sacrifice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in fact, not sometimes you do have to
sacrifice more than your male
[SPEAKER_01]: counterparts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's challenging.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it actually also there's a statistic
that showed that men are based on their
[SPEAKER_01]: potential and women are based on their
performance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have to continuously day in and day
out out to perform your male counterpart.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's tough as shit in this industry
right now because this industry is moving
[SPEAKER_01]: so quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has so much capital behind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so to be able to compete under those
conditions are difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I, you know, of course,
some people are not going to want to keep
[SPEAKER_01]: up with that rat race.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's no no harm in that at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that it's going to get to a
space where women do have more of that
[SPEAKER_01]: funding that we're going to be able to see
more women in that seat.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're not this is not a great thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that it's like I'm not for this.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just something that I'm observing
that a lot of that funding is going to
[SPEAKER_01]: come from men because they're currently
holding those funding positions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so until we start working together and
start dispersing those funds into more
[SPEAKER_01]: female CEO hands, we're not going to see
that change happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's going to take some time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But but it's going to happen.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I'd like to add just one thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: I alluded to before, which I think this is
a super historic moment in time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Never has there been such a new industry
with the potential of this industry that
[SPEAKER_07]: has come along when women are super
educated, have the business acumen of a
[SPEAKER_07]: couple of generations now and have the
financial wherewithal to participate.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if we can marshal all of those
resources and take advantage of this right
[SPEAKER_07]: now, I think it's a huge opportunity.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for this panel.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is great for all of us to
hear, especially as a man who works in
[SPEAKER_02]: female centric industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: I own a birth center and work a lot with
midwives.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I came into Los Angeles making sure
that my entire staff management wise was
[SPEAKER_02]: all female because I'm not trying to
attract men with girls in booty shorts.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're also trying to try trying to
educate men on how to transition their
[SPEAKER_02]: business from a male dominated one to a
female centric one, whether you're just
[SPEAKER_02]: trying to attract that market or just
trying to have a more balanced.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'd like to hear how can males from
this kind of standpoint and a male
[SPEAKER_02]: centric, how can they transition better
into having female centric kind of
[SPEAKER_02]: demographics being attract and not look
disingenuous by having I mean,
[SPEAKER_02]: I allow my staff to dress any way they
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of them dress in a in a in a way that
may that might reflect on me negatively
[SPEAKER_02]: saying that I'm telling them to dress this
way, even though that's the way they want
[SPEAKER_02]: to be.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm trying to allow them to express
themselves in the way they want to collect
[SPEAKER_02]: tips in the way that they want to attract
business in the way they want to and also
[SPEAKER_02]: come from a place of education.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're talking about being a male
centric.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do males transition better and
really empower if they have that ability
[SPEAKER_02]: to empower anyone to come up into this and
show a better kind of a better marketing
[SPEAKER_02]: tool that isn't just looked at as
disingenuous to say it's just about sex.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it's about being true to your
brand and to yourself and to your vision
[SPEAKER_07]: and then inspiring your people to join you
on that journey and defining what it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's my thought.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say you came back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Go on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would say, you know, to make sure that
you're you said that your staff is mostly
[SPEAKER_04]: female.
[SPEAKER_04]: But as you're talking about the
advertising play that you're going out and
[SPEAKER_04]: when you're doing your pamphlets and your
leaflets and everything that's going to
[SPEAKER_04]: touch that public facing that you have
women sitting at the table.
[SPEAKER_04]: With you on those things, being able to
have those conversations because there's
[SPEAKER_04]: some things that are that you'll read that
are different than how I'll read it,
[SPEAKER_04]: how I read it as a mother, how I read it
as a woman.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you do.
[SPEAKER_04]: I completely agree that you want to avoid
the idea of tokenism or, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: throwing those little bits out without
having a full, well rounded idea of being
[SPEAKER_04]: a female focused business.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would just say make as many females
welcome at that table and listen to them
[SPEAKER_04]: when they talk.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the key.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, and I think it's important to
mention that not all women have the same
[SPEAKER_03]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not all men have the same perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: And like, let's not divide ourselves
further.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like what you were saying, like it's
really conversation to conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, don't be afraid to ask questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: I find so many people fearful of asking me
about burlesque because they're ignorant
[SPEAKER_03]: to it and they're like shy about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so with anything, like I feel like as
long as you have a conversation with open
[SPEAKER_03]: ears and dialogue about it, it will only
benefit in general.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I came to Los Angeles, my patient
base was 19% female.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're currently at 63%, which I think is a
completely different switch than most
[SPEAKER_02]: dispensaries, not only in California,
but in the nation because I was a track.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to attract that demographics.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt they were underserved.
[SPEAKER_02]: I felt like there wasn't a safe place for
them to go to feel like their needs were
[SPEAKER_02]: being met.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so because I come from another
industry that is so female centric,
[SPEAKER_02]: it was like, well, I really wanted to
embody as much of that as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: But as you try to go outward of just my
four little walls and try to give like,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, they do all the marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, my management staff does all the
marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: They do all the graphic design stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We decide as a group, but it's mostly like
they have as much veto power as I do over
[SPEAKER_02]: what we have for marketing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can tell that they've pushed more
towards a medical model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now that isn't necessarily attracting this
kind of newer recreational user.
[SPEAKER_02]: It seems like it's attracting kind of an
older demographic because that's where
[SPEAKER_02]: they think it's the most respectable way
to come from a female to say, this is what
[SPEAKER_02]: they want.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we're also trying to bridge past this,
okay, females aren't just about fashion.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have needs of education.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have needs of kind of like,
so there's all these diverse needs.
[SPEAKER_02]: And even trying to get the females inside
of my own business to say, well,
[SPEAKER_02]: sometimes we do need to attract the
fashion side of things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sometimes we need to draw outside of just
this medical model so that we don't look
[SPEAKER_02]: disingenuous as a female run business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's kind of the balance I was trying
to create.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right.
[SPEAKER_07]: So we're just out of time.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what we're going to do is the
panelists, we're going to first,
[SPEAKER_07]: we're going to ask you to go onto the
Britannia deck after this.
[SPEAKER_07]: So if you have more questions for specific
people, they'll be out there.
[SPEAKER_07]: I want to point out that at three o'clock
is an awesome panel.
[SPEAKER_07]: On cannabis and fitness with real
luminaries.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're going to want to see it.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I just want to thank our panel for
their incredible insights and for being so
[SPEAKER_07]: awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: And for you for participating the way you
did.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
