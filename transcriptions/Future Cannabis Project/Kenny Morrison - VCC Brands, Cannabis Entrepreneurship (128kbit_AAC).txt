[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Kenny Morrison.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started the Venice Cookie Company in
2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came from, I was operating a retail
store, a couple different retail stores
[SPEAKER_00]: called The Pharmacy, and these are retail
stores for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're dispensaries, they're collectives.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just noticed that, you know,
one of the main things that attracted
[SPEAKER_00]: people when they came in the store was,
first of all, A, wow, I can buy cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: in a store now, and B, look at all the
other products it's in besides just raw
[SPEAKER_00]: flour, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: People could always go to their dealer and
find cannabis flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the new novelty and the thing that
really captured people's attention was all
[SPEAKER_00]: of the peripheral products, all the
infused products, that were now available.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it just became real clear that that was
going to be the growth area.
[SPEAKER_00]: We used The Pharmacy as our incubator
account to kind of do some basic market
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, see what works, what didn't work.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we used a couple other storefronts as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We started out as the Venice Cookie
Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started out with three products that
were three cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't really looked back and made
a cookie ever since.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've grown more into a beverage and a
chocolate company.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we, yeah, we started with a vegan
cookie, a normal product called a cookie
[SPEAKER_00]: brownie, which was essentially like a
tollhouse cookie recipe with white
[SPEAKER_00]: chocolate chips and butterscotch chips.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we made a peace crispy treat,
which was just a rice crispy treat.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I guess the way the products have
evolved over time is for one thing,
[SPEAKER_00]: they've gotten a lot smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2008, it was still a real big deal to
go into a store and buy a cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: activated food product, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So they happened to be, they tended to be
really large, sold in a clamshell
[SPEAKER_00]: container, you know, huge, full of
calories, look at me, look at what I have,
[SPEAKER_00]: look what I found, I got this at the
store.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as the novelties worn off over the
years and people rely on these products to
[SPEAKER_00]: take them every day for some sort of
medicinal or wellness effect, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: as the thrill wore off, as the novelty
wore off, they just want a product to be
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller and more compact, maybe more
discreet, you know, less calories,
[SPEAKER_00]: easier to consume, less of a chore to,
you know, take into your body every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: We source the raw material, we extract it,
we test the extract, we test the oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put it into the food products and we
test the products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're originally doing an ethanol
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using alcohol and a heating process
to make what's generally known as Rick
[SPEAKER_00]: Simpson oil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using that for our extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The problem with using alcohol as a
solvent is it pulls chlorophyll as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we were, and we were getting an oil
that was black.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like green food coloring in a
little tiny vial that looks black,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's really green.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the bitterness that you get from
chlorophyll just imparts a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: an extra taste we're trying to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we moved on to CO2 and other
extractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sell and distribute the products all
over the state of California, from the,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, right up against the Mexican
border all the way right up against the
[SPEAKER_00]: Oregon border.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you rely on distributors or do you
have direct relationships with all the
[SPEAKER_01]: dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_00]: We use our sales team.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have an internal sales team?
[SPEAKER_00]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been taking on for at least a couple
years now practically a new employee or
[SPEAKER_00]: two every month.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the growth of the company and the
expansion of the company has been pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: profound.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pretty significant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not much of an end in sight.
