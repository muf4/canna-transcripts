[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is ultimately a freedom of choice
issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so relevant to our lives in so many
ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm happy to see that the country has
finally grown up and the Supreme Court has
[SPEAKER_00]: ruled in a way that if two people love
each other regardless of their sex,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can get married.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a freedom of choice issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an issue largely of how tolerant we
want to be as a society towards people who
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing things that don't harm other
people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis fits into that conversation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gay marriage is part of that discourse.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's other ways of looking at the
issues and how it's relevant to society.
[SPEAKER_00]: There was a case where someone went
through the airport with $10,000 on a
[SPEAKER_00]: domestic flight and the TSA said that that
$10,000 in cash smelled like marijuana or
[SPEAKER_00]: the duffel bag that it was in smelled like
marijuana, so they seized that money from
[SPEAKER_00]: that guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Civil asset forfeiture allows you to take
money from people without filing any,
[SPEAKER_00]: without prosecuting and even getting a
conviction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a way for enforcement to fund
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's policing for profit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that's a big problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that trains law enforcement to
subconsciously disrespect our citizenry by
[SPEAKER_00]: seeing them as revenue streams and it
actually sets up the exact opposite
[SPEAKER_00]: scenario that enforcement was intended to
provide.
[SPEAKER_00]: Citizens aren't here to serve enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Enforcement's here to serve the citizens.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we've set up this thing where
enforcement views the average citizen as a
[SPEAKER_00]: revenue stream and that's just
fundamentally wrong on so many levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens with seizures if cannabis is
involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: That happens with just getting pulled over
and getting a seat belt ticket or a tail
[SPEAKER_00]: light being broken ticket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It creates a fundamental problem about how
enforcement views the citizen and
[SPEAKER_00]: consequently how the citizen views
enforcement.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyone with a Facebook account,
at least on my Facebook feed, it's just
[SPEAKER_00]: constantly filled with disrespectful
encounters amongst police.
[SPEAKER_00]: And citizens of all colors.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I want to use the cannabis issue
as a way to kind of continue the
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation about things that aren't
necessarily directly related to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's what people are
starting to realize is being involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: the cannabis industry, it's almost one of
the most profound forms of social
[SPEAKER_00]: entrepreneurialism currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we definitely do feel that we're
changing the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're having a direct effect on how people
perceive cannabis and tolerance and
[SPEAKER_00]: freedom of choice and the concept of
medicine and what we should and shouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to do with our lives.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, clearly I've devoted my life to
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got a lot of meaning to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
It's got a lot of meaning to me.
It's got a lot of meaning to me.
