[SPEAKER_00]: The stats are showing over just the last
seven years that the potency of cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: or the stuff that definitely the stuff
that both of us grew up with is
[SPEAKER_00]: substantially lower six, seven,
eight, nine percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now we're looking at twenty one,
twenty four.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, some of these Chernobyl and crazy
claims in the thirties, mid thirty
[SPEAKER_00]: percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your opinion of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because that's the one thing I've realized
is I thought, oh, yeah, it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: all the friends that I grew up with,
all my kind of surfer stoner buddies from
[SPEAKER_00]: from NorCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are going to want the higher,
more potent, the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then the fastest growing segment is
our generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the older Gen X.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a baby boomer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a silent generation that they don't
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They want to take something back up that
isn't alcohol, that isn't over the
[SPEAKER_00]: counter, that isn't prescription.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then all of a sudden they take one
puff and they're just like, that's
[SPEAKER_00]: equivalent of a whole joint.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any way to disrupt this race to
the top for the state specific?
[SPEAKER_01]: Potency is the crudest measure that we
have of the effect of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and and it's it's useful mainly for
THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And and in it back in those days that I
was talking about before we had cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: analytic analytics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was really the only thing that we
could do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now it's not so much a question of
stronger or weaker, more potent or less
[SPEAKER_01]: potent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a question of dialing in the
cannabinoid and terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one of the really interesting things
that we've learned now is that terpenes,
[SPEAKER_01]: right, terpenes are the elements,
the chemical compounds that give all,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything in the world that has a flavor
or a smell gets it from terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cinnamon, vanilla extract, all these
things, terpenes.
[SPEAKER_01]: So so what we've learned, though,
is that terpenes have profound synergistic
[SPEAKER_01]: effects with cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just a little bit of terpene can can
radically alter the therapeutic or
[SPEAKER_01]: subjective user effect of a particular
profile of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it used to be that we just talked about
stronger, weak cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But now we talk about CBD, THC.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're getting to the point now where we're
starting to talk about CBN, CBG.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And THCV.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking about a range of
cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think of those cannabinoids, CBD,
THC, CBG, THCV, that whole constellation
[SPEAKER_01]: of cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: As the engine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: That drives us forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about terpenes as the steering
wheel.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like so just a little bit of terpene,
one terpene or another can can really put
[SPEAKER_01]: your effect in a different direction.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is we can measure this
therapeutically.
[SPEAKER_01]: We believe it's also true with subjective
user effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not stronger or weaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, you know, where do you want to go
with it?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to take us years to develop
the science.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me caution consumers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you see a product and it has something
on it like calm or alert or something like
[SPEAKER_01]: that, don't believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not true.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no science yet.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: There will be one day we will be able to
associate specific cannabinoid and terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: profiles with specific therapeutic and
user experience effects.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're not there yet, but we're on the
verge of figuring it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's really that's an interesting
point because I feel that's a 2.0 to your
[SPEAKER_00]: point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know Mersin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know Lemony.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I know the terpenes that I like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So to your point, I'm not just looking at,
oh, this is 27 percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a bit much for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anything over the teens.
[SPEAKER_00]: Honestly, I don't, but more so looking at
the terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's so funny that people in this day
and you know it, you hear it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, what do you prefer?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you probably laugh when people ask
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Indica or sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're like, really?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, people ask me and I'm like,
can you really show me a true indica or a
[SPEAKER_00]: true sativa?
[SPEAKER_00]: But even that aside, not talking about
this or that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is your terpene profile that works
for your body?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like literally, what is the terpene
profile and the cannabinoid profile that
[SPEAKER_00]: fits you as an individual with your
endocannabinoid system versus because
[SPEAKER_00]: you're right, your comma.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a good example, Ed Rosenthal.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know you know Ed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jane and I were catching up and we were
talking about his stardust.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I love his stardust because in certain
situations I can't consume conventionally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Jane goes, hey, you know, Ed took care
of you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, I think Ed's always taking
care of me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just like, so you like it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, yeah, I do it with an herbal
tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: I do it with turmeric and ginger at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps me sleep.
[SPEAKER_00]: She goes, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: I use it in the morning and then I go on a
cleaning spree throughout the house.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a perfect example, I think,
to your point of don't say, oh,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, this product is alert for you and I,
or is calm for you and I, or is this for
[SPEAKER_00]: you and I, or that for you and I,
because it is very individual and we have
[SPEAKER_00]: to know our own respective profiles.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a psychedelic revolution that is
going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: And cannabis has become so mainstream that
sometimes we forget that cannabis is a
[SPEAKER_01]: psychedelic substance.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the things that it does is it
suppresses our default mode network in our
[SPEAKER_01]: brain, the thing that's always thinking
all the time and the regular straight kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of one after another kind of way,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And it helps us see a broader spectrum of
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, key to that experience, to any
psychedelic experience is set your
[SPEAKER_01]: mindset.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where are you inside you?
[SPEAKER_01]: How are you feeling?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on in your life?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you thinking about?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you, you know, what's going on?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, you stress, you happy, you sad,
like what are you setting yourself up for,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what environment are you in when
you are consuming that psychedelic
[SPEAKER_01]: substance, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And that set and setting are really
critically important, true with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we layer in the fact that like
every other kind of medicine, cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: interacts with an individual's own body
and our bodies vary, our endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: systems vary, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is one of the things I love about
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's this treasure chest that we will be
opening up and thinking about and figuring
[SPEAKER_01]: out for a long time to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much more to time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much more to come.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much more to come.
