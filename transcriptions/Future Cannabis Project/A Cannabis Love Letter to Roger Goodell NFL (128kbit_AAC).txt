[SPEAKER_00]: I wrote a letter to Roger Dale just
stating that, like I said, I'm a nerd,
[SPEAKER_00]: so I like to learn stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once I started learning and going
through all this information, I had some
[SPEAKER_00]: family members that were going through
chemotherapy, and I noticed the huge
[SPEAKER_00]: benefits of cannabis with chemotherapy and
cancer patients and helping relieve pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, well, if it can relieve pain for
cancer, then it can relieve pain for a guy
[SPEAKER_00]: that's coming off of an ACL injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the pain, it makes you
apprehensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you apprehensive, you play slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you play slower, you're more
susceptible to getting another injury.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they want you to play fast at a high
level without thinking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in order to do that, you have to
disregard your body pain receptors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I put all that in the letter,
stating to Roger Dale, this is the things
[SPEAKER_00]: that we preach in the locker room.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, play fast, play hard,
play smart.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't do that when you're
concentrating on your injuries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when you're taking all these
other drugs, it makes you lethargic.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you dull, sluggish, moody.
[SPEAKER_00]: Last thing you want is the quarterback to
be pissed off at you and moody,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then you're not getting the ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: You say something to him that he doesn't
like in the locker room, and you go out in
[SPEAKER_00]: the field, and now he's not throwing the
ball.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you wonder why, because he's pissed at
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why is he pissed at you?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: His hormones are off because he's taking
all these damn pain meds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm talking to Roger Dale and saying
that, you know, there's a huge issue with
[SPEAKER_00]: this.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the players are looking to fight
these pain problems they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of the alumni are suing the NFL
because of all the pain meds they took and
[SPEAKER_00]: all the steroid injections to give them
cortisone shots to their knees that just
[SPEAKER_00]: caused their knees to go out.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look at the older players,
they walk like the Frankenstein.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's sad to see that they didn't have
the same type of opportunities that we do
[SPEAKER_00]: now, as far as the medical science
involved with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that CBD is going to be the
lifesaver of the NFL when they start
[SPEAKER_00]: implementing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they did take it off the band
substance list now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So CBD is off the band substance list in
the NFL.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're able to take CBD, but it has to
be, I think, hemp-derived, a leaf,
[SPEAKER_00]: if I'm not mistaken.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the THC levels are still something
that they monitor in the NFL.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that once they learn that it's
less of a headache if you allow them to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke weed than if you take that away from
them, they resort to other ways of curing
[SPEAKER_00]: the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know there's a lot of athletes
that get control for DUIs because it's
[SPEAKER_00]: legal to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when your body hurts, you're just
going to drink a lot to dull the pain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then that alcohol stays in your system
the next day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the day after that, now your brain is
catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then your body is still catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you're going into another week of
pain, bringing the baggage from the week
[SPEAKER_00]: before.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that once they learn that
cannabis is the solution as far as helping
[SPEAKER_00]: your body, it's just better overall.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Roger Goodell didn't respond to me,
so I keep harassing him every time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every chance I get, Peter asked me to
come and speak about this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, put me on camera.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll mention it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's something that we've got to
put pressure on them to see that there are
[SPEAKER_00]: people that are advocating for it,
not because we're potheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what their favorite go-to is,
oh, we're potheads.
[SPEAKER_00]: Especially when Trump's like, oh,
it's a witch hunt.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, let's just get down to what it really
is.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that's going to help
everybody as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let's start learning about it,
talking about it, being more open about
[SPEAKER_00]: it, so that we can get the people that
need it the best help they can get that's
[SPEAKER_00]: out there on the market.
