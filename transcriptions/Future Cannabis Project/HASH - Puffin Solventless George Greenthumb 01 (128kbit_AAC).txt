[SPEAKER_02]: Making hats 10 years ago, always making
traditional bubble hats.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I ended up coming up with better ways
of processing my material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like all of these rods in here is dry
material.
[SPEAKER_02]: I only got one product in here that's
fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was the Tropicana Cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're welcome to look at all of these
right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: But my forte is dry material.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like processing live.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like squishing it more.
[SPEAKER_02]: The squishability on live is great.
[SPEAKER_02]: You pull like 80% on your squishes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Fresh frozen live rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: The last one I did was the Tropicana
Cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was a hard wash because the nugs were
ice cubes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You had a saturation time.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to soak them up so they can open
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't want to beat them to make
contaminations.
[SPEAKER_02]: So ultimately I only pulled 3% on the
wash.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can't use the entire plant.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can just use your tops.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of this except for the Tropicana is
all trim material.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dry, cured trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I said, I like doing the processing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I cut the whole plant down.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything except for major stalks.
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe some waterleaf.
[SPEAKER_04]: Big waterleaf that's purple.
[SPEAKER_04]: Any leaf that looks like it has any frost.
[SPEAKER_04]: You'll notice that on the dry material
when you wash, you'll get all the actual
[SPEAKER_04]: stalks of your heads too.
[SPEAKER_04]: You won't get those on the fresh frozen at
all.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll all stay on the plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's actually trippy because you hold
these nugs that look like they're still
[SPEAKER_04]: covered in crystals and there's nothing on
them.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is there any difference?
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys are all growing inside.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not true.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean both.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inside and outside.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two totally different mediums too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Outside I'm in a greenhouse with soil and
no till garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: Inside rock wool and salts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's all we do is indoor rock wool and
salts.
[SPEAKER_06]: So interesting.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I used to go up north and visit with
the farmers up there where they were being
[SPEAKER_06]: taught how to harvest their plants for
live resin.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were being taught to harvest like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were all outdoor.
[SPEAKER_06]: They would be harvested before the sun
came up.
[SPEAKER_06]: They were still cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just a helpful thing because the
colder the plant is, the easier it is to
[SPEAKER_04]: cut it down.
[SPEAKER_04]: In all reality, I don't think you're going
to make much of a difference in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might even be heavier.
[SPEAKER_04]: It might even be heavier because you're
going to be a little more water and more
[SPEAKER_04]: moisture.
[SPEAKER_02]: So your percentages are going to be harder
to pull when you've got someone who
[SPEAKER_02]: watered the night that they cut.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to have a higher water
content compared to somebody who does a
[SPEAKER_02]: dry back for two days and cuts.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every single plant that I'm cutting down
and turning to fresh frozen has been
[SPEAKER_04]: starved for two days.
[SPEAKER_04]: Two or three days from water at least.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I guess my question is, is there any
difference in any way between the
[SPEAKER_06]: different parts of the plant?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, of course.
[SPEAKER_04]: The bottoms are going to come out
different than the tops.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to get more.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've done like a test wash.
[SPEAKER_04]: He actually brought up a test wash that I
did recently where I just do like a mason
[SPEAKER_04]: jar of 10 fresh frozen grams, which would
normally be like two, two and a half once
[SPEAKER_04]: dried.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I just shake the shit out of it
in the jar with ice and water.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I set it on the table and let it
sit for like a minute and pick it up and
[SPEAKER_04]: look at the bottom.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've done a plant that was the same
strain, but stunted.
[SPEAKER_04]: It didn't grow well and there was no,
no yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then the plant in the back that was
super good and you grab a nice cola,
[SPEAKER_04]: then you shake it and it's a complete
different outcome.
[SPEAKER_04]: So of course the different, you know,
you know, tops of the plant versus the
[SPEAKER_04]: bottom are going to be a little different,
but if you grow proper, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: indoor, usually you're not going to have
too many bottoms or what they call larf.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Or whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, so.
[SPEAKER_06]: And is it the point is to like harvest,
like, so you get the, like the red,
[SPEAKER_06]: you have to get the most resident.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: You want your resin to be like you,
cause you just want the head.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want the stock.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the heads definitely get to a,
so you want it full.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But they also explode.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you have to be like careful of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you also don't want to freeze it too
much because sometimes freezing it will
[SPEAKER_04]: allow it to explode.
[SPEAKER_04]: But you lose it when it explodes.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's just, it comes out differently
through the bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause you're using those micron bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your bags get gummed up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, and that's the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's, that's gummy bags is the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you call temps make a huge
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, two, three degree temperatures,
you're gumming up.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I've also had the other hand
where like some hash is so good,
[SPEAKER_04]: even in a 65 degree room, it's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's completely fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I've had other hash where it's
like 50 degrees in the room and you touch
[SPEAKER_04]: it and it just turns to glue.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's all the, yeah, it's, it's how you
grow it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's making sure you're taking care of it,
making sure you're not spraying your
[SPEAKER_04]: plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: The more, if you're spraying your plant,
you're going to really ruin some,
[SPEAKER_04]: some heads and on your, almost your entire
product is not going to come out anywhere
[SPEAKER_04]: near as good as someone who doesn't spray.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the worst.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of farmers don't want to be
straightforward.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they hand you the product like,
Oh, Hey man, do me this huge favor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, let's make all this great hash
together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they give you a booth product
because they've been spraying.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll smell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll be like, Oh cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see you guys are using plant therapy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the, the healthy organic spray,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, I knew it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I asked you guys, are you guys
spraying anything?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they'll say no, because it's organic.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't think it like, I'm like,
I honestly, I don't agree with spraying
[SPEAKER_04]: H2O or like a high like hydrogen peroxide,
even on your plants, like any water,
[SPEAKER_04]: anything in my opinion is not good for
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you have humidity control.
[SPEAKER_02]: You monitor your humidity, your VPD.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have a person that knows how to
default your defoliation is number one.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you guys are on the same page.
[SPEAKER_06]: Definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when you do it for longer,
you learn what works and what doesn't.
[SPEAKER_02]: That hash starts in the nursery,
the genetics.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the phenol hunting, the seed popping,
the networking of trading cuts and
[SPEAKER_02]: fighting the right genetics starts in the
nursery.
[SPEAKER_02]: What happens, how you feed it,
how you treat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: How soon do you send it off to flower?
[SPEAKER_02]: How mature is your plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you spraying something on it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Each plant matures differently.
[SPEAKER_02]: So GMOs, 70 days straight for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you guys would be perfect to run this
by.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was talking to Sunshine Johnson once,
you know, she's a, she's a dry farmer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And she supplies for Nasha, you know,
that brand.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they had a long relationship and she
had suggested an article called The Grower
[SPEAKER_06]: and the Hashmaker.
[SPEAKER_06]: And there's like a lot of people in this
industry where there's like really close
[SPEAKER_06]: relationships between the growers.
[SPEAKER_04]: I won't even buy any type or run any type
of flower that I'm not in the room able to
[SPEAKER_04]: look at.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that relationship is really important.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look at it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to go into these grow rooms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I, we operate.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's going to start to glow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you're, if you're, if you're,
if you're, yeah, wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wait, wait, wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it going to blink?
[SPEAKER_02]: And I understand what you're saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're having to go in your own,
we are, you'll see this turn orange.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't walk in our room unless we have
to.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've got some kush mints on the flower and
I put a Mac Ross in my 90U that I pressed
[SPEAKER_02]: today.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: We even grow the same.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is dope.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: I smoke a lot of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I smoke bong.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would use some of my bong all day long.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'm about to go buy one.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think dementia.
[SPEAKER_02]: We got buddies over.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I get my 1130 from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been shopping in dementia since I was
16.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're in the neighborhood, bro.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know Mike.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know, I know.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are you saying Joel, the old glassblower?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's my homie, dude.
[SPEAKER_03]: We flexed all day long, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: Josh D all of them, bro.
[SPEAKER_02]: And Josh, like he comes over and he's my R
and D guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was like, Josh, bro, I just pressed some
shit, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need your opinion.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now they, I mean that used to be like the
managers and shit of dementia.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're all just the growers in the Valley
now that are bad ass and been doing this
[SPEAKER_04]: for years.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're fucking good.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I get his opinion.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tell me what you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll sit there and we'll find like
mystery strains and we'll balance it.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think he's taste?
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got a great palette.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, he, he smoked a lot of different
strains where you can, and he can recall
[SPEAKER_02]: them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who does?
[SPEAKER_02]: Our mutual friend Joel.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's a glassblower.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's also one of the right hand man's of
Josh D.
[SPEAKER_02]: He was a big part of Josh D's legend.
[SPEAKER_03]: So he's been around a long time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Early nineties.
[SPEAKER_02]: They were the ones who brought the OG
Kush.
[SPEAKER_02]: They brought it to Dr. Green thumb.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have the same cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: We call it the Hollywood OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody calls it their own thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all share the same shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: It goes to the dynasty.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're so similar.
[SPEAKER_02]: They run them at Josh D's over there in
Carpinteria still.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's what we did.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you, you find a fire cut and you
pack them in pounds of $5,000,
[SPEAKER_02]: $6,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: We used to make real money on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right.
[SPEAKER_04]: I forgot a whole bunch of crap that I
thought I brought, but I thought I had the
[SPEAKER_04]: temperature.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was trying to hurry up and get over
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I ended up forgetting a few more
things than I wanted.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was pressing.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I can show you the difference between
live pressed and regular.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is the, this was my live fresh
frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is my first time running.
[SPEAKER_02]: Real quality nugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't get the opportunity to
process fire nugs, fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where can I go?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I go over here?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Tropicana.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I only ran a half pound.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, well, it was a thousand grams.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy, it was a small garden,
you know, and he's a thousand grams wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So he's telling me it's roughly estimated
close to a half pound, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: A fresh frozen pound should be 2250.
[SPEAKER_04]: 2250.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, this is smaller than that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So 1,000 is smaller than half.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just under.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then, then that could help my numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause maybe it is three and a half
percent.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, I still base it on a thousand though.
[SPEAKER_02]: So even though I only pulled 30 grams of
pressable hash, I don't count my 160.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't count.
[SPEAKER_02]: I throw that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my check.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is your, uh, your full spec that
you're pulling?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, that you like to.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's new material, I'm not going to
just do what I normally do to my other
[SPEAKER_02]: material that I know already.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm going to throw all my bags in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to throw all my bags in.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to wash one unit and I want to
see what you mean.
[SPEAKER_02]: If it's something you've never done
before.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to find the meat.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody talks the 90U.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, where's the 73?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't do anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a complete opposite hash maker.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm a full spectrum dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always been full spec'd until like a
year or two ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, anybody tells me different.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't want to buy my hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's completely.
[SPEAKER_04]: Fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know what I'm doing and I know I make a
great product and I am not hurting for
[SPEAKER_04]: customers.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you talking about here?
[SPEAKER_04]: What is, what is different from your hash?
[SPEAKER_04]: It's an actual, it's actually a very,
you know, good discussion because not too
[SPEAKER_04]: many people are talking about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the ones that are like, it's vague.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing set in stone as to what
full spectrum actually means.
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now the guy that I took most of my stuff
from, which was superior solvent lists,
[SPEAKER_04]: he, what he calls full spectrum is 25 all
the way up to 219.
[SPEAKER_04]: 25.
[SPEAKER_04]: Micron.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Micron all the way up to 219.
[SPEAKER_04]: And now a lot of people would not put
those in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: However, when I run stuff that is so good,
there's nothing in my 219.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's nothing in my 220.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it doesn't matter that he is throwing
it all in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, I understand why he's like,
no, you pull the whole thing, but it's so
[SPEAKER_04]: little on a good quality product that it's
almost not necessary.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happens with a mediocre quality
product?
[SPEAKER_04]: I set it aside and I'll like stack a jar
of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I'll kind of mix it together.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll press it and then I'll turn it to
edibles.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what it's the freebie,
you know, when the homies come over.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's, it's either, I call it either
trashish pretty much.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, if it's not pressable and like,
like he said, uh, it's all on how you do
[SPEAKER_02]: your wash though, because everybody does
their washes different.
[SPEAKER_02]: Everybody says, Oh, you should do,
you know, eight washes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I used to do eight washes.
[SPEAKER_04]: When my every stream is different,
I can wash eight washes on a certain
[SPEAKER_04]: strain and it's fine.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wash four on another one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's already turning green and
chlorophyll.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you're like, okay, can't go any
further.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the Keats, in my experience,
working with material is you're fighting
[SPEAKER_02]: against the, the, the agitation,
uh, the breaking down the material,
[SPEAKER_02]: the chloroform, all of those things are
going to create contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my thought process is do it as fast as
possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hurry up and get your wash done.
[SPEAKER_02]: So with the different techniques and
different analyzations, I've managed to
[SPEAKER_02]: only have to do two washes and I do two,
five minutes, five minutes, five minutes,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I don't do the dumps.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's, that's a standard process for
you.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's my dry material.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to treat my dry material this way
because dry material is easier to fall
[SPEAKER_02]: apart.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier to degrade.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's easier to not make your rising come
out white.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: If you want to have a beautiful,
you can't have the contaminations,
[SPEAKER_02]: but you also don't want to lose your
yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my whole thing is like, okay,
I need to improve my quality and I want to
[SPEAKER_02]: improve my yield.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, and therefore I need to decrease my
agitation, but do certain things to pull
[SPEAKER_02]: these heads off as fast as possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you use for your agitation?
I use wash bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I use wash machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have four RV washers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a Madea big washer that's
equivalent to like three of the little RV
[SPEAKER_02]: washers.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's better to have like a better,
more sensitive like surface.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're going to use dry material,
does all of that matter?
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're in a bag, it's not going to be
scraping.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, it's not scraping.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's not going to cause more damage,
more or less damage.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I only wash by hand and I also don't
feed by any pumps.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everybody else usually has like a washer
like he does where there's a pump that
[SPEAKER_04]: feeds the water somewhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything that I do is gravity fed.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have pulleys in my room where I pull the
bag to the ceiling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did you build this system yourself?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use a deer carcass hoist.
[SPEAKER_04]: I bought it off Amazon.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was just like, what is going to hold 300
pounds of water and ice?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you do it differently or did someone
teach you this process?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I've just kind of, I evolved over like
watching what was on the internet.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's no fricking information out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: No one wants to give you any info.
[SPEAKER_04]: So do other people use gravity?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's their traditional way where you
hang the bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: The traditional way is you hang the bag.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why you got the rope.
[SPEAKER_04]: You hang the bag and you wash it by hand
because Bubble Bags is who I watched do it
[SPEAKER_04]: in Amsterdam and he had the drill gun and
he literally held the bag up and shut the
shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: They used to tie them off on poles and let
them drip.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's exactly how I do it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do I have a hook?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, that takes forever.
[SPEAKER_02]: That takes a second forever.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also don't like to have any hash loss to
pumps in a pipe and I don't know if
[SPEAKER_04]: there's any oil in a pump that's being
used.
[SPEAKER_04]: I definitely don't want to run your stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only thing I'm pumping is my raw water
when my RO comes through my pump because
[SPEAKER_02]: it's a 300 gallon RO tank.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to pump that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have that being pumped, which is my
clean water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have my waste.
[SPEAKER_06]: You do, you don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I've done dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: This was washed dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: What's the most important quality you're
going for?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like what do you mean like in regards to
preservation?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like is it like when I walk into a room,
what am I looking for?
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it the purest end product?
[SPEAKER_02]: My idea is I want to capture the true
essence of the flower without the
[SPEAKER_02]: carcinogenic plant leaf material.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I want a true representation of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's rinsing it all out.
[SPEAKER_04]: If we're doing it right, it's already
pure.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you have like cats wandering around
your room with hair everywhere.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the only way you're not rinsing it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Think about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't understand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, he's rinsing.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then it goes into another filtration
bag, through another filtration bag,
[SPEAKER_04]: through another.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you have your hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you put it in another filtration bag
and then you press it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have no idea how many different seeds
it's going through until it's getting into
[SPEAKER_04]: my jar.
[SPEAKER_02]: For example, this Kush Mints was,
this is my biggest dumper, Kush Mints.
[SPEAKER_02]: It blew my mind on how this one put out.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is some of the best hash I've ever
made right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it this one?
[SPEAKER_02]: This is a different texture of the Kush
Mints.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here's a version of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there a dabber that we have anywhere?
[SPEAKER_04]: Metal dabber?
[SPEAKER_02]: Good question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, I just lost my train of thought.
[SPEAKER_02]: What were we talking about?
[SPEAKER_06]: What were we trying to do with this?
[SPEAKER_06]: We were talking about the rinsing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just how many filtration bags is there?
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, right, right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So on the Kush Mints, that one,
again, I used to do full spec.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a believer of this full spec.
[SPEAKER_02]: I still believe in light for my personal
consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I am not the person buying my rosin.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have to remember that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have to pay attention to what they
want.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it may be against what I believe.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: My definition of full spec would not be
what his would be.
[SPEAKER_02]: My full definition of a full spec would be
first, run every single bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we're making bubble hash, that's a
different collection.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to choose different qualities in
that case.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm making rosin, I'm looking for
certain qualities in that hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's, I don't want floof.
[SPEAKER_02]: I call the stocks floof.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I don't want floof.
[SPEAKER_04]: They also screw up your freeze dryer,
too.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessary.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't make your end quality product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're straws.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're empty straws.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're floof.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's empty taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you pull it all, you can get a pile
of it, put it on bags and squish it,
[SPEAKER_04]: and you get like nothing comes out.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you know that there's nothing in there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's this freaking floof contamination.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your yields go down.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this Kush Mints, best one ever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, I generally pull pressable hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: My goal as a keeper is 15% to 20%.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to ever.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's three to four wet weight.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, he knows wet numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's where I have a hard time
processing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Which is perfect, which is what you want.
[SPEAKER_04]: And anything more is just massive icing on
the cake.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where I have like an outdoor GMO that I
run.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, outdoor, but greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's sunlight driven.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it has indoor, you know, where I'm
removing the elements.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's pumping like seven and a half
percent, which is insane, which would be
[SPEAKER_04]: like fresh frozen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, which would literally be like 36%
return, which is like impossible.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do the math in your head.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, how does this, this nub right
here, 33% of that nub is all crystal.
[SPEAKER_04]: How the fuck is that even possible?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like maybe you do it in your head.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like there's no way.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then it does it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's some, there's some strains that
just crush.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is it strain specific?
[SPEAKER_04]: Very strain specific.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've also noticed soil and sun really
have a major factor on it, especially on
[SPEAKER_04]: the time of the year that you're growing
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a huge difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Your environmental conditions completely.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you've got your room hot, it's just
like the sun is hot.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're going to have melty heads.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're not going to have the most peak
performing strikes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, outdoor farmers have a tougher
challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: Outdoor hashishians that process.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if it's very outdoor because
you get dust, bugs.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's other processes that you need to
do prior to washing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You've got to wash your material so you
can wash it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Literally.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, everybody.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the air.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I got my hats off to the, to the guys
who, who process outdoor material.
[SPEAKER_02]: And bring the fire because that is a
challenge in itself where I'm fortunate
[SPEAKER_02]: where the indoor material, the doors are
closed.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not allowed to walk in there unless
we're supposed to be doing something in
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's how you, you know, you keep a
facility and the.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's called a controlled environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's exactly what I was going to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because if you open that door,
everything changes.
[SPEAKER_02]: The air evacuates, CO2 evacuates,
temperature rise, humidity changes,
[SPEAKER_02]: that hot air comes through.
[SPEAKER_02]: Boom, boom, everything's off for the next
three, four hours.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to minimize that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And people don't realize that they want to
bring their homies in and I get invited to
[SPEAKER_02]: other facilities and they're, they're like
open doors.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm like, no, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, you don't know where I've been.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't want to take in any bugs.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I just came from the street.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't even change.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like a lot of grow rooms of different
sizes.
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you think is the best size?
[SPEAKER_06]: The size that you can handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on what you can handle.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more you have the, the, the more
details, the more things are going to go
[SPEAKER_02]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it just depends on what can you handle?
[SPEAKER_04]: In my opinion, for one person,
no more than 20 lights, 20,000 watts.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's for one guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what you're doing.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to have mistakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're going to be tied to that garden.
[SPEAKER_04]: You better even be good with 20,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: No vacations.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your homies like, yo, we're going to go
fishing.
Nope.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I have a resi to change.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have the fucking deal.
[SPEAKER_02]: You are a slave to that garden.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: At that rate.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as soon as you leave, something
floods.
[SPEAKER_02]: As soon as you leave.
[SPEAKER_02]: Light goes out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I left the RO on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in the car and you just turn
around.
[SPEAKER_01]: My RO takes still over close cause the
stupid thing won't close and it just
[SPEAKER_01]: slowly drips.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then finally I piped it to the drain.
[SPEAKER_06]: When you go to the trade shows now,
all you see are these like cool automated
[SPEAKER_06]: systems they're selling that you can use
from your phone.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nothing is, nothing is more reliable than
being there and doing it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those things can work, but you got to
monitor them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They will work as long as somebody's there
to fix them when they're not.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause they do the job, but corrosion
happens.
[SPEAKER_02]: Things get caught in the line,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Want to try this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about lights?
[SPEAKER_02]: Lights.
[SPEAKER_06]: What about lights?
[SPEAKER_06]: What about them?
[SPEAKER_06]: What do you like to eat?
[SPEAKER_06]: It is.
[SPEAKER_04]: For indoor?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm old school dude.
[SPEAKER_04]: Old Horty Luxus.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, everyone's now with the Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_04]: The thousand watt Hortys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that ready?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or we got to heat her up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I got to use this thing, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to try it or just use that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But get it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you're already working on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sweet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It all depends on your, your.
[SPEAKER_04]: A taller ceiling.
[SPEAKER_04]: Usually it works a little better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I personally based on, who I get to work
with, I don't even have the desire to grow
[SPEAKER_02]: at home because the level that I'm able to
see these guys perform at, it just like,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's like, why even try?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like in my eyes, because I'm lucky enough
to be a part of this facility every day
[SPEAKER_02]: where I feel.
[SPEAKER_04]: Might as well make the best hatch rather
than put in the effort.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, not only that, I get my grow fixed
by being a part of their facility.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, I don't need a f*****
headache at home.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it allows me to dedicate more of my
time to my craft and my growing,
[SPEAKER_02]: which if I weren't in that position,
then yeah, I'd want to definitely grow
[SPEAKER_02]: like I've always grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: Go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Might be a little low, but we'll see.
[SPEAKER_06]: You guys have beaks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's right there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's charging.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy's dude.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you call this one?
[SPEAKER_03]: It was watermelon OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yum.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that grape stomper is absolutely some
of the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to do something to break it
without being on the pad there.
[SPEAKER_04]: How was it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Tastes good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it hit nice too.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not a big dabber.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, I tell you, I only do dabs to
test my product, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_02]: and also to enjoy with friends.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like a social thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm not a, I don't have my own peak.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have, I have my own dad rig,
but again, I only use it to test it so
[SPEAKER_02]: people can.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that way I know if there's any
contaminations in my product.
[SPEAKER_06]: So what's your favorite method of
consumption?
[SPEAKER_02]: What we just had, I had a snake in here.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I prefer putting my hash back with the
flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that combo.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also will top just about every bowl I
smoke, whether it's a bong or a pipe,
[SPEAKER_02]: it gets a little piece around.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's why I prefer my type of texture
versus the jar tech, which applies heat
[SPEAKER_02]: and makes it all gummy.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's so important.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you guys could talk about texture.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can you speak more on growing for the
melt?
[SPEAKER_05]: One of the main, one of the main reasons I
follow you all is I'm on the East coast
[SPEAKER_05]: where we don't have good melt knowledge.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what's the question regarding melt?
[SPEAKER_05]: I think growing for melt, like maybe what
genetics you like to grow for.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's very strain dependent, you know,
for good melts.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of those, the stuff that pumps is
much better with the melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: The GMO is really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: The cookies and cream stuff, the straw
Nana stuff is really good, but you have
[SPEAKER_04]: to, once you grow it, wherever you're at,
that's when you have to do your tests that
[SPEAKER_04]: he's talking about.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to break down all those bags and
actually do a test of each head to see
[SPEAKER_04]: which one melts the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: And people think, oh, well, the first wash
is always the best.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, that's not true.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sometimes the first wash, you're getting a
lot of dirt because you are washing your
[SPEAKER_04]: plant.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're, you're, you're cleaning a lot of
crap off.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just been built up.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's dust.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every room you go in, in every house,
it builds up.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_04]: So sometimes I feel the second and third
wash are really good, really high quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: The third can jump, used to be my dumper
when I, when I washed three times on a
[SPEAKER_02]: regular, my third was my dumper,
but my number two is my dumper.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Number one, number two.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a, it's, it's, I mean, if I wouldn't
grow for, for melt, I would grow for what
[SPEAKER_04]: you desire taste.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then you can figure out your melt.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can figure out which ones you want to
choose to, you know, go down that path in
[SPEAKER_04]: that, when that happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want this strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want, you know, straw Nana or whatever
the case may be.
[SPEAKER_04]: But like, I haven't seen, there's not much
melt out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's like OG, you know, there's no OG's
that really, there's not a big wash
[SPEAKER_02]: washable strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have like the old school, the OG rascal
wifi cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this thing pumps for wifi for an OG.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it actually smells like OG and does
well and is white.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of the few OG strains that comes
through and you're like, okay,
[SPEAKER_04]: cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's OG and it's still hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: Actually, here's an OG.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just happened to have it in there and
you got to open it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like give it the world.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And my buddy grows OG and he gave me a
pound of trim and same thing wash it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Want to see what it do?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what comes up?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we still have to look at what you said
was the best hash you made.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's yeah, that's like, you know,
you sometimes you just go into a room and
[SPEAKER_04]: you get lucky with a strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's got that sour bite.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like make sure your salivary glands.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just was probably one of the best
terpenes that I've ever had come out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, like, okay, the plant smelled
like that and you wash it and it just
[SPEAKER_04]: smells even better than the plant did.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what you're trying to capture.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're trying to capture the essence of
that plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when there's other things sprayed
on that plant, it comes out stronger.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, that extra.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you'll get a bad taste in the back of
your throat.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like almost immediately if someone's
spraying their plant and you're going to
[SPEAKER_04]: turn it into hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that the only one that doesn't have a
sticker?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the wifi one.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it's a wifi.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's only one that doesn't have a
sticker and that's the alien rock candy,
[SPEAKER_04]: which only pumped like 2%.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like your packaging.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's dope.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then what's this one?
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a label maker, brother label maker.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it fits your jar perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it fits the jar real good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where do you get your jars from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sticker plug.
[SPEAKER_04]: What?
[SPEAKER_04]: Sticker plug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sticker plug.
[SPEAKER_04]: He orders them from Germany.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're actually like the Myron.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're not just painted glass.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's the real deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: The actual glass is that color.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're more expensive than any jar I use.
[SPEAKER_04]: It sucks.
[SPEAKER_04]: My bigger jars, my big ball jars are
cheap.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cheaper than these.
[SPEAKER_04]: My big ball jars with the metal cap and
everything are literally like 60 cents
[SPEAKER_04]: cheaper each.
[SPEAKER_04]: They keep the sunlight out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the benefit of those.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they're extremely.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all his.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, the little Myron.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are all different flavors.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have the clear bottom ones.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's so they it's cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't buy them.
[SPEAKER_02]: They actually just they come to me.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's that nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not that I get them for free.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm just saying that I don't go out and
get them.
[SPEAKER_04]: I could order them, but they're so damn
expensive unless you order 10,000.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he orders the 10K and then I get a
little bit of a cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is extraordinary.
[SPEAKER_06]: So this one that turned out like this,
how many washes?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's five washes, I believe,
and it's all five.
[SPEAKER_04]: Five washes.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's not just first or anything.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's full spec.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all five washes.
[SPEAKER_04]: 40 you to 179.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is what I was actually using.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use ice extracts.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I like I thought because they
have like the different numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I'm like, yeah, he's got the
nice like.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I can.
[SPEAKER_04]: I also have like a 104 bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're they're really nice and they hold
up really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've probably done like 500 washes of them
and they look like the dab on really.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, yeah, I really highly recommend the
ice extracts bags.
[SPEAKER_04]: Are you just doing a natural cold cure?
[SPEAKER_04]: I I press very hot, though people trip on
how hot I press.
[SPEAKER_04]: I press at 224, 224 degrees and direct
into a jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once I press direct into a jar,
whatever is left on the paper,
[SPEAKER_04]: which isn't much because I have a pretty
good funnel flows.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just throw into the top of the jar,
put the lid on and I set it in a dark room
[SPEAKER_04]: for like three days to three.
[SPEAKER_06]: Why does that seem like it would be too
hot because it would evaporate?
[SPEAKER_04]: People think that you're burning it or
it's going to ruin it.
[SPEAKER_04]: But if you watch any one of my live
videos, you can watch one from today.
[SPEAKER_04]: If you go on my on my Instagram,
I was like I said, I was pressing right
[SPEAKER_04]: before I got here.
[SPEAKER_04]: I pressed at 225, 224, whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was piss yellow.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, this is why does you want it?
[SPEAKER_02]: What?
[SPEAKER_02]: How many grams are you going in on your
puck?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I do like 22 gram bags and then I do
like four to six of them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can even do that goes into one jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that all go into one jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't I try not to do more than 100
grams at a time because then it won't fit
[SPEAKER_04]: in the jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll actually like start to muffin up so
crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: You kind of got to like jiggle it down a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like 90 is about what you want to do at
the most.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I just jar on the lid and I set
it in a dark room that's a little bit
[SPEAKER_04]: warmer because I for some reason I have
this closet that has my water heater in
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it stays at about 80 to degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just put it on a wood shelf.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's not like on metal where it's
getting hot and cold, hot and cold wood.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that content would a thick piece of
wood takes longer to change temperatures.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much will be in this jar?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like 60 to 80 grams and then like two or
three days.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then depending on consistency,
like I have this gnarly tool that I just
[SPEAKER_04]: beat the living hell out of it with.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I just twist it up and smash it and go
over and over again.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_06]: How long does it sit in the room?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like two to three days.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can sort of see it start to do like a
little bit of a change and it'll almost
[SPEAKER_04]: like separate itself from the jar.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there'll be like white flaky lines
towards the bottom and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you just know, okay, it's good to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it'll usually build up a little
pressure.
[SPEAKER_04]: And when you crack them, it's like,
okay, cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been doing its thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's fermenting, it's rotting.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's eating itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: The turps are literally a solvent.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's doing what it's supposed to.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's getting juicier.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's usually where like I'll just
store my stuff anyway.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like you couldn't build that room.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just something that you just get
lucky.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I bet you figured that out by just
playing with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just screwing with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've asked a million people,
hey, how do you do this?
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've tried the other way where people
throw it in the oven at like 200 degrees
[SPEAKER_04]: and let it cook down in the oven.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then right when they're supposed to
pull it out and whip it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, screw that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not heating my stuff back up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not putting it in through anything
like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not even setting it on a heat mat at
100 degrees.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to put it in that room,
let it sit, do its thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It makes sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I beat the hell out of it to the
point where it becomes like super gooey
[SPEAKER_04]: and super wet.
[SPEAKER_06]: If anything would cook it, it seems like
it would be that other process.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Putting it in the oven.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of people are all about that for
a minute.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they like that consistency.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like he said, sometimes you have to do
what your customers are asking.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was telling them, you're wrong.
[SPEAKER_04]: This is not the way to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We shouldn't be putting it in the damn
oven.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're like, just do it and I'll buy
it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: God damn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: All right, whatever.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is it like shatter or something?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it just like turns it gooier.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the consistency of mine right now
is the easiest way to dab.
[SPEAKER_04]: The easiest way to get it on a dabber and
stays on the dabber.
[SPEAKER_05]: Would you like to demonstrate it?
[SPEAKER_05]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I want to do some of the grape stomper
because I really haven't seen any.
[SPEAKER_04]: I certainly haven't been posting much of
this information.
[SPEAKER_04]: Literally as soon as I knew, as soon as I
made it, it was going to go so.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, so you can just kind of get a
good dab of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you can easily do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can break it in half.
[SPEAKER_04]: It stays on there.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can even wipe it off with your finger
if you don't want to press it on to the to
[SPEAKER_04]: the banger itself.
[SPEAKER_06]: Is your is your peak ready?
[SPEAKER_06]: Let's take a look at that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does it have the surround?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just don't like ceramic.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've never been a ceramic.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's really good.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's just that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I just don't like the way it tastes,
really.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, I think coarse tastes the best
for for high quality dab like this.
[SPEAKER_06]: Does that mean it doesn't would mean it
doesn't have one like that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you don't want anything getting in
the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's personal preference.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like the owner of Puffco would call
me crazy because they don't.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: He would be like, what are you talking
about?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because he only uses his ceramic one.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'm it's a thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm coarse.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been for a while.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm courts only.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, that's just I feel like what has a
taste or is it that it does?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I think quartz has virtually no taste
as the purest way to smoke anything on top
[SPEAKER_04]: of.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, come on.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was I was smoking weed out of a can in
high school.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's not let's not talk about semantics
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I mean, I was collecting rosin
inside the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Remember the fucking resin, dude?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: With the metal pipe, you put your weed
inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: You smoke through your nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are the dumbest kids in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: It got ripped.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the 90s.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were making concentrates in our little
metal pipes.
[SPEAKER_04]: I used to buy weed out of a tire,
you know, in San Diego.
[SPEAKER_04]: It would smuggle it in tires from Mexico.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it was literally in the tire and we
would chip it out of the tire and they
[SPEAKER_04]: would sell it to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then it would be like lizards in it and
bees and stems and sticks.
[SPEAKER_02]: They got in the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: We smoked all that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't care.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were just like, let's get high.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you think all these crazy names
come from?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was smoking all the crazy shit back in
the back in the day.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Did this charge at all?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, damn it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I thought it was charging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, you guys want to try one of these?
[SPEAKER_02]: Give it a go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's see here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's start off with the Mac.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, definitely.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Mac dry trim material.
[SPEAKER_02]: The reason I started pulling the 90U,
I started with the Mac.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was my first experiment because
before that, before I started pulling
[SPEAKER_02]: different bags and paying closer attention
to my head sizes and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: My full spec, you asked me earlier,
would have been the, what is it,
[SPEAKER_02]: 140, sorry, let me just remember 160.
[SPEAKER_02]: Basically the 160, so 159 to your 45.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't really get much in my 25,
but all the little broken plant material
[SPEAKER_02]: that got through everything else,
I used to save it and now it just slows
[SPEAKER_02]: down my drain.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it just slows the process.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't even have a 25 bag.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mine's 40 and then goes straight to my,
and all my plants that are my greenhouse
[SPEAKER_04]: plants get watered with my wash water.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's nutrition right there.
[SPEAKER_02]: That same nutrients that you're feeding,
that's what you're washing out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what's coming out, those
anti-cyanids.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you just recycle that water and put it
out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's RO water, so I know it's clean.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's nutrient water.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it tastes like weed and it smells like
weed.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just don't pour it in there immediately
because it's really cold.
[SPEAKER_04]: So give it a day to warm up and then leave
it in a bucket and then dump it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And man, that stuff stinks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Let me tell you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it is loud.
[SPEAKER_04]: Your whole backyard will be like,
the neighbors are just like, thank God I
[SPEAKER_04]: got skunks in the neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_04]: I swear to you, there's a skunk hit on my
street like every other day.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's times where I'm just like
sitting in my house, not doing anything
[SPEAKER_04]: and it smells so bad, like as if the skunk
walked into my house and sprayed my entire
[SPEAKER_04]: house.
[SPEAKER_06]: Has one been hit or no?
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't even know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Then you never see anything and you're
just like, literally it smelled like an
[SPEAKER_04]: electrical fire.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so potent and insane and it smells
almost like chemicals.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I'm sure it's gotten me off the
hook a couple of times.
[SPEAKER_04]: And my neighbor's like this super cool old
lady.
[SPEAKER_04]: She's like 90 years old and she's from the
Yucatan and she's just badass.
[SPEAKER_04]: And she feeds the squirrels and the birds
and all the other neighbors hate her.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I love her to death.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yeah, bother them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do the critters like your backyard?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, actually the only problem I have is
because she leaves those nuts and stuff
[SPEAKER_04]: out for the squirrels, they go and bury
them in my yard sometimes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get a little digging going on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I get a little digging action going
on once in a while.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so when I was washing this one,
I ran all my bags again.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I was like, damn, the 90U is fat
on this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the 45 was like smaller than this.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Usually when I do a big wash, I'm usually
washing 10 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's, you know, 10, 12 pounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: What he's smoking on right there.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I just hit the grapeshopper,
but I'm about to try it right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's a Mac one.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's the caps cut that was gifted to
the real IOG and the real IOG tissue
[SPEAKER_02]: cultured it and gifted it to LA Family
Farms.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's how that's that is the true
tissue cultured Mac one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Miracle alien cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like I was saying, I ran all the bags
and then I was like, wow, this thing does
[SPEAKER_02]: have a fat 90.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it had like a, you know, a big 90U
like this, a 45, about that size,
[SPEAKER_02]: 73, like that size.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I'm like, I'm okay with leaving
that out.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's not mine.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that is not gonna hurt me compared to
this.
[SPEAKER_04]: So and if it's a really that much of a
difference, like it looks way different or
[SPEAKER_04]: is a different color by all means,
please, you know, as a hash maker,
[SPEAKER_04]: you don't want it in there.
[SPEAKER_04]: It'll, it'll boost your product way up by
taking it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: My buddy's product, for example,
I do this first time I ran it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was that, that 1000 grams, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I was telling you about, yeah,
this is the one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And guess where the meat was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, that smells so familiar.
[SPEAKER_04]: Guess where the meat was.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that Mac?
[SPEAKER_02]: That's Tropicana Cookies.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, it is Tropicana Cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, I just ran some of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why does that smell so goddamn familiar?
[SPEAKER_02]: So that the meat was the 45.
[SPEAKER_02]: The 45, that was where the meat was.
[SPEAKER_04]: The heads were smaller.
[SPEAKER_04]: They were smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: And after I did it, I realized,
I'm like, maybe there was.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know what he might not have done?
[SPEAKER_04]: He might not have ran it an extra week or
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: He told me he cut it early.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what he did.
[SPEAKER_02]: So there's also probably why it came out
whiter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Why do you think I'd get a fatter head?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because LA Family Farms, they are not
pulling early.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of times they'll pushing them to see
what the genetics can actually do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Different conditions change the the
length.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can steer the plant to finish early or
you can steer the plant to finish longer.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's amazing what some of these
strains do.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can do it a lot with just what you're
feeding it by adding potassium at a
[SPEAKER_04]: certain time and whatever.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a guy that I follow named Blue
Green Tank.
[SPEAKER_04]: The guy is so sick.
[SPEAKER_04]: He doesn't even feed his plants any food.
[SPEAKER_04]: He makes these little avocado husks that
he cuts all the meat out and then he adds
[SPEAKER_04]: like all of his nutrients into like a big
mix in a big bowl and then puts it back in
[SPEAKER_04]: the avocado husks.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sets it on the ground and he has so much
like so much bacteria, beneficial bacteria
[SPEAKER_04]: and worms and all sorts of bugs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he literally just has a dripper that
goes of water that goes on the avocado.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then he's grabbed the avocados,
flipped them over and it's just a giant
[SPEAKER_04]: puddle of red worms.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just like, yeah, what, dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, yeah, I don't even water.
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, I add bananas for potassium.
[SPEAKER_04]: I use barley and pumpkin ground up pumpkin
seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, dude, how do you even know
this shit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_04]: How did you learn to do this?
[SPEAKER_04]: He's like, Koreans, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're bad ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that KNF, right?
Right.
[SPEAKER_04]: But yeah, he was like he and he's very,
he's very like open with his info.
[SPEAKER_04]: He posts everything and he's super cool.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, I'm surprised more people don't do
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's also a testament to how powerful
these plants are.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they, they draw everything out.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, they're really powerful.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy how versatile they are too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is this that one?
[SPEAKER_04]: That's the Mac.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Can I try this?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, please.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, I, I'm a believer of sharing
information to a degree, to a degree,
[SPEAKER_02]: because there's certain things that you
just, those are just your thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, that would, that's, that's what
keeps you different.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's also like, I could tell you some
things that you can't reduplicate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even if I told you, and I showed you a
video, you have to do it 20 times and
[SPEAKER_04]: screw up five to really learn it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know how much material and
mistakes that we make, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: We don't show that shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't know how many.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do sometimes I'm like, that was a fail.
[SPEAKER_02]: Dude, there's times where I have done a
few, like first time fail, second time
[SPEAKER_02]: fail, third time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm doing everything that I normally
do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I just have to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I pull my hair and I'm like,
I'm like, what the fuck?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like everything that I know is not fucked.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I want to blow up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I have to tell myself,
dude, just let it go.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then all of a sudden you forgot
something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You forgot something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to start and do the alphabet.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're forgetting a step and you're
rushing and you're getting frustrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's not, it is not this machine's
fault that you want to kick and throw
[SPEAKER_02]: through the fucking wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's you and you need to be cool,
smoke a bowl, reset, come back.
[SPEAKER_02]: A B C D E all the way through Z.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I nailed it because you get,
you get accustomed to nailing it at times,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, especially when I'm running the
same material over and over and over and
[SPEAKER_02]: over.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you think I'm going to do that
same thing to this thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It just doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so now you have to recreate a recipe
to produce the, the, what, whoever you're
[SPEAKER_04]: really good to keep a book of screen to
create what's happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And not only that, if you have the lucky
weather changes, the way that I started
[SPEAKER_02]: processing their Cushman's was not what
you see today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the ability to continuously process
that material and get to learn about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like a relationship, you got to be around
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Continue to nurture it, look at it,
evaluate it, be with it, be a part of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Watch the squish, understand it.
[SPEAKER_02]: The more you understand it, the better you
can hold.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, that's a whole nother.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can, you can't teach that.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's an acquired thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just cause I tell you, it doesn't mean you
know when to push the goddamn lever.
[SPEAKER_02]: I squished 50 seconds.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, people are like, what?
[SPEAKER_02]: I squished, I squished for four and a half
minutes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's just bomb.
[SPEAKER_02]: I squished out 180.
[SPEAKER_04]: So 224, there's like 30 or 45 degree
difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: And look at the texture differences.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're night and day.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't look like the same hash maker
did it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what makes it your signature.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's personal.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can do laser logo designs on my
textures.
[SPEAKER_02]: Um, I believe this is just my belief.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I did Frenchies.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, there's this sense that I have a
hash maker.
[SPEAKER_06]: Do you want to try my Mac?
[SPEAKER_06]: Their basic philosophy is I make the hash
that I want.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like the hell with the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm doing like, you're going to like how I
do it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Then he gets a very personal line.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like your chefs or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you can only do that to an
extent and you're going to put yourself in
[SPEAKER_02]: a corner.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what I see is that's another
challenge.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I love challenges.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a puzzle guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I like to break down, analyze,
uh, backwards, you know, what do they call
[SPEAKER_02]: that?
[SPEAKER_02]: When you, you know, you read reverse
engineer, I'm that type of my,
[SPEAKER_02]: I read instruction manuals for pleasure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I don't read books.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: I read instruction manuals.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like to know how machines work.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not the guy that just says,
Oh yeah, I'm going to make this thing
[SPEAKER_02]: work.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: People don't like understand how like
pumps work or like you need to understand
[SPEAKER_04]: how a vacuum pump works before you're
running your freeze dryer.
[SPEAKER_04]: Understand what you're using.
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of pump oil goes in there?
[SPEAKER_04]: Understand that how vacuum works.
[SPEAKER_04]: Understand how, um, when you open a valve,
what, which way the air is going to go
[SPEAKER_04]: through.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, you got to put a filter on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should go slow.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many stupid things.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't think about that.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't give it to you.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't tell you there's not even,
there isn't even Harvest Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even have an owner's manual.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't even have an owner's manual.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're making hash and we're taking care of
the machine better than what they're doing
[SPEAKER_02]: for food.
[SPEAKER_04]: We troubleshoot it for them.
[SPEAKER_04]: This guy, this guy's solventless beef.
[SPEAKER_04]: He has had to take his entire machine
apart, redo the firmware, redo everything
[SPEAKER_04]: and literally like teach them their
mistakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're, and they're, dude,
he said he was like soldering shit.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, what?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, dude, you're not a tech.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like he's like, I had to be, they didn't
want to take it back.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't want to help.
[SPEAKER_04]: They didn't want to do nothing.
[SPEAKER_04]: He said they kept sending him like flash
drives where he'd have to plug in the
[SPEAKER_04]: flash drive, redo everything.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, bro, that's absolutely
crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give it about 10, 10 seconds, maybe,
maybe 15.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the caps cut too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Such a small world, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, it is a small circle.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a big, it's, it's not as big as
you think.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's where your reputation matters.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not being a freaking scumbag, not being a
liar, not doing shit, not running plants
[SPEAKER_04]: that are freaking sprayed, not,
you know, just being good to your fellow
[SPEAKER_04]: man.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like so hard to find somebody out
there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I spent a breath of fresh air finding
some hash makers that are so freaking
[SPEAKER_04]: humble and cool and like willing to share
info.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that guy, Anthony, that saw them as
BNV cannabis cam, Cameron's like one of
[SPEAKER_04]: the nicest people in the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like, he's given me so much
information and helped me be confident
[SPEAKER_04]: just to, you know, just to go swimming in
the deep waters, you know, where you're
[SPEAKER_04]: like, ah, is this, let's throw all this
weed in the, in the freaking, in the water
[SPEAKER_04]: and ice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, we're not going to know what's going
to happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know?
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, that's the thing about washing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the processes that I do, I'm not the
guy that likes to wait after the freeze
[SPEAKER_02]: dryer, you know, cause that's a whole
fucking nightmare for me to sleep through
[SPEAKER_02]: that.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like you dump it with all the water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I check numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a numbers percent guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: So after I do my wash, I still wash and I
squeeze like the traditional hash methods
[SPEAKER_02]: and I do my cutting up.
[SPEAKER_02]: But again, temperatures play a huge role
in my ability to pull that off.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I always check my numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know based on the pool that I got,
I got what I needed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if I didn't, then I didn't do a damn
good wash in a, and there's, in
[SPEAKER_02]: everything, every second counts,
man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like that's how I, I count every
millisecond, everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I get distracted, even when I'm
pressing because I do 50 second presses,
[SPEAKER_02]: I did it, you know, if I get distracted,
dude, I'll lose, you know, 0.25 of my
[SPEAKER_02]: yield, just like that, you know,
on the overall picture, you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: if you're not focused and looking at it
every moment to maximize it and you know,
[SPEAKER_02]: and I'm the same way when you're
processing and making the hash in the,
[SPEAKER_02]: in the, in the environment that you're
doing, how you're doing it, how you're
[SPEAKER_02]: treating it affects your whole end result.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I don't even know what we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_05]: There are people from all over the world
tuned in.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dude, I got, I was doing a live feed and
someone's like, Hey from UK.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I was like, bro, you have no idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: How much that means to me.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like that seriously is like the world.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are true hash connoisseurs.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh dude, you can't even find weed in
freaking Britain.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, well, we smell hash.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's, that's where the real hash
market world is.
[SPEAKER_02]: America.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything was coming right there from
Morocco.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was just like going.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's the California.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the California thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's our, it's our atmosphere.
[SPEAKER_02]: Colorado started with it, you know,
Colorado's brought.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got to give credit to Colorado for
bringing out the rosin, but they,
[SPEAKER_02]: they also, you know, struggled with their
facilities.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it was a way to grow pot above 6,000
feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's, and it's their way to process
early.
[SPEAKER_02]: They didn't have to worry about the take
down the dry and all the humidity spikes
[SPEAKER_02]: and all those things.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that it was, it was, uh, they were
almost forced into that market.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like if they weren't, there could have
been some failure.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's why they went to Rosin
because you know, some of the flower was
[SPEAKER_04]: so lacking just due to the, the
environmental conditions that they
[SPEAKER_04]: couldn't finish.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then they would just make these
amazing hashes that would come out of
[SPEAKER_04]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a big fan of Rosin Ryan.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, there's a lot of great hash makers
that I follow and I analyze as much as I
[SPEAKER_02]: can, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm not just looking at the big picture.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking in the back of the round.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm looking like, what's back over there.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: They got you this picture and I'm like,
Oh, what's over there though?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so that's, that's.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's how I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so I, there's, there's nothing
easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't believe anything is easy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you know, we like to make it look easy
because you know, it's not, it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: fucking, it's your, it's your work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's my portfolio.
[SPEAKER_02]: So why would I not want to put my best
work out there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make more mistakes than I can produce
beautiful quality.
[SPEAKER_04]: I shit the bed and my phone died.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm sorry, Pete.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I'm not washing, I'm pressing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, um, so washing or pressing,
washing or pressing, washing or pressing,
[SPEAKER_02]: washing or pressing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm, I mean, yeah, I'll take a day off
here and there to go golf.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just wash and press, wash and press,
wash and press, South Carolina,
[SPEAKER_04]: six to 10 hours sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then I mean, some days are even longer
in my two or three washes.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get freaking really deep in the
water.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's give it a go, dude.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, it's going to be my first time
using it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's heat it up.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll start low that way.
[SPEAKER_02]: He can do a press and we'll bump the temp
up for him.
[SPEAKER_02]: Uh, I did bring some material.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has, I didn't bring it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I apologize.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've got some here.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can press them of ours.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause I'd like to see what you do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Those are for a cotton mouth and they'd
work very, very well.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're from C's candy.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you know what?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never seen, I've never seen anybody
press my wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've pressed other people's washes and I
don't, I don't prefer that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't prefer washing, you know,
pressing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me, uh, turn, grab the table from that
side.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
