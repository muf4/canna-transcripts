[SPEAKER_00]: So this is our homemade grab, or not even
a gravity drip system.
[SPEAKER_00]: This has a pump in there, and we're gonna
plug it in for the very first time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And look at that, it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have eight, 18 plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We ran a half inch tubing out,
split it with a T, quarter inch into the
[SPEAKER_00]: pots with the dripper on the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we put in some nutrients in here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting in on remote nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see how those perform on our very
happy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a bunch of clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, AK-47, some new clones.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are seeds from India.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then all these larger plants are a
variety pack of varietals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where'd you go?
[SPEAKER_00]: This one is clementine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, what did I do with the,
it's probably buried under here on this
[SPEAKER_00]: one, but goji-oji.
[SPEAKER_00]: This happy plant over here is a lemon
cake, triple, double.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this one I believe was the pre,
now this is Mondo perks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that this one is a pre-98,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we hope to add more strains soon,
but look at this drip system.
[SPEAKER_00]: Team effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we'll leave this on for,
what, twice a day for half an hour each?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
All
right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So right, what's the current time?
Okay.
