[SPEAKER_01]: The reality of having this this market
that's already established and trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: be regulated and finding myself up against
a wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is I guess what I'm what I'm getting
is that on on the one side I don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: you know the the finances or the the
business sense that these large companies
[SPEAKER_01]: do and still realizing I needed to go
through with this process and I needed to
[SPEAKER_01]: become compliant and I needed to start
going down this this path way several
[SPEAKER_01]: years ago and seen my friends and family
and community members that couldn't didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: want to do it kind of look at me like I
was crazy and and and be so shocked like
[SPEAKER_01]: that that I would do this process and yet
at the same time not fitting in with the
[SPEAKER_01]: real players then the new industry that
comes in and says hey we're gonna do a
[SPEAKER_01]: million square feet or whatever and we
have all the capital we can lose money
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's in our business plan to lose
money for three or five years or whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: it takes and seen the like how how they
don't understand how a small operator
[SPEAKER_01]: would work or how that could function and
yet the small operators in my life acting
[SPEAKER_01]: somehow like I'm the man or something for
for trying to keep my family my two young
[SPEAKER_01]: children safe and and getting caught kind
of in this this paradigm where need access
[SPEAKER_01]: to market but don't somebody asked
yesterday here about my sales rep like you
[SPEAKER_01]: know and do what it sales rep or sales rep
how do they work for your company it's
[SPEAKER_01]: like I don't have a sales rep I don't just
try and meet with dispensaries or
[SPEAKER_01]: distributors when I can yeah to try and
get something going but I am the lead
[SPEAKER_01]: farmer I am tied to my farm that's what we
do all day every day and yeah and the
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions we had yesterday and yeah tied
to your farm and but it is a family farm
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think that is what's getting lost
and we had the discussion a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: yesterday and really on but how family
farms like in all other aspects of North
[SPEAKER_00]: America you look they've gone to
commercial farms and like this is an
[SPEAKER_00]: industry where there still are a lot of
true family farms and it's how do we
[SPEAKER_00]: collectively get that group together and
to market and I think we're better
[SPEAKER_00]: together than individually I think we
talked a lot about different sectors of
[SPEAKER_00]: the market and I think there's a lot of
opportunity there's a lot of opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: for all areas but the area that you are in
is this small batch this craft properly
[SPEAKER_00]: dried properly cured like a product that
right now isn't necessarily being rewarded
[SPEAKER_00]: from a price point but I think will be and
we GCI and partnering like we're thrilled
[SPEAKER_00]: so we're involved in both Canada and
Switzerland and are moving into California
[SPEAKER_00]: which we think the Pacific Northwest from
BC down to California is the epicenter of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis in the world and think the
triangle and think this is the old world
[SPEAKER_00]: to cannabis and that is a market that is
going to as we move forward both globally
[SPEAKER_00]: and rules and regulations coming down that
the world wants and is a treasure that
[SPEAKER_00]: needs to be protected and the small family
farms such as yours and thrilled to be
[SPEAKER_00]: partnered with Hezekiah and the co-op and
bringing sort of marriage of farmers
[SPEAKER_00]: capital and so that we can compete and we
can get these products out to the world
[SPEAKER_00]: and allow more people like yourself to
come from the free market over to the
[SPEAKER_00]: regulated market and have a pathway and
have collectively have sales teams have
[SPEAKER_00]: marketing teams so things so we've got a
teamwork so the nature of this business by
[SPEAKER_00]: the laws and the prohibition of input of
forced people to be secretive and to be
[SPEAKER_00]: isolated and working solo or with very few
trusted people one of the opportunities
[SPEAKER_00]: with sort of the regulation and coming out
of the closet so to speak is that we can
[SPEAKER_00]: work together sure like the probability of
us meeting 15 years ago probably pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: low you know and it's fascinating that
we're both sitting here and there's
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunities to move forward and work
together and it's sort of bring the
[SPEAKER_00]: marriage of capital and good values and to
build a product and what we want and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think what you guys want is in ten years
to have an industry that we're proud of or
[SPEAKER_00]: at least a good portion of the industry
that we're proud of and that carries on
[SPEAKER_00]: the values and being able to provide for
family provide a good product be proud of
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're putting into a jar what people
are smoking yeah and I think together we
[SPEAKER_00]: can do that and it's not without
difficulty and I don't know I've found
[SPEAKER_00]: this whole experience of Meadowlands has
been fantastic meeting great people and
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah and there was I think what we're
really looking for is people distributors
[SPEAKER_01]: you know collective bargaining groups that
we trust to a level that we can continue
[SPEAKER_01]: to spend the majority of our time farming
because it's the I can kind of the
[SPEAKER_01]: elephant in the room or whatever you want
to say is that the traditional market
[SPEAKER_01]: provided plenty of shady shit goes on but
if the if you had the right people is that
[SPEAKER_01]: they did that they allowed for these half
hour transactions that took a care of part
[SPEAKER_01]: of the year yep um and that allowed for
farming and what we're seeing is a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: one problem with this new market is
five-hour meeting about a five-hour
[SPEAKER_01]: meeting to talk about a net 30 that turns
into a net 60 that turns into a we don't
[SPEAKER_01]: know it sat on the shelf and what are you
gonna do about it and I don't know how
[SPEAKER_01]: intentional this is I'm not gonna try and
put it out there that it's you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: they're trying to scam me but I see with
these these distributors that some of them
[SPEAKER_01]: are just trying to survive but the more
established ones know that I'm busy
[SPEAKER_01]: farming and sure I have a business lawyer
and I have a defense yeah attorney but do
[SPEAKER_01]: I really have the time or effort or
finances to work with them at the level
[SPEAKER_01]: that I would need to to to draft that
leather letterhead to you know to go to
[SPEAKER_01]: court I don't so instead I let it slide I
mean yeah and I think what what we want
[SPEAKER_00]: and I want to work with people and look
there's good people on all sides of the
[SPEAKER_00]: aspects and there's bankers and people
that are assholes and screw people over
[SPEAKER_00]: and I'm sure so there's farmers that do as
well hell you know what I like it so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: not but it's funny in that group of people
that have a shared and common vision and
[SPEAKER_00]: common goal that you trust and you
shouldn't need contracts shaking your hand
[SPEAKER_00]: and look in the eyes is how this business
has taken place for 30 or 40 years and
[SPEAKER_00]: should be how it should be able to
continue should be able to trust your
[SPEAKER_00]: partners and that if something extraneous
happens on my end or your end when I come
[SPEAKER_00]: to you you realize that it wasn't
intentional and you believe believe that
[SPEAKER_00]: because there's not this fear of they're
trying to take advantage that we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to do it like yeah something like
oh did was there a mold issue for some
[SPEAKER_00]: reason that no one could have thought of
like a crazy humidity event comes through
[SPEAKER_00]: sure I mean or you're just trying to hide
product and that's not it's about trust
[SPEAKER_00]: and it's building and what with has in the
co-op is because it's the co-ops are
[SPEAKER_00]: farmer owned and you're still like it's
not big business coming in and trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: buy your farm and tell you how to do it
you still own your farm you have these
[SPEAKER_00]: people but helping that path to market and
become that source that so you can farm
[SPEAKER_00]: and create the best product and we do the
best job at getting that product into jars
[SPEAKER_00]: and out to the market and capital back to
you so you can continue to do your and
[SPEAKER_00]: that I think what I've seen is people have
different portions of that business and
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone thinks their portion is more
important and should take more money and
[SPEAKER_00]: are trying to squeeze the other and
everyone needs to have a fair and living
[SPEAKER_00]: portion of that pie and that's how we can
grow it all and let's grow the pie instead
[SPEAKER_00]: of trying to take pieces of a smaller pie
from each other sure that's you know that
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm kind of the belief that I don't think
that mine is is my piece is the most
[SPEAKER_01]: important it's you know that is it's
better than someone else but the reality
[SPEAKER_01]: is that I do have this certain capital
investment because I'm also on the front
[SPEAKER_01]: end or whatever on the first first in line
for the creation of the product that it is
[SPEAKER_01]: a hard pill to swallow when I do basic
math and I'm getting just ground down on
[SPEAKER_01]: numbers that I have to like kind of
calculate quickly in my head they're like
[SPEAKER_01]: the the jar price the eighth price and in
these meetings and I'm like wait it's
[SPEAKER_01]: gonna try to get out a calculator and
stuff and then it's like okay that's not a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred percent my world the business
certainly isn't the business aspects of
[SPEAKER_01]: this but I can I can do some basic math
and I can say don't don't basically call
[SPEAKER_01]: me stupid when you sit here and I'm I'm
kind of asking for whatever like a 15 20
[SPEAKER_01]: percent I'm hoping to get and meanwhile
they're saying they're only putting a
[SPEAKER_01]: hundred percent markup on it and the math
just doesn't line up when I can see the
[SPEAKER_01]: product on the shelf and say I know how
much all these taxes are yep so I I know
[SPEAKER_01]: that that's not the only thing that's
causing this product to be so exorbitantly
[SPEAKER_01]: expensive that the majority of consumers
just don't feel that they can afford it or
[SPEAKER_00]: they truly can't yeah absolutely and I
think what is lacking in a lot of the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry and through the co-op and the
model and doing this is transparency and
[SPEAKER_00]: that's what we want and I think it's a lot
easier to understand when everyone can see
[SPEAKER_00]: every aspect and there's transparency to
it of what the markups are and there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of people in the industry they're
trying to hide those pieces so they can
[SPEAKER_00]: take a bigger group and it's it's about
building trust and building and hopefully
[SPEAKER_00]: this event and meeting you yesterday and
continue the conversation over by the
[SPEAKER_00]: coffee earlier on and that's led to us
sitting here with a microphone which is
[SPEAKER_00]: more awkward but uh it is a continued
development and hope we have more
[SPEAKER_00]: discussions with Hezekiah and get you
involved in the project because I think we
[SPEAKER_00]: can succeed as a group and market this
region this plant in a way that the there
[SPEAKER_00]: is consumers that want this and it's just
a matter of being able to have a unified
[SPEAKER_00]: voice to get there in a quality product
and it takes great people and visionaries
[SPEAKER_00]: and you've taken the path from the free
market to the regulated market which is a
[SPEAKER_00]: difficult one and we want to be there to
help make sure that that was the right
[SPEAKER_01]: decision yeah yeah no and that that's
that's the beauty of the co-op model and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's why you know I look forward to I
see it as a as a necessity for me because
[SPEAKER_01]: it bridges this gap between being the lone
voice trying to make enough of a wave or
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever you want to say that that like
that my product does sell and sells in in
[SPEAKER_01]: a timely manner and it actually works but
at the same time not having to go it alone
[SPEAKER_01]: that the and scale up because the other
option is to scale up to such a magnitude
[SPEAKER_01]: that I know that I wouldn't need a co-op
that I just I have these um what are the
[SPEAKER_01]: marketing agents or whatever term that
some of these distress throw around and
[SPEAKER_01]: that the coops seems to be like that that
beautiful middle ground of having the
[SPEAKER_01]: voice but having the voice without having
to buy the voice absolutely and everyone
[SPEAKER_00]: having multiple skill sets and pieces if
you do it all grow it up and you're all
[SPEAKER_00]: yourself and fully believe you could do
that but you're not the strongest at all
[SPEAKER_00]: the aspects and what happens when you have
to do everything and you have these
[SPEAKER_00]: different things you don't do anything you
do everything average instead of doing
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're really good at well and the
great piece is if you get a whole bunch of
[SPEAKER_00]: group of people that are all good at
pieces we can excel at all of them and
[SPEAKER_01]: propel the entire group and then that's
that's the beautiful thing right there is
[SPEAKER_01]: is that if we could come come to market
strong in in that that collective voice of
[SPEAKER_01]: of saying this this is this beautiful
marriage of a quality product created in a
[SPEAKER_01]: sustainable fashion yeah because I think
ultimately when there is some more some
[SPEAKER_01]: higher level of consumer education that
that is ultimately what they want is a
[SPEAKER_00]: marriage of those two things absolutely
and I think collectively if you have start
[SPEAKER_00]: with ten farmers and a hundred farmers and
three hundred farmers and now it's a
[SPEAKER_00]: hundred thousand square feet of collective
grow to a million to three million all of
[SPEAKER_00]: a sudden and all unified telling that
story and that education it's more
[SPEAKER_00]: powerful and it's easier to get that
message out about what the product is then
[SPEAKER_00]: three hundred people individually doing
their things and not unified doing it and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's just look median like it's it's crazy
it's easy to get messages out but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: also difficult like everyone's got an
Instagram but who follows what and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: all over like media so fragmented so
getting a voice and trying to educate is
[SPEAKER_00]: much easier if we've got a whole group
doing it and it is I believe fundamentally
[SPEAKER_00]: it's what people want they just don't
necessarily know how to get that there's
[SPEAKER_00]: not a path in the regulated market to get
that reliably and consistently and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: this marriage and partnership between
farmers keeping community and I think one
[SPEAKER_00]: of the things that was most important
yesterday was the collective model is a
[SPEAKER_00]: way to keep families on their farm and
family it's not as you mentioned it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: just a farm and it's not just family that
they're together and it's a combined
[SPEAKER_00]: entity and this is the backbone of what
North America has been built on and doing
[SPEAKER_00]: this and it's critical to keep that part
of this alive because that's why people
[SPEAKER_00]: are doing this like I know you absolutely
love the plant but you're doing this to
[SPEAKER_00]: provide for your family and to make their
life better and to be able to do that
[SPEAKER_00]: together with the thing you love is
fantastic yeah well for me they're
[SPEAKER_01]: inextricably linked yeah so I can't I
can't just say one or the other and this
[SPEAKER_01]: is kind of the the quandary that I'm in
where historically we don't want to rock
[SPEAKER_01]: the boat yeah I know has a coyote we had a
talk last night after that about this very
[SPEAKER_01]: thing where it's the one part for me it's
more than that but he was kind of saying
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the biggest one for him where all of
a sudden it's a big it's just a time to
[SPEAKER_01]: shut up we're like okay think of the
children we don't we don't want to push
[SPEAKER_01]: that boundary yeah um and I've been in
that same place where it's like all right
[SPEAKER_01]: we already have enough things that we're
trying to push through it's it's the one
[SPEAKER_01]: it's it's so taboo that if they they want
these certain regulations in place you
[SPEAKER_01]: can't have kids anywhere near it well
we'll just do that yeah but then at a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain point after enough time energy and
as a small farmer money I spent so much
[SPEAKER_01]: money to them why can't I have some kind
of a voice saying it's just a place plant
[SPEAKER_01]: no my children are not going to be
consuming the plant but being near it is
[SPEAKER_01]: not going to hurt them so why can't we
have a little bit of dialogue and
[SPEAKER_01]: education about the fact that they don't
need to be you know away from it to the
[SPEAKER_01]: point where I lower my quality of life in
terms of being a family man yeah or being
[SPEAKER_01]: you know a person that that's with my
family and that my wife could have a
[SPEAKER_01]: little bit more free time or time to work
on her parts of the project that that the
[SPEAKER_00]: kids could be a little bit closer to that
that's absolutely and it I think it's
[SPEAKER_00]: something once again as a group and that's
something at GCI and working with emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: groan that we'd like to take up and lead
and we're separated enough from not having
[SPEAKER_00]: a farm that is being the voice and pushing
it it's not creating risk on our side
[SPEAKER_00]: right because by not physically having the
family so can sort of create an insulation
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit to push this to try to get
these through with the support of the
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers but get this through and I think
that was one of the things that came out
[SPEAKER_00]: of the sort of roundtable last night that
is critical and it's the passing on of the
[SPEAKER_00]: family farm generationally and learning is
part of the process and if this is a crop
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't allow that then you end up
with a disconnect at some point because
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe not all your children are gonna want
to continue but maybe one does and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: how the family farm continues and it's
through that education process and if
[SPEAKER_00]: through regulations which don't really
make sense because as we know the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: their plants you can't magically get high
from being too close to the plant you know
[SPEAKER_00]: so I I think it's something that it's very
and if it's a one of the byproducts of
[SPEAKER_00]: pushing this forward it'd be be fantastic
because it's critical to the whole piece
[SPEAKER_00]: of having this high quality product
because without family on a commercial
[SPEAKER_00]: scale you just can't get the care and the
end product on a scale and I'm not gonna
[SPEAKER_00]: say it's never gonna happen in a million
square feet and maybe they'll create
[SPEAKER_00]: technology to do it I'm very skeptical on
that front and I think the consumer is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna want something different and they
want the old world cannabis and as we
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about this Bordeaux burgundy
champagne region of cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_00]: Pacific Northwest is that and this is
you've been a steward of that for many
[SPEAKER_00]: years and the whole Northern California
have been and it's a duty to carry that
[SPEAKER_00]: forward and to continue that and we're
excited to be part of this journey with
[SPEAKER_01]: you guys yeah I am excited for the for the
future of being able to continue to form
[SPEAKER_01]: at this point we were kind of just in
survival mode yeah that I care so much
[SPEAKER_01]: about producing the product and all that
goes with it and for me the the family
[SPEAKER_01]: farm aspect of it is so important because
it's I got neither or that happens real
[SPEAKER_01]: quick when you take away the family either
my family life suffers because they are
[SPEAKER_01]: farther away and I don't see them as often
or my my work suffers because I am with
[SPEAKER_01]: them and I'm trying to commute in to take
care of it when I can essentially and when
[SPEAKER_01]: we're able to bring that together I see
how both my family life and my work life
[SPEAKER_01]: go up and are at this this this higher
place and I think the most important thing
[SPEAKER_00]: is keeping that together but second is
this sort of marriage between the co-op
[SPEAKER_00]: finance farmers and all of these pieces is
the immediate goal is obviously we want to
[SPEAKER_00]: have a great product and we get it to
market in a regulated fashion but we need
[SPEAKER_00]: to move it quickly that you're beyond just
surviving like needs to hit a point where
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a fair and equitable occupation doing
it and getting that piece and getting it
[SPEAKER_00]: so that more people want to come from the
free market to the regulated market
[SPEAKER_00]: because there is a path to better quality
of life better family less risk all of
[SPEAKER_00]: those elements and there's a path to the
passion they've had for their plants and
[SPEAKER_00]: things to get to the market and it's
shared and that I see one of the biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: takeaways from me this weekend is we need
to help get from survival to comfort
[SPEAKER_00]: happiness and comfort and and obviously
want to grow to like great success but we
[SPEAKER_00]: need that first step over like it's got to
be and taking away that that option of an
[SPEAKER_00]: either or because there's a lot of people
that are sitting on that razor's edge
[SPEAKER_00]: right now going back to the free market
because they can't do it right and that's
[SPEAKER_00]: what we've got a chain like these pioneers
these people that have taken that first
[SPEAKER_00]: step we need to support them and help so
they can continue this path yeah and so
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's an easy decision not a either or
decision and I think an extension of the
[SPEAKER_01]: the whole family discussions in a family
sound you know we're talking about how
[SPEAKER_01]: close the children can be to the grow or
things like that but I think there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: bigger issue here also when we talk about
family farm is that in the corporate model
[SPEAKER_01]: they they can follow these certain rules
if though all the water for the facility
[SPEAKER_01]: needs to come from this certain area of
well specifically that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: hydrologically connected to something else
fine they can do that and then they they
[SPEAKER_01]: go home to their house where wherever that
is and they live their normal life well in
[SPEAKER_01]: a family farm it's not really like that
and so as an example I got a million
[SPEAKER_01]: gallon pond and two springs that provide
all the water that I could ever need yeah
[SPEAKER_01]: well we had a punch 160 foot well but I we
had water at 35 40 feet pay by the foot
[SPEAKER_01]: you can do the math it's unnecessary but
it's not hydrologically connected so I
[SPEAKER_01]: move out of this area of being as heavily
regulated okay and so that works that's
[SPEAKER_01]: what they want for for cannabis
cultivation fine they they still want it
[SPEAKER_01]: metered and I'll roll with that well that
wasn't good enough then they started
[SPEAKER_01]: saying well what about for your domestic
use why can't you just use this water for
[SPEAKER_01]: your domestic use and I I think it's a
poignant example of where this regulation
[SPEAKER_01]: starting to really creep in to the to our
everyday living toward no my family
[SPEAKER_01]: already has clean safe delicious drinking
water yeah and we're not using a lot of it
[SPEAKER_01]: we have needed access in a normal world
that would just be accepted but because of
[SPEAKER_01]: the nature of this plant and its extreme
regulation this way it allows for this
[SPEAKER_01]: just this hyper regulation where they
start controlling aspects that to me seem
[SPEAKER_01]: like they have nothing to do with the
actual plant itself and yeah and I think
[SPEAKER_00]: and I think a lot of the regulation takes
place in vacuums and don't understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: family farm which is also part of the
whole education and getting the story out
[SPEAKER_00]: right and showing the positive stories
around this not just the negative stories
[SPEAKER_00]: because people see the news and the free
market black market whatever want to call
[SPEAKER_00]: and people that aren't doing the bus or
what they're doing and a lot of times some
[SPEAKER_00]: of that is involved with other drug like
there's then there's a perception that is
[SPEAKER_00]: portrayed and what we need to do is start
changing that story and tell the good
[SPEAKER_00]: stories and the pieces so that it's seen
as a for what it is as a crop yeah I mean
[SPEAKER_01]: that's that's a big that's a big
distinction that I make and you know these
[SPEAKER_01]: broad sweeping statements but here here's
one is the like a simple what's a two two
[SPEAKER_01]: four two parts split in terms of free
market traditional market cultivators and
[SPEAKER_01]: then distributors would you know people in
in the business is people where it's
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially the only only real cry maybe
jaywalking and speeding or something but
[SPEAKER_01]: it's the only crime they commit and
otherwise are normal whatever the whatever
[SPEAKER_01]: that means yes like yeah that everything
else about them when you meet I mean like
[SPEAKER_01]: oh my god you could be you know you're a
normal person and then the other side
[SPEAKER_01]: which is straight-up criminal element yeah
where they have used money from human
[SPEAKER_01]: trafficking and hard drug sales to finance
these large-scale illicit cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: production and distribution operations and
that we can make a distinction to the
[SPEAKER_01]: general public yeah and and say hey I know
that these people they haven't done
[SPEAKER_01]: everything perfectly they've had to do
what they felt was necessary or what made
[SPEAKER_00]: their business work but they're not bad
people absolutely and that's there is a
[SPEAKER_00]: real distinction there and I think in
fairness like Canadian regulators American
[SPEAKER_00]: regulators and the lawmakers the
unintended consequences of trying to they
[SPEAKER_00]: want to remove the criminal element from
it but it's captured the pioneers as well
[SPEAKER_00]: and the people that were doing it and
pushing plant-based medicine and that have
[SPEAKER_00]: gotten us here yeah to the like that have
carried the mantle and risked their
[SPEAKER_00]: liberty their freedom in order to do this
and though that group yourself and these
[SPEAKER_00]: farmers people should the ones that should
be celebrated and they shouldn't be caught
[SPEAKER_00]: up with the regulations they're trying to
element eliminate the criminal element and
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm all for the criminal element
unfortunately that an intended consequence
[SPEAKER_00]: is the criminal element being removed I'm
very in favor of that but the unintended
[SPEAKER_00]: consequences is unfortunately generally
it's organized crime they have lawyers
[SPEAKER_00]: moving money doing things these simple
rules that they put in place to become
[SPEAKER_00]: onerous for the guy that this is the only
thing that they've done wrong and having
[SPEAKER_00]: Jay walk they don't have the ability to
get around it so it doesn't these rules
[SPEAKER_00]: don't actually catch the criminal element
unfortunately and that's sort of the
[SPEAKER_00]: unintended consequence and they
exceedingly punish the people that are
[SPEAKER_00]: just trying to get there to go the right
way and that's where I think telling the
[SPEAKER_00]: stories and having the public realize that
there is a difference and these are family
[SPEAKER_00]: farms like these are farmers this is not a
criminal enterprise yeah yeah and the guy
[SPEAKER_01]: got three broad categories that I put this
into and I'll just you know the one is is
[SPEAKER_01]: the business aspect of it and new or newer
people coming into this kind of a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: what we see here is they're way better at
it oh shit yeah I've made my business work
[SPEAKER_01]: but I have no business background I you
know I don't have an MDA MBA yeah see I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't really care but that's great for
them okay and they have this this skill
[SPEAKER_01]: set and I think there's there's pieces of
that for me to learn on how to run a
[SPEAKER_01]: business that that works to where I have
good forecasting abilities and good
[SPEAKER_01]: bookkeeping skills and all that and so of
course they they have that in a way that
[SPEAKER_01]: we as farmers for the most part don't and
the second the second one being the the
[SPEAKER_01]: science of it and I feel like the big
business they can get that they might not
[SPEAKER_01]: personally know how to grow the best
product but they can get enough people on
[SPEAKER_01]: the team that know it that they can make
that work but it's the history and the
[SPEAKER_01]: culture of it that they see it's kind of
eludes them and they don't see the
[SPEAKER_01]: importance of it and that's that's the big
one that we really hope that we can kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of and that's the most important part to
me like I and that's what can't get lost
[SPEAKER_00]: right and if it does get lost I don't see
a future where Northern California or
[SPEAKER_00]: British Columbia Oregon the stewards of
this plant for the last 50 years can
[SPEAKER_00]: survive without that culture because that
is the culture the history the legacy and
[SPEAKER_00]: it's the being able to grow this product
in a craft in a way that's critical to the
[SPEAKER_00]: survival of this area and it's going to be
a segment of the the marketplace yeah that
[SPEAKER_00]: does it it's not the entire marketplace
and I think we talked earlier there's lots
[SPEAKER_00]: of elements of this marketplace there's
new consumers that are going to come on
[SPEAKER_00]: women men that want a replacement for
alcohol and they want it through a
[SPEAKER_00]: beverage or an edible and that and that's
where the science is going to come in and
[SPEAKER_00]: onset times and offset times but like a
full spectrum like the plant the time back
[SPEAKER_00]: to old-school old-growth wines and the
Cabernet's and the uniqueness is that come
[SPEAKER_00]: from the different microclimates and that
two farms by the crow flies of
[SPEAKER_00]: quarter-mile can have totally different
environments in different products and
[SPEAKER_00]: there's going to be there is a consumer
that wants that now and there always will
[SPEAKER_00]: be and we need to make sure that we
provide an economic framework that it's
[SPEAKER_00]: sustainable for the farmers to be able to
grow that and that we don't lose that and
[SPEAKER_00]: that comes back to the family farm and
working together and I'm really excited
[SPEAKER_00]: about this journey and it's been fantastic
meeting you this weekend and look forward
[SPEAKER_00]: to many more conversations you have for
sure you
