[SPEAKER_02]: She says tell me a little bit about what
you do So okay, who are you?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, my name is Steven?
[SPEAKER_00]: Raisner Are a is ner and My company name
is potent P o t e n t Ponyx P o n i c s
[SPEAKER_00]: and I work with aquaponics Aquaponics is
using fish and fish waste to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients for plants to grow This allows
us to use a lot less water and a lot less
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients Than traditional farming methods
How does it work with low water how you
[SPEAKER_00]: use The fish farm so we use significantly
less water by recirculating all of the
[SPEAKER_00]: water from the fish tanks So none of the
water goes into the soil and Into the
[SPEAKER_00]: ground where it's not available again for
the plants This also helps in extremely
[SPEAKER_00]: hot environments Because the plants have a
lot more water available so for places
[SPEAKER_00]: like deserts or Island nations where they
have a lot of heat with not a lot of water
[SPEAKER_00]: it can be a great way to grow both very
Vegetables and medicine plant medicinal
[SPEAKER_00]: plants What filter do you use We use a
separate called a radial flow separator or
[SPEAKER_00]: a slow pass-through filter That allows the
weight the fish waste to the heavy fish
[SPEAKER_00]: waste to settle to the bottom as The water
flows through the chamber where it can be
[SPEAKER_00]: then separated and vacuumed off the bottom
put into a separate tank and turned into a
[SPEAKER_00]: compost tea of sorts to unlock the
nutrients from that fish waste in a
[SPEAKER_00]: similar manner to what happens in soil
with animal compost
[SPEAKER_02]: Hydrogen and the fish waste oh so for pH
and the fish waste The fish castings using
[SPEAKER_02]: worm castings she says in there Is it just
fish waste fish water or other elements to
[SPEAKER_02]: it or yeah?
[SPEAKER_02]: How they're similar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes Okay, so so she was asking how fish
waste is similar to terrestrial creature
[SPEAKER_00]: waste so just in the soil You have the
terrestrial or soil food web in Aquaponics
[SPEAKER_00]: we use the aquatic or water food web
[SPEAKER_00]: And this allows us to unlock those
nutrients the same way that they would
[SPEAKER_00]: happen in soil just using different
species of microbes
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have to add anything to it to the
the water for the fish or for the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: or is it a good standalone media So so you
do have to add iron And adjust the pH with
[SPEAKER_00]: things like calcium or potassium just to
maintain stability But you you don't have
[SPEAKER_00]: to add very much
[SPEAKER_02]: She says something I would love to try
that methodology one day Yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's a great It's a great gardening method
and provides a lot of different options
[SPEAKER_00]: and much faster plant growth plants can
grow almost Twice as fast using aquaponics
[SPEAKER_02]: She says saves a lot saving water is a big
thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep very important A lot of water to feed
plants She says it can be exhausting Did
[SPEAKER_02]: you imagine everybody just using up all
the natural resources of water She says I
[SPEAKER_02]: mean, that's the way a future If it stands
the way it is Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why we need to work together us
soil organic growers and us aquaponics
[SPEAKER_00]: growers And you know, we're all on the
same team of less water and more
[SPEAKER_02]: sustainability Keep it simple Absolutely
Looked in nature Looked in nature Well,
[SPEAKER_02]: thank you so much Thank you very much for
your time we appreciate it I appreciate it
[SPEAKER_02]: If you had to come up with a Body language
for hydroponics, what would you imagine in
[SPEAKER_02]: your head?
[SPEAKER_02]: What would you paint that picture like?
[SPEAKER_02]: Maybe a fish swimming into Can you do can
you do like is
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you have it's a water solution
with the nutrients So you have the or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe nutrient water plant Or
[SPEAKER_01]: is that too much like to watering the
Exploding
[SPEAKER_01]: fish You
