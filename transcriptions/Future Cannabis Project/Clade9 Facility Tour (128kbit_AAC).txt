[SPEAKER_01]: Welcome to Clay 9, Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the entrance to the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give you guys a tour.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very inviting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Anyway, this is the cultivation entrance
that is still building it out at the
[SPEAKER_01]: moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's this room going to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be the changing room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So cultivators will walk in.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll check in and they'll come in and
change out the scrub, sanitize and
[SPEAKER_01]: changing stations will be over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they'll go through that door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then they'll go through.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is like the vestibule for just for
cleaning.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be an air curtain in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once they walk in, they'll go through
kind of like sterilization process.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be air curtain here that'll blow
off any debris they have on them as they
[SPEAKER_01]: come into the facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now you're in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So will this be blocked off?
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be blocked off at some point
right now because we're under
[SPEAKER_01]: construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's open so the guys could get back and
forth, bringing materials or whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this will just be like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is like loading.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a loading dock for distribution,
for supplies.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll have cultivation supplies here,
you know, packaging, post reduction
[SPEAKER_01]: supplies here and just anything we need
for operations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have a couple of other places for
storage, but all the big bulky stuff will
[SPEAKER_01]: be here for the most part.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you can see we're still under
construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: Floors haven't been all the way done yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have an office here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is kind of like our command center at
the moment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that going to remain an office or is
that going to be something else?
It will.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to remain an office.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is our break slash conference
room here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Functioning restrooms, thank God.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been using the porta potty for two
years.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a nice change.
[SPEAKER_01]: Another lot of unsatisfying dumps,
especially with COVID.
[SPEAKER_01]: That was scary, scary.
[SPEAKER_01]: So glad we got through that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once you get past the hallway here,
this is where the cultivation space is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is the core, the main corridor
for the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just all flower rooms all the way
down.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are all going to be flat.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is room number what?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is one, two, three, four,
five, six.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're actually, in the beginning,
we phased it out into three phases.
[SPEAKER_01]: So phase three, this becomes the last
flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what we're going to use it for now is
actually trimming, packaging, storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will be post harvest for now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you in a rush to get every room up and
running or more like let's get two rooms
[SPEAKER_00]: humming.
[SPEAKER_00]: And once we have customer demand,
maybe like room three comes online and
[SPEAKER_00]: room four and room five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have two up that'll be up by next
week.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the goal is to get two more on and
then kind of test the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's four of six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Four out of six.
[SPEAKER_01]: The last two though are going to wait
until we get going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the thing is with all the
infrastructure we've invested,
[SPEAKER_01]: the investment to get additional rooms up
is small compared to the whole facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it makes more sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: It makes more sense to get as many as you
can up.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, this will be the post
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we put a, you could see there's a
little wall.
[SPEAKER_01]: This room is actually about twice the
size.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the other side of it is our water room
for the time being.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many square feet is this room?
[SPEAKER_01]: These rooms are 2000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Each flower room is about 2000 square
feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we got the water room here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this will remain the water room.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will remain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: At least until we get, phase three built
out.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so tell me about what's going on in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have, uh, so this is, so first of all,
we're using the house brand of nutrients,
[SPEAKER_00]: clay nine, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for those of you who don't know,
we have our own nutrient line,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, that we've called clay nine since
about 2016.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and we sell direct to growers mainly
to large scale growers, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say 10,000 square feet and up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so, yeah, of course we use our own
product and, you know, we, we live and die
[SPEAKER_01]: by this, by this nutrient blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you're going to break some news right
here, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're changing the name of clay nine to
newts because, uh, later this year we're
[SPEAKER_01]: launching our clay nine flower brand,
just so to avoid confusion in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have the newts brand for nutrients and,
uh, clay nine will be the flower brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's, uh, is that like the RO water
over there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll walk you through this, this,
the water room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, this, it'll, our fertigation
system is all based on the Priva Nutrijet,
[SPEAKER_01]: which is over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this bad boy, this is the brain of the
fertigation system and it is top of the
[SPEAKER_01]: line Dutch fertigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Irrigation control.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we're about three to four weeks from
getting this online though.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the meanwhile, we're just kind of
building the irrigation as we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then is this, is this the same,
uh, Priva or is this a, oh yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's Priva too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like a Dosatron type system,
just different brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's similar to the Dosatron in that it,
you know, pulls nutrients and dosism,
[SPEAKER_01]: but the difference is it has a lot of,
um, expendable capacities.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it'll do lots of monitoring and
alarming and things that, uh, data
[SPEAKER_01]: collection that the Dosatron doesn't do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you are a data guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a data freak.
[SPEAKER_01]: Precision control.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you will know like when, uh,
a leaf on a plant in room number seven is
[SPEAKER_00]: slightly below temperature.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the hope at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to build into that,
but yeah, we'll eventually get to that
[SPEAKER_01]: type of precision.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but for the fertigation, this is
essentially, um, what it does is it'll
[SPEAKER_01]: take the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll mix them with our parameters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll fill our day stock tanks,
which are behind you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then those will feed the rooms,
but it'll do all these measuring.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll measure, measure pH and EC here
twice.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it'll measure as it leaves the
tanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there'll be three points of reference
that will always be checked.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if there's anything goes out of
whack, there'll be alerts and alarms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll know the second something weird
has happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, and then each room is probably
going to be at a different phase.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like one's going to be just about to
harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: One's going to be, you know, six weeks in
every, every a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll be having different regimens and,
uh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at peak production, we'll have six
flower rooms at six different cycles,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, at six different times of cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The regimens will all be a little bit
different and this thing will be tracking
[SPEAKER_01]: everything from flow rate to the EC to the
pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we could also monitor runoff too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with, with each room, if we're feeding,
we're looking at the runoff as well,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's all automated.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so if we see anything weird,
we could have the system alert us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so it's all about, you know,
having control precision and just knowing
[SPEAKER_01]: when something goes wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's the, is this RO?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is RO.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an RO system.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the RO system.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the RO water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in the, uh, in the three tanks
over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So with the Priva, essentially,
um, we set the level where we want this to
[SPEAKER_01]: be filled every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the Priva will just keep this thing
full to whatever our level is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we want 250 gallons available at all
times, it'll make sure it keeps it at 250
[SPEAKER_01]: gallons of fresh nutrients ready to use
for the room.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in terms of your nutrients,
what, like, is this a different mix than
[SPEAKER_00]: this, than this?
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll all be different mixes,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is flower room three.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the mother room.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'll be flower room five.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you notice there are spaces in
between.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are rooms that aren't up and running
yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So as the rooms come online, we drop in
the day stock tanks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so basically, where these are in their
life cycle, you're going to blend
[SPEAKER_00]: something up and then bring it,
you know, take it offline for however long
[SPEAKER_00]: it takes to mix it up appropriately,
bring it back online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So right now we're doing it by hand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to fill it up, mix it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's labor, you know,
so in three to four weeks, so that'll take
[SPEAKER_01]: over that part of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the mixing will be done
automatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll be, they'll be filled
automatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And with, with all the different controls,
we could do lots of really creative types
[SPEAKER_01]: of cycling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I could tell the Priva that I want to
blend the nutrients at 9 a.m.
[SPEAKER_01]: and really stir the shit out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's really aerated and then feed at
905, you know, and then the next feeding
[SPEAKER_01]: at 930, I could have the Priva blend it at
925.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it feeds aerated at 930.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just all of those little things you
can control, we're going to control to
[SPEAKER_01]: optimize production.
[SPEAKER_00]: In addition to the base clade nutrients,
are you adding things like microbials or?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, we have an IPM regimen,
but we don't add anything in terms of the
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all our own proprietary blend.
[SPEAKER_00]: So here we have the mom slash clone room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then those are eventually going to be
separate, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're going to keep this mix the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually use the same formulation for
mom, clone and veg, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we will have a separate veg tank just
to have control just because of the volume
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements are a little bit bigger.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's the same blend for mom,
clone and mothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mom, clone and veg.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the flower rooms are all a little bit
different.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then do you notice that different kind
of cultivars you have like different
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrient mixes?
[SPEAKER_01]: They do.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're all relatively in the same
ballpark.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you want to dial in specific
varieties, definitely have noticed that
[SPEAKER_01]: like the sativa hybrids, you know,
what people call sativas like Jax or
[SPEAKER_01]: anything with terpenolene seems to have a
little bit different requirement for hydro
[SPEAKER_01]: than say like OG Kush or something really
indica Afghani.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are the sativas like more or less?
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like they're a little bit more
potassium hungry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the way they feed throughout the cycle
is different, too.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, sometimes it seems like from our
research at like Babas feed kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: consistently through flower, whereas like
OG Kush is like feed super heavy in the
[SPEAKER_01]: beginning, and then it drops off quickly
in mid flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sativas are kind of somewhere in the
middle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, yeah, we've definitely noticed lots of
things about how they feed under
[SPEAKER_01]: construction.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will be our drying room.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what are you thinking of your setup
in terms of because do you have any drains
[SPEAKER_00]: like a temporary drying space right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is our temporary.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is actually going to eventually
be flower room six.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, flower room six is an LED two level R
&D room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what what are you envisioning the
setup?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you going to have like stacks of?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're probably going to go cheap and
effective kind of old school rock systems
[SPEAKER_01]: like the sliding rectangles that hold
plants like on trellis nets.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, because it is really cheap and
they're very effective.
[SPEAKER_01]: The main the main thing we're going to
invest in is environmental control,
[SPEAKER_01]: because that's really where you need
precision here for, you know, temperature
[SPEAKER_01]: humidity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you what do you what do you
like to keep it at in terms of humidity
[SPEAKER_00]: and temperature?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you like bring it down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, we like to keep it cold,
you know, 65 or lower in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature Fahrenheit.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then for humidity, it's, you know,
try when the plants first come in,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's so much moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just trying to like get the
humidity down quick.
[SPEAKER_01]: So 40 to 50.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after you're closer to your
moisture level in the flower, you can kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of raise it to keep it going a little
longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I would say early you're trying to
bring the humidity a lot lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as the plants dry, you kind of
bring it back up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you eventually like?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your target?
[SPEAKER_00]: Final human?
[SPEAKER_01]: I think you're you're ending up around
like 55, 60, 55 in that ballpark.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then the flower is kind of right there
at the right moisture level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And do you pretty much dry and cure again,
getting back to like different cultivars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you dry everything the same way or do
you have different techniques?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, there's something more time
or they do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we give the entire drying cycle enough
time for all the range of cultivars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, some strains might be done
in nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some might be ten, but some might be
eight.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just make sure the dry cycle is long
enough to accommodate all the different
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you have a bunch of different stuff
that goes in there at the same time,
[SPEAKER_00]: you just leave it till.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we give ourselves two total weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then whatever the variances and the
different varieties, they'll all be done
[SPEAKER_01]: by 14 days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because one one thing we've seen is the
longer they hang, if you're if you're
[SPEAKER_01]: environment is off, especially now that
they're doing testing, you could fail
[SPEAKER_01]: tests for mold, for, you know,
bacteria, whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is where that could really affect
you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our Vegas and data shows our Vegas data
shows us kind of show pointed us in the
[SPEAKER_01]: right way to cure dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you could pass the state state test.
[SPEAKER_00]: And by Vegas data, you mean the data
you've gathered from the facility you run
[SPEAKER_00]: in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: For those who aren't in.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also in Arizona, to some extent.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there isn't any testing still in
Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: So although we have great data from that
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vegas, you're certainly an expert in
drying and curing and super dry climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: L.A.
[SPEAKER_01]: is actually a lot easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we figured it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're excited about launching the
product here, though, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's keep going.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Space to get through.
[SPEAKER_00]: How many square feet is the total space?
[SPEAKER_01]: Seventeen thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seventeen thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: And some change for the facility.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then six row rooms at two thousand
each.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So five or two thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: One is that six hundred square foot
experimental room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have about about ten thousand six
hundred square feet, almost eleven
[SPEAKER_01]: thousand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's one of the unbuilt flower rooms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can we flip this?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Never mind.
[SPEAKER_00]: No power.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: People get the gist of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what number room is this going to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is number two.
[SPEAKER_00]: This room, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, that was one, one, two,
three.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water room or new room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So two flower, three flower, four flower,
five flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one is the next up.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is five.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think we get.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of lights do we have going on in
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mixed spectrum ceramic metal halide
HB.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eighty four lights.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: What brand?
[SPEAKER_01]: These are growers choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I assume you've done a whole lot of
lighting research to come to this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how many.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a two thousand square foot
room, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a little bigger, actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's about twenty two hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how many lights?
[SPEAKER_01]: Eighty four lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: Eighty four.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what do you like about the metal
halide?
[SPEAKER_01]: It gives it some blue spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: The HBS does it have.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we just this is really our second
production room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've done the mixed spectrum and I've
experimented with mixed spectrum in the
[SPEAKER_01]: past, but way back in the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just the fact that the fixture cost
between the ceramic metal halide and HBS
[SPEAKER_01]: are so close.
[SPEAKER_01]: We decided, hey, we might as well blend
them and just give us control.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have two different controllers and
we could control the spectrum on four
[SPEAKER_01]: different bands of controllers within the
room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So out of eighty four, we could do twenty
one HBS and, you know, or forty forty two
[SPEAKER_01]: HBS at 50 percent ceramic metal halides at
one hundred and just really play with a
[SPEAKER_01]: different blends of blues with the reds
that the HBS have and the far reds of the
[SPEAKER_01]: HBS.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can dial in and out of different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We could turn the HBS completely off,
have the CMH all the way on, or we could
[SPEAKER_01]: do the opposite, have all HBS with no CMH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we kind of over.
[SPEAKER_01]: We overspec the room so we have more
intensity so we can kind of go up on one
[SPEAKER_01]: or the other.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just it gives us more playing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you have like targets for DLI?
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the DLI number is indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a lot lower than like greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_01]: I want to say our DLI for indoor is like
30, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to do the math, but we run about 700
micro moles, maybe 800 max during flower
[SPEAKER_01]: and only for a limited amount of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have to do the calculation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think the DLI was around 30,
but I have to sit down and do some math.
[SPEAKER_01]: But our DLI changes through flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah, looks we're really close.
[SPEAKER_01]: This room is supposed to be ready within a
week and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it looks like we're really close.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'll show you the flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We actually have this running with the
same configuration next door.
[SPEAKER_01]: So check it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got to go around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to go around.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to get scrubbed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now you must be psyched.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Psyched and stressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's all kind of combined.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a long journey.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the official cultivation
entrance over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and this will be the official
entrance because I thought that's where
[SPEAKER_00]: people basically switch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the official right now, but yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is temporary cultivation entrance.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this will switch to, to just like an
emergency entrance and exit at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a mini changing room over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have to get scrubbed up.
[SPEAKER_00]: See here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have the same protocol is going
now.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same protocol is just a smaller room for a
smaller crew.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everyone comes in, you got to put some
coveralls on some large pants for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pants and shirts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll be right back.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to grab my uniates over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So should I put these stylish?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if we have any extras.
[SPEAKER_01]: One sec.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you know what we do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, they are Crocs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got to be comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say that these stylish
looking Mario Batali.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone makes fun of me with the Crocs,
but super comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's, oh, there we go.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a, uh, I look like a ninja or
like if a ninja made love to an orderly
[SPEAKER_00]: and had a baby, it would look like this
outfit.
[SPEAKER_01]: That'd actually be a good cultivator,
probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the cultivation entrance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And let me show you kind of the protocol.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have a biosafe mat here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: And yeah, Sanidate in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you step on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it like bleach or what?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's hydrogen peroxide with parasitic
acid.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it kills anything on your feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also have facility shoes as you're
wearing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just really like overkill,
but we want to make sure anything that's
[SPEAKER_01]: in that room gets killed coming into the
facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I should close this door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Close the door.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after you step into the facility,
you could put on the booties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only the stylish Crocs,
but the booties that go on top of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the whole setup as modeled by
Dave.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a temporary cultivation
entrance.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, um, see, we have this refrigerator,
the whiteboard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when the guys come in.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So today is what day?
[SPEAKER_01]: Today is June 29th.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we usually leave a list of kind of
things for the guys to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things to knock out.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have, uh, just RO, straight and
rolling benches, mother room.
[SPEAKER_00]: So mother room, 77 degrees with 68%
humidity.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So 78, 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the supply as the, as the boss,
but the entrepreneur, you just came back
[SPEAKER_00]: from Staples.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's right at home depot to get the
paper towels.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're doing it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, having the guys focus on
cultivation and just trying to be scrappy
[SPEAKER_01]: and running around and do what I could do
at the moment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm part entrepreneur, part cultivator,
part HR trash.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever, whatever I need to do to get it
done at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but yeah, this is just kind of our
little, uh, mini kind of meeting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Space and the guys get started here and
then go throughout the day.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just, uh, this kind of exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got a breeder, the breeder's brief and
the cannabis business times that's coming
[SPEAKER_01]: out, uh, I think this week.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our snake eye strain, which is one of
our proprietary varieties, um,
[SPEAKER_01]: which has been very successful in other
markets.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's actually developed here in LA in
the arts district.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of exciting to bring it back.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're going to launch that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're about to see it.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're about to see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a little early in flower,
but, uh, in the mom, it's in the mom room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have it in the mom room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have it in the flower room.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, we're about to go see it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go see them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Go check it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here is our mom room slash bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in here you have, uh, you want to talk
about the setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're all Dutch, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are, um, rolling benches,
uh, and we're running on drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So because it's a temporary setup for veg,
we are just hand watering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which is a little bit labor intensive,
but until we get the veg room up,
[SPEAKER_01]: until we get our fertigation up,
we're just doing what we got to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're in here watering every day and
just making sure that the moisture rate in
[SPEAKER_01]: the cubes, the pH, the EC is all on point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so far everything looks really good.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have ghost.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have ghost OG and actually there
should be, let me see if there's a,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, we love our strain list.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got ghost OG and these are split a
little bit so you could walk on down the
[SPEAKER_01]: aisle and we split up the strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: With the painter's tape, a painter's tape,
a painter's tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can't imagine how much you go through
in a grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like for separating tables,
for labeling your clones, everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's a great product gap tape.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are classic OG varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a ghost OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is private reserve OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is, um, this is a, our Bubba sky,
which is a pre 98 Bubba had in the
[SPEAKER_01]: collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: For more than a decade, by the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just probably the best Bubba I've
ever, ever smoked, ever seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, so we've kept it forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then after the Bubba, you got the J1,
the, you know, trusty Jack Harare skunk
[SPEAKER_01]: cross.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great yielder.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a really phenomenal Sativa,
um, high interpenaline, but just a great
[SPEAKER_01]: grower, easy to grow, high yielding,
but also just a great flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then as we go down, we have,
uh, this is a experimental strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're really excited about here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the MLG six.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, which is really a cross between,
uh, my Phoenix OG, girl scout cookies,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, ghost OG and Emerald triangle Kush.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's a mutt.
[SPEAKER_01]: What they call this in Cali is an exotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an exotic, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it's super, super phenomenal
quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, really, really brachy kind of compact,
super resinous, super pretty, great bag
[SPEAKER_01]: appeal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just like great, great, great,
uh, turf profile as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's super tasty, has a little bit of a
gassy from the OG and from the Phoenix.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but it has a really nice color and
structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: More from the girl's got cookie.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just a phenomenal hybrid, but we're
going to run this one in production
[SPEAKER_01]: finally on our third room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, then we got a little bit more Tahoe
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: We love OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have the original Tahoe cut Tahoe,
the ghost, the private reserve.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are all OGs in production here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then after that, this is snake
eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and that's the house, uh,
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a house cultivar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, this one has been great for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We won several awards in Arizona on the
flower, on the extract.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we've ran it in Vegas as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And people love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just a really small yielder,
you know, it's only drawback to snake
[SPEAKER_01]: eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have you been playing around with crossing
with other things too?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I have like a massive collection.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I have, I have about 200 lines.
[SPEAKER_01]: Under my belt of hybrids, you know,
um, just F ones in bread lines,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, back crosses, but yeah,
approaching 200 lines over 10 years of
[SPEAKER_01]: breeding.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, and this is, this is one of the great
ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: This diamond dust, which is the next one
is probably our most well-known and we run
[SPEAKER_01]: this in Vegas, uh, and it's our best
seller.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the diamond dust is a hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, double dream, sour bubble,
uh, lemon haze and bubble gum.
[SPEAKER_01]: But what's interesting about it,
it has, it leans towards an OG turf
[SPEAKER_01]: profile without having any OG lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that was one of the reasons I,
that was part of the goal in that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm still working on this line.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, it's a long, you know, years in
progress, but the goal is to create a
[SPEAKER_01]: beautiful OG turf profile with no,
OG lineage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and so you're creating a much more
vigorous strain because the OGs are really
[SPEAKER_01]: finicky strains that have been bred indoor
forever inbred.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're just like, they're,
they're, they're great product,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it is tough to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this diamond dust, the goal is to make
something that has that profile,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's just really vigorous to grow
easier to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is kind of like part of that
project.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's diamond dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over here, we got some, some other
stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got more diamond dust.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the way back here.
[SPEAKER_00]: The beginning of this row is diamond dust.
[SPEAKER_01]: Diamond dust here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then stopping here, this is G13.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ah, that's a G13, but it's actually a,
it's not the real G13.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a, a new take G13 2.0 we'll call it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the reason I, I'm taking the liberty
of calling a G13 because the bubble gum
[SPEAKER_01]: male that I started this line with came
from Elfer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Frank and Mel Frank, he worked with the
university of Mississippi.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I thought, Oh, you know what?
[SPEAKER_01]: We can call this G13 and get away with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause we work with Mel on the bubble gum,
but yeah, this is the G13 that that row is
[SPEAKER_01]: also G13.
[SPEAKER_01]: G13 is just like a super potent kind of
like, you know, heavy here.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember in the late nineties,
uh, coming across that and in Rhode Island
[SPEAKER_01]: and Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: That, that was some powerful stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're, we're trying to bring the G13
back, but yeah, giving out our own twist,
[SPEAKER_01]: but it's a really nice strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, uh, it's a very well, well loved
in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We grow a lot of it in Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we know that, you know,
the Cali market will like it as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's about it for the varieties in
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's going on over here?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's G13 as well.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: The whole, that's all G13.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all, that's all G13.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how, how many, uh, how many plants are
in each bay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we have, let's see, five tables here.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about 200, uh, and 50 per table,
approximately in here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and that's because we're doing our
bigger room.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually it'd only be about 200,
but because we're doing our bigger room,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's about 250 per table.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what, what's the breakdown of,
of cultivars you're growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: That you love and cultivars you're growing
that you're like, I like it, but the
[SPEAKER_00]: market fucking loves it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, uh, I'm, I've kind of in line with the
market in many ways, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: but I would say 20% of what we grow is
stuff that I wouldn't necessarily
[SPEAKER_01]: personally want to smoke.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, like I'm not a huge Sativa fan,
you know, like I would, I wouldn't smoke
[SPEAKER_01]: J1 probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we run, you know, quite a bit of J1.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I'm a big OG fan.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like, I like perps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, um, those are the strains,
you know, we kind of gravitate towards
[SPEAKER_01]: partly because the market just loves them.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, I might be biased to grow a little
more of it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's something you personally love
that's not, uh, in the lineup right now?
[SPEAKER_01]: Ooh, that's a great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love Mendo perps.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's one of my favorite all time strains,
but we don't run it.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the unfortunate thing is,
unfortunately California is still,
[SPEAKER_01]: is, is as much experience California has
in cannabis, the rec market is really
[SPEAKER_01]: immature, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so a strain like Mendo perps,
which has a great taste and just a great
[SPEAKER_01]: effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a great plant to grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just doesn't, it has a low THC count.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, it's like 16 to 18 and the
market just isn't super receptive to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I want to bring back like a Mendo
perp, you know, like a true Mendo perp,
[SPEAKER_01]: like people love purple punch,
you know, but it's the same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everyone runs it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I am kind of working on a perp hybrid
in the background that I want to bring,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, into production at some point.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then with the moms kind of what's your
strategy in terms of like how long you
[SPEAKER_00]: keep each one, how many clippings you can
get off them when you basically yank them?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we, uh, we, we'd like to recycle
them relatively quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like.
[SPEAKER_01]: Three to four months, you know?
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then, you know, getting every time
we take cuttings off it, 30 to 40,
[SPEAKER_01]: really good cuttings per mom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this room eventually won't have any veg
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: It'll be about 150 to 200 moms.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, we'll take maybe half of
those moms will take 20 clones of each mom
[SPEAKER_01]: every couple of weeks and they'll cycle
back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what, how many in here are vegging
right now versus moms?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're all vegging and our moms are
going to be the select few chosen plants
[SPEAKER_01]: of each variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll take, you know, like our top
eight of each variety and those will
[SPEAKER_01]: become our mothers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go check out the clone, the clone
room next door.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is a clone room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're pretty empty right now, but we're
taking clones on Friday.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this will be filled again Friday
evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's your kind of method?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you take the clippings, are you
dunking them in anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you, uh, pretty standard, standard
propagation with domes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're, um, taking our clones and dipping
them in a rooting hormone and then
[SPEAKER_01]: sticking them in a 1.5 inch block.
[SPEAKER_01]: And over here we have some experimentals.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are kind of the, this is the fun
stuff here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what are we looking at?
[SPEAKER_01]: So all of these, well, there's about,
uh, I don't know, maybe half a dozen new
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties that came from lines I've been
working on, um, that we're just getting to
[SPEAKER_01]: the test phase where we've random ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: We like what they had to offer,
whether it was, you know, the subjective
[SPEAKER_01]: or objective testing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now we're going to put them in a
production room and see how they perform
[SPEAKER_01]: on a smaller scale.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we'll get flour from those.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then if we like, we like that flour
and we really think it has a chance of
[SPEAKER_01]: getting in production, then it'll go in
production in the next cycle of the cycle
[SPEAKER_01]: after.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we have, these are the diamond dust
F2s, our top four varieties so far.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, we have some more of that MLG variety.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's five phenos that we really like in
the MLG.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the 17.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is an F2 of our SCI 40.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, the Donna OG is a strain that we,
we've, we've ran for years.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, and then just some other random stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have, um, purple dream, emerald
triangle, more diamond dust F2s.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have some, some kind of classic strains
are in the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like the mimosa, the gelato 33,
uh, the BI, BI 28 is a pre 98 Baba ghost
[SPEAKER_01]: OG over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sorry.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all the experimental stuff
essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have, uh, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have more over here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are, yeah, this is kind of some,
um, off the mo you know, standard,
[SPEAKER_01]: uh, dark heart purple city kind of
genetics that we're running as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then what's the, uh, the humidity in
here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, we keep the, the, the clone room
pretty humid.
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to stay like at 70%.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just so when we're doing acclimation,
uh, dome removal, the clones don't have
[SPEAKER_01]: any transition stress.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you use domes.
[SPEAKER_01]: We use domes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, we're just cleaning and getting ready
for the next production cycle.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we'll show you in the flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the, is everything in here going
to be on automated, uh, irrigation too?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, so for the clone room, we have a tank
in the, in the water room that feeds in
here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the guys will have like a hose.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just irrigates whatever they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You don't really need a lot of water here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We rarely need more than five gallons at a
time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the tank will be mixed automatically.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whenever they need water, they distill up
a five gallon bucket and they can hand
[SPEAKER_01]: water.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to be experimenting with some
type of like, um, misting system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we could reduce labor in here,
but that's, you know, later next year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clone room, and then we have flower
four.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not up and running yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're just using it as like a storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is going to be probably the next room
that we flip after flower room five.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's kind of getting ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is the next build out after five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have everything, all the
infrastructure is ready.
[SPEAKER_01]: We just need lighting and we need HVAC.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean only HVAC and lighting.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the bedroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is another room that's closer that we
have to build out still two.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's going to be a two level LED.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you're, you're going to see the
lights.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to put shelving in.
[SPEAKER_01]: We will.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Probably the PIP horticulture rocks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have like 3000 pounds of burrows
shelving in my driveway.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why you don't like the burrows or why?
[SPEAKER_01]: You ended up using it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my house.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically they, they sent me a shelving
for my garage so I could like play with
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it showed up and it's 12 foot
shelving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just like, this won't even fit
in my garage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was always going to bring it to the
nursery I was working at and carpenteria,
[SPEAKER_00]: but then we needed like an F one 50 to
load it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: And every time we were trying to
coordinate getting a truck down like,
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, it's still on my driveway.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you need, if I need burrows,
I'll hit you up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Burrows is actually looked at burrows too,
but we ended up, we're thinking about
[SPEAKER_01]: going with PIP probably.
[SPEAKER_01]: So here's our flower room.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, so basically every other light is HPS
ceramic metal highlight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have J one.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a day 17 of flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is our metric tracking.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you enjoying, are you loving metric?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, we had luckily some
experience in Nevada, so we're used to
[SPEAKER_01]: metric and we've been using it for a
couple of years.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some little changes between the
states, but for the most part,
[SPEAKER_00]: the water is coming out here and then it's
just running down this.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stake drip irrigation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is the snake eyes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so how many more weeks do these have?
[SPEAKER_00]: Eight, eight more weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we, we go really full term compared to
a lot of growers, but some growers grow
[SPEAKER_01]: eight, a lot of growers grow nine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We go 10 just to push the trichrome
production, to push the terpene levels.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then just the chlorophyll reduction.
[SPEAKER_01]: As well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when you go 10 weeks,
you get a big drop off in chlorophyll,
[SPEAKER_01]: even though it's still growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when you harvest, you're closer to
where you need to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, this is, do you have different,
so you, even though you have different
[SPEAKER_00]: varietals in here, you're flowering them
all for the same number of weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This logistically, it's easier at this
point, but it gives us a little bit of
[SPEAKER_01]: flexibility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though we go 10 weeks,
you know, at nine and a half weeks,
[SPEAKER_01]: we could start to harvest different
varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if we want to do fresh frozen,
we'll harvest a row at nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, are you going to do, so are you going
to do fresh frozen and then hand it off to
[SPEAKER_00]: a partner or?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we've done that in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I don't know if we're going to
do that yet, but it's an option.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always a nice option.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then is that going to be like in
Nevada where you're doing it for,
[SPEAKER_00]: like solventless hash or for hydrocarbon?
[SPEAKER_01]: It was more for hydrocarbon in Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would prefer to do a solventless
extract, you know, like a fresh frozen,
[SPEAKER_01]: like live rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be something I would much
rather do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, but yeah, that's something we're
working out right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in the beginning, it's going to be
flower focused and then we'll kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: transition into more extracts if we need
to.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the money shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the money shot for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So do you spray this stuff with any
foliars or not at all?
[SPEAKER_01]: We do foliars.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do like phosphorus foliar, nitrogen
foliar, and we do do like zero to a little
[SPEAKER_01]: bit, which is hydrogen peroxide and the
paracetic acid, but not late, just really
[SPEAKER_01]: early on in flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're experimenting with like regalia and
a couple of others.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's marrone, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's marrone.
[SPEAKER_00]: Marrone, yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's marrone.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what kind of pest does one see in like
an LA indoor grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully zero, but over the years,
I mean, everything under the sun,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, we've seen.
[SPEAKER_01]: But right now, the only thing we've really
had to deal with, luckily, knock on wood,
[SPEAKER_01]: for the last three or four years,
has been fungus gnats, which are more of a
[SPEAKER_01]: nuisance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they just stick around forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we've been really kind of psychotic
about cleanliness and mainly doing all
[SPEAKER_01]: strain development in-house and not
bringing new cultivars in from other
[SPEAKER_01]: breeders unless they're like seriously
quarantined.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I was going to say you need to have
some SOV around the quarantine process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so we do that and it takes a really
long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as you saw, we bring in new varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a very thorough process and they
don't come in for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes, you know, three to four months
before we're really, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: beyond the point where we're happy to
bring in varieties that we have inspected.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what is your expectation for the yield
out of this room?
[SPEAKER_01]: 162.375 pounds of flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: 162 pounds in some change.
[SPEAKER_01]: 162 pounds.
[SPEAKER_01]: OK, got it, got it, got it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have like really good data on yield.
[SPEAKER_01]: So our projections like, you know,
when we make projections on yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really close.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we should be within five percent of
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully better, hopefully above.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are there any, like you've been
growing for a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you still learning?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, are there things you've incorporated
into how you cultivate recently that you
[SPEAKER_00]: weren't doing three, four years ago?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, yeah, 100 percent.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the mixed spectrum is,
you know, like two months old,
[SPEAKER_01]: something we've done before, but never on
production.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's something new we wanted to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, we could play with the
spectrum.
[SPEAKER_01]: And kind of alter it throughout the cycle
to see if we can maximize yield or terpene
[SPEAKER_01]: production or cannabinoid production.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's something new.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've been growing for rock wall forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's not really new.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are bringing in a lot more automation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So automation on the irrigation side,
not something really new, but using preva,
[SPEAKER_01]: which I consider like the Rolls Royce,
the Fertigation, that's new for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: What like, so take as an example,
the Vegas facility, what's its system?
[SPEAKER_01]: So that one's just a traditional tank
system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every room has a tank and we have to mix
the tanks by hand every week, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it's a smaller scale facility.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like at that scale automation,
it gets really expensive, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: per square foot.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this was big enough where we justified
the Fertigation system.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the preva just allows us to have like
really precise control.
[SPEAKER_01]: And just the expandability and the
creativity of things we could do with the
[SPEAKER_01]: preva to me is exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, eventually it'll also take over
our environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the lights, the irrigation,
the airflow, temperature, humidity,
[SPEAKER_01]: everything will be automated.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once you have the automation and the
ability to monitor the data, what's kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of like one thing you're excited to
research?
[SPEAKER_01]: Spectrum, you know, using lighting and
spectrum to change terpene and cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: profiles.
[SPEAKER_00]: So basically there you could set up this
room with a certain spectrum, the room
[SPEAKER_00]: next door with a different spectrum,
everything else consistent and see what
[SPEAKER_00]: the difference is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we could do things like adding LEDs
like in one specific part of the spectrum
[SPEAKER_01]: at one part of the, you know, flower cycle
and see how that affects things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So lighting is exciting.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just like little things like pruning
techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: And at this point we've done so much
research.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's all little things we're
doing research on, but like pruning,
[SPEAKER_01]: lighting, always making the plant
nutrition better, dialing in our feeds,
[SPEAKER_01]: dialing in the dry back, the environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, I just always trying to do,
think of whatever we can to improve the
[SPEAKER_01]: operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What about, are you guys like,
how much training are you doing during the
[SPEAKER_00]: process of the plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: We try to do a lot of training.
[SPEAKER_01]: So every week we try to have a training
module on a different part of the
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation.
[SPEAKER_01]: So like this week we're doing propagation.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then next week we'll do a training
module on loading, loading a flower room,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, sorry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was thinking more like training the
plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, oh, that type of training.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we do zero training whatsoever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know, that was one of the learning
curves over the year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Training becomes so labor intensive and
it's, it's such an art that on production,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's really hard to do right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Actually, can we, can I walk down here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let me, let me get you a,
yeah, you could go down this row,
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever row you want to go down.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So talk about the philosophy while we're
walking.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So for, for training, like I said,
we don't do any, any training at this
[SPEAKER_01]: point.
[SPEAKER_01]: These trellis nets are just supports for
the vertical growth.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just reduces the labor.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants grow naturally and you just put
in trellis nets at different stages to
[SPEAKER_01]: keep them from falling over when the
flowers get too big.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's our, that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sorry, you said there's one room where
you're going to have a second level,
[SPEAKER_00]: not every room, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's an R and D room.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we'll be doing a lot of phenotype
hunting in that room.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll be doing lighting research on LEDs.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in that room, we don't necessarily need
the height because it's more for research
[SPEAKER_01]: and breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_01]: But once they leave that room,
they'll come back into these rooms for
[SPEAKER_01]: production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And typically how tall are these getting
by the time they're done?
[SPEAKER_01]: They're from the table.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe five and a half feet at the tallest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes they'll get too tall,
like six feet, six and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're trying to reduce it down to about
five and a half feet for our big
[SPEAKER_01]: varieties.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like J1 is just a monster.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just keeps going.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't stop.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, it's already pretty big.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that the end of the tour?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the end of the tour.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks for coming by.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'd like to get you back though in
about four weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When these things are massive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's time it for peak LA traffic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah, there you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah, and that's where we couldn't come
through before.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, there's the barrier.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all making sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you in a couple of weeks.
[SPEAKER_01]: See you in a couple weeks.
See you in a couple weeks.
Bye.
Bye.
