[SPEAKER_04]: It has your distribution for you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we have our own distribution
license.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been friends with Rise for a long
time, but then they changed, and like
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody else, just don't have control
over what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're our fulfillment partner,
so they do all the last mile stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our real focus is to, besides
cultivators, is just to make sure that we
[SPEAKER_00]: do our own testing and packaging and all
that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we have a sales team,
so we keep the relationships with the
[SPEAKER_00]: clubs, because we had them, you know,
and didn't want to give them away to
[SPEAKER_00]: someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know the drill.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so what do you want to share with
Fred?
[SPEAKER_01]: And can you kind of talk about that
cultivar?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't speak to this cultivar as much as
the people that farmed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is Sunroots Farm Cultivation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is a great example for us,
because we're always talking about
[SPEAKER_00]: sungrown versus indoor, and now that dates
are on labeling, everybody's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, what's up?
[SPEAKER_00]: That was produced in October, and it's
July.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's the sungrown, and people in
Southern California are starting to
[SPEAKER_00]: understand the cycle of sungrown and the
seasons of it all.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a great example of a flower
that I can put in front of a biro and be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, this is indoor, and they're like,
oh, it's great, and they're like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, this is actually last year's outdoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a great, it's a really good
strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, the Velvet Purps is a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've been rocking it for a while,
and it's just so resinous, and it's got
[SPEAKER_00]: that sappiness to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's got super high terpenes, and it's got
that sap to it that kind of suspends it in
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It smokes, and for me, I can be like,
I have a tendency to have a more anxious
[SPEAKER_00]: feeling, and so I've got to be careful
about coffee and things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's cannabis, I'm pretty sensitive
to, and this is such a, it's just very
[SPEAKER_00]: calming for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes me feel good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's a great example of sungrown.
[SPEAKER_04]: I feel a good nose.
[SPEAKER_04]: It kind of reminds me of sweet tarts.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's super.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpy, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: What do we have to smoke it out of?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we have something here to smoke it out
of?
[SPEAKER_04]: We could always roll a joint.
Yeah.
See.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you have your own farm, and you also
work with other farmers?
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is one of the other farmers you
work with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our only thing that I cultivate on is a
2,500 square foot license.
[SPEAKER_00]: I, in Mendocino, in the community,
over the last, really over the last five
[SPEAKER_00]: years, there's been a big push to other
people trying to sell their flowers
[SPEAKER_00]: through us and get to retail.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you still have an Ingrid?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we have Ingrid over there,
absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good example of one that was in
the sun way too long today, and I'm like,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's not exactly how I want it to look,
but it's a beautiful strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, so really, one of my,
I think one of my strengths more than
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation was going out and being the
voice of a group of us that were
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivating, rather than someone coming in
and saying, yeah, I can sell your herb for
[SPEAKER_00]: you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, hey guys, I'll do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll fucking get out there and do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's kind of, so we cultivate a
little bit, but really it's an aggregation
[SPEAKER_00]: of a lot of small farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, we've taken a little bit of a
different approach.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like talking trees, we just, it's all
single source, but there's also that need
[SPEAKER_04]: to help out other communities.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're going to develop another brand so
that we'll have like this mountains brand,
[SPEAKER_04]: and then we can like co-brand other farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the talking tree is like, we know,
we always, it's just, we grew it.
[SPEAKER_04]: We know everything about it.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it sucks, we're going to take it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it's our farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, so yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, what are you both seeing down here?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what if, what if yours is selling in
the LA market and like, what, what are you
[SPEAKER_01]: noticing in kind of different markets
across the state?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like LA, the Bay area, your home turf?
[SPEAKER_04]: LA seems to me to be the hardest to tap in
the smallest volumes that we like,
[SPEAKER_04]: we see compared to some Bay area stores
tend to go deeper.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think LA there's so much, so if you do
get in a store, maybe they'll order sizes,
[SPEAKER_04]: or at least to our experience so far,
the volume of the orders aren't as big as
[SPEAKER_04]: say, North Cal or in our own backyard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though it's a much bigger market,
there's so many more players and more
[SPEAKER_04]: competition, I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so different.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's so different than the Northern
California market too, as far as like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you get a lot of like, the like can get
indoor for 17, you know, kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's a lot of indoor being
cultivated in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a still a lot of
education needs to go in and sun grown to
[SPEAKER_00]: get more momentum in that, in the market
down here.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just, just our experience down
here over the last year, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's, it is incredible how many people are
unaware of, of the agricultural cycle of
[SPEAKER_00]: the seasons of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when something, they want something
full sun and then it, and it was harvested
[SPEAKER_00]: in December and they're getting it in
June.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, it's like, oh wow, you didn't
know that this was harvested because
[SPEAKER_00]: that's when, that's the end of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah, it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_01]: You make free rolls, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you make free rolls?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we do make some free rolls for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: I assume you're not psyched that like a
free roll is like someone's first
[SPEAKER_01]: experience with your brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you'd probably rather have someone
start with like flour and make their own
[SPEAKER_01]: joint.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I go to, I would go into my store
and get a free roll first thing,
[SPEAKER_04]: just cause like if I'm traveling or moving
around, it's easy just to grab a free
[SPEAKER_04]: roll.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a flour guy.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather smoke a joint than a bowl or.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I'm totally a flour guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's where flour flour to the end.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the pre roll market is so like,
people are really intimidated because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's so much, unfortunately,
like there's a lot of product that people
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know what to do with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what makes it into a free roll.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I'm sure like these guys, like we
basically, we take our flowers and we
[SPEAKER_00]: grade them.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're all of the a buds and things that
we decide not to put into an eighth jars,
[SPEAKER_00]: what a free roll is turned into.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not like you're taking trim and
you're taking random things, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Free rolls are good.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll smoke your free rolls all day,
bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_04]: They gotta go quick, you know,
cause once you break it down, it starts to
[SPEAKER_04]: degrade.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, I mean, we tried to go for a model of
like packed or, you know, packed to order,
[SPEAKER_04]: pre rolled to order, which you can't do
anymore because the testing changed,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we just can't keep up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like, we're just constantly.
[SPEAKER_04]: Free rolls, free rolls, free rolls.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're out the door and feel good
about that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd hate to see them sit around for a
month and then go out.
[SPEAKER_04]: Probably the budget flower, like a nine,
$10 eight.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've got a little bit, I mean,
the live market's a little hard to crack.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so many players and the prices are
low and we've done really well with bubble
[SPEAKER_04]: hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've done really well with bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: We just do full spectrum, 70 U,
good old bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: $10 a gram wholesale.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it hits the customers about 20,
25.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, all that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we use it for all our edibles,
our ice water hash infused as well.
Can we look at one?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is so funny how it all like full
circle, the BHO bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I always just straight away from
the solvent world and just like,
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll make bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll make bubble hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we use it for like space jam and
the teas and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, and then it just becomes like,
oh wow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Bubble hash is what we sell more than
anything else.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have European people hitting us up
trying to buy it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like multiple guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, and they're like, oh, we're coming
to the United States and we love sour
[SPEAKER_04]: diesel.
[SPEAKER_04]: We want to buy a lot.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm like, well, we can't sell it to
you.
Sorry.
[SPEAKER_04]: It tastes good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've always rather smoke it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's ungrown over indoor myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys do indoor too?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can I open this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you guys are cultivating everything
yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: What permits do you guys have?
[SPEAKER_00]: What permits do you guys have?
[SPEAKER_04]: I have five outdoor permits, one under
5,000 indoor permit and a micro business
[SPEAKER_04]: permit that includes cultivation nursery
specialty indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: Distribution and retail.
[SPEAKER_04]: I have nine permits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt County, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely like, that's always the
balance between small farmers being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to scale up a little bit to be able to
actually grow enough to penetrate the
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's easy to aggregate when you're
aggregating like a 2,500 square foot and a
[SPEAKER_00]: 5,000 square foot and a 2,500 square foot.
[SPEAKER_00]: You actually end up being maybe the canopy
that's similar to what you have with the
[SPEAKER_00]: five permits, you know?
[SPEAKER_04]: CDFA is like the worst.
[SPEAKER_04]: CDFA is the worst at getting permits.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting permits is not easy at all still.
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: BCC is much easier than CDFA.
[SPEAKER_04]: CDFA is just like really difficult and
taking forever and moving slow.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whereas if you have a micro business or
retail or distribution or CDPH,
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturing permits seem to all be so
much easier than getting a cultivation
[SPEAKER_04]: permit.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I work with three different local
municipalities, City of Eureka,
[SPEAKER_04]: City of Arcata, and then Humboldt County.
[SPEAKER_04]: The county has always been the hardest.
[SPEAKER_04]: Eureka was the last to come on,
but it was like the easiest.
[SPEAKER_04]: They actually hosted the best cannabis
mixer I've ever been to like a week or two
[SPEAKER_04]: ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they've issued 59 permits in the last
year, give or take.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the City of Eureka?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, City of Eureka.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they brought in like a half a
million in permit fees.
[SPEAKER_04]: They gave us all these statistics.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's created this many jobs.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's bringing this much money into the
economy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We love cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's one building that was empty for 14
years until a cannabis business moved in.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's like even the city sees a great
economic story and it's good to see.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So they're getting easier.
[SPEAKER_04]: The locals are getting easier,
I think.
[SPEAKER_04]: Unless you're dealing with CDFW is also a
nightmare when it comes to cultivation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dealing with fish and wildlife is very
hard.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it July 1st, one of those deadlines?
[SPEAKER_04]: July 1st, there's a new water board
regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: I defuse that stuff to other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't remember the details, but a new
water board enrollment and everybody that
[SPEAKER_04]: grows has to be enrolled with the water
board.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so they're rolling out a whole new
program that you have to be signed on.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of cultivators, a lot of friends,
people that I know with permits,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're in scientific review right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're waiting on their provisional
license and they're in this suspended
[SPEAKER_00]: state waiting.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're on CDFW.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, hopefully they'll start to turn on.
[SPEAKER_04]: When do you decide what you're going to
grow for the coming season?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the farm that we have is close to
the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we rock genetics out there that we've
been doing just because they work well in
[SPEAKER_00]: those environments and conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you go closer to the coast,
you definitely have to be thinking as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as like molds and things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are the genetics that work well?
[SPEAKER_00]: We rock watermelon ranchers.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's really, really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's been a great strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: The AK is another strain that I don't know
exactly why it works so well out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this particular cut works so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely an old school classic AK.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's big fucking resinous buds,
but they don't mold out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we rocked it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's Ellie's gift out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we're doing again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's what we've been doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then everybody else in the group and
kind of like you, it's like people have
[SPEAKER_00]: been cultivating the same genetics for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are still breeding and trying to do
different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: But a lot of people are just setting up
the same thing that they knocked out last
[SPEAKER_00]: year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mark from Shelby Veg is doing the
grapefruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mikey's doing the Viper cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Gabe is doing the Ingrid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people go with what they know.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's definitely, once you change it up,
it can be a rabbit hole.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as you know, finding a good genetic is
not easy to come by.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a lot of fucking work.
[SPEAKER_04]: We do a little bit of both.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a few staples.
[SPEAKER_04]: For now, they could change with like
Skittles, maybe the Huckleberry.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we're trying to get over a year ahead
and work on new genetics and try and just
[SPEAKER_04]: come out with new strains every year.
[SPEAKER_04]: But that's like a work in progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we did a lot of crosses last year
and we got this really good pink lemonade
[SPEAKER_04]: male.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we just back, we just crossed that
with Skittles, White Tahoe Cookies,
[SPEAKER_04]: Candy Land, a bunch of stuff, Golden
Lemons.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we just popped all those seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: So now we're going to, you know,
feno hunt them, flower them all indoor.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just kind of pick the winners and then
try and build those up for next season and
[SPEAKER_04]: try and just at least have something in
our profile that's always just brand new
[SPEAKER_04]: and hopefully the next big strain.
[SPEAKER_04]: You never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you, from the time like you start
the process to the time you find
[SPEAKER_00]: something, to the time it's actually ready
in the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: At least two years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_00]: People that don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Breeding and getting a stable,
good genetic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stick out is definitely a process.
[SPEAKER_00]: So everything you're doing, wasn't this
started last month?
[SPEAKER_04]: We've been working on for almost a year
already by growing it and picking the
[SPEAKER_04]: selections.
[SPEAKER_04]: The males were grown last year.
[SPEAKER_04]: We cloned them or kept the pollen.
[SPEAKER_04]: Ideally we try to keep the pollen in the
clones.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the new, the initial cross with the
pollen that we saved and then we can keep
[SPEAKER_04]: the clones going and produce more of that
same pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, first off, do you think that people
should be happy to have the ability to
[SPEAKER_00]: patent their strains?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't really have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a fucking rabbit hole question for
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm just going to say I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I would say the key play is just
to keep it really tight and win a couple
[SPEAKER_04]: cups, enter it into things, make the
recognition, let people know, work with
[SPEAKER_04]: the people that you got the genetics from,
if they're breeders as well, give them the
[SPEAKER_04]: recognition and just make it own the
strain.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's like you don't have to
trademark something if you are the one
[SPEAKER_00]: that's known for doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you decide, if you build it up and
then you decide to give it to somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: else to do it, then it's like they can do
it because you've given it to them,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's not talking trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the brand goes a long way to protect
the genetic itself.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I see why people would do it,
but it's just not my thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd rather share something great with
everybody and let them play with it and
[SPEAKER_04]: see what they do with it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's, I think that's art.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, that's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Breeding and like plant patents and all
that has been a huge conversation in the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis community these days with
everything that's been happening with
[SPEAKER_00]: phyllis bioscience and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So funny times.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you feel like smoking?
[SPEAKER_00]: Any, any flower man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Flower for sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: See what we got here.
[SPEAKER_04]: All we have is indoor right now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Try the huckleberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's up with you guys as far as
distribution working for you guys?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Um, we do, I do all my own distribution
through high grade distribution.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I mean, it's going pretty good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a lot of work, but we're in probably
over 120 stores now.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's moving.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, we sold out of flowers though.
[SPEAKER_04]: And, uh, I mean, I did try like,
you know, putting, getting some other
[SPEAKER_04]: homies.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, Oh, I know you're a good grower.
[SPEAKER_04]: I haven't seen your problem.
[SPEAKER_04]: A few years, but, and, uh, people notice.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so it's like, ah, my reps were getting
upset.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, well, dude, you're the one
that's not making any money for not
[SPEAKER_04]: selling flower.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're good.
[SPEAKER_04]: We already developed a brand and then
it'll be like, all right, we can showcase
[SPEAKER_04]: other farms through that brand and just
kind of run this branding as a single
[SPEAKER_04]: source.
[SPEAKER_04]: When we run out, it's out.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of like it's seasonal product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you could be like, yo, everybody be
patient because when you get it again,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a current volume of, uh, Canada,
just how I've learned in the last season
[SPEAKER_04]: is that probably have enough.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause it was like, you know, it was last
year.
[SPEAKER_04]: It was like making moves where we had to
make moves.
[SPEAKER_04]: But, uh, we have the cultivation can be
that can probably get us through about a
[SPEAKER_04]: year of supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: As we're growing.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so that's good.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of it as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys, I mean, you got the indoor,
but you've been harvesting already,
[SPEAKER_04]: right?
[SPEAKER_04]: My indoor, I'm only at 1200 square feet
built out right now, just cause I have the
[SPEAKER_04]: permits, but not the money for the build
outs, but we have 49,000 square foot
[SPEAKER_04]: outdoor, you know, uh, 30, low 30,000 of
it's mostly mixed, you know, greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_04]: pull and tarps.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we started harvesting first,
second, week of July, a little,
[SPEAKER_04]: little, a little bit behind this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I like to harvest on like a fourth of
July, but it'll be about a week late.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cause I mean where I'm at, just in my
light depths in general, almost everything
[SPEAKER_04]: finishes about a week early.
[SPEAKER_03]: So, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean right now we're not
harvesting anything on the outdoor scale
[SPEAKER_04]: from, you know, October through July.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then July, it'll be nonstop till
October, always harvesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you can still keep your product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not selling any bull.
[SPEAKER_04]: So if I sell bulk, I'm going to help
friends out and sell their product as bulk
[SPEAKER_04]: and only do package for my, my flowers.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, I mean right now we're still in
the growth phase and could have sold a lot
[SPEAKER_04]: more weed if I had it, but, uh,
we made it to like May with some still
[SPEAKER_04]: haven't flowered and we plan to produce
more this year.
[SPEAKER_04]: Every year we add more fans.
[SPEAKER_04]: We added this ad, you know, like it's
always getting better.
[SPEAKER_04]: The infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The huckleberry is a strain that actually
got from a father-in-law of mine.
[SPEAKER_04]: Uh, that was great.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think out in Trinity and so,
uh, Trinity County.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we got seeds of it and grew it for
two different seasons.
[SPEAKER_04]: It just Fino hunted what we call,
we labeled the huckleberry, but it's the
[SPEAKER_04]: huckleberry three is the Fino.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's really nice, like fruity,
uplifting, tasty bud.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we can roll a joint in that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's true, but I think they have
smaller limits on like canopy and stuff,
[SPEAKER_04]: but probably easier to deal with in terms
of the grading and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when you're dealing with CDFW,
they're CDFW and they're statewide and
[SPEAKER_04]: they're not County and they're going to be
your biggest nightmare.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: As an outdoor grower in the Hills,
CDF.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, they have been for me,
maybe other people's different stories are
[SPEAKER_04]: different, but most people I know in the
Hills of humble, that's been their biggest
[SPEAKER_04]: hurdle to getting a permit to CDFW.
[SPEAKER_01]: What about the farmer?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's definitely the case for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the local lag department and the cow
fire and even the water board,
[SPEAKER_00]: like state inspectors, but fish and
wildlife is definitely a serious business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't give a fuck about cannabis and
you know, cause their job is to protect
[SPEAKER_00]: fish and wildlife, you know, so,
but it's been, it's been good,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, but yeah, a lot of hurdles.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a real thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do
[SPEAKER_03]: I?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not necessarily.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think, yeah, everybody has the
rights to cultivate and their quality is
[SPEAKER_00]: quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, so I think Appalachian,
I think like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that, yeah, we'll see.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, Appalachians, there's definitely
something to it because even the grow off
[SPEAKER_04]: is a great example of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can give 10 growers the same exact
cutting and even on indoor, I mean,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can give 10 growers the same indoor
cut.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all going to come out different.
[SPEAKER_04]: So that just kind of speaks to like,
yeah, there's something to Appalachia and
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, nothing against Salinas or Santa
Barbara or anywhere that's growing,
[SPEAKER_04]: but elevation definitely can play a key
and a lot of Mendo, Humboldt, Trinity.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're between that 600 to 2000 foot
elevation and it's pretty prime,
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis growing weather.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's just, you have to,
you definitely have to have early bird
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to have stuff that comes down
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unless you're pulling tarps, but for us,
we're doing a full season crop out on the
[SPEAKER_00]: coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we don't want strains that
are going to be going too far into you
[SPEAKER_00]: know, late September, ideally they're all
coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just strains that do well, strains that
are airy, you know, strains that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, that are kind of grow and they
allow good light to come through and air
[SPEAKER_00]: flow to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the trick is like not, you know,
giving them exactly what they need and
[SPEAKER_00]: building the soil out there for a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, I think one of the biggest
things out on the coast is just not
[SPEAKER_00]: overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're in the valley and you have
like super high temperatures, it's a whole
[SPEAKER_00]: different animal.
[SPEAKER_00]: But on the coast, just less is more,
more oxygen is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: That smells good.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dry farming is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I wish I could do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dry farming is definitely because you're
really close to the water source on the
[SPEAKER_04]: riverbed and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: You got to grow the right strains because
you're going to deal with a lot of
[SPEAKER_04]: moisture, similar to growing on the coast.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I mean, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been, I've visited a couple of dry
farms.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, wow, you never water these
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: You plant them.
[SPEAKER_04]: They're like, yeah, they droop for like
the first week and then they just come
[SPEAKER_04]: back up and do their thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Pretty cool.
[SPEAKER_04]: Wish I could do that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I'd say in general, a lot of farmers
typically historically do overwater.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah,
[SPEAKER_04]: we try to conserve as much water as
possible.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're always experimenting and nothing
really to the methodology.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, there's like some hot strains out
there or some breeders that are putting
[SPEAKER_04]: out new, new genetics.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're just trying to play with it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's part of the fun of it for me.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's just seeing all the varieties of
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: One strain I've been liking a lot lately
that I couldn't tell you the breeder off
[SPEAKER_04]: the top of my head is the lemon Royale.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Really nice.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just that lemony, lemony, just scent and
it's got a little bit of the OG cushy
[SPEAKER_04]: lemon, just yumminess to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a good one.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been my favorite lately.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, honestly, now there's another
criteria is like we go ahead and like,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh, this is awesome.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's do the potency test because
unfortunately we're dealing with that bias
[SPEAKER_04]: and we'd rather have stuff that's going to
be like, oh, it's over 25%.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: If it's amazing bud and test at 14,
15%, it's like, well, we'll keep it
[SPEAKER_04]: around, but unfortunately people buy by
that.
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the turps?
[SPEAKER_03]: What about the turps?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually turp test all our smokables.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have, we think turps are important.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's more just beyond turps in THC
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's more going on to like synergies of
it because even some of the better
[SPEAKER_04]: strengths grains that get me really high
have low turps in low cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_04]: sometimes.
[SPEAKER_04]: So there's obviously something else,
but there's all kinds of factors.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do we think of that?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's super bomb, super tasty.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's all our indoor soil grown,
TE, organic.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're already doing indoor?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, just smaller amount.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think it just produces a better
tasting product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Growing in... I've personally never done
anything besides oil, but I've seen and
[SPEAKER_04]: been around a lot of different systems and
I know like the flood and drain systems
[SPEAKER_04]: work really well.
[SPEAKER_04]: All the grow down systems.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, those are more efficient and tend
to be higher yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: So from a business standpoint,
it does make more sense to go and more
[SPEAKER_04]: hydro sense.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even though they're growing great quality
cannabis too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've smoked some, it's really
good, but I've just always preferred soil.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just a preference.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think the turps come out a little
stronger.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I've heard extractors that extract
with product say that they get a better
[SPEAKER_04]: extract out of the same strain if it was
soil grown versus say salt grown,
[SPEAKER_04]: hydro style.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you make your own nutrients?
[SPEAKER_04]: No, we blend like, you know, products we
get.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thankfully we work with this company
called Soilscape Solutions that Sam's
[SPEAKER_04]: great.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, he's great.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he's actually developed this foliar.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've always been kind of an anti foliar
person, but he's like, just, you got to
[SPEAKER_04]: try, you got to try it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we've been trying it and it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like all these micro minerals.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think there's like 18
ingredients in it, but it's extremely,
[SPEAKER_04]: you use like three mils to like a hundred
gallons or something.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like don't quote me on the ratios and
stuff, but it's extremely low amount and
[SPEAKER_04]: it's very effective.
[SPEAKER_04]: Very, very effective.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's been amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: He helps us develop the right programs to
keep plants really healthy.
[SPEAKER_04]: All organically.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what are some of the lessons we've
learned?
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm not a soil scientist.
[SPEAKER_04]: What about me?
[SPEAKER_04]: So we got to rely on you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, not so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I've been doing it a long time.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I used to buy my own nutrients and
lime and dolomite and, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: blend it all together.
[SPEAKER_04]: The back Juano's and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: But when someone else can just do that and
more balanced ratio based off like testing
[SPEAKER_04]: the soil and develop a product,
program and get, you know, I'm just like
[SPEAKER_04]: tossing it in like this, this way,
you know, this is what I've learned.
[SPEAKER_04]: So nothing that was like amazed like by
the necessarily, but just like the
[SPEAKER_04]: specific knowledge of the balance of what
to be giving it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pretty much.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it was always working.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm good actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you add something like live rosin,
are you like the person who's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've never done live rosin before,
but like not going to be the one to make
[SPEAKER_01]: this?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do you like bring someone in,
an expert in, like whatever it is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I tried to only focus on non
solvent, you know, solvent list,
[SPEAKER_04]: solvent free product, but we have started
making live resins as well, but we don't,
[SPEAKER_04]: we outsource that with, or actually we
partner with a guy named Half Hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he does all our high end hash
production and yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: So he manufactures all our hash.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you know, we try to work with people
that, you know, bring value to each other
[SPEAKER_04]: by working together.
[SPEAKER_04]: We can't just do it all.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's good to develop good partnerships.
[SPEAKER_04]: And that's what kind of what Space Gems
is, is she had an amazing product and
[SPEAKER_04]: brand and we started working together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so now we come to the lab more.
[SPEAKER_04]: Right now we're using Gavitas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I must say I really like the controllers,
the system where they all, you can control
[SPEAKER_04]: them, light dim them and temperature
settings.
[SPEAKER_04]: But we'll be looking into, as we remodel,
we're still not built up to scale for the
[SPEAKER_04]: permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll be looking at other options,
but trying.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's always something new to learn in
this game.
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you feeling about testing coming
up?
[SPEAKER_00]: How are you feeling about testing and all
that shit?
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh man, testing is such a burden.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Expensive and just like the most organic
farmer ever can, you know, it's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's kind of trippy at times with like
heavy metals and shit like that.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's kind of why we went with this
foliar program.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we hadn't, we hadn't failed anything
for heavy metals yet when we started
[SPEAKER_04]: testing at the end of last year,
but what we did fail before was
[SPEAKER_04]: Aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so there's Sam Soilscape is like,
Oh, that's coming from an over ripened
[SPEAKER_04]: fungal flat.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we were making fungal flats,
you know, try to get the fungal biology
[SPEAKER_04]: going, but there's like such a short
window.
[SPEAKER_04]: And if you're not microscope and if it
blooms, then that somehow fostered,
[SPEAKER_04]: that created the the fungus, the
Aspergillus.
[SPEAKER_04]: So yeah, trippy.
[SPEAKER_04]: We haven't had any issues with the heavy
metals though.
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully things change and they,
they fucking like easing up on some of
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But probably gonna R and D everything just
to be safe, just to be safe because
[SPEAKER_04]: there's, there's something to shift it
into another source.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have our own nursery, but it's,
it's between four different facilities,
[SPEAKER_04]: but it's all in-house.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I guess the question I'm asking is like
every square foot you dedicate to
[SPEAKER_01]: something that's not flowery is less
flowery.
[SPEAKER_01]: So everybody probably has a different
strategy about thinking in-house or do I
[SPEAKER_01]: work with a nursery that I trust?
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I think you allocate about 25 to
30% of your total space and most,
[SPEAKER_04]: most municipalities don't charge for
nursery space.
[SPEAKER_04]: So tack that on and they usually just give
you that as you needed that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I mean, usually you need about to
propagate, I'd say for indoor,
[SPEAKER_04]: you can get away with 25% to have moms and
self-sufficient clone production and keep
[SPEAKER_04]: 75% flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I
[SPEAKER_04]: would like to, I don't really have the
source or the funds to pay someone to do
[SPEAKER_04]: that right now, but I'd like to tissue
culture everything and start fresh as we
[SPEAKER_04]: move into like a new, a new facilities
just to make sure you get rid of pathogens
[SPEAKER_04]: and stuff.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, just to revive your, the genetics
that you're working with, but I haven't
[SPEAKER_04]: got it done yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know a lot of farmers who would love to
tissue culture their genetics,
[SPEAKER_00]: get them back to ground zero.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's just a good way to preserve them,
save them for later.
[SPEAKER_04]: You don't have to take up space.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're like, ah, it's not good right now,
but I don't want to lose it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just catalog it in tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do have a story.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: The retail stores definitely helped a lot
because it brings in cashflow every day
[SPEAKER_04]: and it's been pretty successful.
[SPEAKER_04]: So on my model with the store is that,
you know, a nice clean environment,
[SPEAKER_04]: but also just to support everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: Anyone that has a good product,
we give a chance.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so we have a lot of different
products.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's in McKinleyville, which is in
Northern Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_03]: So who is your clientele?
[SPEAKER_04]: The clientele is super diverse.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would say our clientele averages
probably between 30 to 60 and a lot more
[SPEAKER_04]: frequently we're seeing a lot more elder,
older folks coming in.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people, new people.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Even in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_04]: So a lot of new people, a lot of curious
people, younger people that know what they
[SPEAKER_04]: want coming in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Humboldt, in your dispensary,
what's the demand for, like, kind of no
[SPEAKER_01]: age, so count brand versus like local?
[SPEAKER_04]: I can't say that we've seen much demand
for that, but like we have brought in
[SPEAKER_04]: products from Lemon Tree and say Alien
Labs.
[SPEAKER_04]: And they're at a really premium price.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like, I'm like, how are we going to sell a
$70 eighth in Humboldt?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the product sells, it's sold.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't think it was an issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, I don't work in the store
monitor too much, but I know we brought in
[SPEAKER_04]: some very high end products.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, wow, how's this going to fly?
[SPEAKER_04]: And in Humboldt, people are still buying
it.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think there's such a diverse consumer
out there.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as a store, it's like, we like to offer
something for everybody.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, like a cheap, $20 eighth is
actually the highest volume selling
[SPEAKER_04]: product when we have a good stock of them
where we live.
[SPEAKER_04]: But then there's also people that come in
for the super high end, live resins and
[SPEAKER_04]: rosins too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do they help you decide where you're going
to grow?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not so much, not so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: We think whatever we do is going to have
some niche somewhere market.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, no one can ever get tired of
having new strains of cannabis to try.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just got to find good ones and work with
them.
[SPEAKER_03]: But like if they're older, are they asking
for like magical CBD stuff?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have they heard about it and want to know
what it is?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yes, exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of people interested in CBD products
or have tried it and are looking for
[SPEAKER_04]: another comparable product because it's
working.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh yeah, we have a definitely,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of CBD infused product.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm probably getting into some pure hemp
CBD products as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: So non-cannabis, huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Not in the store, but focusing on that on
an adjacent building and then started
[SPEAKER_04]: juicing.
[SPEAKER_04]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was going to make it a consumption cafe,
but I feel like it might be better to just
[SPEAKER_04]: have a CBD product store there instead and
do, we could do some manufacturing of
[SPEAKER_04]: products there too.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, it's because you, we wouldn't be able
to split the unit cannabis versus
[SPEAKER_04]: non-cannabis because it's not split like
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, consumption on site would be cool,
but yeah, I'm just not sure if it's,
[SPEAKER_04]: it's going to be a lot more to monitor.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's allowed.
[SPEAKER_04]: You can get a permit for a consumption
lounge.
[SPEAKER_04]: We were going for it and we still are in
the permit process.
[SPEAKER_04]: So depending on how difficult it becomes,
we might just drop it and go into CBD,
[SPEAKER_04]: but we've already paid a pretty good
permit fee and it's been five,
[SPEAKER_04]: six months now.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're just kind of trucking along in the
progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not necessarily ready to outfit it
and get all that done.
[SPEAKER_04]: So no rush.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, not yet.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not in humble.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_04]: Mendo definitely.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think a lot of, I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's so there is one.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's one in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the Ingrid lounge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right next to the LMC, Lenomore
Collective.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's, it's a private set membership
based kind of situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And honestly, I don't really understand or
know how the regulations go as far as
[SPEAKER_00]: consumption lounge is in Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that they're really working hard on
tourism, cannabis tourism.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think consumption might be a little bit
of a gray area.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't hear any of what you said,
but I bet it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's fucking rock and roll band.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Did you go out to Meadowlands?
[SPEAKER_04]: I did.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have loved to have gone,
but I should have gone to Meadowlands.
[SPEAKER_04]: So you're like more of a vacation than the
end product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vacation with guys like me.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would have loved to have been with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: You're saying Meadowlands?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think I'll make it next year.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to.
[SPEAKER_04]: I always like Meadowlands.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
