[SPEAKER_08]: To start it out, I figure they all come
from different backgrounds of the
[SPEAKER_08]: concentrate world.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll just let them each kind of give
an intro and talk a little bit about what
[SPEAKER_08]: they do and what they're focused on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we'll start with you, Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_05]: So all my knowledge of raisin,
I learned about it traveling the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I spent 18, 20 years of my life
traveling.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I spent plenty of time in a producing
country, where I spent months living with
[SPEAKER_05]: a local, making hashish.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like really, the whole concept behind it,
it's really picking up the wholeness of
[SPEAKER_05]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm trying to bring the traditional
art into America, trying to find the
[SPEAKER_05]: science behind what those people have been
doing for thousands of years.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that takes a big time of my life.
[SPEAKER_05]: Otherwise, I'm totally dedicated to the
Emerald Triangle, because as a raisin
[SPEAKER_05]: specialist, I am nobody if I don't get the
best raisin.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I also believe that in the Emerald
Triangle, you have something that is so
[SPEAKER_05]: unique that you can build up a system like
they exist in the wine industry,
[SPEAKER_05]: where you can literally protect every
small mom and pop grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because a four acre of land in Champagne
or in Bordeaux, it's a domain.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a chateau.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not for sale.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's priceless.
[SPEAKER_05]: And this, you have it in the Emerald
Triangle.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the terroir.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have the land that is incredibly rich.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have hundreds of microclimate.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have genetics that has been here in
North Central part of the Emerald for two
[SPEAKER_05]: or three generations.
[SPEAKER_05]: And you have an economy that has been
alive for three generations and that are
[SPEAKER_05]: feeding basically the whole northern part
of California.
[SPEAKER_05]: The future of California comes from them.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you can protect their land,
they're going to be the center of a
[SPEAKER_05]: multi-billion dollar industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we have the blueprint in a history
book in the wine industry.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Frenchy.
[SPEAKER_06]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_06]: My name is Justin Pullman.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're the PMP laboratories.
[SPEAKER_06]: PMP is the acronym for Purified Metabolic
Products.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that is the goal when you do
purifications.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to purify those metabolites using
the highest quality extraction equipment,
[SPEAKER_06]: along with the highest quality solvent.
[SPEAKER_06]: And a lot of people that make BHO,
they are not using high quality solvents.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're using very easily accessible
solvents, like over the counter
[SPEAKER_06]: aerosol-based butanes for lighter fluid.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in science, that is a big no-no due to
the mere fact that there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: dangerous components that are in those
solvents.
[SPEAKER_06]: And let's see.
[SPEAKER_06]: When it comes to even the equipment that's
being used, a lot of people, they are DIY.
[SPEAKER_06]: They make this recapturing equipment out
of refrigeration equipment.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that within itself is very dangerous.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I've tried to bring about knowledge
in the community and other friends of mine
[SPEAKER_06]: on the importance of starting correctly.
[SPEAKER_06]: And starting with pure products and the
importance of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have been working with concentrates
with our patients for about five years
[SPEAKER_10]: now.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we even at one point had a CO2
machine.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we were setting up the lab.
[SPEAKER_10]: We were doing it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we just didn't find the medicine to be
as efficacious as it could be for people
[SPEAKER_10]: that were suffering with serious
illnesses.
[SPEAKER_10]: We do in fact believe that there's a place
in the market for CO2.
[SPEAKER_10]: No question about it.
[SPEAKER_10]: Butane, I don't think there's a place for
it in the market.
[SPEAKER_10]: I have our patients, I say go ahead and
take this amazingly healthy diet.
[SPEAKER_10]: Go ahead and eat all this unbelievably
wonderful natural food.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't then tell them to spray Pam on
their plates before they make their egg.
[SPEAKER_10]: I wouldn't want them to be putting butane.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't care how many parts per million.
[SPEAKER_10]: Garbage in, garbage out.
[SPEAKER_10]: You don't want to put poison into your
body when your immune system is
[SPEAKER_10]: compromised.
[SPEAKER_10]: Your endocannabinoid system is not working
efficiently.
[SPEAKER_10]: And you need to really ramp things up.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have made a commitment as an
organization to stick with ethanol.
[SPEAKER_10]: The 190 ethanol, the grain alcohol,
it works incredible.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have beautiful numbers.
[SPEAKER_10]: Our medicines, we test each and every
single batch.
[SPEAKER_10]: The results are fantastic.
[SPEAKER_10]: And we have had incidents where we've had
patients where we've had to go to CO2
[SPEAKER_10]: because we had to go to an outside source.
[SPEAKER_10]: Outside source with the most incredible
reputation.
[SPEAKER_10]: We even use the same flowers.
[SPEAKER_10]: They do the CO2, we do the ethanol,
and our patients didn't do as well.
[SPEAKER_10]: So it was like, you know what,
that's a no-brainer.
[SPEAKER_10]: This is all about the patients.
[SPEAKER_10]: This isn't about mass production.
[SPEAKER_10]: And though we are making a heck of a lot
of medicine, and there's no reason why we
[SPEAKER_10]: can't keep ramping up, but you don't have
to go to caustic, non-organic,
[SPEAKER_10]: non-natural methods in order to do that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We also have a commitment to not doing,
we use a whole plant extract.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so that we don't strip everything out
through our processes and then add back in
[SPEAKER_10]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_10]: So if people are doing that, there's a lot
of call for that, especially in the smoke
[SPEAKER_10]: market.
[SPEAKER_10]: But in the serious medical market,
definitely don't recommend it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mara.
[SPEAKER_07]: My name's Hunter Green.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm the lab director for WVAPES.
[SPEAKER_07]: We are a high-end artisan CO2 oil company.
[SPEAKER_07]: With vapor devices.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm Jason Beck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm founder and director of Alternative
Herbal Health Services.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're the oldest dispensary south of San
Francisco, and the state's still in
[SPEAKER_01]: operation.
[SPEAKER_01]: I started originally in 2001 in San
Francisco, and then the city of West
[SPEAKER_01]: Hollywood in 2004 asked me to come down
and open up off of a recommendation from
[SPEAKER_01]: the Board of Supervisors.
[SPEAKER_01]: I currently have the largest selection of
quality concentrates in the state.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe even the world, as far as I'm
concerned, at this point in time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's pretty much it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Jason.
[SPEAKER_08]: When I started this, I used the phrase
resin specialist.
[SPEAKER_08]: And as we were discussing this panel,
Frenchy brought up the importance of a
[SPEAKER_08]: common vocabulary.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just wanted to ask him and the other
panelists, if they'd like to chime in,
[SPEAKER_08]: what is the importance of using certain
vocabulary?
[SPEAKER_08]: And what are some other words that we
should be using?
[SPEAKER_08]: Frenchy?
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, to start with, we don't have a
common word for unpressed resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: Which is the material that everybody is
using.
[SPEAKER_05]: It goes under many names.
[SPEAKER_05]: From Keef, with a pretty pejorative
connotation to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: To ice wax, beach sand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And many others like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really need to be able to define every
aspect of what we do.
[SPEAKER_05]: I do not extract resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: I collect it by sieving it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm not an extractor.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are.
[SPEAKER_05]: And already this is something big for us.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really need to use a common vocabulary
to be able to teach people what we are
doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like we need to be able to have a quality
certification, a way to show what is a
[SPEAKER_05]: quality in a resin to anybody who has no
knowledge of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: By looking at the annotation of somebody,
you should be able to understand what that
[SPEAKER_05]: plant or what that type of medicine can
bring to you.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like when we don't have a common
knowledge and there is a world market
[SPEAKER_05]: opening to us, it's a little sad.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would like to say something.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even when it comes to BHO, I think people
need to really understand the importance
[SPEAKER_06]: of using a lighter fluid-based solvent
versus a 99.9% purity solvent.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really big, especially when it
comes to human consumption.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't make a medicine by starting with
something that's used to propel a motor
[SPEAKER_06]: down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: I differentiate from a lot of that,
personally.
[SPEAKER_01]: I myself suffer from cerebral palsy,
myself, just first of all.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the reality of it is that extractions
need to be called exactly what they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they are called hydrocarbon
extractions.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's basically what it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's used in pretty much everything that
you get.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how coffee beans become
decaffeinated.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's how you extract essential oils like
lavender, perfumes, things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is all the same thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all people really need to do is stop
open blasting and working with quality
[SPEAKER_01]: machinery that is actually made to keep
everything with inside.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, benzene is a hydrocarbon,
but it's also a carcinogen.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't think they fall in the same
category.
[SPEAKER_01]: My thing with CO2 is this, is that when
you do CO2, you have to add in artificial
[SPEAKER_01]: terpenes into CO2 in order to give it a
terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you blast with CO2,
the terpene molecule separates from the
[SPEAKER_01]: THC molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's why they have all these
different flavors and different things
[SPEAKER_01]: like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the main reasons that I
don't sell CO2 products is because of
[SPEAKER_01]: that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like CO2, I feel is great for edibles and
things like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as far as for vaping, I'm not
convinced on that yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I was going to ask you, because I actually
noticed on your website, it said you
[SPEAKER_08]: pulled the medicine from the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I was wondering if you were trying not
to use it.
[SPEAKER_10]: And I was like, no, I'm not going to use
it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to use it.
[SPEAKER_10]: I'm not going to use it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you do, it's organic grain alcohol,
correct?
[SPEAKER_08]: And you feel that's the most efficient way
to pull it out.
[SPEAKER_08]: And my question is, to pull the medicine
out, my question is, is that the best way
[SPEAKER_08]: to make extractions for all uses,
including smokables, do you believe?
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say that the reason that the
profiles of the plants, there's people
[SPEAKER_10]: that do it at home.
[SPEAKER_10]: They do it in their rice cookers or
whatever it is they do.
[SPEAKER_10]: That's not the same operation that we're
talking about.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not the same scale.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not the same equipment.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not, it's a very much of an art form
in addition to just the flat out
[SPEAKER_10]: extracting and getting it decarboxylated
correctly to be, to have your correct
[SPEAKER_10]: number of, you know, the, you know,
do you want to leave some THCA in,
[SPEAKER_10]: for example?
[SPEAKER_10]: Do you want it for a certain particular
designated use?
[SPEAKER_10]: So for that, the profile that we end up
with when we extract using the high grain
[SPEAKER_10]: alcohol is closest to the profile of what
we see native in the flowers that we start
[SPEAKER_10]: with.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if we're wanting to achieve something
with the plant that we bought and we have
[SPEAKER_10]: this flower, we want it to be just a
concentrated version of that basically in
[SPEAKER_10]: the medicine itself.
[SPEAKER_10]: As far as we actually think that the
smokables, I mean, I do our medicine,
[SPEAKER_10]: I smoke our medicine, you know,
the same thing that would go into a
[SPEAKER_10]: syringe, I might put into a vape
cartridge.
[SPEAKER_10]: That doesn't mean that it's necessarily
correct for everybody and for every
[SPEAKER_10]: market, but we're doing one with very,
very seriously ill people and we're
[SPEAKER_10]: creating profile.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want to be able to do that using the
integrity of the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_08]: That leads me into a question for Hunter.
[SPEAKER_08]: So you have at WVAPES a proprietary
terpene separation process.
[SPEAKER_08]: Now, I'm sure you're not going to give us
all the details, but can you tell us a
[SPEAKER_08]: little bit about that?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then it'll probably open the door for
other people to talk about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, going back to what he was talking
about, I do agree with him with most of
[SPEAKER_07]: the CO2 oils on the market.
[SPEAKER_07]: He's correct in saying that, but now with
some advances in technology, you can
[SPEAKER_07]: fractionalize the terpenes off to the
side, post-process your oil, and then
[SPEAKER_07]: reintroduce those terpenes back into the
oil, giving it a natural cannabis flavor
[SPEAKER_07]: that's really, really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: And do you think that when you're adding
terpenes back in, what if they're not from
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis?
[SPEAKER_08]: How's the panel feel about that?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's artificial.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's artificial food coloring.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like adding artificial flavor to your
cereal.
[SPEAKER_07]: So everyone's in agreement on that one.
[SPEAKER_08]: So everybody out there starting a
non-cannabis terpene company, maybe not do
[SPEAKER_08]: that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's the kind of advice that you'll get
here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quick question on that though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, aside from the aesthetics and the
marketing value of having it be the same
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes, from a functional point of view,
are the terpenes from another plant
[SPEAKER_02]: different chemically than the terpenes you
find in the marijuana plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: All terpenes are the same in all plant
products.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the exact same terpene profile that
you'll get in a banana, as if you taste
[SPEAKER_01]: banana that tastes flowers like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's the exact same terpene profile.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would have a slightly different take on
that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We also make a topical that contains 10
essential oils.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so I've done a lot of research on,
and we're actually creating, because we're
[SPEAKER_10]: starting some drug trials now on some
different things with this particular
[SPEAKER_10]: topical.
[SPEAKER_10]: It has in it essential oils that come from
various other plants that also have the
[SPEAKER_10]: same resident terpenes that are within the
cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we specifically chose these for that
reason.
[SPEAKER_10]: But then you start getting into the chemo
type of the essential oil, like we talk
[SPEAKER_10]: about with our plants.
[SPEAKER_10]: What elevation was it grown at?
[SPEAKER_10]: What was the likelihood?
[SPEAKER_10]: It's going to change everything about the
thing with the plant.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, you can look at, for example,
rosemary.
[SPEAKER_10]: And if rosemary is grown in one place
versus another place, it might have more
[SPEAKER_10]: alpapine in it, another place that might
have more of another essential terpene in
[SPEAKER_10]: there.
[SPEAKER_10]: And so you have to actually, it's so much
more complex than just whatever's in a
[SPEAKER_10]: banana is in a banana.
[SPEAKER_10]: Because then it depends on the banana.
[SPEAKER_10]: Where does that banana get grown?
[SPEAKER_10]: I've had a lot of bananas.
[SPEAKER_10]: Maybe they don't taste the same.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that's the beauty of cannabis,
is that it has the capability.
[SPEAKER_06]: Its gene pool is so big.
[SPEAKER_06]: It produced so many terpenes.
[SPEAKER_06]: Banana flavor, vanilla flavor,
skunk.
[SPEAKER_06]: The list goes on and on.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are other things that occur in
nature as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: The skunk pheromone or the smell that it
produces, there are strains out there that
[SPEAKER_06]: are very similar.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you were to classify the molecule,
they more than likely are the same thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no scientific study that has
actually tried to make the difference
[SPEAKER_05]: between terpenes, say limonene,
coming from different plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: But at the same times, why would you lose
the terpene in the first place when you
[SPEAKER_05]: are an extractor, especially when you use
CO2 and BHO machine?
[SPEAKER_05]: That's machine that I use in the perfume
industry to pick up the most volatile
[SPEAKER_05]: terpene.
[SPEAKER_05]: So if from the beginning you lose the
terpene, the game is over.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plant is all about terpene.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabinoid is a terpene compound.
[SPEAKER_05]: Cannabinoid are made by the bonding of two
molecules, terpene and phenol.
[SPEAKER_05]: You lose terpene, the game is over.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think in the future, I think if
harvesting terpenes becomes something that
[SPEAKER_06]: gains popularity, I think there will be
other methods besides BHO and CO2
[SPEAKER_06]: extractions.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are VOCs, these are compounds that
naturally are volatile at room
[SPEAKER_06]: temperature, just under vacuum and having
a cold trap, you can harvest them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have one of our extract artists,
they have one in particular line that's
[SPEAKER_01]: called divine thorium.
[SPEAKER_01]: It means divine flower in Latin.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that whole line is all black,
when it's blasted, it is blasted with
[SPEAKER_01]: actual lemon rind, strawberries,
things like that with the cannabis and
[SPEAKER_01]: actually enhances the terpene profile
afterwards on your after hit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So then in the after hit, you taste all
strawberry or you taste all that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And because that's all a natural terpene,
it can all be mixed like that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, so when we were discussing this
panel, also Frenchy brought up an
[SPEAKER_08]: important point about relationships
between cultivators and concentrate
[SPEAKER_08]: manufacturers.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I wanna see if you could talk a little
about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then I'd like to expand on it and say,
maybe for Jason, how about the
[SPEAKER_08]: relationship between the concentrate
makers and the dispensary?
[SPEAKER_08]: And then to Justin, how about concentrate
makers and the manufacturers of the
[SPEAKER_08]: equipment?
[SPEAKER_08]: And basically, how can we strengthen those
relationships and anyone else can chime in
[SPEAKER_08]: as well?
[SPEAKER_05]: So I work with a small seed company in
Mendozino, Aficionado Seed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the ash is actually a promoting tool
for the genetic.
[SPEAKER_05]: You don't look hardly at resin when you
look at flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: For me, it's the opposite.
[SPEAKER_05]: I never looked at flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So everything is about the resin.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that when you bring genetic to somebody
and you can show the flower and you show
[SPEAKER_05]: actually the resin, that is growing on
that flower, it has a very, very strong
[SPEAKER_05]: impact.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can use the ash to promote a line of
flower even before you bring it on the
[SPEAKER_05]: market.
[SPEAKER_05]: And also on the quality control.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like any genetic who doesn't pass the
ash test has to be breeded longer or one
[SPEAKER_05]: who really show a lot in the resin that
should have been stopped is brought back.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I am the wine maker and I work
with a vine grower.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my relation with them, we share
everything.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything that happened to me happened to
them.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I receive the love and dedication of
months of hard labor.
[SPEAKER_05]: My dream, everything that come in my hand,
I've been treated like the little beauty
[SPEAKER_05]: they are from the moment they put the seed
in the soil, to when it come in my hand.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I'm only collecting the expression of
a lot of work and dedication.
[SPEAKER_05]: And because I can create a relation like
this, it goes beyond buying trim.
[SPEAKER_05]: We work together and we're trying to not
only to show the potential of the genetic
[SPEAKER_05]: because I work with the elite heirloom
genetics that have been living in the
[SPEAKER_05]: three states up north for three or four
generations.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like I can, I'm the person between
the plant and the patient that bring
[SPEAKER_05]: really the full expression of that plant
to the people.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like keeping the purity of it,
especially when the plant are growing in
[SPEAKER_05]: two places that it's all the terroir.
[SPEAKER_05]: She was talking about plant giving
different aspect of herself growing in
[SPEAKER_05]: different place.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can tell you that up north they have a
terroir that is very unique, as good as in
[SPEAKER_05]: Malaya where when you change valley,
you can really feel a difference between
[SPEAKER_05]: the genetic, even if it's the same
genetic.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is what I have working in a close,
close relationship with growers,
[SPEAKER_05]: they give me the land, they give me all
these months and dedication and this is
[SPEAKER_05]: what I have to keep as pure as possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a direct connection between concentrate
makers and equipment manufacturers,
[SPEAKER_06]: they're one and the same in a lot of ways.
[SPEAKER_06]: The market for BHO, if you rewind five
years ago, it was very common to use
[SPEAKER_06]: aerosol base and PVC pipe and that
material was winning canvas cups left and
[SPEAKER_06]: right.
[SPEAKER_06]: As time had gone on, then people want
shatter, they want honeycomb and there's
[SPEAKER_06]: these trends that happen in the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nowadays, if you're not using a closed
loop extraction equipment and you're still
[SPEAKER_06]: blasting your frowned upon in the market,
which you should be because that's very
[SPEAKER_06]: dangerous and now de-waxing has come into
play and it's growing fast and it's
[SPEAKER_06]: constantly changing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even the components, people are realizing
that you shouldn't be using pipe thread
[SPEAKER_06]: and refrigerant equipment.
[SPEAKER_06]: These are just frowned upon.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of DIY people in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're a farmer and you have trim,
that's a viable product.
[SPEAKER_06]: You want to make it into, you want to
harvest that for what it is, but you don't
[SPEAKER_06]: see people out there buying trim to roll
into joints or they're using it to make
[SPEAKER_06]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's like, yeah, I think both markets are
feeding each other and they are going to
[SPEAKER_06]: be.
[SPEAKER_08]: It would seem that they're then really
relying on you to keep them up to date on
[SPEAKER_08]: the best practices and the best equipment,
which I think all patients, we should be
[SPEAKER_08]: happy for that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Jason, were you going to?
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as from the store aspect,
I'm really big on only working with name
[SPEAKER_01]: brand concentrate companies.
[SPEAKER_01]: As far as you have to be really branding
yourself and putting as much effort into
[SPEAKER_01]: selling your product as much as I'm
putting effort into selling your product.
[SPEAKER_01]: With that said, that helps a lot with the
quality control because anyone that's
[SPEAKER_01]: creating a real brand and really trying to
be in this business is not going to be in
[SPEAKER_01]: any interest of wanting to harm people or
creating a bad product in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: By working with quality brands and quality
things like that, I source numerous
[SPEAKER_01]: flowers for numerous extract companies
constantly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Basically, it's all about if you've got
good going in, you're going to get good
[SPEAKER_01]: coming out.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you've got trash going in, you're going
to have trash coming out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_06]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_06]: I kind of wanted to comment on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that there's a lot of people out
there making butane related products that
[SPEAKER_06]: aren't in the limelight because you're
manufacturing a narcotic and they don't
[SPEAKER_06]: tend to be in the limelight.
[SPEAKER_06]: They don't want to market themselves.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're not brands though.
[SPEAKER_06]: They may be selling their products to
other brands.
[SPEAKER_10]: I agree with you.
[SPEAKER_10]: I disagree.
[SPEAKER_10]: They are brands.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're just putting their energy
somewhere other than just selling a lot of
[SPEAKER_10]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're putting it into R&D.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're putting it into taking care of
sick people.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're putting it into giving away free
medicines where necessary.
[SPEAKER_10]: They're putting it into paying out through
the nose through lawyers and accountants
[SPEAKER_10]: to be compliant and to be doing the right
thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: Branding is a business strategy.
[SPEAKER_10]: Making good medicine is a science.
[SPEAKER_01]: I agree with exactly the end point of what
you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: The end point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Making quality meds is a science,
100%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why these brands make some of the
best medicine and then they turn it into a
[SPEAKER_01]: brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: That way it's notarized.
[SPEAKER_01]: People know it.
[SPEAKER_01]: People know the name.
[SPEAKER_01]: These brands win cups.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just how market share works.
[SPEAKER_08]: As you can see, there's no controversy in
concentrates by the way.
[SPEAKER_08]: We don't have to worry about that.
[SPEAKER_08]: That brings up another point.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have these state regulations on the
horizon.
[SPEAKER_08]: Concentrate manufacturing has been and is
basically illegal in the state.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there concentrate associations being
formed?
[SPEAKER_08]: What is the concentrate world doing as far
as to get involved with the legislation?
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll let anybody speak on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can speak for the Ashishin.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're trying to make a guild association
to be able to know what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Ezekiah from the Emerald Grover
Association is the person in charge.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have been talking about it for a year
because, as I was saying, as Ashishin,
[SPEAKER_05]: everything comes from your growers.
[SPEAKER_05]: That means that for us as a ash maker or
anybody touching the resin in any way,
[SPEAKER_05]: the only thing we have to think about is
protecting our growers and protecting the
[SPEAKER_05]: land, literally.
[SPEAKER_05]: Beyond that, this is the beginning.
[SPEAKER_05]: If we don't have that, there is nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I thought there was this company,
Sursa, I may be murdering it, but I
[SPEAKER_06]: believe at one point in reading about it,
I wrote them.
[SPEAKER_06]: I didn't get a response from the email.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're an association?
[SPEAKER_06]: I believe so.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was looking it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sursa, that's Addison DeMora's group.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sursa, they're the group up north that are
trying to lobby for concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than that, I work with CIA.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm one of the executive directors down
here for Southern California.
[SPEAKER_01]: We work more on a local level,
more than on a statewide level because,
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end of the day, you need to get a
local ordinance passed, especially in with
[SPEAKER_01]: how the new framework of how this law
works.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to have local sanctification for
extraction, not just state approval,
[SPEAKER_01]: state license.
[SPEAKER_10]: I work with APA, American Herbal Products
Association.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're treating cannabis extracts just like
any other herbal extract.
[SPEAKER_10]: When the whole heck of a lot of safety is
put in there, protections because of the
[SPEAKER_10]: fears around harm to the giving and taking
their own way, you might not die for it,
[SPEAKER_10]: but you sure might feel like you wish you
would for a few hours.
[SPEAKER_10]: Nobody should have to go through that.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're working on all the things around
labeling and processing and distribution
[SPEAKER_10]: and storage and et cetera.
[SPEAKER_10]: Everything that you can think of,
soup to nuts on this.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're creating all the guidelines so that
we can then present these to the various
[SPEAKER_10]: legislative groups and say, here,
we've already done this.
[SPEAKER_10]: Here, this is how we're self-regulating.
[SPEAKER_10]: We want you to adopt this because we're
being hard on ourselves.
[SPEAKER_04]: Great, excellent.
[SPEAKER_04]: Another point just to pull off.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've heard a lot of people say there's
been a huge farm lobby going in place for
[SPEAKER_04]: when it becomes more federal than
legalized and restrictions that make on
[SPEAKER_04]: the land, especially around extracts
because there are arguments that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: taking a plant, you're taking something
out of that, and you're doing something
[SPEAKER_04]: similar to farming.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think that that's a real risk in
the concentrated space?
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that it's a very big risk in the
entire industry.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think that the more that we can do to
collaborate and work together,
[SPEAKER_10]: and make sure that we self-regulate,
and that we have outside independent
[SPEAKER_10]: adjudications, make sure that we're doing
it all correctly, and we can show that
[SPEAKER_10]: we're putting all the efforts together to
do that and test it and everything,
[SPEAKER_10]: and testing, testing, testing,
testing, test every batch, test it again,
[SPEAKER_10]: retest it, get the machines better,
get the technicians better.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think there will eventually be a
strong hand in the FDA?
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, as long as we are doing everything
we can to keep this an herbal product
[SPEAKER_10]: because if you're not dealing with
isolates, standardized pharmacology is
[SPEAKER_10]: about reductionism.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's about single-molecule drugs that you
can dose and say you have 25 milligrams or
[SPEAKER_10]: 25 milligrams of X.
[SPEAKER_10]: What we're doing is so much more complex
than that, so we have to treat it as an
[SPEAKER_10]: herbal product.
[SPEAKER_10]: On the other hand, we're going to spay now
to start drug trials with Guzman and
[SPEAKER_10]: Sanchez, and we're gonna be using
extracts.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're using full plant extracts to be
doing studies on cell lines for
[SPEAKER_10]: glioblastoma or HERD-2 breast cancer.
[SPEAKER_10]: We're looking at the schwannes in the
basal cell, and we're using full plant
[SPEAKER_10]: extracts.
[SPEAKER_10]: So we want to show that if you get it down
and you know what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_10]: you don't have to get these little
standardized drugs.
[SPEAKER_10]: And the thousand other pharmaceutical
companies don't have a way to stand up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, and to that, you work with the
American Herbal Products Association,
[SPEAKER_08]: and that's exactly what they do and what
they've been doing for a decade or so is
[SPEAKER_08]: keeping herbal supplements out of the
hands of the FDA when they don't need to
[SPEAKER_08]: be.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why APA is so important.
[SPEAKER_08]: I actually have no idea how we're doing on
time, but I think it's time to go to
[SPEAKER_08]: questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: So if anyone has questions out there,
Obi.
[SPEAKER_12]: My understanding is that in Europe,
smoking flowers is considered crude.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's not the end product.
[SPEAKER_12]: The end product is the hash.
[SPEAKER_12]: And in the United States, my understanding
is that flowers, for many people,
[SPEAKER_12]: is considered the end product.
[SPEAKER_12]: Aaron, you're the consummate marketer.
[SPEAKER_12]: Comment on that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay, so I'm on the panel now.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, that's good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, well, we are a company that
specializes in high-quality flowers.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know it's kind of going against the
trend, but that is something that myself
[SPEAKER_08]: and my head cultivator, Tyler Wadley,
here really focus on.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for a lot of our patients, it's about
the flower, but we have plenty of
[SPEAKER_08]: concentrates, and like these concentrate
manufacturers have said, it all starts
[SPEAKER_08]: with the plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So definitely the trend is going to more
and more concentrates, and like you said,
[SPEAKER_08]: hash is probably the finished product,
but there's something to the flower for me
[SPEAKER_08]: personally where I feel the full effect,
and it would be really similar with
[SPEAKER_08]: Frenchy's hash, but when you take that
away from me, it's just not the same.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whether it's BHO, CO2, I'm looking for
more of an effect personally.
[SPEAKER_08]: So who knows, I think people will,
sometimes you take a dab, sometimes you
[SPEAKER_08]: smoke a joint.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more of a generational thing too now,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, the younger generation is all about
the concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's their whole thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have a whole generation of
kids that have never smoked flowers pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: much, and that's really what it is.
[SPEAKER_06]: When I was in college, I went to college
with Europeans who they smuggle hash over
here.
[SPEAKER_06]: They would roll their little joints with
the tobacco, and you turn them on to some
[SPEAKER_06]: high-grade sour diesel, and they're like,
wow, do you want my hash?
[SPEAKER_08]: Trade, trade, trade.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would say that a lot of times we get a
lot of love from people who usually don't
[SPEAKER_08]: smoke flowers because we produce a really
clean, smooth flower, and I think if there
[SPEAKER_08]: were more of that, you would see more of
these people using it, but so much of the
[SPEAKER_08]: cannabis does hurt your throat and is not
flushed properly, so that is an issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Right there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of the people I know all do nug run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Trim is more of an economical thing,
but a majority of my concentrates are all
[SPEAKER_01]: nug run.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your patients, because your patients
want that, correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's what a majority of them want,
and because I've had stores since 01,
[SPEAKER_01]: I've always sold concentrates back when
only concentrates were only called earwax,
[SPEAKER_01]: honeycomb, amber glass, amber shards,
and now the only thing that's different is
[SPEAKER_01]: the marketing and the different techniques
and the different devices and the
[SPEAKER_01]: different companies that have come out to
help brand the market share.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that it's a marketing thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think whether you're purifying
metabolites from trim or from flower,
[SPEAKER_06]: as long as those glands are present and
there is some type of cannabinoids in
[SPEAKER_06]: there, then it doesn't really matter.
[SPEAKER_06]: Your yields will be different,
and maybe the terpene concentration will
[SPEAKER_06]: be slightly off, but it is an economical
thing.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if you're in a contest or something,
then I would suggest using flowers,
[SPEAKER_06]: but besides that, I think it could be a
waste of money.
[SPEAKER_10]: We use flowers, but sometimes we'll get
some popcorn bud.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's still pretty good, but even before we
use it, though, we'll always keep that
[SPEAKER_10]: out.
[SPEAKER_10]: We will not use it in its present form.
[SPEAKER_10]: We'll make sure that we remove as much of
the plant matter as we can, not that
[SPEAKER_10]: there's gonna be much in popcorn.
[SPEAKER_10]: Popcorn has to have some nuts in it,
some real nuts.
[SPEAKER_10]: But we definitely use flowers.
[SPEAKER_10]: A lot of what you see in the edible
industry is the trim that goes with that.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't understand why anybody thinks that
it goes through a different mechanism
[SPEAKER_10]: through the body.
[SPEAKER_10]: It doesn't matter if it's healthy.
[SPEAKER_10]: To me, it's all going in, and it all needs
to go in healthy.
[SPEAKER_10]: But too many times I've seen the trim that
I've looked at and seen, where it's like
[SPEAKER_10]: after they do their, they have their
trimmers there all day, not wearing masks,
[SPEAKER_10]: not wearing gloves, not wearing whatever.
[SPEAKER_10]: They'll come in and they'll just scoop up
what's off the floor, sweep the floor,
[SPEAKER_10]: put that in big, giant hefty bags,
and then sell that for 50 bucks or 100
[SPEAKER_10]: bucks to some processor.
[SPEAKER_10]: It's not really what I want in my mind.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, but it's like they would treat the
small buds the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not really what you use of the plant
because the tricone on the sugar trim are
[SPEAKER_05]: as good as the tricone on the head.
[SPEAKER_05]: But it's the way your trim, your material
has been treated between the harvest and
[SPEAKER_05]: you.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why your relation with the grower
is so important because my quality of ash
[SPEAKER_05]: is the quality of aficionado.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not my ash.
[SPEAKER_05]: I represent aficionado.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just made by me.
[SPEAKER_05]: So now it's a question of for those
grower, they want their reputation to stay
[SPEAKER_05]: high.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a very small industry.
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot make any mistake, especially
when you're a breeder.
[SPEAKER_05]: They wouldn't give me anything but the
best.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you have sugar trim left in a plastic
bag just by itself, the weight of the
[SPEAKER_05]: trim, they're so sticky that when I open
it at home, I can put a coffee,
[SPEAKER_05]: a full cup of coffee on it in full
confidence, not feeling afraid at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: And take picture of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is just sugar trim, but this is the
best of the sugar trim that have been
[SPEAKER_05]: treated the same way that the flower have
been treated.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's why you need that relation of the
grower because I know that my medicine is
[SPEAKER_05]: organic.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know where it's grown.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know it's been taken care in between.
[SPEAKER_05]: All my resin is cured or fresh.
[SPEAKER_05]: I know everything about what I do because
it's so concentrate the resin at the end
[SPEAKER_05]: that anything that is wrong is gonna show
even more so here.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like if you have any pesticide and
you don't have somebody checking your
[SPEAKER_05]: plant to tell you that yes, now you are at
the end of the flower season.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no more pesticide about it.
[SPEAKER_05]: If you don't have that trust toward your
grower, you never know the medicine you're
[SPEAKER_05]: giving away.
[SPEAKER_08]: One other question.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, are we done?
[SPEAKER_08]: Now how about concentrate that comes from
sun-grown cannabis versus indoor cannabis?
[SPEAKER_08]: Is there a difference and what is the
difference?
[SPEAKER_01]: Taste, taste, yield, quality, price point,
color, all of these different things.
[SPEAKER_01]: All will come into play with all of these
concentrates.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you are working with outdoor and
greenhouse, your numbers are a lot larger.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a fine timeline from when you can
process those plants to when they will
[SPEAKER_01]: actually go bad and you will actually
produce bad product because the trichomes
[SPEAKER_01]: have already amber color so you're gonna
come out with dark.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reality of it is you better be able to
pump it if you're gonna be able to grow
[SPEAKER_01]: it.
[SPEAKER_10]: We prefer greenhouse in what we do because
it still gets all of the natural cycles.
[SPEAKER_10]: We have to obviously, we have to freeze
the light in certain times, different
[SPEAKER_10]: times of year, et cetera.
[SPEAKER_10]: We also like the idea that the plants are
being stressed to a certain extent.
[SPEAKER_10]: I really never understood the whole indoor
market.
[SPEAKER_10]: I understand if you're having to be
stealth and you're in an illegal place,
[SPEAKER_10]: then that's a whole entire different
thing.
[SPEAKER_10]: But they chop all the bud form that comes
out because they're pretty little nugs and
[SPEAKER_10]: they're pretty and they trim them to
death.
[SPEAKER_10]: But then people are gonna go, oh wow,
isn't that great?
[SPEAKER_10]: And they're either gonna then destroy them
in a concentrate or they're gonna put a
[SPEAKER_10]: match to it to light it up anyway,
which just feels really destructive to
[SPEAKER_10]: something that you just cultivated to be
pretty.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're born to die.
[SPEAKER_10]: Huh?
[SPEAKER_11]: I said they're born to die.
[SPEAKER_01]: I differ with that a little bit just in
the fact that I believe that by creating
[SPEAKER_01]: the perfect environment for a plant to
grow in, you can make the perfect medicine
[SPEAKER_01]: basically.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's really how I believe it.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you grow with outdoors, you have the
outside elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I was saying that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But even with greenhouse, it still is not
the same as indoor.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not gonna come out with that same
terpene profile, that same bud structure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That same crystal content, all of that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are not gonna get that without doing
it indoor.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, I would agree with Jason,
but we're big indoor cultivators.
[SPEAKER_08]: On our shelf at Buds and Roses,
we have put some of the best greenhouse on
[SPEAKER_08]: the shelf for maybe half the price of our
indoor.
[SPEAKER_08]: But our patients do prefer the indoor.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think I'm biased.
[SPEAKER_08]: Los Angeles is not only the largest retail
market, but the largest market for indoor
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivation as well.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I think indoor cultivators need to,
we started Cultivators Alliance actually
[SPEAKER_08]: in Los Angeles to build up the ethics and
the responsibility behind indoor
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivators.
[SPEAKER_08]: I think there's a place for it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean personally from doing extractions
with greenhouse, I've seen some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: best extractions from all organic
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there is some importance to having
it be sun-grown, but yet in a controlled
[SPEAKER_06]: environment of the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_06]: Even when the farmer is taking down that
crop and what they do to protect the
[SPEAKER_06]: terpenes and the internals of that gland,
immediately freezing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because you're dealing with volatile
organic compounds that are immediately
[SPEAKER_06]: vaporizing as soon as it's cut down.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a concentrate maker, you're trying to
harvest that stuff and you need to either
[SPEAKER_06]: do it immediately or freeze it or figure
out a way to get after it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But yeah, I've noticed definitely organic
greenhouse weed makes the best
[SPEAKER_06]: concentrate.
[SPEAKER_05]: Any of you have ever been in the field of
cannabis when the plant are 15 to 20 feet
[SPEAKER_05]: high?
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like Zeus plant, a plant in full
power outside will never be able to be
[SPEAKER_05]: compared from anything grows indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: Doesn't matter how good you are indoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: The expression of a plant outdoor fully
grown in the soil, you cannot compare it.
[SPEAKER_05]: When you walk indoor at night,
do you think the plant doesn't know that
[SPEAKER_05]: outdoor, it's daytime that you should
sleep or the opposite.
[SPEAKER_05]: You think that when you grow indoors the
plant doesn't know about the moon cycle.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like the plant is a living organism that
is aware and intelligent.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we don't even pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you're dealing with a living
organism that lets you do a lot of things
[SPEAKER_05]: because you can bring your genetic further
than any bees pollinating.
[SPEAKER_05]: But there is a limit to what a plant can
give you indoor without, like when you
[SPEAKER_05]: have ventilation, it's a fan.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's nicer fan.
[SPEAKER_05]: It makes the plant stronger, but it's not
the wind.
[SPEAKER_05]: It will never be.
[SPEAKER_05]: The UV ray that you have in a grow room,
you don't have the UV rays at the sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no light that duplicates the sun.
[SPEAKER_05]: There is no room that give a quarter of a
moon to a full moon.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like you have to realize the beauty
of that plant outdoor.
[SPEAKER_05]: She can give the maximum.
[SPEAKER_05]: Indoor, you're trying to take the maximum
over, pushing her to do something that
[SPEAKER_05]: naturally it's against her nature.
[SPEAKER_05]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_05]: So you do great research, don't get me
wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, no, no, I agree with you with what
you're saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, sales dictate
the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the bottom line is indoor sales 100
times more than outdoor or greenhouse
[SPEAKER_01]: period.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not even realistic.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not even a realistic statement.
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_05]: If the Emerald Triangle wasn't exporting
all their flowers on the other coast,
[SPEAKER_05]: you will know what is sun-grown flower.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just that you don't find them in a
market.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_05]: None of you really know what is a
beautifully sun-grown flower coming from
[SPEAKER_05]: Mendozino.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's like those flowers, the indoor cannot
compete with that, but it's not known.
[SPEAKER_05]: People are not educated to choose
sun-grown towards indoor because
[SPEAKER_05]: sun-grown, it's dirty bird shit on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, how would you smoke that?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, no, at the same time too,
from my experience of running stores for
[SPEAKER_01]: so long, I've also noticed that outdoor
greenhouse flowers decompose at a much
[SPEAKER_01]: faster rate than indoor flowers decompose.
[SPEAKER_01]: Their color changes faster, their taste
changes faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: All of this changes in a number of weeks
as opposed to a number of months.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, let me say this.
[SPEAKER_08]: So bring Jason and I the best sun-grown.
[SPEAKER_08]: We would be happy to carry it and get it
off to our patients.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're all for it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So all right.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll go to questions and I think we'll
wrap it up.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_13]: I just wanted to make a comment about
this, if I may.
[SPEAKER_13]: I've been around marijuana for decades.
[SPEAKER_13]: My collective's just down the street from
there.
[SPEAKER_13]: We're in our 10th year now.
[SPEAKER_13]: I go to Amsterdam every year and I buy all
of the organic seeds.
[SPEAKER_13]: I go to Spain to pick them up.
[SPEAKER_13]: I bring them back, give them to our
growers and grow organically.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have one indoor grower, all the rest
are outdoor.
[SPEAKER_13]: One greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_13]: I will smoke nothing but sun-grown.
[SPEAKER_13]: The new stuff now, the sun-grown from
award-winning seeds is the best marijuana
[SPEAKER_13]: out there.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's so pure when you smoke it that you
just can't go back to indoor that has been
[SPEAKER_13]: grown, what they say organically,
but I don't believe that.
[SPEAKER_13]: We have organic growers, but there's
always that taste, that weird chemical
[SPEAKER_13]: taste that is never in a really,
really good sun-grown from award-winning
[SPEAKER_13]: seeds marijuana.
[SPEAKER_13]: It's the best as far as I'm concerned.
[SPEAKER_13]: My personal experience.
[SPEAKER_13]: All right.
[SPEAKER_13]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think a lot of new edibles brands,
transdermal brands, even vaping brands,
[SPEAKER_02]: look for extractors to provide them with
concentrated material to put into their
[SPEAKER_02]: products.
[SPEAKER_02]: Could you all compare and contrast the
cost of production of the different
[SPEAKER_02]: extraction techniques and their
suitability for these different
[SPEAKER_02]: applications?
[SPEAKER_01]: The cost of production is really going to
depend on the actual individual extractor,
[SPEAKER_01]: how much machinery they actually have and
are able to process at one given time,
[SPEAKER_01]: because the more you are able to produce,
the lower your price per gram costs to
[SPEAKER_01]: produce.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always going to depend on the actual
concentrate maker, depending on what the
[SPEAKER_01]: individual price point will be and how
fast he's able to process it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you're asking like styles,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: CO2 and BHO.
[SPEAKER_06]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_06]: CO2 extraction is going to be the most
expensive to do because the equipment
[SPEAKER_06]: needed to produce that extraction is very
expensive due upon the high operating
[SPEAKER_06]: pressures of CO2.
[SPEAKER_06]: The thickness of the steel has to be super
thick.
[SPEAKER_06]: It has to be bulky.
[SPEAKER_06]: Whereas a butane extraction, it's a low
operating pressure solvent.
[SPEAKER_06]: It operates at 50 PSI at 100 degrees,
which is not high at all when it comes to
[SPEAKER_06]: pressure.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can produce this equipment relatively
cheap.
[SPEAKER_06]: Alcohol is probably even less expensive
considering you just need like,
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know, a giant ...
[SPEAKER_06]: At least that's the scale of butane,
the alcohol extraction.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would say the scale of alcohol.
[SPEAKER_10]: I would not want to scale up a bad
technique of butane.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think ... It's the best extraction
technique there is in the extraction
[SPEAKER_05]: world.
[SPEAKER_05]: But people don't put those things in their
bodies.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, but you can't say that it's like,
this is the best way to extract the most
[SPEAKER_05]: volatile type of paint.
[SPEAKER_05]: In the industry of the BFU, it's BHO and
CO2.
[SPEAKER_05]: You cannot say that it's a bad technique.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can say people can use that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'd like to bring up something that you
mentioned earlier.
[SPEAKER_06]: You said that you give your clients,
you give them an organic diet.
[SPEAKER_06]: But you want to tell them to use PAM.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now would you tell your clients to go get
drunk?
[SPEAKER_10]: No, I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_06]: But your solvent of choice is ethanol,
correct?
[SPEAKER_06]: Which is something we use to get drunk.
[SPEAKER_10]: Well, maybe you do.
[SPEAKER_10]: I don't use it to get drunk.
[SPEAKER_10]: I might use it to relax in the evening
with a glass of wine.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's the difference?
[SPEAKER_07]: Really though, it comes down to the end
product and how well it was refined.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a lot of really good solvent out
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: But at the end of the day, if it's refined
out properly, it doesn't really matter how
[SPEAKER_07]: you get it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about the solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about the quality of the product
going in in the first place.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not about the solvent.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's about the quality of the product.
[SPEAKER_07]: By making sure the solvent's not there.
[SPEAKER_08]: Are there any more questions?
[SPEAKER_08]: You've had your hand up for a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yes.
Going back to the
[SPEAKER_09]: stain door.
[SPEAKER_09]: Wouldn't that be based on ash,
the consistent maintained through that
[SPEAKER_09]: period of time?
[SPEAKER_09]: So which would be burping the whatever
container in which the cannabis is kept
in.
[SPEAKER_11]: So wouldn't that reflect how the longevity
of freshness the cannabis has?
[SPEAKER_08]: Most likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think what Jason was saying is it
just seems that the...
[SPEAKER_00]: Basically, it's kind of like this,
and this is a really weird analogy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It might not even be politically correct
to say this, but this is the best analogy
[SPEAKER_01]: I can give you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Imagine indoor flowers as rich kids in
Beverly Hills and you imagine outdoor as
[SPEAKER_01]: poor kids in the hood and all of the
adversements that they have to go through
[SPEAKER_01]: in life and to be able to grow in that
type of an environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in Beverly Hills.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're in a perfect stable environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a maintained same temperature,
same everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Outdoor, you're subject to the elements.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting rained on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting trampled on.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're getting bugs eating on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're having all kinds of problems.
[SPEAKER_12]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's without a doubt.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, it's about
creating the perfect environment to create
[SPEAKER_01]: the perfect product.
[SPEAKER_08]: All right.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think that's... Barrett, go ahead.
[SPEAKER_08]: Last question.
[SPEAKER_05]: As an ash maker, and I can look with a
magnifying glass, my dream, to be sure I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't forget any head, I get between 7% to
15%.
[SPEAKER_05]: According to the strain, the grower,
and many, many, many things, but as an
[SPEAKER_05]: average.
[SPEAKER_05]: And a good average, 10% it's already very
nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: 15% it's rare.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's a special genetic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have found if the cannabis being tested
has a 22% THC or whatever, usually my
[SPEAKER_06]: yields are going to be very similar.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm saying.
I'll see you next time.
