[SPEAKER_00]: The Appalachians Project, man,
so I mean this is something that you hold
[SPEAKER_00]: near and dear, and I know several other
people that are tied to it, but really you
[SPEAKER_00]: talked about this at an earlier Future
Cannabis Project video in a basement in
[SPEAKER_00]: Venice, in an old speakeasy of all places
with some very interesting folks.
[SPEAKER_00]: So tell us a little bit about that,
because that's really what put things on
[SPEAKER_00]: the map.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, nice pun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pardon the pun.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the founder of the Mendocino
Appalachians Project, one of the things
[SPEAKER_03]: that we did with the Appalachians was,
you know, I come from a design background,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I had been building greenhouses.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've been in the California
industry for about 22 years, so I'm very
[SPEAKER_03]: familiar with Northern California and the
cannabis trade.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understood what was going on from a
political standpoint, because of course,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, I was on the other side of the
gate, and then I was on the food policy
[SPEAKER_03]: council, so I was working a lot with
policy around food, you know, policy
[SPEAKER_03]: development, you know, for food,
and also writing online software programs
[SPEAKER_03]: for, you know, virtual food hubs for
distribution, decentralizing production,
[SPEAKER_03]: farm-to-table dinner series for about 10
years, so I had this idea of small batch
[SPEAKER_03]: craft and how to support taking cannabis
money and supporting the local food
[SPEAKER_03]: system, and then I got arrested in 2012
and ended up very publicly exposed for my
[SPEAKER_03]: work in the non-profit sector,
and I had a choice, either apologize for
[SPEAKER_03]: being in the cannabis industry,
which had supported all this great work to
[SPEAKER_03]: that point, or step up and do something.
[SPEAKER_03]: Got into policy council development,
developed the Mendocino policy council
[SPEAKER_03]: with a few other people, and then my skill
set was really in that design,
[SPEAKER_03]: so I was like, I was noticing where I
really get in, where you fit in,
[SPEAKER_03]: and I started drawing this map.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started drawing an Appalachians map.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've heard the concept of Appalachians of
the wine regions of France, grew up with
[SPEAKER_03]: them, and I was like super stoked on,
you know, on how they had developed what
[SPEAKER_03]: it seems protections for small batch and
craft wine producers, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: And very similar, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very similar.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, protecting products of place,
essentially protecting IP, because when
[SPEAKER_03]: you give the farmer IP, you give them the
power, not the corporations.
[SPEAKER_03]: Correct.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the market then demands back to the IP,
which is connected to the land,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the land owners versus the corporation
and the product.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's products of place, and of place
being the number one determinant.
[SPEAKER_03]: So drawing that map really was cementing
our regional heritage and legacy moving
[SPEAKER_03]: forward, and then drove around with a map.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you saw the map today,
but you know, with the pins in it.
[SPEAKER_03]: I saw it, yeah, I've seen it before.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's a state map.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is our first shot at doing a state
map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you guys are down in my neck of
the woods.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think you're out in the desert,
aren't you?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, no, no, no, no.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're launching, we do mapping.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're identifying regions where
cannabis is being produced in geographical
[SPEAKER_03]: indication settings, not necessarily for
appellation of origin.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the expression, the metabolomic
expression of the plant's relationship
[SPEAKER_03]: with sun and soil is the most important
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So therefore, desert is not really a place
where you can do that.
[SPEAKER_03]: You have to do it engineered or inside,
and you don't get an appellation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, you know, it was a really good
way to protect small batch and craft
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis producers, as a real way to
protect the legacy and heritage of the
[SPEAKER_03]: region, and a real way to, you know,
make a quality differentiation in the
[SPEAKER_03]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so which we hope to see forward with
organizations like Emerald Exchange and,
[SPEAKER_03]: and craft cannabis producers everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how that that affected a bit of the
policy here in the state of California,
[SPEAKER_00]: right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know there's certain brands,
like Humble, I'll pick on one that had to
[SPEAKER_00]: segue their name into dosis to go through
that because of the Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, just as an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, so you can't claim the name
of a place necessarily as the brand name.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, you know, and a lot of people are
going to start to see that when
[SPEAKER_03]: Appalachian petitions start to come in,
there's going to be this huge backlash
[SPEAKER_03]: against all the brands that have the name
of either the strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of it comes down to the strain
names as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, so it's like Big Sur Holy Bud is
an example that Richard Mendelsohn brought
[SPEAKER_03]: up the other day.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's that's really big.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the Big Sur Holy Bud, just call it Holy
Bud.
[SPEAKER_03]: Grown in Big Sur, California, and or Big
Sur Appalachian, giving the power back to
[SPEAKER_03]: the Appalachian, not the strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you get to the strain, they could grow
it in Ethiopia and have Big Sur Holy Bud
[SPEAKER_03]: grown all around the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't necessarily maintain that
same marker of quality that it comes from
[SPEAKER_03]: that specific region.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Holy Bud grown in Big Sur then becomes
the marker of quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: Makes sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: So getting into this and you know,
we hate to compare this industry to the
[SPEAKER_00]: alcohol industry, but it's kind of hard
not to.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's one of those things where kind of
talking about micro macro, we have it
[SPEAKER_00]: again, literally metaphorically,
Celestial Brands, Anheuser-Busch.
[SPEAKER_00]: We know Miller Coors has been focused on
for a minute.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'll ask both of you to start with you,
Ricardo, because some of this in your
[SPEAKER_00]: backyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, Miller Coors is right down the
street from you in Golden, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think of as some of these
mainstream alcohol and even more recently,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously tobacco companies?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where do you see us in a year as far as
the larger corporations versus the smaller
[SPEAKER_00]: micro, if you will, versus macro?
[SPEAKER_02]: I think this is only the beginning.
[SPEAKER_02]: And apparently that guy agrees.
[SPEAKER_02]: But no, this is only the beginning,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, we're just seeing the first giant
alcohol brand, the first few big beer
[SPEAKER_02]: brands.
[SPEAKER_02]: Of course, now Altria, the owner of Philip
Morris International, is in the game with
[SPEAKER_02]: a very legitimate.
[SPEAKER_02]: 1.8 billion, I think.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, $1.8 billion investment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in Kronos up in Canada, we're going to
see a lot more of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it was 45% with potential for 55.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, no, it's only amplifying.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're going to see so much more of this.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think it's inevitable.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think the only thing we need to be
aware of is most of these industries have
[SPEAKER_02]: not been the most accountable,
have not been the most transparent or
[SPEAKER_02]: honest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we just need to be conscious about
what their involvement could mean for the
[SPEAKER_02]: potential future of this industry and the
businesses they're involved with,
[SPEAKER_02]: because you could watch Mad Men,
you could watch a number of documentaries
[SPEAKER_02]: and read books.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, especially big tobacco.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, let's not forget
pharmaceutical, because the largest donor
[SPEAKER_02]: to the opposition campaign in the 2016
election in Arizona was Insys
[SPEAKER_02]: Therapeutics.
[SPEAKER_02]: Proud Arizona.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was an interesting story,
I think.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God, I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: A maker of a crazy, strong and deadly
fentanyl.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think we need to just keep an extra
close eye on these entities, whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: pharma, alcohol, nicotine, to make sure
that they're not practicing the ill deeds
[SPEAKER_02]: of their past now.
Right.
Definitely.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what's your take?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is we know you've grown up
not too far from where I grew up up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've seen it with like the microwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, very few.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to keep these microbreweries from
jumping the shark, so to speak,
[SPEAKER_00]: and going to A, B, and becoming just
another name like Goose Island or
[SPEAKER_00]: Breckenridge Brewery in Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you see that playing out in
NorCal?
[SPEAKER_00]: Has it been true that companies like in
the nicotine space have been purchasing
[SPEAKER_00]: property up here north of San Francisco?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, you never know.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: You never know until you do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then all of a sudden, it's like you
get into common sense, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like who the hell would want to move
to northern California and produce 10,000
[SPEAKER_03]: square feet of craft cannabis when they
can go down into Imperial Valley,
[SPEAKER_03]: Central Valley, Coachella Valley,
they can go down to Salinas, they can go
[SPEAKER_03]: to Carpinteria, they can go to San Luis
Obispo, and they can grow a million square
[SPEAKER_03]: feet of really beautiful cannabis that
they can put into packaging and sell for a
[SPEAKER_03]: premium in the consumer marketplace like
Los Angeles, San Diego, Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_03]: So at literally pennies a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're looking at some of these new
productions, five cents a gram.
[SPEAKER_03]: At scale, let's just say at 10 cents a
gram, we're at $45 a pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: Five cents a gram, we're at $22.50 a
pound.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we would have to grow tens of thousands
of pounds here just to support the taxes
[SPEAKER_03]: and the mortgage on our farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the idea that we would ever survive as
a commodities competitor, it doesn't even
[SPEAKER_03]: make sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're extremely hopeful and optimistic
because at the end of the day,
[SPEAKER_03]: we have projects.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have media projects telling the story
of who did carry this torch for this
[SPEAKER_03]: number of years, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like I've got 22 years of shipping
out of northern California, five decades
[SPEAKER_03]: of production.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, it's a legacy and a heritage that
carry the torch for everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now if industry comes in and decides that
they want to homogenize an entire region,
[SPEAKER_03]: it'd be kind of an asshole move,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And it doesn't make very much sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: It seems spiteful.
[SPEAKER_03]: UCBA just tried to do something very
similar to the retail space where they
[SPEAKER_03]: were saying, well, we're going to block
events and we're going to block small
[SPEAKER_03]: batch craft cultivators from having direct
access to consumers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not because they had to, but because they
could.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not because it made sense, but just
because they were kind of pulling the
[SPEAKER_03]: little jerk move.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: We see people doing that all the time,
but the one thing they can't have is
[SPEAKER_03]: northern California.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one thing they can't have is our
redwoods.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't have our land, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't have the millions of people
that come up here to visit our coastlines.
[SPEAKER_03]: They can't have all of these things that
we already have intrinsically linked to
[SPEAKER_03]: our survival already, which is tourism
dollars, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have an industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we just have to say, I was lucky that
I got to take that yoga class for 10
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was lucky that I got to coach soccer for
those years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was lucky that I got to do all those
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a blessing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was a gift that the medicine gave to
me.
[SPEAKER_03]: Super great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now I got to pick up the hammer and the
saw again.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to learn how to build a glamping
tent.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've got to go down to the thrift store.
[SPEAKER_03]: I got to Venice Beach out my little
glamping tent and charge $200 a night and
[SPEAKER_03]: give them a joint.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, that's what we do.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we just have to wait.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to stop crying.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have to stop scaling because if we
scale up to 10,000 square feet,
[SPEAKER_03]: we're taking all of our good resources and
dumping it into a failing market,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is the commodity space.
[SPEAKER_03]: We are not commodities farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can produce 10,000 square feet of crap,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or I could produce 2,500 square feet of
the finest cannabis on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people will pay for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people will pay for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The premium is good.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we just need to just go back to what it
was that we were doing before.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're homesteaders now.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of us moved up here as economic
refugees.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now we've learned how to farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've learned how to build.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've learned how to survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've learned how to pump our own water.
[SPEAKER_03]: We've learned how to do all of these great
things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we just get to share those gifts and
skills with the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_03]: The world is going to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we had Kevin Jodry, a mutual friend of
mine, both of ours, had Kevin Jodry on and
[SPEAKER_00]: some of the things that he's doing
specifically in Humble.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that name has such a reputation
internationally, as does Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Humble definitely does.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what we talked about.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to bring this money in,
got to bring the right money in,
[SPEAKER_00]: the positive money in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And tourism is where it's at because this
is still an epicenter.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, traveling to places like Spain for
spandibus or traveling, just getting back
[SPEAKER_00]: from Canifest to Prague.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, there's people, they know these
names.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're synonymous with top quality fire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not to say good genetics don't exist in
Europe, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: But Northern California definitely has
that image that should be taken.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, it also is going to be the capital
of regenerative farming across the world
[SPEAKER_03]: because at the end of the day,
we were behind locked gates and we became
[SPEAKER_03]: permaculturalists.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also by necessity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We shared by necessity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We communicated and became community by
necessity.
[SPEAKER_03]: We were geographically isolated.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can teach the world these values and
these skills.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on an institute-style, retreat-style
basis, we can bring people up and teach
[SPEAKER_03]: them to be permaculturalists.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we can show them living systems that
we've been building over decades as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love seeing the closed-loop farmers up
there.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a good example.
[SPEAKER_00]: These guys from aquaponics to composting
annualized.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's really cool to see what's
going on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Indigenized inoculants, microbiome,
in-ground soil.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, we do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we do polyculture for real.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's why you mentioned homestairs
because that's one thing, Kevin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this guy is so great.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you guys know, you grew up probably
with Huelhauser, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: With California Gold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I compare Kevin to Huelhauser because this
guy moved from Tennessee, but he knows
[SPEAKER_00]: more probably about California,
specifically North of San Francisco,
[SPEAKER_00]: the most natives that I grew up with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And here this guy is just so he preaches
it so well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the education that he shares as far as
what's going on and the fact that the
[SPEAKER_00]: largest acreage of privately held property
by far is in that county of this entire
[SPEAKER_00]: state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that says a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: About the whole neighbors and how you all
coexist and make things happen and do it
[SPEAKER_00]: as a collaborative, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do it as a team effort.
[SPEAKER_00]: More so now than ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you feel about, you know,
we had Mendocino, I want to say Mendocino
[SPEAKER_00]: Generations on earlier that we were
talking to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is a project like that something that's
making a difference to your point as far
[SPEAKER_00]: as taking care of the smaller growers?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I mean, so Mendocino Generations is
positioned on Greenfields Ranch,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is the oldest intentional community
in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Back to the Landers in the 1960s came
back, planted cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're seeing Mendocino Generations are
the second and third generation farmers
[SPEAKER_03]: from that original group of Back to the
Landers from San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, I've stayed and hung out in,
you know, in Greenfields for a while.
[SPEAKER_03]: I used to watch Sunsets on Steve Ryle's
property before he passed on the top of
[SPEAKER_03]: the hill and, you know, and watch his big
25, you know, monster, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: 10 pounders.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, you know, and, you know, and I rented
a property across the street in Running
[SPEAKER_03]: Springs for a little while.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I got to know a lot of these guys and
got to know a lot of these people in the
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendocino Generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're it's a really unique model.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of them are micro branding.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then they're still putting it into the
common pot to then support Arcana,
[SPEAKER_03]: which is their flower brand, the
marketing.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's kind of get that like sort of like
Thundercats Transformers model where like
[SPEAKER_03]: they all come together and make this super
thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then they can all split apart and
become this micro thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I've been running farmers markets in
Mendocino County for five years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: We would rent out of a hall and we would
do it below ground and, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: in underground farmers markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: And our original farmers that would come
down from the hills were coming down from
[SPEAKER_03]: Comchi and Greenfields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Chia was one of the original farmers and
she was one of the original brands as
[SPEAKER_03]: well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Madrone, you know, Arcana, Mendocino
Generations.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now Blazing Oaks is working with those
guys.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you're getting a lot of these farmers
that are coming in three sisters.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, a lot of these brands that are
able to be their own farmers market booth
[SPEAKER_03]: at a booth space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then when we come to a larger space,
come together and be that together.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a cooperative model that's
necessary in all industries.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's another thing that we can teach
people is how to act like like an
[SPEAKER_03]: organism, like actually act like humans
that live in community and coexist and
[SPEAKER_03]: move that model into economy.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And start creating economies of scale that
aren't necessarily scaled large,
[SPEAKER_03]: but they're replicably small and scalable.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what and that's what we see
with Arcana.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's an actual working model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And and being agile and adaptive like that
is going to allow them to survive because
[SPEAKER_03]: what Darwin adapt and survive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we are doing that model.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny you mentioned we just had
this kind of became a bit of an
[SPEAKER_00]: international show.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'll get into like the vibe on the show
from you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to hear from both of you.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just it's not your first rodeo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ricardo, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I can't wait to talk on that as well
for this specific event.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we just had some of our friends from
Santiago, Chile came up and they just did
[SPEAKER_00]: that at Expo.
[SPEAKER_00]: We they're like, hey, Lance, we want to
get you and these five other brands
[SPEAKER_00]: together and do it as a collaborative.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, 100 percent makes total
sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were all brands that complemented
each other.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had similar messaging and mantras.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rick, you and I were just talking about a
minute ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: The culture matters in a company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to align ourselves with other
companies that have that similar similar
[SPEAKER_00]: culture and ethic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's exactly what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly what this was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, it was a cost savings as this is
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the fact that we had that continuity,
we're all able to coexist.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, that's again, I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: It should be more than just we grow flour
and grow great.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it can be meaningful.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I mean, also, it's it's it's the
things that we can teach one another.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also things that we should just
be learning from other industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we shouldn't be teaching.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, you know, you go to consumer
packaged goods and you look what's
[SPEAKER_02]: happening there because almost all of that
will be applicable in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: industry of the future, even if it's not
that way yet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the segue.
[SPEAKER_03]: But then we ask the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the question.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is it right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should we be learning from extractive
industries that have destroyed the planet
[SPEAKER_03]: or should we be teaching regenerative
systems to industries and getting into the
[SPEAKER_03]: policy?
[SPEAKER_03]: See, that's the thing is we now have
grassroots policy advocates that are
[SPEAKER_03]: getting in and changing laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we can change packaging laws
because, you know what?
[SPEAKER_03]: At the end of the day, it was our survival
on the line of whether or not we were
[SPEAKER_03]: packaging or not packaging.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I mean, I've watched brands package
for six months, spend all of their money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the BCC changes.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we as small batch cultivators can't
afford a twenty, thirty thousand dollar
[SPEAKER_03]: packaging hit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we get back in and we advocate and we
write and we become participatory
[SPEAKER_03]: democracy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can teach industry that we don't have
to roll over for policy.
[SPEAKER_03]: We can change policy to change industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: To become less extractive to the whole.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's something that cannabis is
going to teach people.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a teacher.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a plant spirit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's taught us for all these decades
how to act right to the earth,
[SPEAKER_03]: how to honor the earth.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now that we're moving into industry,
now we have to act right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And industry needs to follow suit because
at the end of the day, the Paris Climate
[SPEAKER_03]: Accord and what happened with Donald Trump
and what's happening around the world,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's an up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a cry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a rallying cry for humans to start
acting in a way that's in accordance with
[SPEAKER_03]: their mother.
[SPEAKER_03]: Or get kicked out like we're out.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we have to change.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think cannabis on a larger sense,
it's like telling us like, please change
[SPEAKER_03]: these other industries, please,
for the love of all things, holy.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, and I, God, man, I hope you're
right.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I wish you were right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it comes down to how we treat the
plants and how we treat our resources.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it also comes down to how we treat our
human capital.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, I think we all hoped that
this industry could be different than any
[SPEAKER_02]: other industry, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And we saw early numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, let's just talk about how we,
you know, we're three dudes up here.
[SPEAKER_02]: How do we treat our women partners in this
mix?
[SPEAKER_02]: And they deserve more because what is the
average number of women in CEO or
[SPEAKER_02]: ownership positions in traditional
industries?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's in the 20%.
[SPEAKER_00]: We were the highest percentage of female,
to your point, in this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and it has declined every year of the
last three to four years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I want cannabis to be better.
[SPEAKER_02]: I want to believe that we can be.
[SPEAKER_02]: But right now we're just proving to just
fulfill this inevitably sad, pathetic
[SPEAKER_02]: destiny of being yet another industry
controlled by the patriarchy.
[SPEAKER_03]: And to that point, I will tell you that,
you know, it is empowering as a white male
[SPEAKER_03]: in this industry to hand that over.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had Jessica here as our CEO for a
number for a year and a half.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fucking amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: As soon as she left, like I asked
Michael's girlfriend, I was like,
[SPEAKER_03]: Teresa, will you please be our CEO?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, because we need that female
leadership because cannabis, sativa,
[SPEAKER_03]: L, you know, is feminized now.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like in the seedless cannabis is what
we're smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a female.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a goddess is what we're so like needs
to be female run.
[SPEAKER_03]: And executive director of MAP,
Janine Coleman, she cranks out like 30
[SPEAKER_03]: emails before breakfast.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a workhorse.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the type of leadership that we
need.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even Hazel here, which is Hazel Bagwell is
amazing.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's a rock star, man.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taylor Blake.
[SPEAKER_03]: Taylor Blake.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I was in on this with,
you know, watching Taylor run this for
Tim.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's next generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: She's first generation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Tim started, but Taylor took it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, so it was Desmond's birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, it was Desmond's birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it was Desmond's birthday.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it became, and then, and then,
and then, you know, and then it became the
[SPEAKER_03]: judge.
[SPEAKER_03]: But anyway, but yeah, so, but,
but, but to say it is, I see that it's so
[SPEAKER_03]: great the way she wants to be handed off
to the female and how the females are
[SPEAKER_03]: acting so well in the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it is, it's teaching me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, at least I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if anybody else doesn't learn,
at least, at least I'm learning.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a good transition because that's
exactly the last question I had.
[SPEAKER_00]: And again, we, we kind of talked about it
off camera, but Ricardo came up and I
[SPEAKER_00]: think, you know, being from Northern
California and, and, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: obviously having your past as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is your first cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: So congratulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not, he has been around the block
for years, ladies and gentlemen,
[SPEAKER_00]: and very much an advocate for the
industry, a medicinal medical advocate
[SPEAKER_00]: like myself.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this is your first Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is kind of cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: It is my first Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you for the welcome.
[SPEAKER_02]: God.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will say that this vibe is special.
[SPEAKER_02]: You have to come here to get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I get it now.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's, it's, it's special.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is, it is an expo.
[SPEAKER_02]: It is a trade show, but it's infused with
this spirit and, and, and more than
[SPEAKER_02]: anything, even though, you know,
of course there's the booths like this one
[SPEAKER_02]: that we'd expect, but it still feels like
it's a celebration of sungrown cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: which I think is what Tim started as
originally all those years ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm, I'm, I feel very warmly welcomed.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's good to see you, my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's great to meet you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can definitely say that I will be
back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd love to have you back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe we'll do a little, little tour here
or there next time you come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a couple of friends just up the
road.
[SPEAKER_00]: Love to show you what they have going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you, we we've discussed this
before and that Mike knows that's why I've
[SPEAKER_00]: been a supporter of Emerald Exchange since
the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you, in my opinion, living in Southern
California and going to an Emerald
[SPEAKER_00]: Exchange, this is exactly what I compare
it to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just bringing down that culture and that
NorCal vibe.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've heard about this, Rick,
you know, NorCal, SoCal, either you claim
[SPEAKER_00]: one or the other.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're from here, it's like,
you know, and I'm NorCal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everyone knows I hate LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not a fan.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just not my, the pretentious,
the whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I went to my first, I am so not a
fan of LA, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had to, I do.
[SPEAKER_00]: San Francisco, in my opinion, is the best
city in the country, not even the state,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's, it's efficient.
[SPEAKER_00]: You look at LA, nobody drove there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody drives in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody walks in LA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a real sign.
[SPEAKER_00]: As definitions, everyone has to drive
compared to here where you have to rent a
[SPEAKER_00]: car from a city.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got six different means of mass
transit.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I digress, but you, you captured this.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Rick saw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like this is what's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's seen it this first year.
[SPEAKER_00]: You captured the energy of NorCal with 50,
60 small, medium sized growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you brought them down to, of all
places, the Santa Monica mountains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we're talking a few miles from the
Malibu finest and the richest hoity-toity.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how did you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what, what, and how does that compare
to what you've experienced over the years
[SPEAKER_00]: here?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was doing the exchange in Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I was doing a farmer's market with an
infused dinner at night.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was, you know, you know,
doing a banquet style table, all full farm
[SPEAKER_03]: to table, a hundred percent local within
the, within the County.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I was bringing out brands,
right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Mostly it started with Mexican blankets
and mason jars, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then evolved into, of course,
bringing in branded, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: and, and your neighbor, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, drawing a really cute logo and
getting it printed at, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: at the print shop.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I, you know, about two years throwing
the event in, in, in the village of
[SPEAKER_03]: Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I went down to Malibu.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a friend of mine who's Jeremy from
Sambazon, you know, so we're down there,
[SPEAKER_03]: sanctuary on PCH having a conversation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And one of our black market friends shows
up and he started talking shit about
[SPEAKER_03]: Sungrown.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm like, he's, he's offering me like
$900.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this is two and a half years ago,
$900 for OG Sungrown pre-bought.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I told him that's bullshit that he's
going to buy it for 18 and love it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that I asked Jeremy if there was a way
that we could take the event that we were
[SPEAKER_03]: doing in Northern California and bring it
down to SoCal onto his land into Malibu.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the thought was, is how do we link a
culture?
Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like, do I bring a large group of
humans from Northern California and put it
[SPEAKER_03]: in downtown LA, the large group of humans
from Southern California, or do we take a
[SPEAKER_03]: small group of humans from, from,
you know, the village of Mendocino and
[SPEAKER_03]: from Mendocino County Hills and bring them
to another medicine culture, a place where
[SPEAKER_03]: you'll find teepees in your yards and
where there'll be a peyote ceremony
[SPEAKER_03]: possibly every other week and yoga and
yoga and sound healing and all of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so our culture meeting their culture.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's two medicine cultures actually
meeting.
[SPEAKER_03]: So coming in and then, you know,
creating this sort of, you know,
[SPEAKER_03]: it's not really a festival.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's more of like a wellness activation.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's like creating activations,
you know, instead of just booths,
[SPEAKER_03]: creating a bazaar and then having the
brands actually have yurts and teepees and
[SPEAKER_03]: tents and air streams and, you know,
and separating it out and then bring in
[SPEAKER_03]: having something to do throughout the
entire day.
[SPEAKER_03]: But really what it is, is it's that
replicable, small, scalable model where we
[SPEAKER_03]: were saying, we're going to take these
small batch cultivators and go directly to
[SPEAKER_03]: influencers, media, businesses,
and, and, and investors and say,
[SPEAKER_03]: help us scale in a small way in a place
that can afford the margins that we need
[SPEAKER_03]: to survive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you guys did that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You did a great job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's one thing I remember.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was so impressed by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think Jessica was a bit of a force
behind this as well, but coming from a
[SPEAKER_00]: digital media background like Rick,
that you guys got a lot of coverage,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of organic coverage, but that
surprised me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't just bitchpub per se,
but it was mainstream.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want a secret?
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll give this one over.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the original meeting for the Emerald
Exchange, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: That where I met Michael Katz was actually
my sister.
[SPEAKER_03]: My sister-in-law, Megan Champion,
she hooked me up with Michael Katz and
[SPEAKER_03]: then Matthew from Foria and Brittany
Comfort, Matthew's PR person.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're all at a dinner hanging out and
Matthew's very reserved.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know if you know Matthew well,
but Matthew's very reserved.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think things are a good idea,
but he's, he's strategic and he's built a
[SPEAKER_03]: really great brand and a really good
business model and he's great.
[SPEAKER_03]: But having him come in as a sponsor was a
little bit, iffy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what he did was he gave us Brittany,
his PR person.
[SPEAKER_03]: So his sponsorship contribution was
Brittany.
[SPEAKER_03]: So all of that national media and local
bougie media that Foria was getting then
[SPEAKER_03]: became our media with the exchange.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hired Louisa and Jeremy's wedding
planner to come on and curate the original
[SPEAKER_03]: event.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we had bougie media and a bougie Malibu
wedding planner throw this event that was
[SPEAKER_03]: ended up being the perfect storm.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they came out of the cover to the LA
Weekly saying, this farmer's market proves
[SPEAKER_03]: that weed is the new wine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that was it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like as soon as that headline comes out,
it was like, we, we'd, we'd gain a
[SPEAKER_03]: following.
[SPEAKER_03]: That was amazing vibes.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a couple of Trustafarians,
a couple of the hipsters come up from
[SPEAKER_00]: Malibu, a couple of those spoiled kids,
but it's cool because like it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was even just the guests.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was the people attending.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of kept them in check.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they kind of came in with this LA
attitude.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I remember people like they're sitting
somewhere and kind of being rude to
[SPEAKER_00]: someone.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, no, we all share the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not your table, my table.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is our table.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just like, Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're talking about the Malibu gold guys
and all that stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the idea was, you know, is that we
hand select and curate our attendees.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't just broadcast it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: We, we, our influencers then invite their
friends that they want to see and meet the
[SPEAKER_03]: farmers.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's not like we're just, Hey guys,
want to come to an event?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you know, Hey, you know,
you should really tell a couple of your
[SPEAKER_03]: close friends because we like you.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next one you have, maybe you and I can
pitch up and get this guy to come out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, you need to come down.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's for one day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if he has an office out there now,
he has to come visit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have a guest room, just saying.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, well, I want to thank both of you
guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is, we're in the final hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can hear all the tear down noise in
the background here, but I really,
[SPEAKER_00]: really sincerely appreciate you guys both
taking the time, which was just us
[SPEAKER_00]: catching up.
[SPEAKER_00]: His old friends in the hallway,
taking the time to catch up with us here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thanks again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get a meat shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, buddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Okay.
Okay.
