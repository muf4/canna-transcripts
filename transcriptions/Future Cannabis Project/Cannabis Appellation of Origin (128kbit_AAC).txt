[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Justin Calvino and I am one of
the founders of the Mendocino Appalachians
[SPEAKER_00]: project.
[SPEAKER_00]: I drew the first rendition of the map and
have since been working on Mendocino
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is Swami Chaitanya and I'm a cannabis
cultivator up in northern Mendocino County
[SPEAKER_02]: and I've been very active in Mendocino
County trying to get a fair deal for the
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis growers and I feel that one of
the more positive things we can do is a
[SPEAKER_02]: proactive campaign to make Appalachians
the standard for having cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: designated to certain geographical areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it's the best thing we can do to
save the small farmer so we're working on
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Today we're going to be talking about a
little education.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think all things Appalachian right now
are education based.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the word mean anyway?
[SPEAKER_00]: We learn every single day.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a designation, it's a name.
[SPEAKER_00]: We actually got a discussion about the
name Appalachian in the very beginning
[SPEAKER_00]: where it was to appeal the appellate court
to name.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know, I know, but there was a whole
discussion and policy about the fact that
[SPEAKER_00]: because of the name, the appellate in
Latin, that they would be able just to
[SPEAKER_00]: name anything an Appalachian and have it
stick.
[SPEAKER_00]: As an Appalachian designation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Appalachian now means to appeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: To appeal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in an appellate court right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where does the word come from?
[SPEAKER_00]: The word is Latin and then it came into
France.
[SPEAKER_00]: The French designated Appalachians
originally as Rockford.
[SPEAKER_02]: Let's go back to your French lesson when
you took French 101 if you ever did.
[SPEAKER_02]: The first thing you learned is my name is
Swami.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or basically I call myself Swami.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's what je m'appelle Swami means.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am called Swami.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Appel is the name of or to be called.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when we say Appalachian Saint-Emilion,
which is a small district in France,
[SPEAKER_02]: it means that the wine from that area is
definitely from that area and it can bear
[SPEAKER_02]: the name.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has the privilege to use the name that
it's from specifically that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just like Americans, we like to take
names and we like to change them to serve
[SPEAKER_00]: our purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where the appellate court into
appeal.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was one of those rabbit holes that
didn't get you too far.
[SPEAKER_02]: So Appalachian is the name of the region
in which whatever it is, whether it's
[SPEAKER_02]: cheese or wine or now we're saying
cannabis, that it's certified that it's
[SPEAKER_02]: coming from that particular region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how do we choose the region?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, one of the most important things
that we're doing right now is actually not
[SPEAKER_00]: just choosing the regions, but choosing
the regions by their standards and
[SPEAKER_00]: practices and having those standards be
the name.
[SPEAKER_00]: So may standards be thy name, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: I guess.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would have a region designated by
their regenerative farming practices,
[SPEAKER_00]: their in-ground sun-soil relationship,
the traditional markers for quality,
[SPEAKER_00]: which would be small, craft, artisanal,
and of course, regionally specific,
[SPEAKER_00]: small, micro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we even use it even now.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have Idaho potatoes.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have, you know, Jamaican Blue Mountain
coffee and all these different things that
[SPEAKER_02]: have a value because there's a name
associated with them that they come from
[SPEAKER_02]: that place, but they're also of that
place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's where we get into what our
education lesson is for today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The difference between a geographical
indication or an indicator and an
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachian of origin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swami?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, a geographical indicator is simply
an affirmation that the product came from
[SPEAKER_02]: a particular area.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we have that in the United States
called AVA's, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those are mean American viticultural
areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: And once again, it's just a designation
that that particular set of grapes in that
[SPEAKER_02]: bottle comes from that area.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we know in Napa, it only has to be 85%
grapes from Napa and they can still use
[SPEAKER_02]: the Napa name.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can't really legally use Appalachian.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can only say AVA.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because it's a GI, it has to be from
that region or 85% from that region,
[SPEAKER_00]: but the standards aren't generally
attached to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's where we get into the sort of,
you know, what practitioner, what
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivator or operator, however you want
to call it, wants to develop certain
[SPEAKER_00]: practices for their region specific and
what standards and qualifiers they
[SPEAKER_00]: actually have to obtain before calling
themselves of that area.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the reasons why we say of versus
in, a geographical indicator would be in a
[SPEAKER_00]: region, indoor grown, engineered soil,
greenhouse, any of those things,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can be done in any various regions.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could have an indoor grow in downtown
LA and it could be downtown LA grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was grown in downtown LA, but it was
not grown of downtown LA unless you tore
[SPEAKER_00]: down the building, tore up the concrete,
planted it directly in the soil and
[SPEAKER_00]: allowed it to be of the region.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anyway, the basic minimum that we're
talking about that to begin with,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's got to be grown in full sun,
and it's got to be in the soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the reason it's got to be in the soil
is if it's of the earth, those roots and
[SPEAKER_02]: the fungi and everything that's in the
soil is now connecting it and reaching out
[SPEAKER_02]: to all the other plants in the actual
area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's starting to draw its nutrients
from the ground itself in the actual area
[SPEAKER_02]: where it's grown.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it literally becomes of the earth.
[SPEAKER_02]: It represents the earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: In that one location, in that one space,
in this one space, I'm not going to point
[SPEAKER_00]: you out directly, but... We're up here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the Bell Springs region of Northern
California, when someone decides to put in
[SPEAKER_00]: a plant and it expresses itself in that
region, it comes of that region that's the
[SPEAKER_00]: only place in the world that that plant
will be able to express itself in that
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then we say the only way to truly
make sure that marker of quality is met of
[SPEAKER_00]: that region is that it is touching the
native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: That it has the environmental implications
of soil temperature, moisture temperature
[SPEAKER_00]: and content in the soil, as well as marine
layer influence, sun influence.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it depends on whether it's on top of
the mountain or down in the valley or
[SPEAKER_02]: something, how far it is from the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would be the determinant of the
Appalachians.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because like in Napa, they start the
Appalachians down right next to the bay in
[SPEAKER_02]: the Carnaros region, but they grow
different grapes there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow right here about a mile and a half
from the coast in Albion.
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow a pineapple.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have less than 5% mold.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have almost full marine layer influence
until 11 o'clock every morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are like, and I grow what people
call bonsai.
[SPEAKER_00]: Little plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now here's something you learned that over
the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's one of the key ingredients of
Taowar and Appalachian as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the collective knowledge that the
people in the area who've been there for
[SPEAKER_02]: now a couple of generations, two and three
generations up in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so these people have figured out
what's the best thing to grow here,
[SPEAKER_02]: how does it grow best.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you see the nutrients in the plant,
they're the ones mostly producing the
[SPEAKER_02]: terpenes.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the cultivar that's kind of saying
it's going to be CBD, TAC.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the terpenes are really the product of
the nutrients that you put in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if those nutrients are coming from the
soil of the area, then that's going to be
[SPEAKER_02]: the flavor of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: The terpenes are going to be an expression
of the area.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as we get into international
Appalachian designation, we're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: get into metabolomic research and data
capturing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wait, wait, what did you call that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Metabolomic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So metabolomic is the capture of the
cellular information at a certain stage of
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like tissue culture?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like cellular data mapping.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at different stages of the vegetation
into flower, the plant's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: expressing itself in different ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have the metabolism or metabolomic
expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like a sugar in a grape or a Briggs count.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to reach its peak.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have flavonoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have this full expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we say, when we want to get poetic
about Appalachians, we allow our plants to
[SPEAKER_00]: fully express in this region.
[SPEAKER_00]: To fully express a plant is to give full
and true medicine.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the only way to get that full
expression is, number one, full sun.
[SPEAKER_02]: But now we're also using the word long
season.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, long season.
[SPEAKER_02]: All the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all the way.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's like sometime in March or
April, you put your seeds in.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you harvest sometime in
September, October, and November?
[SPEAKER_00]: Depending on the region.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Albion, I put in after the first new
moon in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I put the first new moon in June.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've had to propagate my seeds in a
greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I also use a light supplemental
lighting to allow them to get to a certain
[SPEAKER_00]: size, usually about knee to waist high.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them in first full moon of June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then after my soil has been fully
cover cropped, I double dig my soil back
[SPEAKER_00]: in.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put my plants in first full moon of
June.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I'm hoping that I have full
trichome development and full ripeness by
[SPEAKER_00]: equinox.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the moisture content in my soil
gets so cold that people are like,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, it's still hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an Indian summer.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, I'm in a different place.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to take my first plant until
October 4th.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but the sun hits a certain distance.
[SPEAKER_00]: My track in the sky, it goes below my tree
line.
[SPEAKER_00]: My soil doesn't get hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: My marine layer influence and the wet and
the damp in my soil, it smells like earth.
[SPEAKER_00]: I wouldn't have the vaguest idea how to
grow over on the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: The New West Summit two years ago,
I brought wine glasses not full of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis, but full of soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had people smell my soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say almost every person that
came in could smell wet earth from my
[SPEAKER_00]: Albion property.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, I see.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: From the coast, from right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then from my Navarro property,
they were smelling drier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were smelling almost clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They could say, oh, it smells kind of like
they were salivating.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they were salivating when they smelled
my clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they smelled it, they were
reminded of a rain forest or moss,
[SPEAKER_00]: peaty soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: See, we're adding to our soil all the
ingredients from our local farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get wood chips from the fallen
branches.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get some forest stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get leaves.
[SPEAKER_02]: We get the grass from the fields that we
mow and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that keeps getting added on to our.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you have very dry vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the other thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where you are, you have very dry
vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have moist and wet vegetation.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I chip up apple, because I have an
apple farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I chip up a lot of my apple waste that
is already in a degradation period.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very soft core.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I chip up, it's already on its way
to composting on the tree.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then that goes into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm already composting within the first
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have as much woody mass.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas you have a very dry chip mass,
which means that it's going to be harder
[SPEAKER_00]: to break down.
[SPEAKER_00]: And your soil is going to still retain
that dry aspect to it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, we have a worm bin, too,
that all of our food scraps go into.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're a part of our food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we have a compost pile.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all that's sort of local ingredients
that keep coming in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Our manure comes in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes from 20 miles away and stuff like
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So all of that is the local thing that's
going in.
[SPEAKER_02]: Local ingredients that are making the
terroir really an expression of the land
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_02]: And therefore, the terpenes, particularly
in the plant, are expressing the land
[SPEAKER_02]: itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I know you've talked extensively with
Frenchy as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been hanging out and getting yelled
at by Frenchy, is really what we call it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in talking to him, this is a
multi-decade development in what this is
[SPEAKER_00]: like.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, I can say, and we can
fantasize and be poetic about what our
[SPEAKER_00]: practice is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But until we've done a decade of
production.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what we're involved in now is we're
trying to raise a little money to buy
[SPEAKER_02]: weather stations.
Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Costco, I think so.
[SPEAKER_02]: Feed the map.
[SPEAKER_02]: Little weather stations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we'll put those on maybe two or three
farms in each one of these areas.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we need 30 or 40 of these weather
stations.
[SPEAKER_02]: And with those, we'll start to begin the
data collection of the metabolic
[SPEAKER_02]: information.
[SPEAKER_02]: What did you call it?
[SPEAKER_02]: Metabolomic.
[SPEAKER_02]: Metabolomic information.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, metabolomic comes from one
university, the Mendel University in
[SPEAKER_00]: Prague.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the only machine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the International Recognition for
Appalachian comes from Prague.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will be able to give our climactic
data and our climactic data as well as our
[SPEAKER_00]: cultural data in.
[SPEAKER_00]: But our genetic and our metabolomic
expression will be the capture that we put
[SPEAKER_00]: into our IP.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we will never be able to create an IP
expression for our region and say,
[SPEAKER_00]: oh, here's intellectual property.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our intellectual property will be
classified by our metabolomic expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the important thing is we have
to have that unique metabolomic.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we start with just the meteorologic
information.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're also going to get soil.
[SPEAKER_02]: We've been talking to soil scientists and
so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we want to really get an idea of what
the native soil really is and then what
[SPEAKER_02]: the soil that the farmer has created.
[SPEAKER_02]: From that native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those two data sets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bookend, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Metabolomic in the center.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We also need water data, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, water.
[SPEAKER_02]: All of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Triangulate.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's where we're in the process now
of trying to... We haven't really started
[SPEAKER_02]: a campaign to raise money to get the...
Oh, we've started a campaign.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just haven't actually raised any.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we say, feed the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: Feed the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just came up with that, actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We need to get these pieces of equipment
to start the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because say, once again, look at Napa.
[SPEAKER_02]: Down in Carneros, which is on the bay,
they get so many days of fog.
[SPEAKER_02]: But up in Calistoga, they almost get no
fog.
[SPEAKER_02]: And down in Carneros, they get no days of
frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And up in Calistoga, they get five,
10 days of frost.
[SPEAKER_02]: And on and on and on.
[SPEAKER_02]: That kind of stuff says, well,
that's why they grow certain grapes in
[SPEAKER_02]: Calistoga and they grow different grapes
in Carneros.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where we'll inject the... We
need to prove it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, see, Frenchy and I were talking.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no.
[SPEAKER_02]: Frenchy and I were talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the problems I kept saying was
like, well, you know, an awful lot of
[SPEAKER_02]: people in Mendo and Humboldt and so on
have brought in soil bag soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's hosian forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's happy frog like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So how can we possibly call it a terroir
if it's that?
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we start talking about what
happens if you're using regenerative
[SPEAKER_02]: methods of agriculture, if you're creating
living soil, and if you've got your
[SPEAKER_02]: compost and your worm fin and you take all
this stuff from your land and you put it
[SPEAKER_02]: in, over time, the soil, even though it
might have started with potting soil,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's now got all those local ingredients.
[SPEAKER_02]: And likewise, the living part of the soil,
the hyphae of the fungi and the bacteria,
[SPEAKER_02]: they're reaching out into the rest of the
soil away from your pot or your mound,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And so it's to begin to bring in stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so over like four or five years,
your actual soil is going to be native
[SPEAKER_02]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to create native soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's where the purists will get into
like, say, Crystal Ortiz, who's doing a
[SPEAKER_00]: full dry farm method, but she lives in an
alluvian flat, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I love that, but I can't do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Home's flat is an alluvian flat in the Eel
River.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a beautiful space, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like this gorgeous, you know,
corn and sunflowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was an old alfalfa.
[SPEAKER_02]: But then we need a real certification of
dry farming as well, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Because anybody could claim it,
but are they doing it?
[SPEAKER_00]: I did dry farming last year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, dry farming-ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: There were two waterings, one of which was
the on-set watering, where I put it in,
[SPEAKER_00]: and I watered it in, and then I let it
sit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I had a numb guy come out there
one day, like, hey, guys, I wanted your
[SPEAKER_00]: plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, ah, my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anyway, regardless.
[SPEAKER_00]: But going through dry farming,
it was like watching the plants flag and
[SPEAKER_00]: watching them come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Crystal said she's never dealt with
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like there are different ways of
having it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But wilting and so on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I got to throw water on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, actually, maybe sometimes you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, you're forcing the taproot down into
mineral contact in a hard pan.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I was saying about the indigenizing
the inoculants, it's like some of your
[SPEAKER_00]: more elitist or some of your more
stringent, you know, standards-based
[SPEAKER_00]: people will say, oh, we want 75% native.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it doesn't matter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going for size here,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going for true expression.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we want it to eat the mineral.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you're in hard pan, that's nearly
impossible.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll drown your plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can barely ever water because the idea
is that it's not in like a- Well,
[SPEAKER_00]: you either have to not grow or grow
different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have to grow fully different.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you might have a full sea of green
methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you'll see maybe, say, in like Dos Rios
or like Hatchet Valley, maybe is a sea of
[SPEAKER_00]: green, fully dry farmed sea of green in a
hard pan soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're only about that big.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're only about this big.
[SPEAKER_00]: But if you go to the regions in
Afghanistan, right, like that Afghani
[SPEAKER_00]: Kush, those guys are just like,
I mean, unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an unirrigated desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't irrigate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't irrigate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the middle of the desert.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they also, all the plants are like
crowded together.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're super crowded and they're hard
packed.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's one that's just got one long
stalk up there and one flower on it and so
[SPEAKER_02]: on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go and then they machete
them all down, bale them up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because they're not making flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're not selling flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're making hash or charros,
as they're calling it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, charros is when you run through the
field and you get the sticky- Now,
[SPEAKER_02]: that's the story of the naked virgin
running through the field and getting all-
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not a true story.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also children.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's also children.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Manali, in northern India- Well,
actually, the way you do it in Manali,
[SPEAKER_02]: you pull on the raw plant, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's what they call the cream,
malai.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when you roll that, that's the
charros.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the hip.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in Afghanistan, they do it different
than in India.
[SPEAKER_00]: They beat it on a screen.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: But in India, they do the dry plant after
they do the wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, after they do the wet.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then the women do like this and get
out the seeds because they want the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: And they beat the key.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's another thing about this
appellation.
[SPEAKER_02]: If we get this model down, they can use it
in Afghanistan.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can use it in Nepal and Thailand and
all these places that are the tradition of
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis growing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they can protect themselves from
industries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And also take care of the small farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're dealing with a microcosm of
what legalization is going to look like
[SPEAKER_00]: internationally.
Right?
Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Swami, you're 75.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got 20 years left in you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going to be wheeling you on stage.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I suppose.
[SPEAKER_02]: We'll be talking to the Senate and the
House of Representatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we go to the UN twice this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: We go once in December and once in March
to talk to them about cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: appellation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm submitting a paper with various people
for that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've tackled, I think on my contribution
now, I'm on UN sustainability goal number
[SPEAKER_00]: 10.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can't stop commenting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of those are pretty repetitious.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think they were written by elementary
school students and college students.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the fact is, some of them are very
repetitious.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I keep saying, cannabis is the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cannabis is the answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I saw a lot of that feedback.
[SPEAKER_00]: And through Appellations, we have a full
microeconomic perspective.
Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because we're into full localization.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is buffalo medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, how do we use all of the
plant and all of the community?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you mean, buffalo medicine?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, in America, well,
buffalo are in Africa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Bison are in America.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in America, the white bison are in the
middle of the white bison.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the bison, you have all of the bison
used by the tribe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Native Americans, they used every bit
of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what I say about Appellations being
bison medicine is essentially,
[SPEAKER_00]: we're using all of the community,
all of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're using all of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, they're even starting to figure out
how to use the root.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because apparently the root has completely
different chemistry than everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it still has trace cannabinoids
present as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's got the other things that no
where else appear.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have pharmaceutical companies
actually taking full plant flour and
[SPEAKER_00]: throwing it in a large scale extraction
machines and pulling out, isolating all
[SPEAKER_00]: different cannabinoids that weren't
present before because they were able to
[SPEAKER_00]: develop at different stages.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a company out of North Carolina
that's come up with this giant extraction
[SPEAKER_00]: machine, just 230 liters an hour.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just strip everything down,
throw it into a vat, spin it, cook it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just read that there are over 530
compounds in a cannabis plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were 82.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, it was 400 last year.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're talking cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Just cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, there were 82 cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_02]: They found another 40 or so like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a continuum.
[SPEAKER_02]: So anything we need to say to wrap this up
to make the last little point of whatever?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I mean, before you are involving
yourself in a discussion about
[SPEAKER_00]: geographical indication or GIs,
understand the difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: appellation at the highest possible
standard, a top standard of GI,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then the traditional GI, which still
allows you to have community pride.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not bad to say LA grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's what they call an indication of
source.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really even a geographic
indicator.
[SPEAKER_00]: It involves itself in metrics.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the metric conversation,
it'll be very much involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: This product was derived from this space.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, see, track and trace, once it gets
actually running, whatever it happens,
[SPEAKER_02]: will enable us to say that this indeed all
of this comes from Mendo or Humboldt or
[SPEAKER_02]: wherever it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: And by the way, any other county that
wants to have an appellation application
[SPEAKER_02]: or a whole kind of thing, just get it
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your county together.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get meetings together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ah, ah, ah.
[SPEAKER_00]: What?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no such thing as a county
boundary.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: I stand corrected.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because we're talking about geography.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're talking about microbiomes,
biological boundaries.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biology doesn't respect a tax base.
[SPEAKER_00]: So at the end of the day, a lot of our IP
that we're developing right here will go
[SPEAKER_00]: to dissolve.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, because this area up here,
this is a whole pretty much an area which
[SPEAKER_02]: is distinct in itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just spent two days in Palo Verde
right here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the Palo Verde appellation goes into
Bell Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's a fight between the volunteer fire
department of Palo Verde and Bell Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that might actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not a fire department.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a fire brigade.
[SPEAKER_00]: A fire brigade.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, see where it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: See, that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your brigade and their department are
arguing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because there was a clearing issue
coming across county lines.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mendo wouldn't clear for Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Palo Verde was like, what are you
talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're fighting fires.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're like, yeah, but we stop at the
county line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Palo Verde was like, that's bullshit.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that wasn't our fire brigade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was your fire brigade.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was Bell Springs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I could talk about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's a region here that's linked
together by fire districts, that's linked
[SPEAKER_00]: together by watershed, that's linked
together by the gravel pit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, you drive up there and it looks like
the same area.
[SPEAKER_02]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the same area.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got oaks and the drone and fur and so
on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that county boundary has nothing to say
to the environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what do we talk about that?
[SPEAKER_02]: But anyone who has an environmental area
that you want to protect, then you
[SPEAKER_02]: absolutely have to start doing the
research to say, get together,
[SPEAKER_02]: make your meetings, and start collecting
the data.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you can say that the foothills of the
Sierra will be a whole separate area,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever it's actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: There's a north foothill and a south
foothill and so on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with your regional trade group or
association, this is really a subcommittee
[SPEAKER_00]: that can form with already organized
farmers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we get into cooperatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get into already organized trade
organizations and actually get a
[SPEAKER_00]: subcommittee to help develop Appalachians
in Arties.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's not reinventing the wheel.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_02]: But the other thing that's key,
like in France, where the Appalachians
[SPEAKER_02]: come from, it was always originated with
the farmers themselves, the local farmers
[SPEAKER_02]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you have to meet their local
categorization to apply.
[SPEAKER_02]: The federal government of France,
they will accept the things or reject
[SPEAKER_02]: them, but they can't propose and they
can't change it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is where it's local control of
what the farmers themselves are really
[SPEAKER_02]: doing and what they say.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be part of our group, you got to do it
this way.
[SPEAKER_00]: This allows us to exert agricultural
rights not seen by any other ordinance,
[SPEAKER_00]: any other initiative, any other statute in
the state of law.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are breaking ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a revolutionary moment for
agriculturalists to actually claim rights
[SPEAKER_00]: for land.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
Okay.
Anyway.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
