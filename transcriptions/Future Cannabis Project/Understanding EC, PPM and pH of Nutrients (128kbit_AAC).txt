[SPEAKER_01]: 200 parts per million of nitrogen will
read different as an EC than 200 parts per
[SPEAKER_01]: million of potassium, because they have a
different electroconductivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're reading parts per million on a
meter, it's a combination of all the salts
[SPEAKER_01]: together that you're reading.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is nitrogen a salt?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, almost all fertilizers are salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: A salt is a metal and a nonmetal,
technically a metal and a nonmetal that
[SPEAKER_01]: have combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: So nitrogen, calcium nitrate, calcium is
the metal, potassium is the metal,
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrate is the nonmetal, potassium sulfate
is a salt, sodium chloride, sodium is the
[SPEAKER_01]: metal, chloride is the nonmetal.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so most all nutrients are a type of
salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's where people will get into
difficulty if they use something like urea
[SPEAKER_01]: or ammonia, because you can mix urea in
water and not get a reading, because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not a salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no electroconductivity in the
urea.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's simply a double ammonia molecule.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ammonia is the same way.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't read.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're using those elements,
you have to be careful that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: understanding how much you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the other end of it is that if you're
growing in a situation where it's cold,
[SPEAKER_01]: the bacteria that break down urea work at
a lower temperature than the bacteria that
[SPEAKER_01]: break down ammonia.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so what you can end up with is urea
being broke down into ammonia and just
[SPEAKER_01]: sitting there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you get ammonia toxicity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if the temperature is warm enough,
it just naturally converts into nitrogen
[SPEAKER_01]: from the ammonia.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if someone's using their EC reader,
they won't even know that this is an
[SPEAKER_00]: issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, that's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, EC or parts per million,
because they are the same.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're reading the same type of
information.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you're sort of mixing together your
nutrients and you're measuring PPM,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a derivative of EC, what are you
looking for?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what do different levels tell you?
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're looking at EC, it's basically
just telling you a level of nutrients that
[SPEAKER_01]: are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're feeding more nutrients there
that are present, generally the easier the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant has finding them and using them.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is up to a point, of course,
because everybody knows it gets too high,
[SPEAKER_01]: you start burning roots because the salts
will then start pulling water out of the
[SPEAKER_01]: root and the roots die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I say it's kind of true because what's
more important actually than the level of
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients is actually the balance of
nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much nitrogen there is to potassium
compared to phosphorus, compared to
[SPEAKER_01]: calcium, compared to iron, magnesium,
manganese, all the different nutrients
[SPEAKER_01]: that are there.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more balanced it is, it's like eating
a balanced diet yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more balanced it is, the healthier you
are, the better you feel, the more you can
[SPEAKER_01]: do what you're supposed to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're overloaded in fats, you might
grow, but carry too much weight,
[SPEAKER_01]: which will not allow you to do many
things.
[SPEAKER_01]: Things that you want to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have enough fats,
of course then you don't have enough
[SPEAKER_01]: energy because pretty much you need fat in
your diet to get enough energy.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you're exercising strenuously or just
working hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it works that way with plants too.
[SPEAKER_01]: The more balanced what you have,
nutrient for your plants, the better off
[SPEAKER_01]: you are.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's part of why I don't like parts per
million because everybody thinks parts per
[SPEAKER_01]: million is telling you what you have for
nutrients and it doesn't.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just tells you what the level of salts
are.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if it were all sea salt, you would
have almost nothing that was good for the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant in there, but it would still read
parts per million of say 1200.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so the readers give you a rough
estimate of the EC of all the elements in
[SPEAKER_00]: aggregate, not like here's the EC of this
element or that element.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and that's a good point.
[SPEAKER_01]: EC is no better for reading whether
they're good or not.
[SPEAKER_01]: It simply is a measurement of a relative
level of nutrient or salts in your
[SPEAKER_01]: solution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it comes to having a level of
trust that the nutrient supplier is
[SPEAKER_01]: telling you exactly what he's giving you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, because if you can trust that,
then you can sort of, you can work
[SPEAKER_00]: backwards to figure out what's going on,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to remember also that in your
nutrient solution, mostly what they talk
[SPEAKER_01]: about is N, P, and K, nitrogen,
phosphorus, potassium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as important of all as in all of
those, some of them will tell you calcium
[SPEAKER_01]: and that's terribly important,
but iron, copper, boron, seldom are
[SPEAKER_01]: mentioned in there, but more than likely
they have those elements in the feed.
[SPEAKER_01]: They just don't tell you what it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, so then if you do trust what they
say on the packaging, then what are you
[SPEAKER_01]: going to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you going to do?
What are you going to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plant's going to suck up different
nutrients and different proportions based
[SPEAKER_00]: on what it needs and wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, and you could actually potentially,
from one day to another, run short on one
[SPEAKER_01]: of the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why reintroducing a complete
shot or complete balance is quite
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, I think we missed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went on a tangent there from where...
Off of EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, off of EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's kind of like, what do you want to
feed at?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're watering quite regular,
you can feed at a higher EC.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because between the one water to the next,
you don't lose so much of the moisture,
[SPEAKER_01]: the water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And EC is an electrical conductivity,
which is a measure of the concentration of
[SPEAKER_01]: salts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in your growing media, if you've got...
Just for a number to pick, we've got 500
[SPEAKER_01]: grams of fertilizer in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's completely saturated.
[SPEAKER_01]: The EC is going to be at a certain level.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know exactly what it is,
but at a certain level.
[SPEAKER_01]: As that pot dries out, the plant is using
water, taking water out of there or water
[SPEAKER_01]: is evaporating out the top.
[SPEAKER_01]: The EC is just going to climb because it's
a concentration of the salts in your
[SPEAKER_01]: media.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as the weight of the media gets
lighter because it's losing water,
[SPEAKER_01]: the EC is going to ramp up.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what would bring the EC... What would
maybe not in the same scope, but wouldn't
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant sucking up nutrients also lower,
you see a little bit, but not as quickly
[SPEAKER_00]: as the dry ends raising it?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it tends to use more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: And also you do lose some water from
evaporation from the media.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the plant tends to use more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: You also never have the nutrients in exact
balance.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's certain elements that are going
to gradually be climbing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And depending on the stage of growth or
the time of day or what's going on with
[SPEAKER_01]: the way the plant is growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you'll gradually always be building
some nutrients, maybe diminishing some
[SPEAKER_01]: others.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in general, as the time from water to
water goes, the EC within your growing
[SPEAKER_01]: media is going to go up because there is
less moisture in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the other thing this thing reads is pH
levels.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the relevance of pH levels to
healthy, happy plant growth?
[SPEAKER_00]: Specifically cannabis, because different
plants have different pH likings.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I mean, you're familiar with a lot
of citrus fruits and camellias and that
[SPEAKER_01]: really like a low pH around four or three,
five or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most plants like a pH, say five,
five, five, six to six something.
[SPEAKER_01]: Six, four.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's some plants that like it
higher than that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Most of the time, it's a result of where
the plant originated from because the
[SPEAKER_01]: plant has developed to survive in a
certain environment.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so its genetics gives it a certain pH
range that it likes, mostly related to how
[SPEAKER_01]: nutrients are available to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: pH oftentimes, if you've got a high pH,
calcium becomes more available.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a low pH, you start to get low
availability of calcium.
[SPEAKER_01]: Iron and most of your sulfated
micronutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the time, say 20 years ago,
they used to push an EC or pH of say six,
[SPEAKER_01]: five, seven, two or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is because a lot of the sulfated
micronutrients are more available at those
[SPEAKER_01]: pHs.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we've gotten into more chelated
micronutrients, we have gradually been
[SPEAKER_01]: working with a bit lower and bit lower.
[SPEAKER_01]: So now we start to get below six to mid
five to mid six as a pH where many of the
[SPEAKER_01]: pH or the micronutrients are available to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: So keeping your pH in a certain level is
oftentimes important to the availability
[SPEAKER_01]: of the nutrients around it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But so a specific pH level allows
nutrients to sort of make themselves
[SPEAKER_00]: bioavailable in different rates?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: More available, less available.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can look in the online or in an
encyclopedia or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: They'll have a chart that shows which
nutrients are available most at what pHs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you take somewhere down the middle
where almost everything is available
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty close to the most, there's one or
two of them that actually kind of outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of that line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ralph and I don't remember what they are.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's a couple of them that if you
could run a lower pH, it'd actually be
[SPEAKER_01]: better for that nutrient, but it isn't for
any of the others.
[SPEAKER_00]: So working backwards, when a nutrient
supplier creates nutrients, they need you
[SPEAKER_00]: to live within a certain pH range because
they're formulating to a specific range so
[SPEAKER_00]: that they know, oh, we need more of this
because that isn't as bioavailable at that
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we, as growers, just gradually
acclimatize to that because we notice our
[SPEAKER_01]: plants are growing better at this pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we just kind of gradually push
ourselves to the pH of the nutrient that
[SPEAKER_01]: we're buying because it seems to work
better.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so you'll hear lots of growers talk
about, oh, I like a pH of around six,
[SPEAKER_01]: a little above six or below six.
[SPEAKER_01]: But really, most of the time, you're going
to find them in that five, five to six,
[SPEAKER_01]: five.
[SPEAKER_01]: Somewhere in between there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they found a spot.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it may have to do with their water
because the water that you're using is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to affect the pH.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of an acid you're using for pH
up and down because they will react
[SPEAKER_01]: quicker or slower changing the pH of what
you have and making the nutrients more
[SPEAKER_01]: available, less available.
All right.
All right.
