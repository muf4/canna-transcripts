[SPEAKER_04]: So why don't we start with High Times
thinks that the retail game is where it's
[SPEAKER_04]: at and they're making a big pivot.
[SPEAKER_04]: So who wants to start with that one?
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I could start.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, look, it's I told I think I said
this to Tom the other day.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was like, everybody wants to do retail
until they get into retail.
[SPEAKER_06]: It sounds fun.
[SPEAKER_06]: It looks, you know, glamorous.
[SPEAKER_06]: But it's, you know, I think High Times is
in for a rude awakening when they realize
[SPEAKER_06]: that the amount of money there there is in
retail is horrible.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you know, unless you're going to try to
cut corners and try to evade certain
[SPEAKER_06]: things here and there, which I'm not going
to lie, a third of retailers are doing
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, they're not doing things that
exactly the way that they've been supposed
[SPEAKER_06]: to.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, and which shocks me because
there has been a few quite a few retailers
[SPEAKER_06]: that have already been busted by the BCC.
[SPEAKER_06]: Legal ones doing things that they're not
supposed to.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know one that got caught with
100 pounds of illicit cannabis,
[SPEAKER_06]: selling it out of the jar from underneath
the register, underneath the counter.
[SPEAKER_06]: And they still have their license and
nothing's nothing's done.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, that's another disheartening
fact, you know, off subject.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, yeah, I think High Times is in for a
rude awakening when they realize that the
[SPEAKER_06]: retail business is not all it was meant to
be and that they're not going to be able
[SPEAKER_06]: to get the evaluation that they want from
retail to sell it or what they eventually
[SPEAKER_06]: plan on doing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, wait a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let's back up a second.
[SPEAKER_05]: Were they just slapped?
[SPEAKER_05]: Were they just let go or there was a slap
on the wrist?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because that's not enforcement.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, it's not enforcement at all.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, you know, the BCC has always said,
oh, well, we only enforce and the DCR,
[SPEAKER_06]: we only enforce against legal operators
because that's what we can do.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what we're allowed to do.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're not allowed to enforce against
illegal, but they're not enforcing against
[SPEAKER_06]: legal ones either that are breaking the
laws.
[SPEAKER_06]: So and when you do that, now you're
creating a completely miskewed market
[SPEAKER_06]: because now you have legal operators that
are doing illegal stuff to cut corners.
[SPEAKER_04]: Isn't cushy punch back to business as
usual?
[SPEAKER_06]: Cushy punch is back to business.
[SPEAKER_06]: You know, I mean, they got caught with a
completely illegal facility running two
[SPEAKER_06]: locations.
[SPEAKER_06]: And again, I know.
[SPEAKER_06]: Are you guys selling cushy punch in your
shop?
[SPEAKER_06]: I am not, but I'm friends with the owner
and I met him.
[SPEAKER_06]: I met up with him the other day and I
asked him.
[SPEAKER_06]: He said, oh yeah, we're going to be back
online.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't think they actually have
products back out there yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, all it is is the brand gets
caught.
[SPEAKER_06]: They find another licensee.
[SPEAKER_06]: They make a licensing agreement for the
name.
[SPEAKER_06]: And next thing you know, that brand is
back online.
[SPEAKER_06]: With a new license.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, and again, I love the guy,
very nice guy, family guy.
[SPEAKER_06]: But, you know, when when people are doing
things like this and he's not the worst,
[SPEAKER_06]: you know, the other retailers selling,
you know, literally they confiscated 100
[SPEAKER_06]: pounds from his facility.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I know of another incident where the
idiot manager started running down the
[SPEAKER_06]: back alley with like 20 pounds and the BCC
agents tackled him.
[SPEAKER_06]: OK, I mean, and they're still operating.
[SPEAKER_06]: It makes no sense.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm over here worried about taxes and
this and that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'm getting, you know, if I'm late,
I'll get a threat letter that I'm going to
[SPEAKER_06]: lose my license.
[SPEAKER_06]: But then the person who completely does
something illegal and gets caught red
[SPEAKER_06]: handed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it just a lot of things just don't make
sense to me, you know, and and if you're
[SPEAKER_06]: not going to enforce in areas where you
have complete control to enviors,
[SPEAKER_06]: let alone the ones that you don't.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, again, you know, you're setting us
up for failure and you're rewarding the
[SPEAKER_06]: people that are doing illegal stuff to
continue doing illegal stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Back to the question at hand about high
times.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't know if anyone else is as bored as
I am, but I actually pulled up the SEC
[SPEAKER_01]: filing to look at what assets were
included in that purchase.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got to kind of unwind it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pre-Harvest, before Harvest entered the
California picture, it was Have a Heart
[SPEAKER_01]: out of Seattle that was, you know,
getting some of the retail permits in not
[SPEAKER_01]: so coveted jurisdictions, let's say.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Harvest purchased Have a Heart
dispensaries and then they were also in
[SPEAKER_01]: the process of getting some of their own
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I unpack just what it is that High
Times allegedly purchased.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm saying allegedly because you still
need a stock to go public and all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: different jurisdictions to sign off on
this before this deal could ever go
[SPEAKER_01]: through.
[SPEAKER_01]: So minimum, I would say you're looking at
a year before, you know, any dots would
[SPEAKER_01]: be, T's would be crossed and I's would be
dotted before this would be completed.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we've got a Harvest in Palm Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you're familiar with Palm Springs
market, Palm Springs is one of two
[SPEAKER_01]: jurisdictions in the entire state that
have an open process for retail,
[SPEAKER_01]: the other being Lompoc.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're interested in getting a
retail permit, those are the two
[SPEAKER_01]: jurisdictions that if you can find
property that qualify, you can get,
[SPEAKER_01]: you pretty much can get a retail permit
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a very overcrowded market in
Palm Springs.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's one of them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got another one in Harvest of Venice,
which if my memory serves me correctly,
[SPEAKER_01]: I believe Venice is only a medical market,
which is a really tough way to compete
[SPEAKER_01]: these days.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got Harvest of Merced.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got Harvest of Riverside.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't think that one is open yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got Harvest of Hanford,
which isn't open yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: You've got Harvest of Leith, which is
definitely not open yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you've got two very expensive
dispensary permits in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got another one in San Bernardino,
which I don't believe is open.
[SPEAKER_01]: And two in Oakland, one in Coalinga,
and the final one being in Santa Cruz.
[SPEAKER_01]: And Santa Cruz only allows you to sell off
20% of the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what they sold was their 20% stake in,
or no, actually, I think it's only 10%.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you've got a lot of less desirable
areas to operate.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that the Coalinga store is,
if it's still open, is doing about $1,000
[SPEAKER_01]: a day.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are the types of assets I want
everyone to be aware of that Harvest
[SPEAKER_01]: potentially unloaded onto high times.
[SPEAKER_01]: High times still has to go public and
still has to take possession of these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And in the midst of a pandemic,
when everybody is shifting from retail to
[SPEAKER_01]: curbside or delivery, those business
models absolutely do not make sense in
[SPEAKER_01]: either Oakland or San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe they could make sense if you're
going to turn all of those assets into
[SPEAKER_01]: trying to become a statewide delivery
brand is the only thing that I could think
[SPEAKER_01]: that they would attempt to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that would all depend on how expensive
those San Francisco and Oakland properties
[SPEAKER_01]: really are and how much those are bleeding
them dry until they actually are up and
[SPEAKER_01]: running and up and running in a
post-pandemic world.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where we're not wearing masks and we're
congregating again.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so this, to me, should be viewed as a
Hail Mary by both Harvest who's looking to
[SPEAKER_01]: unload their less desirable assets and a
Hail Mary by high times, hoping that this
[SPEAKER_01]: will help them go public.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's all this is and nothing more.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just quickly, a show of hands,
the panelists, who here is getting in on
[SPEAKER_04]: the high times?
[SPEAKER_04]: Reg A Offering.
[SPEAKER_04]: Getting in while the going's hot.
[SPEAKER_04]: They keep sending me emails.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I get them every day.
[SPEAKER_03]: But something funny about high times and
that whole situation, first of all,
[SPEAKER_03]: it just whole thing screams Hard Rock Cafe
to me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this idea of just these super light
commercial, just wonky looking places that
[SPEAKER_03]: have like Cheech's pipe in a glass display
or something.
[SPEAKER_03]: But funny high time story.
[SPEAKER_03]: So Flo Khanna, we launched this Dirty
Money campaign on a Monday and we did an
[SPEAKER_03]: Instagram post that was basically
encouraging people to contact the
[SPEAKER_03]: representative and we don't want to have
to handle cash.
[SPEAKER_03]: When we posted it, some dude from high
times who works there commented and was
[SPEAKER_03]: like, all his comment says was,
you're lobbying wrong or that's not how
[SPEAKER_03]: you do it or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we responded and we were like,
what do you mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: We think this is an issue people would
care about, especially since you just
[SPEAKER_03]: purchased 13 dispensaries and this is a
about not having to handle cash in a
[SPEAKER_03]: dispensary.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they responded that of course they
care and that they invented grassroots
[SPEAKER_03]: lobbying.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in case folks didn't know that out
there, high times invented grassroots
[SPEAKER_03]: lobbying, which actually isn't even a
thing, but they invented it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so, you know, they obviously really
know what they're doing and they've got a
[SPEAKER_03]: great team.
[SPEAKER_03]: I did just read that Stormy Simon is no
longer the CEO.
[SPEAKER_03]: She has stepped down.
[SPEAKER_03]: She lasted four months.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had conversations with Stormy where I
told her to get out.
[SPEAKER_04]: I said, you know where it started was when
I got the emails and you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: the one from today is coming, you know,
who sent it high times investor who sent
[SPEAKER_04]: it Adam Levin.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there was one that had Stormy's
name on it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I immediately emailed her and said,
don't let them put your name.
[SPEAKER_04]: I was like, and then I was like,
don't you do not a couple of years from
[SPEAKER_04]: now want to be associated with duping
little old ladies who invested in high
[SPEAKER_04]: times.
[SPEAKER_04]: You do not want your name associated with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then we had a long phone call and I've
been trading emails.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm going to try to get her on to do a
webcast.
[SPEAKER_04]: But just to be clear for anybody who's
watching, because I'm going to cut this
[SPEAKER_04]: out as the high time segment so people
don't have to wait till the end.
[SPEAKER_04]: The people who currently run high times
are a bunch of finance douchebags who have
[SPEAKER_04]: nothing to do with the grassroots history
of high times from the sick from the 70s
[SPEAKER_04]: and 80s.
[SPEAKER_04]: And any master, you know, any good grower
does not read high times today.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: So just everybody who's thinking of
investing in high times or who thinks,
[SPEAKER_04]: oh my God, that'd be amazing to go to a
high times dispensary.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we have a couple of brands on here.
[SPEAKER_04]: Amanda is flow kind of going to rush to
supply product to high times retail.
[SPEAKER_04]: Shannon is fiddlers greens.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is that going to be the first phone call
you make when they take over those retail
[SPEAKER_04]: operations?
[SPEAKER_05]: And shame on you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, see, I blame high times in a lot of
ways for bringing this weird idea of what
[SPEAKER_03]: quality is to the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's really been hard for sun grown
because when I was growing up in Chicago
[SPEAKER_03]: and looking at high times magazine,
they had the centerfolds of buds that are
[SPEAKER_03]: supposed to be like the highest quality
buds.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like these were the buds and they were all
indoor and they were all grown like this
[SPEAKER_03]: far from the light.
[SPEAKER_03]: And none of them really look, I always
would compare it to like the playboy
[SPEAKER_03]: centerfold where like you grow up thinking
that that's what like the ideal woman
[SPEAKER_03]: looks like.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you get out in the world and you
realize that was all bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of feel like that's what high times
did.
[SPEAKER_03]: They set it up for people, consumers to
think that quality meant orange hairs and
[SPEAKER_03]: tight nugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's not true.
[SPEAKER_05]: So they're like the porn hub of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: No, no, no.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kevin, I have a video clip of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'll play in the, in the on demand
version.
[SPEAKER_04]: Kevin Jodry said it best, which was the
article on the left side of the page,
[SPEAKER_04]: which is that hydro bud, its sole purpose
was to sell the product on the right side
[SPEAKER_04]: of the page, which was a, a, a,
an HPS light or whatever it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: What you have is you have information
that's used as basically marketing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's kind of like reading old high times
because I haven't read the shit in years.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like reading high times and every
article was basically to sell the material
[SPEAKER_00]: on the next page.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're not giving you any information.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're giving you a marketing pitch
wrapped around some photos.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_03]: And, and, and, but unfortunately the
impact that it had on the consumer
[SPEAKER_03]: marketplace was that all these years
later, indoors being sold for $65 an
[SPEAKER_03]: eighth and sungrown is lucky to get 40.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I do think that high times played a
huge role in that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, I don't think they'll ever take
responsibility for it, but I think they
[SPEAKER_03]: played a huge role in really leading the
consumer astray when it comes to knowing
[SPEAKER_03]: what a quality cannabis product is.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's a double edged sword.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because for, you know, I grew up in Texas
and a lot of my first exposure to cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: was, you know, high times magazines that
we were able to look out and see.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it brought it to people who weren't in
Northern California, weren't part of the
[SPEAKER_02]: community.
[SPEAKER_02]: But like Amanda said, it was also
misbranding and misrepresenting.
[SPEAKER_02]: It was, you know, selling McDonald's
hamburgers.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it was filet mignon.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so we've got to undo that at this
point.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that analogy, Shannon.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will not be rushing to do business with
high times retail shops.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's not really in line with our brands
and our mission.
[SPEAKER_04]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Have, have, have we beaten high times
sufficiently?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
