[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so we have some audience chatter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Dean Link, he says, my fear with many
multi-state operators is that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: invested so much into expensive means of
production with a commodity expected to
[SPEAKER_00]: fall in price and an eventual interstate
trade brand equity on the consumer level
[SPEAKER_00]: feels like a far safer bet.
[SPEAKER_01]: First of all, Dean, thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate your sentiment there because
look, from the commodity side,
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, when you talk about cultivation as
a commodity and you talk about what's
[SPEAKER_01]: going to happen with price compression and
commodification, certainly investing or
[SPEAKER_01]: over-investing right now in your
infrastructure is probably a dicey way to
[SPEAKER_01]: look at it, especially when people right
now aren't incrementally building as
[SPEAKER_01]: supply matches demand.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're not just sort of working the
equilibrium curve up.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're thinking about it from the
standpoint of a lot of these newer markets
[SPEAKER_01]: and Canada is a prime example,
they're all trying to race past to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: biggest operator.
[SPEAKER_01]: California is a prime example where call
it a year from now, even though there's a
[SPEAKER_01]: dearth of available product in the
marketplace, there's about to be such an
[SPEAKER_01]: oversupply.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when that happens, does price
compression happen and all of a sudden
[SPEAKER_01]: you're going to look at this investment
you made into expensive means of
[SPEAKER_01]: production and kick yourself for it?
[SPEAKER_01]: That's inevitable.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the guys that are really thinking
about this in a meaningful and smart way
[SPEAKER_01]: are saying, okay, let's only build what we
know we can sell through.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then let's take a look at it and say,
okay, do we have a customer base,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether it's distribution, companies that
want more product or directly store
[SPEAKER_01]: accounts that want more product.
[SPEAKER_01]: And can we build our infrastructure so
that we're not the expensive guys?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we actually build it so we're
producing at a really low cost per gram?
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you are, then you're probably
thinking about this the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the second part of his question was
with relation to... I think it's mostly
[SPEAKER_00]: just the fallen commodity prices basically
creating brand and brand equity is the
[SPEAKER_00]: safer play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then it's like, are you a real estate
doing a real estate play?
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you doing a brand play?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because I know I talked to the chairman of
a very large well known brand who is
[SPEAKER_00]: basically talking about, we're just trying
as hard as we can to build our brand and
[SPEAKER_00]: not get distracted in other parts of the
market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they're creating the CBD only
line of their products so that they can be
[SPEAKER_00]: national.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they can be in California with the THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: They can slowly go into other markets
market by market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But with CBD with their brand name,
they can be basically a global brand like
[SPEAKER_00]: a Nabisco, a Kraft, a Coca-Cola,
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's certainly a lot of people that
are trying to do the dual use with that
[SPEAKER_01]: because they think they can get into the
Whole Foods is in the GNC's and the other
[SPEAKER_01]: shops with their CBD brands that their
brands recognizable.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when people walk into a
dispenser, they recognize the same thing
[SPEAKER_01]: for their flower brand or their consumer
branded product side.
[SPEAKER_01]: So without a doubt, I think long term that
brand equity is really going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: important.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think everyone right now is identifying
that as kind of the next frontier of how
[SPEAKER_01]: do I make sure I've got longevity in this
space and it's not going to be from
[SPEAKER_01]: something that just has downward pressure
on it the whole time because of an
[SPEAKER_01]: oversupply.
[SPEAKER_01]: But having said that, I'm a firm believer
that there's going to be boutique Kraft
[SPEAKER_01]: canvas suppliers that will always hold
price the same way there is fine wine,
[SPEAKER_01]: fine coffee, fine cigars.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going to have the discount brands
that largely will be our discount
[SPEAKER_01]: producers that will largely be for
extraction.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you'll have some really high end
producers that will hold price and they'll
[SPEAKER_01]: be brands themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Regardless of whether or not the flower
market goes from call 40% of the market
[SPEAKER_01]: today down to ultimately like 15 to 18% of
the market at maturity, that's still a
[SPEAKER_01]: large portion of what's going to be a 70
or $80 billion a year industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you think that 15 billion a year is
still represented by flower, not
[SPEAKER_01]: everyone's going to get crushed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the commodity that we're talking about
is still the backbone, the power of the
[SPEAKER_01]: rest of the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's not only about brand equity,
it's also about cost of production,
[SPEAKER_01]: quality of production.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, I think we touched on this
last time we spoke as well, is what
[SPEAKER_01]: happens when federal legalization happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then when you talk about the
overbuilding of infrastructure that's
[SPEAKER_01]: going on in all these other places,
in my mind, every state that doesn't have
[SPEAKER_01]: a great climate for growing is
oversupplying or overpaying for their
[SPEAKER_01]: infrastructure because ultimately I think
it's unnecessary.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'll never five years from now buy
cannabis that's grown in Illinois.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll never buy cannabis that's grown in
Minnesota.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, the place that's going to
power the cannabis market for the United
[SPEAKER_01]: States from a flower perspective,
even for like inputs going into every
[SPEAKER_01]: other brand, is going to be the lowest
cost, highest quality production.
[SPEAKER_01]: Largely that's going to be California,
maybe a little bit of Oregon, a little bit
[SPEAKER_01]: of Washington, some Arizona.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for the most part, it's going to be
stable climates with tons of sunlight,
[SPEAKER_01]: with great, without much humidity,
which rules out the majority of the East
[SPEAKER_01]: Coast.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's really going to be what's the best
place to farm, and that's here.
Thank you.
