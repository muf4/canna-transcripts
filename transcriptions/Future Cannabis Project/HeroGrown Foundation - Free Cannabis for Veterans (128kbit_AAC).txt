[SPEAKER_00]: Well, Hero Grown Foundation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: How'd you start it?
[SPEAKER_00]: When did it start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Give me the 411.
[SPEAKER_01]: I actually started giving free cannabis to
veterans in 2010 when I lived in Lake
[SPEAKER_01]: Tahoe after cannabis saved my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then Hero Grown was born early 2014.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a charity that gathers cannabis
and gathers and goodwill for veterans and
[SPEAKER_00]: first responders.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the... Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we have cultivators that donate
product to us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We have CBD manufacturers who donate
product to us also.
[SPEAKER_00]: So growers literally gift you cannabis
product, whether it's flour or oil or
[SPEAKER_00]: anything that's going to have a
therapeutic value for a veteran.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And sometimes it even comes through
dispensaries, you know, where they do in
[SPEAKER_01]: most states, they can do that for a penny,
you know, and transfer it just because to
[SPEAKER_01]: satisfy the tax man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your personal experiences as a veteran
and with issues that were caused by your
[SPEAKER_00]: work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: So is that what caused you to get into it?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, really what the genesis for Hero Grown
was in 2013, I was training my German
[SPEAKER_01]: Shepherd, who was a young pup at the time,
and I rented all these young vets who were
[SPEAKER_01]: telling me they were taking 20 or 25
different prescription meds a day and that
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis was the only thing that ever
helped them with PTSD, pain, depression,
[SPEAKER_01]: anxiety.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if they wanted to buy their kid a new
backpack to start school next week,
[SPEAKER_01]: they couldn't afford to buy the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So one morning, shortly after that,
I woke up and just decided that's just
[SPEAKER_01]: outrageous.
[SPEAKER_01]: The only reason they're taking these pills
to kill over 50 vets a day now is because
[SPEAKER_01]: they were free.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much how big of a problem is opiate
addiction with with vets?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's horrendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it's a you know, it's a it's it's
getting a little bit better in terms of
[SPEAKER_01]: the prescribing of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, you know, it's just pretty much just
always a standard answer, not just not
[SPEAKER_01]: just opiates, but a wide variety of
pharmaceuticals.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's widely understood now that
cannabis therapies are a way to an
[SPEAKER_00]: alternative way to get off of opiates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I really believe that's the
case.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when I talk to providers at the
VA now, you know, the providers at that
[SPEAKER_01]: level are much more receptive to to having
their patients use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the the bureaucrats are the ones
that are that are holding it up because
[SPEAKER_01]: the politicians, of course, you know,
pull the strings there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that's what we really have
to get to.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the driving force behind this
simply is money.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, big pharma gives millions of
billions of dollars to, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: to politicians.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then that kind of trickles downhill
when they're pointing someone to be the
[SPEAKER_01]: head of the VA hospital or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the bureaucrats are still pretty
stubborn when it comes to cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Hero Growing Foundation operates in how
many states?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we operate nationally now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We, you know, only give away free cannabis
in states where it's legal to do that,
[SPEAKER_01]: obviously.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we ship free CBD products to veterans
and first responders in all 50 states now,
[SPEAKER_01]: about 40,000 40 to 60 thousand dollars a
month in CBD products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we've given away over four million
dollars in in actual cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_01]: In the last five years.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So each state has different regulations
about cannabis and cannabis products.
[SPEAKER_00]: So how do you function?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you function in Maryland or how
would you function in New Jersey?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, in back east, primarily the way we
function are through veterans who are
[SPEAKER_01]: members of our organization.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's kind of like an underground
railroad deal, if you will.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and they take care of other
veterans.
[SPEAKER_01]: They take, you know, we facilitate with
our contacts, the donations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, it's not always a, you know,
a licensed cultivator.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sometimes it's a private grower or
whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: We test everything before we give it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: But in a lot of those eastern states
still, you know, we don't do public
[SPEAKER_01]: giveaway events.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we have veterans helping other
veterans.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's two ends of the pipeline.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've got logistics at the one end where
you have producers that are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: different products into your hands to be
distributed to veterans in a particular
[SPEAKER_00]: location.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the other end of the funnel is
your network.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of veterans that are connected to the
neighborhood that they're in, the locality
[SPEAKER_00]: that they reside in.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're bringing the relief to the
relief that you find.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can also make cash donations,
I'm sure, at a website.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just a hero grown dot org orgy.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can make donations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, that that helps a great
deal, especially with with hero grown air
[SPEAKER_01]: drop, which is our national program where
we ship, as I said, free CBD products to
[SPEAKER_01]: vets and first responders in all 50
states.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's very expensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you bring up first responders in New
York around the 9-11 attacks.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first responder trauma was such a
elevated thing that people had an
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of.
[SPEAKER_00]: You changed the name of the foundation
from grow for vets to hero grown to
[SPEAKER_00]: include first responders.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you talk about that and what the
impact's been?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, in addition to being an
army veteran, I also had a background in
[SPEAKER_01]: law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it wasn't the the shootings that we
had in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: October of 2017 wasn't really the driving
force.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd already decided that we'd include
include first responders.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that certainly accelerated,
you know, the process.
[SPEAKER_01]: And consequently, on January 1st,
2018, we transitioned or evolved from grow
[SPEAKER_01]: for vets USA to hero grown and started
helping first responders.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'd helped a lot of first responders
prior to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we really didn't make a big deal out
of it or publicize the fact that we were
[SPEAKER_01]: doing that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but I've been helping first
responders in Lake Tahoe since 2010.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I lived there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, in a lot of a lot of
jurisdictions now, for example,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, one of the people that we
persons that we help in Lake Tahoe is an
[SPEAKER_01]: EMT.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, his chief is fine with him
using cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, but if he does use his cannabis
like the night before, he tells his chief
[SPEAKER_01]: or his captain, I mean, and then he just
doesn't drive the, you know, the rig that
[SPEAKER_01]: day.
[SPEAKER_01]: But other than that, I mean, they
understand these guys get a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: injuries, a lot of physical injuries.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, like you mentioned,
you know, in New York or shootings here in
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegas, you know, I mean, it's just the
trauma those guys went through is
[SPEAKER_01]: horrendous.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's not just the first responders.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, the people that were, you know,
affected thousands of civilians,
[SPEAKER_01]: post-traumatic stress.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only 30 percent of the people in the
United States who have post-traumatic
[SPEAKER_01]: stress are veterans.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, you can have PTSD,
you know, if you've been involved in any
[SPEAKER_01]: traumatic situation in your life.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate what you do.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appreciate you sitting down and talking to
us today and support Hero Grown Foundation
[SPEAKER_00]: at herogrown.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I really appreciate Boveda as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Boveda was our first long term
or longest sponsor, you know, going back,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, pretty much to the beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we couldn't do what we do
without your help.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I appreciate you certainly and the
whole Boveda team.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we appreciate you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thanks, Roger.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is this is a this is a
conversation about where you get into the
[SPEAKER_00]: gray area and all the legalities and all
of the logistics of picking up product.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you told me a story about being in
Colorado and being able to drive up to a
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensary and have them give you a
significant amount of product.
[SPEAKER_00]: Certainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: So are you are you at risk?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, how should a politician feel if
they're watching this clip about Hero
[SPEAKER_00]: Grown and trying to understand all the
good that you're doing for veterans?
[SPEAKER_00]: And what are some of the hassles that you
run into or some of the liability that you
[SPEAKER_00]: could face because of these restrictions
in different territories?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we've been very fortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've never had any incident with law
enforcement, you know, knock on wood.
[SPEAKER_00]: It helps that your former law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I don't I don't know that that's I
think it helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, in Colorado, where we were
well established, where law enforcement
[SPEAKER_01]: knew what we were doing, they knew who we
were.
[SPEAKER_01]: They knew we weren't taking, you know,
product in Nebraska, where I grew up,
[SPEAKER_01]: or Kansas or something like that doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're not trafficking cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I think that, you know,
in the in Colorado, the process or it's
[SPEAKER_01]: been legal for so long now that for five
years that, you know, they're pretty much,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, it's just more open,
for example, than it is in Nevada,
[SPEAKER_01]: where I live now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, in Nevada, you know,
all of the owners the licensees are very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very concerned about losing their license
if they, you know, fall out of compliance
[SPEAKER_01]: with the rules.
[SPEAKER_01]: Exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and some of the rules here are
really idiotic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like most states, the rules were made by
people who knew nothing about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, for example, we get a lot of
donations from California, people that
[SPEAKER_01]: live in California.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't ask them how it came how the
cannabis they donate got to Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I'm sure that it didn't just appear in
Nevada.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, I mean, there are some times
where, you know, we really do our best and
[SPEAKER_01]: I do my best not to do anything illegal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there are times, for example,
we're having giveaway events where
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly I'm in possession of more than
what the legal limit is because I'm taking
[SPEAKER_01]: it to distribute to tens or hundreds of
veterans.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I typically do that myself because
I don't want to put someone else at risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we've never had an incident
with law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, they know what we're doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, with it, you know, I think here
even by now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So let me go a different direction with
this.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a dear friend explain to me that he
felt sincerely that California had sold
[SPEAKER_00]: its soul in the cannabis business because
his whole premise was used to be patient
[SPEAKER_00]: focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything was about serving the patient.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's similar because what you're doing
with veterans and first responders is
[SPEAKER_00]: about, you know, medicine for what ails
you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the comment was made that California
had sold its soul from a regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: perspective and from a commercial
perspective, because the patient was no
[SPEAKER_00]: longer the center of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and I think that's happened in every
state.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, certainly in states where they
had medical first and then they
[SPEAKER_01]: transitioned into what they call
recreational cannabis, which is one of the
[SPEAKER_01]: stupidest terms, too, that has ever
developed recreational alcohol.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sounds like it's going to be an Olympic
sport at some point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Colorado, we talk about when we talk
about the regulators, we call it green
[SPEAKER_01]: crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're all about the green crack.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all they care about.
[SPEAKER_01]: The money it generates creates more jobs
for their infrastructure that's forever
[SPEAKER_01]: growing, where they can hire more people
to supposedly do enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, Colorado is a pretty good
example of how silly it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Marijuana Enforcement Division there,
you know, their business cards indicate
[SPEAKER_01]: that they are that they're investigators.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, they carry guns, a whole nine
yards.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go in there and tell them,
you know, about some illegal activity
[SPEAKER_01]: that's going on, they refer that to local
law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't do investigations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it's pretty stupid the way the
whole system set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole soul selling subject,
the reason why I bring it up is because
[SPEAKER_00]: there's redemption in life.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think everybody would agree
there's there's two sides to everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we have collectively sold our soul,
and taken our focus off what's good for
[SPEAKER_00]: the patient, there's also an opportunity
to perhaps buy our souls back.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you think about and I think this
is germane to what you're doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: because if patients that were terminally
ill had access to cannabis at no charge,
[SPEAKER_00]: that would really go a long way to buy our
souls back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the same thing applies to veterans.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, or really anyone that can't get
exactly what they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and Nevada is a really good
example, too, of what can go back,
[SPEAKER_01]: go really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when Nevada first went
recreationally legal, it really the way
[SPEAKER_01]: they set the system up, it really shut out
a lot of patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there were patients who couldn't
get medicine, OK, that had been getting
[SPEAKER_01]: medicine for quite some time, you know,
prior to the recreational, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: going legal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I mean, they don't think about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the regulators don't think
again, they know nothing about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The regulators defense, they have the best
intention.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they're not out there trying to
ruin somebody's process.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to make rules about
something that they may not, as you had
[SPEAKER_00]: alluded to, they may not personally
understand it at a level.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, if we had growers that were
figuring out how to create regulations for
[SPEAKER_00]: growers, I think we'd have a lot better
regulations because it's common sense.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, and by and large, what you say
is true.
[SPEAKER_01]: But on the other hand, I have to tell you
that, you know, I'm pretty well convinced
[SPEAKER_01]: there are some states where, you know,
the enforcement people sit around,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, around table every morning
trying to figure out what they can do to,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, to hassle the people that are in
the industry, you know, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_01]: idiotic because, you know, it's almost
like they're trying to you don't
[SPEAKER_01]: understand that if they shut it down,
they're going to lose their they're going
[SPEAKER_01]: to eliminate their own jobs.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you have access or has this been
considered to for seized or forfeited
[SPEAKER_00]: property?
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you get your hands on cannabis?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's been seized by law enforcement and
redistribute it to, you know, that's
[SPEAKER_01]: something that we're getting ready to try
to do before that.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, in Nevada, a lot of tourists
would buy cannabis and then they have to
[SPEAKER_01]: throw it away or give it away or whatever.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times the rental car companies a
couple of years ago when it first went
[SPEAKER_01]: legal, we're talking about they had all
this stuff left in rental vehicles.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so I tried to get a way to
people didn't want to take it home with
[SPEAKER_01]: them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they didn't understand TSA is not
a drug enforcement agency.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, I carry cannabis, my cannabis
medicine in my carry on every time I fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've had it in my carry on and I open it
up and TSA has gone through it and they've
[SPEAKER_01]: never touched my my cannabis at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm sure if you had, you know,
five pounds or something in your suitcase,
[SPEAKER_01]: they'd call the police or something.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that's not their job.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're looking for for explosives.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's all.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the repurposing of instead of
destroying it, there's there's got to be a
[SPEAKER_00]: value or an opportunity for us to take
that cannabis that's for whatever reason
[SPEAKER_00]: been seized and to put it back to good use
for the relief of pain and trauma for
[SPEAKER_00]: veterans and first responders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, and and that's absolutely true,
you know, and that's something that
[SPEAKER_01]: really, you know, we probably need to work
hard on getting done.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's that's one reason that's the
main thing that holds it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's too logical, Drew.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the future for herogrown.org,
what's the future?
[SPEAKER_00]: What are your plans?
[SPEAKER_00]: Where are you going?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, you know, again, we're we're growing
membership, you know, very, very rapidly,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so our hope is just to continue what
we're doing, but to touch more lives.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, the last thing I think about
every night before I fall asleep is,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, 50 more veterans and first
responders died today.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, you know, what could I have done to,
you know, do a better job to save some of
[SPEAKER_01]: them?
[SPEAKER_01]: So, you know, that that's the mission
we're on now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, really, our our goal is to to
have veterans and pretty much everybody to
[SPEAKER_01]: have safe access to free cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: The same way they have safe access to the
drugs that are killing, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: so many people, you know, there's over 130
people a day now just to opiate overdose.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, I mean, it's just it's a horrendous
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, people made people and companies
made billions of dollars, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: literally slaughtering Americans.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, we'll lose more veterans just
this year than we lost.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've lost in combat in every war combined
or every conflict combined since the end
[SPEAKER_01]: of the Vietnam War.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a great cause, a great organization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really appreciate what you do,
how you do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can join, become a supporter,
become a part of this conversation by
[SPEAKER_00]: going to herogrown.org.
[SPEAKER_01]: And membership's free, by the way,
for veterans and first responders.
[SPEAKER_01]: They can sign up online.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get involved and be at stake in the
supporting our vets and first responders.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thanks, Drew.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, we couldn't do what we do
without you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So really appreciate you and Roger.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep it up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Keep up the good work.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
