[SPEAKER_01]: You guys visit a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like a hummingbird around all these
farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: So do you notice kind of differences in
what you know is the same genetics
[SPEAKER_01]: growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Can you talk about some examples?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like this farm up in Humboldt at 2,000
feet versus... Well, I don't know how much
[SPEAKER_00]: it has to do with like microclimates and
terroir and all that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, all right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then let's start with like two farmers
you know who are growing the same scum
[SPEAKER_01]: tech clone in different climates.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, have you noticed where you know it's
the same seed or clone?
[SPEAKER_00]: There will definitely be differences where
it comes to sun exposure.
[SPEAKER_00]: It comes to like the nutritional profile
of that different farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you're going to see some
differences, but depending on the
[SPEAKER_00]: stability of the genetics that you're
working with, you should always be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: tell that it's somewhat within the same
scope.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you have a farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not currently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or like a homegrown?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have always had a home.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on your home or on your property,
do you know like what stuff that you know
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't grow well there?
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm in Humboldt on anything that's
going to be overly leafy.
[SPEAKER_00]: The OGs do really well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that don't create large colas.
[SPEAKER_00]: We like in my area because we're just so
coastal.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're dealing with like coastal and
elevation?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I'm sea level coastal.
[SPEAKER_01]: So coastal again.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean at best I'm a thousand feet.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what about down in like the San
Diego area?
[SPEAKER_03]: Up there we're 3,200.
[SPEAKER_03]: So and we're area.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, actually I didn't ask you what
does grow well, but what grows well and
[SPEAKER_01]: doesn't grow well?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because that's drier, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or is it coastal?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know our, where we are,
for our farm we grow in greenhouses
[SPEAKER_03]: because you know we get some pretty good
wind.
[SPEAKER_03]: We put some outdoors out there and it
doesn't matter what genetics that they
[SPEAKER_03]: were.
[SPEAKER_03]: They all understood it was windy.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they all just were small, squatty.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it almost took on same traits.
[SPEAKER_01]: And was the wind coming in like September,
October or when?
[SPEAKER_01]: No, all year.
[SPEAKER_03]: All year.
[SPEAKER_03]: All year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like if you look at some of our,
cause we, we, we farmed 10 acres of hemp
[SPEAKER_03]: and everything was this way.
[SPEAKER_03]: No matter what.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, that's where we are.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's our, that's our climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of our stuff's in the greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're able to control.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it wouldn't, but as traits go,
they all took on the same environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: traits to stay alive.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, staying really, really strong.
[SPEAKER_03]: They definitely took out those traits.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's high desert 3,200.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's completely opposite.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've wanted, I still need to come check
out your place, but there's also this guy
[SPEAKER_01]: like an Anza who I've always wanted to go
visit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I used to grow up in Sapango,
which was like at elevation right off the
[SPEAKER_01]: coast, just intense sunlight.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it was interesting growing like the
ruggedness of plants there versus like
[SPEAKER_01]: where I am in LA, like a nice gentle like
Santa Monica breeze, like perfect
[SPEAKER_01]: temperature.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think the cannabis kind of mimics its
growth in its, in its high as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you've got that Santa Monica
weed and you're going to kind of have a
[SPEAKER_00]: nice mellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Drawing your words out a little bit more
feel the need to go to the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do you think of the Durban?
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a, it's a morning weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that you, you know,
you check emails too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It makes you go shit and get stuff done.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are, what are cultivators telling
you for this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what are they psyched about?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are they, what are they growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then what are they stressed about this
year?
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems we have a little bit more
excitement in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like those who are still here in
Humboldt County with, and, and on the,
[SPEAKER_00]: on the traditional market in general,
or they're here to stay.
[SPEAKER_00]: They've weathered the storm, the price of
weed that seems to be stabilizing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Traditional market.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, people are building brands with
like packaging on the traditional market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I feel like those people are like,
like for me, I've always kind of been
[SPEAKER_01]: like, I would rather operate outside the
regulated market and jump back in when
[SPEAKER_01]: it's sensible versus like when you're
being a business with a weight vest.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like a lot of folks feel that way
right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, most of us came from the
traditional market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, we empathize with those who are in
it, but then we, we have folks that took
[SPEAKER_00]: the leap as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we want to root for them in the same
regard.
[SPEAKER_00]: So something needs to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: The white market needs to change.
[SPEAKER_00]: It needs to be something that people can
exist on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't, I'm not going to sit there
and preach more regulation on the
[SPEAKER_00]: traditional market, but it sure is easy to
exist in that realm.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you in terms of genetics, you're
seeing people talking about for this year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I'm seeing people move towards like
sours, hazes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It seems like we're getting a little bit
more of a resurgence on sativa.
[SPEAKER_00]: Traditionally, it's been a difficult one
to bring to market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes forever to grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very niche in a way.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are, I, I often compare the
cannabis industry to 18 year olds learning
[SPEAKER_00]: to drink.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know what they want.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't know if they want vodka or they
don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: You would, whether I was like 13,
17 or today, you would have never caught
[SPEAKER_01]: me with like a wine cooler or like a Zima.
[SPEAKER_00]: Still, when I was 18, I was like,
I had more taste.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: White Claw.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and that's why brands like,
like seven 10 get recognition because
[SPEAKER_00]: there are people out there that are
scrupulous about what they enable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Seven 10 has always been interesting to me
because they've always been there and like
[SPEAKER_01]: in the market at scale and like with
positive reviews.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now it's the flowers.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, and they're one of the companies that
goes, one of the best ones that goes,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, no, that's, that's the price.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't like it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't care.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and I respect the hell out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: If, if, if everyone in the industry had
the ability to do that and there are
[SPEAKER_00]: reasons all the way around the board why
we can't, well, we wouldn't have prices as
[SPEAKER_00]: low as they are.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it seems like you guys were talking
about, it seems like some bigger players
[SPEAKER_03]: are moving to that direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's some things happening to where
we're looking to see a floor for cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: to be you know, somewhat stabilized at a,
at a minimum price, but it takes the
[SPEAKER_00]: largest distributors in this state to come
to some sort of a realization that they
[SPEAKER_00]: have as much control over what the
industry does.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds like things are moving in the right
direction and we could be seeing like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, a $700 floor on mix like
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: And as soon as we stabilize one of these
different platforms, the rest will fall in
[SPEAKER_00]: line.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the one thing we're lacking from say
the wine industry or fine, fine alcohol is
[SPEAKER_00]: we don't have that regulatory board that
places a value on this product.
[SPEAKER_00]: And with the dog eat dog industry,
it's been a race to the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people are optimistic that like per
pound prices are going to go or at least
[SPEAKER_01]: stabilize.
[SPEAKER_00]: They absolutely will.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here's what's happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: This industry exploded because everyone
thought that it was a safe bet.
[SPEAKER_00]: The price of weed was through the roof.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was low risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Money came from everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we saw these multi-state operations
come up.
[SPEAKER_00]: We saw all this canopy space fly up
through development.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, guess what?
[SPEAKER_00]: As it turns out, it isn't that easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there's not, there's not as much money
being funneled into this industry right
[SPEAKER_00]: now because it's a little bit higher risk
than everyone anticipated.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of, there's a lot of debts
with dropping prices.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those who have weathered this storm are
going to command some respect in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're going to command the price they
deserve.
[SPEAKER_00]: They figured out how to do it on the,
some of the most hostile conditions on the
[SPEAKER_00]: planet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's why for a lot of like the
small farmers, for me, it's just kind of
[SPEAKER_01]: like, if you can survive for another year
and a half, like, and so they can sell
[SPEAKER_01]: like that small Appalachian drip and farm
being able to sell to Minnesota or New
[SPEAKER_01]: York or.
[SPEAKER_00]: I tell you, this industry has made us lean
and mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every single one of the farms out there
that are running have had to reevaluate
[SPEAKER_00]: their costs, what their time's worth,
what's worth paying for and what's doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, what's not worth doing at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Before that, the prices didn't justify
such conservative behavior.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a lot of things that happened in
the industry that weren't beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's going to be an interesting new age
for our farms because they're,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're operating at a higher efficiency
than they've ever dreamed that they could
[SPEAKER_00]: in order to survive.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just going to continue to give
them opportunities for success,
[SPEAKER_00]: moving through the industry as it matures
from state to state.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a two way path too.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're, they're finally figuring out what
overhead is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, that's a new word.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's one.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then two, they're figuring out how
they're going to sell their products.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just the analogy there.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, you have to have a good
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so we're getting, we're, that's where
we're kind of seeing a little bit of signs
[SPEAKER_03]: too.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: They get to see it on the, on that end.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get to see a little bit on this end.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, they're coming to, you know,
for solutions on how to differentiate the
[SPEAKER_03]: product a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's cool to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Great question.
[SPEAKER_01]: When Todd eats a hamburger, who's
hamburger does he eat?
[SPEAKER_01]: Who makes this delicious hamburger?
[SPEAKER_03]: I make really, I make really delicious
hamburgers.
[SPEAKER_03]: I definitely eat my own hamburgers,
but it's funny.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'll be on the road a lot and just go into
the farms.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually go everywhere and everywhere I
go, I like to just try a hamburger,
[SPEAKER_03]: soup and hamburger.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's the gnarliest restaurant.
[SPEAKER_03]: I just own it because it gives you an
idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Standard, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: Quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: It tells me a lot about the local
community.
[SPEAKER_01]: What kind of people they are.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love hamburgers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love hamburgers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, the food last night was awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: The salads were good, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The salads were good last night.
[SPEAKER_03]: Three forks.
[SPEAKER_03]: Pizza was so good.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had these like mushroom things.
[SPEAKER_01]: I went to Reno to visit my cousin and I
like the visual.
[SPEAKER_01]: The visual in my head of what to expect
hanging out in Reno was kind of like
[SPEAKER_01]: Vegas, but dumpier.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it was cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, yeah, Vegas, but dumpier.
[SPEAKER_00]: No offense to anyone that's out in that
area is like Atlantic City.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, but my point is Reno isn't dumpier.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it's nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 10 years ago, 12 years ago,
Reno.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was kind of a scary place at the time,
but yeah, it's not too bad now.
[SPEAKER_01]: But like we ate at this German restaurant
and it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was like, and we had gone,
the first restaurant we wanted to go to is
[SPEAKER_01]: this Japanese restaurant and we walked in
there and it was two packs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like we couldn't get a table, but I was
like, I want to eat here.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so like all the restaurants were
really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was psyched with last night's food.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what, I mean, are you seeing like when
you're talking to people about what they,
[SPEAKER_01]: what they want to grow for the market this
year?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like what genetics?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've been, we've been working
with a lot of breeders as of late with
[SPEAKER_03]: Eric and stuff too.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you know, I like your own cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that for your own cultivation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, down in San Diego, we're kind of in
the gray area, but this year, I think
[SPEAKER_03]: just, just for, just for our head,
we're going to be popping some 808 and,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know, 808 genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: For regular Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: For regular Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, not for hemp.
[SPEAKER_02]: For hemp, you know, I like the hoodoo,
hoodoo, hoodoku seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: He does YouTube stuff.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, I've been watching him for the
last two, three years.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really admiring his work.
[SPEAKER_03]: They actually sent us a sample and we
tried so tasty.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this year I connected with Floyd and
we're going to try some of the CBG,
[SPEAKER_03]: CBB seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm talking to him a little bit more to
see which ones have COAs and which ones
[SPEAKER_03]: don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause I got to pick and choose a little
bit of what's, of what it is, but I'm
[SPEAKER_03]: particularly wanting to try his,
I think it was the first run he had with
[SPEAKER_03]: the CBG, CBB crops.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think it was more the Kush, the Kush,
the Kush breed, the first one,
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't know exactly which one,
but between those two, I think that's what
[SPEAKER_03]: we're going to go for.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what he had recommended too.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the hemp side, like of an entire
crop, what percentage of it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: flower, tincture, gummies, bombs,
like, so we did, we did a pretty good
[SPEAKER_03]: round.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you single source with everything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, yeah, that's an awesome story.
[SPEAKER_01]: So all the tinctures are like,
we grew it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, that's our story.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was making, I want to see videos of you
guys making tinctures.
[SPEAKER_03]: Our website literally just yesterday,
we went through merchants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I want you to be like, like giving
demonstrations.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric's the model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Eric's the model.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's the one that's going to be doing
that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so what, what percentage of your hemp
sales or flowers?
[SPEAKER_03]: So we are, we'd care about like,
we've been all, we've been all over as of
[SPEAKER_03]: this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: The only flower we have is CBG Matterhorn.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we actually put that in pre-roll.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause a lot of the hemp is hot.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't, we don't, CBG had no tincture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you bring any of that here,
the CBB?
[SPEAKER_01]: I did.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you smoke it by itself?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It actually feels really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's people that, you know,
CBG is what Floyd swears by for testimony.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of other, a lot of issues.
[SPEAKER_03]: We get a lot of good feedback on that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The tinctures as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot, a lot of good ideas.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let me see the lighter.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBG, the Matterhorn, we rolled that up as
our flower, but that's why we were,
[SPEAKER_03]: because we didn't really see anything we
really wanted and thought we would enjoy
[SPEAKER_01]: to grow until we, but so on the hemp side
is your mindset mostly whatever I grow,
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm growing for some derivative products,
like a, like a tincture, a bomb,
[SPEAKER_01]: a pill.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're not focused on like the,
the joint smoking.
[SPEAKER_03]: Only in a portion of our operation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So one greenhouse and then a half acre is
for, is for pre-rolls and for flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then the rest goes to, goes to oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's actually a lot of square footage
though to flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: You said an acre plus a half acre CBG goes
to CBG goes differently than, than like a,
[SPEAKER_03]: like a hemp genetics actually more like,
like Matterhorn I guess you would call it
[SPEAKER_03]: seer.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not, it's not as bushy as like a,
as like a, you know, standard cherry wine
[SPEAKER_03]: or T cross or something like that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're very different.
[SPEAKER_03]: So half acres, it's a lot, but people like
the pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you just want to make sure it's fresh.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause whatever, whatever we didn't sell
previously, we turned the oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if I was super high and wanted to
like downshift, could I smoke one of those
[SPEAKER_01]: pre-rolls and do they taste good?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you're in a position where you like
have to smoke something, like say you're
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to stop smoking cigarettes and
you're like, all right, I'm going to,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm just going to smoke joints instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a very viable option because you can,
if you smoke as many joints as some people
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke cigarettes, well, you're not getting
a whole lot done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You might be super hyper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if you're switching one to one,
like my cigarette, I have a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: better chance of remaining productive
joints and you know, not going back to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoking cigarettes, but they're really for
people who don't smoke a lot of weeds,
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD and CBG or you feel it way more like
interactive.
[SPEAKER_01]: He makes me kind of jittery.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, that's why I don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I want to start trying
different stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why we like CBG.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, and then we do have a blend of
smooth and we actually go 80 20.
[SPEAKER_03]: So you get a little bit of the,
because CBD does provide a little bit more
[SPEAKER_03]: relaxation than CBG by itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBG adjoined by itself actually is pretty,
it's pretty active.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty sativa.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, you start to focus, you get rolling
a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would love that if it's like,
if it's like a Ritalin substitute.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then it depends on the person too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've noticed like someone will come to me
and say, yeah, I use this because I got to
[SPEAKER_03]: wind down my THC.
[SPEAKER_03]: This still gets me like, it gets me,
you know, a good relaxation or somebody
[SPEAKER_03]: who needs to get tested or something,
but still wants to smoke something other
[SPEAKER_03]: than cigarettes.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's really the, you get a lot of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, and also taking into consideration
that THC in its potency has been climbing
[SPEAKER_00]: over the years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in that respect, the influence of the
CBD bouquet has always been kind of at
[SPEAKER_00]: lower concentration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our interpretation of what the effects
of those chemicals are, are kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: subjective to the concentrations that
we're being exposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what the effect of these different
flowers that are hemp derived have is
[SPEAKER_00]: subjective and it's going to be
continually changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same as like I, THC is to be in the single
digits.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, and that was a high dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Fourteens was like, yeah, I don't know
about some of these 30% flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, wait, why don't you tell them
that's 30%.
[SPEAKER_00]: Apparently it's out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So on the, uh, like the 808s, are you,
are you growing those commercially or just
[SPEAKER_01]: at home?
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we've preserved a small little
part of our greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just for Eric and I and the group's
little head and you know, six or 12 primes
[SPEAKER_03]: in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what, uh, what lines?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're doing 808.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think we're doing 80 and then cannabis
quarry has some really good ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we actually pick, Eric picks them
up from Hawaii.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like some really cool citrus ones.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think there's like a papaya in there
too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So just like the fun, we're going to pop
those too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to be, it's going to be fun.
[SPEAKER_03]: We just, you know, we like to,
in our area, we can go three rounds so we
[SPEAKER_03]: can, it's fun to just kind of keep popping
and keep rolling.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you like depping twice?
[SPEAKER_03]: Early or mid February.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then on one of the greenhouses,
we kind of turn that into light.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have stuff now that you had
supplemental lighting on and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: killed the supplemental and then
eventually you have to depth it as the,
[SPEAKER_01]: it starts to get longer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So at the very end, you're depping of that
first November.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The first poll by, by, by then.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, then we're open.
[SPEAKER_03]: Then we're all, we're all the way open a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's the calm part of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: But the temperatures are good.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like you don't, you know, it's actually
like Eric was saying our greenhouses work
[SPEAKER_03]: better on the other ends of summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like we get rad, you know, like really
nice early flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause it's like you walk in there without
any fans, without any wet walls.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, I love like if I had a green like
SoCal in general, the fact that I could
[SPEAKER_01]: like my garden all year long is just going
and there's never, it's like seasons bleed
[SPEAKER_01]: into each other.
[SPEAKER_01]: The plants kind of go this way.
[SPEAKER_01]: They got the like, they're all funny.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm like, if I had a greenhouse in
SoCal, that's the idea.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like this year was different.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, we got really early season rain
and all of a sudden it got sunny.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I was like, Whoa, a couple of those
blooms pretty early.
[SPEAKER_03]: I hope I didn't miss the flower pop.
[SPEAKER_03]: So like we're hurrying up and go down to
the desert just in case.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cause usually it would be like,
you know, six weeks from now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I don't know if it's like, it's a early
pop.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then if we get a freeze, then we're
going to get, we're going to lose a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: fruit this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's kind of what's scary too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I bet like all your avocado growers and
like all the, there's a lot of different
[SPEAKER_03]: growers are probably sitting on their,
are a little nervous right now going,
[SPEAKER_03]: dang dude, I hope I don't get a second
freeze or else all my flowers will freeze
[SPEAKER_03]: off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They'll have no fruit this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: So this is, yeah, it's pretty interesting
how nature just decides whether you're
[SPEAKER_03]: going to make a break.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know, it's, I got a lot of rain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh no.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now we're going to get a second freeze.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, hopefully we get some more Southern
influenced wet weather coming our way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Southern influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've, we've been very blessed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So far.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you live in Humboldt or where do you
live?
[SPEAKER_01]: So in Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wasn't, we got a lot of rain, just like
everyone else, but I'm just so close to
[SPEAKER_00]: the coast, nothing floods.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we, we did pretty well, but lots of
water came down.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got full lakes now and hopefully
they keep it as long as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: More rain would be nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely some more snow pack,
but it's interesting.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys say from the, from the South,
cause when we're from the South,
[SPEAKER_03]: it would be from the, it would be from the
North.
[SPEAKER_03]: And by the time that thing spins up,
it's going shooting back up from the
[SPEAKER_03]: South.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's, that's, you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: But for us it's, we were coming like,
Oh, there's the North winds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You guys are, Oh, there's a South winds.
[SPEAKER_03]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's, it's, it's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's Humboldt County is one of those
places that it's like 55 or 60 degrees,
[SPEAKER_00]: 350 days a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: It, it just stays the same temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: Daytime, daytime, nighttime.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it'll be cool off maybe into the
forties at night, but it's in,
[SPEAKER_00]: in the lowlands of Humboldt next to the
coast, it's like 55, 60.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: All the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But again, a 45 minute drive inland and
you're at a hundred degrees in the summer.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can go skiing in the winter and
surfing and surfing in the same day.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want to do the trek.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we wrap this?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I probably should get back to the booth.
