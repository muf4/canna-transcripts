[SPEAKER_00]: We both are involved with the Open
Cannabis Project and that's something that
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm very passionate about.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to do with cannabis and patents and
intellectual property and you're an
[SPEAKER_00]: attorney in that field so I'm sure we have
lots to talk about.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I think we do.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got kind of pulled into cannabis a few
years ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'd been working with plant breeders for a
long time and someone who had started a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis genetics analysis kind of company
wanted me to give him some advice about
[SPEAKER_01]: open cannabis and I thought it sounded
interesting and it's evolved into
[SPEAKER_01]: something that is a daily passion for me.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm excited to talk about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, thank you for your interest and I
think for a lot of us folks that have been
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding cannabis for a long time this is
a hot button issue and I don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: have all the answers but I definitely have
some opinions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, so what do you think are the
problems?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are patents a hot button issue?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, well here's the crux of it in my
opinion that cannabis is unique in that
[SPEAKER_00]: it's been under prohibition for around 100
plus years.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, less than 100 years in some ways but
it's been under prohibition for almost 100
[SPEAKER_00]: years and that has made it so the common
publishing of breeding data that happens
[SPEAKER_00]: in an agricultural community has not
happened at all and so you know if I
[SPEAKER_00]: created a new strain or cultivar 20 years
ago like I did I never in a million years
[SPEAKER_00]: would have you know written that down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean shit like if we kept records we
made a practice of burning them at the end
[SPEAKER_00]: of the season like literally I remember
doing that and you know thank God that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not doing that anymore but you know
that has made there there's now a vacuum
[SPEAKER_00]: of any what's called I guess in the the
patent world like prior art evidence of
[SPEAKER_00]: prior art and you know for folks that
don't know prior art just means like
[SPEAKER_00]: something that people have done and
created already and so it's not new and
[SPEAKER_00]: novel and because there's this vacuum
there is the possibility that folks could
[SPEAKER_00]: come and claim you know that they've
created something that they not didn't
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily create it may have been
something that I had or any breeder might
[SPEAKER_00]: have had in their you know tool chests for
or toolbox for years and so why should
[SPEAKER_00]: someone be able to then go and just snap
that up and then come to me with a cease
[SPEAKER_00]: and desist and say you can no longer grow
that variety that you've been growing
[SPEAKER_00]: forever.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well that's it I think you've exactly
framed the problem I've been doing patent
[SPEAKER_01]: law for about 20 plus years and I've
worked in biotech and medical devices and
[SPEAKER_01]: a lot of different areas and what happens
when someone applies for a patent as you
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of correctly stated is that the
patent examiner looks to what's all ready
[SPEAKER_01]: in the public domain and they look for
published documents such as academic
[SPEAKER_01]: publications patent documents as well as
any kind of commercial record and they use
[SPEAKER_01]: that to identify all right here's a patent
application that claims to have invented
[SPEAKER_01]: XYZ and I want to see what is the closest
thing to it that is already in the public
[SPEAKER_01]: domain and then they use that to figure
out what really is new and what should be
[SPEAKER_01]: allowed to be patentable that's a hard job
yeah but they do a careful analysis when
[SPEAKER_01]: they're doing their job right they do a
careful analysis of kind of drawing lines
[SPEAKER_01]: between what someone claims to have
invented and what is already known to the
[SPEAKER_01]: public so okay we overlay that with the
cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: market or the cannabis industry and we
have a unique problem of an industry that
[SPEAKER_01]: has essentially no recorded history as the
opposite of recorded history a history
[SPEAKER_01]: that was affirmatively destroyed right
there is no academic record there is
[SPEAKER_01]: essentially no patent record any
commercial record was hidden instead of
[SPEAKER_01]: published and burned in my wood stove
exactly exactly and so a patent examiner
[SPEAKER_01]: though has the same duty the same mission
they read a patent claim that says I
[SPEAKER_01]: invented XYZ and then they go do a search
and they look for prior patents and
[SPEAKER_01]: academic publications and some kind of
record of commercial activity and they
[SPEAKER_01]: find almost nothing and then they're
supposed to say they're supposed to
[SPEAKER_01]: determine whether someone who claims to
have invented a certain strain or a
[SPEAKER_01]: certain family of strains with some
properties and they it's their job to
[SPEAKER_01]: assess whether that's in the public domain
or not and they're working with their
[SPEAKER_01]: hands tied behind their back and they're
and with a blindfold on and all they can
[SPEAKER_01]: do is follow the guidelines that they're
given and they issue a patent and then you
[SPEAKER_01]: and I both know that we may not know for
any given patent whether it's valid or not
[SPEAKER_01]: whether they make whether it's wrong that
they found it to be patentable but what we
[SPEAKER_01]: do know is that there's a hell of a lot of
reason to doubt that what they found to be
[SPEAKER_01]: patentable actually is because what we
know is that the public record is a
[SPEAKER_01]: complete vacuum that there are things that
happened that never got recorded and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a living witness of that and so you
see a patent that issues and you say oh
[SPEAKER_01]: hell no I did that myself or I know people
who did that 20 years ago and yet now
[SPEAKER_01]: someone is saying they're the first ones
to do it and so I look at that patent I
[SPEAKER_01]: being you I look at that patent and say I
don't respect it I don't think that it
[SPEAKER_01]: should be enforceable I don't think that
it should throw off a whole industry I
[SPEAKER_01]: don't think that people should change
their commercial activities and out of
[SPEAKER_01]: respect for this patent and if I get a
cease and desist letter I'm gonna gather
[SPEAKER_01]: my friends with their pitchforks and their
torches and we're gonna have an uprising
[SPEAKER_01]: over this and it's understandable and you
can't blame the patent office they're
[SPEAKER_01]: doing their job they don't have the tools
to issue a proper rejection you might
[SPEAKER_01]: blame the applicants if they're applicants
that actually know the industry and
[SPEAKER_01]: they're just taking advantage of the lack
of evidence and they're basically doing
[SPEAKER_01]: some kind of gold rush land grab because
they can because they've got the power and
[SPEAKER_01]: the resources and they're just doing it
out of bad faith then they deserve the mob
[SPEAKER_01]: with the pitchforks and the torches to
come after them but maybe they don't even
[SPEAKER_01]: know so we're in a situation where there
needs to be some kind of other public
[SPEAKER_01]: forum to bring to bring forward the
knowledge that exists in the in the
[SPEAKER_01]: memories and the heads and perhaps some
hidden records of people like you so okay
[SPEAKER_01]: enough for me what do you have to say
about all that enter the open cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: project you know and I mean for most of my
adult life I've worked in the nonprofit
[SPEAKER_00]: sector as a fisheries biologist and you
know did river restoration projects and so
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like if there's like a framework or
a structure for for an organization to
[SPEAKER_00]: tackle this issue that the nonprofit
framework is kind of the best because you
[SPEAKER_00]: know you've got somebody who is
essentially hopefully isn't putting any
[SPEAKER_00]: bias into this isn't bringing you know the
ideas of some big agenda agendas exactly
[SPEAKER_00]: they're they're looking out for it you
know supposedly the the good of the of the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole and and I think in particular you
know folks that need some protection are
[SPEAKER_00]: the kind of you know mom-and-pop cannabis
cultivator and sort of the original
[SPEAKER_00]: pioneers of this industry I mean now look
we're in Vegas's biggest convention center
[SPEAKER_00]: there's thousands of booths here obviously
deep pockets involved in this industry you
[SPEAKER_00]: know I do I worry about my community and
Humboldt and I worry about you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: local like just for example my hometown in
Humboldt County the fire chief is a
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis grower he's a volunteer that's he
spends a lot of his time as a volunteer
[SPEAKER_00]: firefighter and wildfire you know kind of
an issue lately we're in California or we
[SPEAKER_00]: were in California I was in California
yesterday and and then the world's biggest
[SPEAKER_00]: wildfires are happening so to get back to
the point you know Jesse is having a
[SPEAKER_00]: really hard time financially and that's
just signs a sign of the times but these
[SPEAKER_00]: are good people you know these are the
volunteer the chief of the volunteer fire
[SPEAKER_00]: and rescue and the school teachers and you
know a lot of folks have somewhat
[SPEAKER_00]: supplemented all the great things that
they've been doing with their farming of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis and that's just not going to
happen anymore and and that kind of stuff
[SPEAKER_00]: is changing maybe it can still happen in
some respect but the last thing we need is
[SPEAKER_00]: a bunch of you know cease-and-desist
letters and patent infringement lawsuits
[SPEAKER_00]: stopping people I mean we've all seen what
happened and this is cliche but you know
[SPEAKER_00]: when Monsanto had their fancy corn and the
pollen blew from their cornfield in Iowa
[SPEAKER_00]: or wherever it was over to the organic
farmers cornfield and he said he he kind
[SPEAKER_00]: of started the fight I think said I don't
want your pollen your GMO pollen in my
[SPEAKER_00]: organic field you know I I want to be
organic and and that's actually my market
[SPEAKER_00]: and I saved my own seat and they said oh
you're gonna screw with us well we're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna sue you for patent infringement
because you're now growing our patented
[SPEAKER_00]: corn and you're not giving us a royalty or
or you're not paying us our licensing fee
[SPEAKER_00]: so that could happen it's it's not
inconceivable that that could happen in
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis it's pretty perverse isn't it it
is it's you know that's in my I mean I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna get off topic but that's capitalism
and and greed I'm not a fan of either of
[SPEAKER_00]: those things especially not unbridled
capitalism and breed greed so well I think
[SPEAKER_01]: I guess my own take on it is that if
there's a solution it is more transparency
[SPEAKER_01]: and more communication about the actual
history yes the essence of a good
[SPEAKER_01]: intellectual property system is that it
can't take something out of the public
[SPEAKER_01]: domain once it's actually in the public
domain yeah but we can't know whether
[SPEAKER_01]: something is in the public domain unless
we document it that's right and the fact
[SPEAKER_01]: that there isn't a good documentation
about what was in the public domain when
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis was kind of in the dark yeah
means that we need to take some steps to
[SPEAKER_01]: document the public domain ex post facto
that's right away I agree and that means
[SPEAKER_01]: that people need to step forward and say
especially in the context of newly issued
[SPEAKER_01]: patents or newly patents that are newly
applied for we need people to step up and
[SPEAKER_01]: say no no this is this is already in the
public domain and here's my evidence of it
[SPEAKER_01]: here's what I know was happening 10 20
years ago or whatever as long as it was
[SPEAKER_01]: prior to the filing date and this is why
it's in the public domain and this is why
[SPEAKER_01]: this patent is invalid and here is a
coalition of people who are willing to
[SPEAKER_01]: stand together to to provide that evidence
and to essentially form a resistance
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't we the militants and really to you
know it's not even in my take you know you
[SPEAKER_01]: don't even have to be anti-capitalist you
just have to stand in favor of the public
[SPEAKER_01]: domain really if something is in the
public domain then damn it let's let's
[SPEAKER_01]: make sure it stays there there's there is
even if you're pro-capitalist you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: have a meaningful IP system that can grab
things out of the public domain and
[SPEAKER_01]: appropriate them to one owner that is just
messed up that doesn't work yeah because
[SPEAKER_01]: as soon as you can't rely on something
being in the public domain one day and
[SPEAKER_01]: possibly being taken out another day then
nobody has any certainty about their
[SPEAKER_00]: rights the whole whole world yeah you know
where's civilization hey right right what
[SPEAKER_00]: is the world coming to dogs marrying cats
so you know I totally agree and and just
[SPEAKER_00]: to finish that point like I you know I
mentioned I you know I'm not necessarily
[SPEAKER_00]: like like you know so radical that I would
I would never say that you know I founded
[SPEAKER_00]: Humboldt seed company I wouldn't tell you
that I'll never patent a cannabis strain
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll tell you right now that I'm not gonna
just go and and grab something that is
[SPEAKER_00]: that isn't yours that you didn't originate
well that's for sure or or that's like
[SPEAKER_00]: really commonplace too I mean you know the
things that we could you know think would
[SPEAKER_00]: would think about potentially wanting to
protect with a patent you know like
[SPEAKER_00]: something like very unique cannabinoids
that have taken years and years of of
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding effort to to grow and develop and
though you know that is just something
[SPEAKER_00]: that that I haven't even really I don't
even know if we've had enough time even
[SPEAKER_00]: using like traditional breeding practices
or even using genetic markers you know to
[SPEAKER_00]: there there may be some some groups that
that have that kind of IP and and maybe
[SPEAKER_00]: there's definitely maybe there's some
warranted patents out there I don't think
[SPEAKER_00]: that I want to make a black blanket
statement and and I'm not just like
[SPEAKER_00]: blanket opposed to patents in the cannabis
space or patents on plants unlike the
[SPEAKER_00]: whole patents on living creatures a lot of
people say you know like I don't I'm
[SPEAKER_00]: opposed to that altogether I mean there
has to be incentive for us as breeders and
[SPEAKER_00]: it has to be somehow like a legal hammer
to protect that incentive and you know we
[SPEAKER_00]: 've used different techniques other than
patenting in the past and that's been
[SPEAKER_00]: successful such as like licensing you know
like we'll have a license agreement with
[SPEAKER_00]: several nurseries throughout California
currently and you know that has worked
[SPEAKER_00]: wonderfully and you know what I feel like
is it should be something that benefits
[SPEAKER_00]: both of you anyway like if you're a
nursery and you want to license a varietal
[SPEAKER_00]: that I've spent a long time developing I
license it to you you maybe give me a
[SPEAKER_00]: royalty every time you take a clone from
it and then in turn I'm like Dale's
[SPEAKER_00]: nursery calm everybody he does a great job
and and we worked hard on this varietal
[SPEAKER_00]: and now he has it and the right to
propagate it openly and you know it's it's
[SPEAKER_00]: my opinion that if somebody else comes in
and gets it and starts propagating it
[SPEAKER_00]: without my permission you know that's not
necessarily a great thing but they also
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have the benefit of me sitting there
being like Dale's nursery is the one that
[SPEAKER_00]: is the the the right person to go to to
get what I had created and and so those
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of things I think are ways that that
we can program proceed and have incentive
[SPEAKER_00]: for breeders you know without big
overarching patents and at the same time
[SPEAKER_00]: that you know there could be some really
unique things I mean there will be
[SPEAKER_00]: incredible things that come out of
cannabis breeding and and different
[SPEAKER_00]: techniques for cannabis growing and all
the stages of the game and those may very
[SPEAKER_00]: well deserve patent protection and so I
don't think that but it's just this very
[SPEAKER_00]: unique situation that we have where we've
had years of prohibition and so there's a
[SPEAKER_00]: vacuum of data and I think that's
something that the open canvas project is
[SPEAKER_00]: is tackling and doing a great job and
providing being a leader in that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: and there's a lot of work left to be done
so they need I'd say support from the
[SPEAKER_01]: community as a whole well a couple things
on that one of my favorite sayings is that
[SPEAKER_01]: when you're a hammer everything looks like
a nail and I'm a patent attorney and so I
[SPEAKER_01]: kind of like patents but I really hate
patents that aren't valid where someone is
[SPEAKER_01]: basically being dishonest and taking
something that isn't theirs because that
[SPEAKER_01]: wrecks the whole system right and
especially when we're talking about
[SPEAKER_01]: utility patents where someone says they
invented something that they just damn
[SPEAKER_01]: well did not invent yeah that really makes
me and because it messes up my industry
[SPEAKER_01]: yes on the other hand I've worked with
some plant breeders well I've worked with
[SPEAKER_01]: plant breeders my whole career and some of
them not as much in cannabis because it's
[SPEAKER_01]: a it's a plant that you can propagate
quickly and you can select it you can
[SPEAKER_01]: select a lot of them you can plant a lot
of plants in a relatively small space but
[SPEAKER_01]: I've worked with with breeders of grapes
and stone fruits where they might spend
[SPEAKER_01]: literally eight to ten years selecting a
special variety exactly and developing a
[SPEAKER_01]: variety that has commercial value that
might last for 20 or 30 years right and if
[SPEAKER_01]: they don't patent that someone can grab
one plant and branch carry it off yeah a
[SPEAKER_01]: branch a small cutting yeah and carry it
off and propagate acres and acres of that
[SPEAKER_01]: yeah and misappropriate ten years of
somebody's work that's right ten years yep
[SPEAKER_01]: and if there weren't a patent system to
protect that work that investment these
[SPEAKER_01]: guys wouldn't have a job yeah they
wouldn't have an employer their employer
[SPEAKER_01]: wouldn't have a business yeah and all of
us wouldn't have those special varieties
[SPEAKER_01]: they spend all that time developing yeah
so you know maybe the world would still
[SPEAKER_01]: turn if we didn't have grapes that ripened
two weeks earlier or that tasted that much
[SPEAKER_01]: better or whatever but there is a hell of
a lot of work that goes into that and
[SPEAKER_01]: that's right that's what the plant patent
system exists to protect I do have a
[SPEAKER_01]: friend who's a cannabis breeder and he I
absolutely believe that there are a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: things that aren't worth patenting even
though I'm a hammer and everything looks
[SPEAKER_01]: like a nail there are some things that you
know you can protect just with agreements
[SPEAKER_01]: either handshake agreements or written
agreements and you can say all right I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: not gonna bother to patent this but when I
send you my clones I'm gonna ask you to
[SPEAKER_01]: only make only propagate this many and to
pay me this much and to restrict anybody
[SPEAKER_01]: else from propagating and to sell them for
this much and to just kind of respect the
[SPEAKER_01]: fact that I originated it and give me some
credit yeah that can work I do have this
[SPEAKER_01]: friend though that's a cannabis breeder
and he actually did that and he sold his
[SPEAKER_01]: friend 500 clones pretty soon he sees this
strain showing up in catalogs and he knows
[SPEAKER_01]: it's his strain it's distinctive and I
think his friend might have even used the
[SPEAKER_01]: same name and so he called his friend and
said hey dude where's my money what's the
[SPEAKER_01]: deal you're selling this in catalogs and
he said oh you know sorry business
[SPEAKER_01]: business is business dude I you know yeah
we had an agreement but this is this is
[SPEAKER_01]: real life and that's when he came to me
and said I think maybe I need to patent my
[SPEAKER_01]: strains because some people you can't
trust and that's kind of what it comes
[SPEAKER_01]: down to at some point things are valuable
enough that even if you wish you didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: have to it's nice to have the recourse
that's not the case with everything but to
[SPEAKER_01]: this extent that you invest a whole lot of
work and a whole lot of time and you make
[SPEAKER_01]: something really special and a lot of
people are gonna want it sometimes it's
[SPEAKER_01]: worth doing I'm not gonna say it always is
and perhaps with a with a plant that is
[SPEAKER_01]: easier to breed quicker to propagate
quicker to select and there are a lot of a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot more strains and a lot more variety it
doesn't always make sense to patent it but
[SPEAKER_01]: there's something about that and I think
there's a big difference between plant
[SPEAKER_01]: patents and utility patents and especially
the potential for abusing utility patents
[SPEAKER_01]: by just pretending to have invented
something that you damn well didn't invent
[SPEAKER_01]: and taking it out of the public domain
that that does make me kind of crazy well
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd say clearly this isn't necessarily
just a black-and-white issue I think one
[SPEAKER_00]: thing to take home is the open cannabis
project is a much needed resource for the
[SPEAKER_00]: US patent and trademark office and for our
community industry and that Dale you are a
[SPEAKER_00]: very knowledgeable person on this subject
and I think that it would be great to have
[SPEAKER_00]: you come on board with the cannabis
project literally on the board maybe I
[SPEAKER_00]: don't know if I'm supposed to talk about
that but it's a nonprofit so you know
[SPEAKER_01]: it'll be public record soon enough thank
you well we could geek out about this for
[SPEAKER_01]: a long time but fortunately we're out of
time right now they're probably trying to
[SPEAKER_01]: kick us out of this hall so yeah that's
probably all for now I see that the guys
[SPEAKER_00]: in black coats I don't know if I'm if I'm
just staying overstaying my welcome or
[SPEAKER_00]: maybe I've been infringing on some patent
I don't know about it's tequila time you
you you
