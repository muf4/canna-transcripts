[SPEAKER_01]: Any company who hires a single compliance
officer and is like we're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're covered We do we got compliance like
I have a consultant.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're great.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are not okay like To tell what you
think Everybody's job in a company in a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis company is now compliance You are
no longer a bud tender your job is sales
[SPEAKER_01]: compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: You are no longer a grower Your job is
growing compliance, you know you Your
[SPEAKER_01]: growers have like a ridiculous amount of
record-keeping responsibility You have to
[SPEAKER_01]: support them.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to build systems that work for
them You have to make sure they have the
[SPEAKER_01]: right scales and the right kind of points
of entry to enter the information so that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not too hard and it's not too
difficult and you're not giving them so
[SPEAKER_01]: much pressure that they're in too much of
a hurry that they can't Write down the wet
[SPEAKER_01]: weight for every individual plant that has
to be written down now You have to help
[SPEAKER_00]: them and then you have to build in
redundancy Big so that's the thing about
[SPEAKER_00]: it is is like not only do you have to do
it you got to do that like three fucking
[SPEAKER_00]: times Because you don't want any of this
to go missing so if you have to keep a
[SPEAKER_00]: visitor's log like a lot of people don't
understand that you have to keep employee
[SPEAKER_00]: records separate from other records and
all of this different thing and so they'll
[SPEAKER_00]: have them all locked up and in our spaces
right now like I mean Compliance also
[SPEAKER_00]: means it takes up a lot of space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to have cabinets that are
locked you have this, you know And this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuff and it's like well,
let's have digital digital is great until
[SPEAKER_00]: shit goes down and then you don't have
electricity and then they just so happen
[SPEAKER_00]: to show up in that moment and the thing
about all of this is and with regulators
[SPEAKER_00]: and I don't mean this in a bad way is like
learn how to be this is funny coming from
[SPEAKER_00]: me from me learn how to be a likeable
person because all of this stuff is all
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like subjective like so if they come
in and they don't like Your attitude those
[SPEAKER_00]: other two things that they didn't that
they saw but they didn't see They saw and
[SPEAKER_00]: so you need to learn how to also come at
this because they're coming at you Nice as
[SPEAKER_00]: can be because they know that takes your
guard down So you need to come at them
[SPEAKER_00]: nicest can be as well and have like like
it was already discussed here is like I do
[SPEAKER_00]: just like a fire drill not that any
businesses do that but do a fire drill
[SPEAKER_00]: because trust me that fire will burn you
down worse
