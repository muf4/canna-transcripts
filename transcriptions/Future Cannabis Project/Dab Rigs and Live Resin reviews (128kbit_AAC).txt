[SPEAKER_02]: So we have our DAB station here with
Andrew.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have three different companies that
brought us different sauces and stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talking Trees, Pink Lemonade Live Resin is
what I'm going with first.
[SPEAKER_02]: Love the live resin, protect the whole
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apex has brought us some beautiful things.
[SPEAKER_02]: Papaya, very Caribbean of us.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to try it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm excited for that gelati.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, gelati is always delicious.
[SPEAKER_02]: Heck yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then Nug brought us some of these.
[SPEAKER_02]: Check out these diamonds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, diamonds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strawberry, banana, diamonds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Testing it over 80% right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: Bad ass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, diamonds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're going to try the Talking Trees
Pink Lemonade Live Resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't wait to do a DAB because I'm not
drinking tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Andrew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this right now is just a B-Nails,
E-Nails setup.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's called their Trinity Series.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is a quartz dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get the best flavor
possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always prefer quartz, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Low temp DABs, quartz.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this little recycler pulls it on
up through in a little cyclone motion.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's pretty fun, really easy on the
lungs, and not going to splash in your
[SPEAKER_00]: mouth when you're taking your DAB.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's the way we like to keep it
clean, fresh, and at a low temperature.
[SPEAKER_00]: So have you taken a DAB before?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just making sure, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go ahead.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm going to pull for you.
Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did Craig do you right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that taste good?
[SPEAKER_02]: Goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, Pink Lemonade Live Resin from
Talking Trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can I have another one of those?
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Don't tell me what to tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we do?
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, perfect.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'll wait for the next one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, we're going through the whole lineup.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love this game.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, please.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do we got from Apex next?
[SPEAKER_00]: Apex.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have Basio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Basio.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: This guy's looking pretty fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my god.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get the fuel coming off of that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, Apex.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice job.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's fantastic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me get you a little fresh run here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going to clean this bad boy out for a
second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get you a fresh taste here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Q-tip industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Never thought they would take over the DAB
industry, did they?
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have a little Basio here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers, my friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let me know when to pull for you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, you can taste the fuel.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little bit of gas on that one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very different from the Pink Lemonade.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can smell that just nose alone,
right?
Goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: The taste out of it was pretty good there.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just straight diesel.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got Nug up left.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, how we're going strawberry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, strawberry man on the diamond.
[SPEAKER_02]: Who doesn't love a diamond?
[SPEAKER_02]: Boy's best friends also.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This was supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got to get your nose on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Holy shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that smells like strawberry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's this?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is a strawberry banana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turb diamonds from Nug.
[SPEAKER_02]: Diamonds are a boy's best friend.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get you a little bit of the.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love my job.
[SPEAKER_00]: You ready?
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_00]: On number three, the Turb diamonds.
[SPEAKER_01]: It tastes like it smells.
[SPEAKER_01]: How was that?
[SPEAKER_02]: How smooth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Goodness.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: We haven't been doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got this and a couple other devices
alongside with us, too.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the Vapex tail here.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you haven't seen this device before,
it is a rig that is all electronic,
[SPEAKER_00]: full vapor pattern.
[SPEAKER_00]: The vapor path is all glass all the way up
through.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get the cleanest hit possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to come by and try this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I can't wait.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'll run through them all again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got all the best devices here
tonight, all quartz dishes, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to get the best taste and
best notes possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll test that for sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, the terpenes off the nose match
the terpenes in your mouth is amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then best of the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: Talk about terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Speaking of terpenes, actually,
over here we have the true terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are some of their most expensive
terpene combinations that they have
[SPEAKER_00]: available.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one on the end is one of my
favorites.
[SPEAKER_00]: Valencin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's found in Valencia oranges,
mainly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get your nose on that, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: That for that ounce right there is four
hundred and thirteen dollars in that
[SPEAKER_00]: little vial.
Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: One of the more rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you do with this?
[SPEAKER_00]: So you would I'm just using this tonight
as a nose exercise.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of pairing this with some of
the concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you get a nice sensory experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: You smell some of the terpenes go
alongside with the.
[SPEAKER_01]: It can really affect what you taste after
you smell like that once you trigger that
[SPEAKER_01]: in your brain for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Little wine guys.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or we could take a little dip of the Terps
and mix it into your concentrate to give
[SPEAKER_00]: you a little bit of a.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And you'll hold out on me this first
round.
[SPEAKER_02]: I see how this works.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm saving the big stuff for later,
my friend.
[SPEAKER_02]: Perfect.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm in.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Excellent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, thanks, Andrew.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can't wait to come back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Typically, this is going to be the
workhorse, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be banging out the dab
super quick in and out, depending on how
[SPEAKER_00]: long the line is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as taste goes, I don't really
have one that's better than another.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going to be depending on the
experience that you want.
Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you want more of a traditional nail
and rig experience, come to this guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want something brand new,
try the vape exhale.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would go this route.
[SPEAKER_00]: This one does deliver a much bigger hit
with a smaller amount of concentrate.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this one is also good for beginners,
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can just take a tiny, tiny little
hit off of it and walk away and be OK with
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't have to finish all of your
dab out of something like this over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then this guy, we have a nail with a
torch.
[SPEAKER_00]: So depending on if we're allowed to have
open flame in here or not, we'll figure
[SPEAKER_00]: that out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that'll dictate how this one runs
tonight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of giving a hodgepodge of
different devices and experiences for
[SPEAKER_00]: people tonight at the Grow Off.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome, brother.
[SPEAKER_02]: Man, those are fucking good.
[SPEAKER_02]: Jesus.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe how this smells.
[SPEAKER_00]: Couldn't have something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: No way.
No way.
