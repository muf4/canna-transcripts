[SPEAKER_00]: So the question essentially was common
practice moving into old rose greenhouses,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that, with dirt floors.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the problem with that is whether we
want it to or not, nature is still
[SPEAKER_00]: functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if there's dirt in this greenhouse,
nature is and still is functioning.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the organisms in the soil are very
specific.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they operate at specific ranges of
oxygen, specific moisture levels,
[SPEAKER_00]: things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when the conditions in the soil are
ideal for their growth, proliferation,
[SPEAKER_00]: and activity, that is what determines what
is functioning and performing functions of
[SPEAKER_00]: nature at all times.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in these old houses, they've been
chemically bombed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there's residuals of chemicals in
the soil that are being pulled up and can
[SPEAKER_00]: be pulled up into the plant, which I
understand is and can lead to test
[SPEAKER_00]: failures.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then just the presence of the spores
of these organisms, because the ground of
[SPEAKER_00]: that greenhouse has been compacted,
anaerobic, and full of disease spores for
[SPEAKER_00]: who knows how long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's not a mountain that we can't
overcome.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just have to understand how that system
is working.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if we know and can understand that
these biological organisms are
[SPEAKER_00]: specialized, we can create the conditions
that make it not ideal for them to
[SPEAKER_00]: proliferate or even function or be viable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's not uncommon when you're scanning
a coverslip of the microscope slide that
[SPEAKER_00]: you see spores of fusarium in alternating
area and all these fungal pathogens.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are there naturally in nature in
their dormant phase for when conditions
[SPEAKER_00]: are ideal for them to proliferate and
perform their function in nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in a extremely healthy,
vibrant soil, it's not uncommon to see
[SPEAKER_00]: spores of fusarium across the street.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you only become concerned when they're
in high populations, because it shows that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're making spores.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so if we can change the conditions in
that soil, we can put those organisms to
[SPEAKER_00]: sleep, put them into dormant phases,
and dispose of them, literally.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's how nature does it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have to change those conditions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're not unovercomeable.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you become running into more
problems now that you're in a greenhouse
[SPEAKER_00]: with glass and all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like a foreign language,
so I don't want to really try to break it
[SPEAKER_00]: down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll let Jonathan handle that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then you're running into more
problems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we make a joke when people ask us,
how do we retrofit these old greenhouses
[SPEAKER_00]: and grow them?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we say, you don't.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put PVC hoop houses, you pull tarps,
and you go buy an appropriate facility
[SPEAKER_00]: that doesn't have disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it will be ideal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the things I see most often,
because I'm analyzing the soil of
[SPEAKER_00]: different growing styles, indoor,
outdoor greenhouses, different types of
[SPEAKER_00]: greenhouses, we can see very clearly how
those environments are negatively
[SPEAKER_00]: impacted.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're impacting the soil, which is
driving pest and disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's coming from the environmental
aspect, because we're using the
[SPEAKER_00]: inappropriate greenhouse structures and
all that business.
[SPEAKER_00]: But really, we're creating a hostile
environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: That hostile environment dictates a
hostile soil environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then when that happens, the good
organisms go to sleep and the bad
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms wake up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can mitigate those, but then you're
still fighting a hostile environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can change the conditions in the
soil to be more ideal for vigorous plant
[SPEAKER_00]: growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And lower disease pressure, but then
you're still fighting environments.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we can see that very clearly when we
analyze the different groups of plants
[SPEAKER_00]: individually amongst the greenhouse or the
space.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can actually see in the back
corner by the wet walls, there's an
[SPEAKER_00]: increase in humidity, which is negatively
affecting the natural respiration of the
[SPEAKER_00]: moisture in the soil in those pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: When that condition is created in the
soil, that selects for organisms that
[SPEAKER_00]: produce nitrates, these anaerobic
organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nitrates are fine for vegetative and
vigorous growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as you move into flowering,
you have to lower the nitrates and bring
[SPEAKER_00]: in the ammoniacal nitrogen.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look on the back of any bottle of
nutrients, you see this happen with the
[SPEAKER_00]: percentages and the types of nutrients
that are happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this increased humidity, whether it's
VPD, indoors, you're running high heat,
[SPEAKER_00]: high humidity, it is stifling that soil
surface.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's creating these conditions ideal
for organisms that produce nitrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: When nitrates exceed 55% of plant sap,
you end up with sucking pests,
[SPEAKER_00]: like as a function of math and nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so in the back corners of these
hostile environments, or up against the
[SPEAKER_00]: other end wall with these smaller plants
that we don't want growing into the
[SPEAKER_00]: controls and the doors, they're getting
the same dosage of water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're being overwatered every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're up against a solid end wall.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're in the shade.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're slow growers.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is the conditions for pest and
disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when we individually count all
these beds or pots or groups of plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: we can look at it and we can see in the
corners where the problem is located and
[SPEAKER_00]: address it by either changing
environmental conditions and changing a
[SPEAKER_00]: process.
[SPEAKER_00]: Almost everybody is brewing a tea that it
selects for disease, biologically
[SPEAKER_00]: speaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that creates more populations of pest
and disease pressure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's what we're going to do.
