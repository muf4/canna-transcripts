[SPEAKER_01]: So let's talk auto flowering.
[SPEAKER_01]: Give me a history lesson.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I'm talking about it is
because I've written a book not for you
[SPEAKER_00]: and not for most of the people that listen
to this podcast but for your mother or
[SPEAKER_00]: your aunt and uncle because I'm convinced
that auto flowering cannabis is the next
[SPEAKER_00]: tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once or twice in a lifetime as a garden
writer, because that's what I do in a
[SPEAKER_00]: different life, as a garden writer I can
tell you that once or twice in a lifetime
[SPEAKER_00]: a new plant is introduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: The last time it happened that you might
remember, that I certainly remember,
[SPEAKER_00]: is the snap pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the sugar snap peas came out,
oh my god, people went nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was a brand new plant nobody had ever
seen.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people went nuts.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm convinced that auto flowering cannabis
is the next tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a snap pea.
[SPEAKER_00]: In terms of a new introduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why I say that is there are a
couple of reasons.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first is that these plants,
which most people have never heard of,
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants are a normal size plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Unlike sativa and indica, which can be
anywhere from 8 to 15 feet tall,
[SPEAKER_00]: these plants are anywhere from 18 inches
to maybe 4 feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're shrubs at the best.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they're smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: They grow in pots as well as outdoors in
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can grow indoors or outdoors.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why they're called auto flower
is because they don't have a photo period,
[SPEAKER_00]: which makes all the difference in the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are a cross between a sativa or an
indica, or sativa and indica, and a
[SPEAKER_00]: rudialis.
[SPEAKER_00]: These were plants that were discovered in
the early 1900s in Russia.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were escaped from plantations where
they were growing hemp.
[SPEAKER_00]: Evolution created a situation where they
went from seed to flower without a photo
[SPEAKER_00]: period, only based on genetics.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there any other plant that auto flowers
like that without using the sun to tell it
[SPEAKER_00]: what to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there are any number of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: Grass, lawns, there are any number of
plants that are auto flower plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, the key thing about this is that if
you live in the northern hemisphere,
[SPEAKER_00]: even if you live on the equator,
that 12 hour darkness plus is a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get 12 hours in Anchorage, Alaska,
right when the frost hits.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're never going to get a plant that
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plants that we are all using today
have afghani as a basis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Somebody went over there and got this
plant, not knowing really what it was,
[SPEAKER_00]: what it was for.
[SPEAKER_00]: It turns out these things take six,
seven, eight months from seed to harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: What we have in auto flowers is the
ability to grow a plant from seed to
[SPEAKER_00]: harvest in seven to nine weeks.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, when they were first commercialized
in 2002 or 2003 with a low rider,
[SPEAKER_00]: they were crappy plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: They were small.
[SPEAKER_00]: The yield was terrible.
[SPEAKER_00]: The strength wasn't all that good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're talking the early commercial auto
flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awful.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a consequence, if you started to look
at them and breed them and fool around
[SPEAKER_00]: with them, people laughed at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you were on one of the internet
websites, they threw you off basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So somebody started auto flower net,
which people ought to go take a look at
[SPEAKER_00]: today.
[SPEAKER_00]: The science, because these things can be
bred so quickly, advanced exponentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And around 2008, 9, 10, the strength
started to get better.
[SPEAKER_00]: The quality was phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: The size of the plants changed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say today we are at the point
where they need to be.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what are some of the improvements?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like if you look at the best auto
flowering plants today versus 20 years
[SPEAKER_01]: ago, it's better now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, depending on what your perspective
is, you can either breed in CBD et cetera,
[SPEAKER_00]: et cetera, THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: The lack of powdery mildew has been,
stuff has been bred out and bred in to
[SPEAKER_00]: make these a plant which your mother would
grow in her house or on her condo deck.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is such an easy plant to grow that if
you add fertilizer to it, you're probably
[SPEAKER_00]: causing a problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are plants that grow so quickly that
when an insect hits it, very often what
[SPEAKER_00]: happens is the life phase of the plant is
gone that the insect requires.
[SPEAKER_00]: Holy crow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the whole idea of growing these plants
has gone from complicated, you had to have
[SPEAKER_00]: a degree in chemistry, you had to know
about hydroponics, blah, blah,
[SPEAKER_00]: blah, to the most simple, easy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You go buy a bag of soil, you stick it in
a five gallon pot, you put the seed in the
[SPEAKER_00]: pot, you don't even transplant it because
they don't like to be transplanted,
[SPEAKER_00]: and bingo.
[SPEAKER_00]: Seven to nine weeks later, you have a
usable, and I mean a usable cannabis crop.
[SPEAKER_02]: How large are these plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, these plants can be anywhere from
this big to about four feet, four and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half feet.
[SPEAKER_02]: What sort of yield?
[SPEAKER_02]: What are the flowers like?
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw a yield the other day, 80 grams on a
cola, and there were about eight colas on
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the yield is phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you just pop onto Instagram and look up
auto flowering cannabis, you will be
[SPEAKER_00]: phenomenally surprised.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the next tomato.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, from a commercial growers
perspective, in places like Oregon,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're beginning to use these because the
advantages are phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: First of all, you get a uniform size
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very important.
[SPEAKER_00]: Second of all, you don't have to worry
about the photo period.
[SPEAKER_00]: What that means is that if you are growing
photo period plants, you can put these
[SPEAKER_00]: plants in between your photo period
plants, whether you're in a veg stage or a
[SPEAKER_00]: flower stage, and still get results.
[SPEAKER_00]: Absolutely spectacular.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ability to breed these things is
wonderful because they are so quick,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the fact that you can turn over any
number of crops means that if you're
[SPEAKER_00]: growing outdoors, you can put one in the
ground now and probably get two more crops
[SPEAKER_00]: in before a frost hits sometime in
October.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just spectacular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really spectacular.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are there any specific breeders that
you've talked to and picked their brains?
Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Who's a breeder who's doing some
interesting stuff?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I would say on a general level for
the home grower, the tomato grower,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would take a look at Mephisto seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mephisto genetics, phenomenal.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Oregon, there's a company called New
Breed Seeds, which is a sister company to
[SPEAKER_00]: Territorial Seeds, which already sells
tomato plants, so we're really in a great
[SPEAKER_00]: spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's worth looking around.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are they able to introduce existing
genetics into these new plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes, and they're able to work on the
genetics so that we can back trace to some
[SPEAKER_00]: of the land races.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really an exciting tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's not necessarily a threat to
breeders who've been?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, absolutely not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a tool because you can breed these
with regular cannabis, take some of the
[SPEAKER_00]: advantages of these, add in the advantages
of regular cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bigger cousins, as I like to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Transitioning from my mom to the hardcore
commercial cultivator selling flour into
[SPEAKER_01]: the California market, the Oregon market,
the Washington state market, what are
[SPEAKER_01]: those growers, like when you meet people
all the time, what are their thoughts on
[SPEAKER_01]: adding auto flowering to their mix of
light depth?
[SPEAKER_01]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I add on to that?
[SPEAKER_02]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the cultivator who says
Appalachian is a really important part of
[SPEAKER_02]: my future survival?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, let's work with the Appalachian part
first.
[SPEAKER_00]: Appalachian has to do with what I call the
three-legged stool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Genetics, light, what's the light in your
area, and the soil, the microbes in the
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: Obviously, I would be a microbe guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: What gives the plant taror, I think,
are the microbes in the soil and the light
[SPEAKER_00]: because the light has such an incredible
impact on the microbes in the soil which
[SPEAKER_00]: make available all of the 18 nutrients
that the plant needs to have.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, we can put all the other crap we want
in a plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's not what the plant uses.
[SPEAKER_00]: It uses those 17, 18 nutrients,
and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: The ability to be able to have specialized
microbes in your area to create that taror
[SPEAKER_00]: works with these plants just like any
other plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's no different than a regular cannabis
plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you can grow these in pots very
easily and move them around very easily,
[SPEAKER_00]: you can create your own taror to a certain
degree.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can bring in soil from my question.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can go into the ground.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they go into a pot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because, you know, Appalachian purists go,
if you're in a pot, if you're not in the
[SPEAKER_02]: ground.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, if you're in a pot, but you have the
soil that you've taken.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, but then they go, well,
then you can grow Humboldt, Appalachian
[SPEAKER_02]: anywhere in the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hate to say it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: But these are really spectacular plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: The colors, the varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, my God, it's unbelievable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the fact that you can grow
a plant in a little teeny area and get a
[SPEAKER_00]: usable harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think the future of cannabis is going
to be auto flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're going to end up in a
situation once it's fully legalized,
[SPEAKER_00]: where you're going to be able to walk into
your, you know, your Best Buy at Christmas
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're going to be little Christmas
trees, auto flower cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: At Easter, it's going to, you know,
it's going to have the same tree,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it'll have that, you know,
those silly little green stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I said the same thing
about legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: It took a while, but I think we're there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I predicted pretty well the
microwave.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is not a great book.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just that it hit the wave at the
right time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think I predicted pretty well the micro
risal wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm telling you, I got a real feeling
about this auto flowering wave.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go to a dispensary,
very often they sell the seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: The seeds do not contain THC in them,
obviously.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you should be able to buy them in the
mail, you know, unless you live in a place
[SPEAKER_00]: like Alaska, where they've made seeds part
of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you need to be a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to be a breeder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can pick these seeds up.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're very, very available.
[SPEAKER_02]: But for homegrown use yet, that'll be
like, like auto flowering sounds like it's
[SPEAKER_02]: going to have tremendous homegrown.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's right.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to be able to go to a seed
rack and when you buy your tomato plant
[SPEAKER_00]: and your celery or your carrots,
there's going to be four or five different
[SPEAKER_00]: kinds of waterfowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it open source science and technology?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: No secrets.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rudy Alice plants are available.
[SPEAKER_00]: People can breed their own.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, so far it looks like a very
clean entry into the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's going to be really
helpful for everybody.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we have improved everything we've
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I mean, and we've we've
introduced CBD or brought it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've introduced, you know, all sorts of
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just another tool in the chest
and really an important one.
Thank you.
