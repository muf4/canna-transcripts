[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's do one more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do it at his big temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go for a 20 grammer.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to do a 20 grammer at 210?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, or maybe go up?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, 210 was actually really good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think that was a good temp.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see if you can do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would squeeze the plates together right
now and just make sure they're nice and
[SPEAKER_07]: hot.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's weird though is when you're coming
down, you almost don't know when you're at
[SPEAKER_07]: the bottom.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I kept pressing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I was pressing and I was like,
oh wait, all I could do was lift up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, I was doing that too.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a short stroke.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like it should have went down a
little further.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it has a short stroke.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there should be a line.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or a little beep.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you ready?
[SPEAKER_07]: For yours?
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, that's what I like to see.
[SPEAKER_01]: No quitters.
[SPEAKER_07]: Got a little smoke on that one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Someone asked, did anyone ever make full
melt dry sift?
[SPEAKER_07]: I have not messed around with dry sift.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dry sift is super gnarly and a totally
different process.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like working with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: I do dry sift completely salt.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be the dry sift Mac,
I want to say.
[SPEAKER_01]: It is a dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, a lot of my dry sift, you can't tell
the difference from the ice water hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll label it so you know the
difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can I check that out?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they got it over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, I'm sorry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom, you're my hand model.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the Mac though.
[SPEAKER_00]: How long have you been married,
Tom?
[SPEAKER_01]: This Cushmix.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh man.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a dry sift.
[SPEAKER_01]: They tend to be a little bit darker.
[SPEAKER_01]: You got plant contamination.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a good factor because it's dry.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have you done the paint roller and the
parchment tech yet?
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't gotten to that.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's some better ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm getting better at it, you know.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it does still put out some nice ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some different older ones,
you can tell.
[SPEAKER_01]: But there's some other ones that I have,
but I don't think I brought them.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, my whole mouth.
[SPEAKER_02]: Satisfying.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think food would be amazing too.
[SPEAKER_07]: All right, you should be good to go.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go ahead and blow that out.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's that watermelon one.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_07]: That coated my mouth.
[SPEAKER_07]: On the second hit.
[SPEAKER_07]: Holy crap.
[SPEAKER_07]: We killed Pete, everybody.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm sorry, Peter.
[SPEAKER_07]: One of my funner Tuesday nights I've had
in a while.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I didn't bring the other part to this,
so I'm going to do what I can and get it
[SPEAKER_01]: pressed with this guy so I don't have the
matching piece.
[SPEAKER_04]: Doesn't help that I'm pretty large.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have the other part, but again,
I was in a hurry.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I keep finding more stuff that I forgot.
[SPEAKER_01]: I forgot that too.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is 20 gram.
[SPEAKER_01]: Generally, yeah, to get all of that out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where I didn't get the maximum
yield on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was a 10 gram puck.
[SPEAKER_01]: I didn't apply enough pressure.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you repress that bag?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it was only at 180 degrees,
you got a lot of cushion for mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: I play on the safe side.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not that his is not safe.
[SPEAKER_01]: He likes that.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what he does.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nobody does it the wrong way.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody, if you're doing it,
that's the right way.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we all have different techniques,
and that's what's cool.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's got the best little puck I can make
for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, I got to get one of those embers.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm jealous now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you get that blowout effect with these?
[SPEAKER_00]: You double bag still, huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: You double bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: I double bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Look at all those textures.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wonder if I folded it up in here,
how it would play out in one bag if we
[SPEAKER_01]: would bust it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't look at me, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's your call.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's your hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get no suggestions from me so you can yell
at me in 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was trying to set you up.
[SPEAKER_07]: I know your tricks.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is good parchment, though.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is gnarly parchment.
[SPEAKER_07]: I love how thick it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's important, especially on the higher
temperature.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I use a much thicker parchment that
I get off of Amazon.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's frickin gnarly.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then knowing how to cut your
parchment, getting all that stuff,
[SPEAKER_07]: right?
[SPEAKER_07]: That's all something you got to dial in.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is what I use, but I can't use that
at high temps.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's the difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it comes down to what are you
doing?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't like the thick parchment.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it takes heat away.
[SPEAKER_01]: It actually absorbs heat.
[SPEAKER_07]: Having big plates helps.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, so if you have thicker paper and I
go in at 180, it's not 180 on this
[SPEAKER_01]: material anymore because it has to heat
through that paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So again, it's all on how you like to do
your thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are things you got to consider.
[SPEAKER_07]: You just kind of like...
[SPEAKER_07]: Cheater, clip it, and then squish it,
and then it'll stay in place for a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit.
No.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're not going to leave that while
you're squishing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, no, that's just giving me time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like a little cheater that's super rad.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's so nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just my little... Yeah,
that's what I'm saying.
[SPEAKER_01]: My extra set of fingers.
[SPEAKER_01]: When I finish this fold, that's when it
goes in, and then I remove the clip.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, perfect.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, gotcha.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gives me time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'll prep all my pucks just like this.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'll sit there, two of us, and we'll
get down.
[SPEAKER_01]: One dude's working the pucks, and I'm
doing all the folding.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can roll joints, I'm a joint
smoker.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like to roll joints, so you could do
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're good at rolling joints,
you're going to struggle.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm totally different.
[SPEAKER_07]: I use the pre-sewn bags.
[SPEAKER_07]: I have a cone filler, you know,
a funnel.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just have a spoon.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just dump it in, weigh them out,
see that they're about even, 20 to 22
[SPEAKER_07]: grams.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what I'm doing per bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: And then I just sit there, and I'm holding
the bag and whipping it, trying to get all
[SPEAKER_07]: the hash to the seam, so all the corners.
[SPEAKER_07]: Press it with my hand a little bit,
double bag it, and pre-press it,
[SPEAKER_07]: and throw it on the regular press.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is ready to go, for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: This thing's actually pretty cool,
though.
[SPEAKER_07]: I just noticed the springs.
[SPEAKER_07]: This helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_01]: That helps balance your plates on the
clothes.
[SPEAKER_01]: The worst thing you get is when the plates
are all tweaked, and they slide your stuff
[SPEAKER_01]: over, unless you have the peaks press
where it self-automatically adjusts,
[SPEAKER_01]: because their plate naturally comes down
at an angle.
[SPEAKER_01]: The whole thing is a computer.
[SPEAKER_01]: You tell it what to do, and it executes
your commands.
[SPEAKER_07]: In all honesty, I would sit there and take
screenshots of people that I would see
[SPEAKER_07]: doing it live, just so I could try to zoom
in and figure out how the hell they were
[SPEAKER_07]: folding their parchment paper while they
were squishing it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Seeing that they were getting good
returns.
[SPEAKER_07]: Were they doing double parchment paper?
[SPEAKER_07]: What was the inside bag?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, everybody's a little differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you double parchment at this temp?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, I double parchment always,
every time.
[SPEAKER_07]: In all reality, it's even more because of
the way I fold it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's on top of itself.
[SPEAKER_07]: I would say even maybe triple.
[SPEAKER_01]: In a production mind, and that's how our
facility will be, operational soon.
[SPEAKER_01]: They account everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: How many papers we have to go through,
how many bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: Those are things that influences the
reason of why I use certain things.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's so many expenses involved with
licensing, with taxations, with
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: All these fees that come out of the end
product, which ultimately the consumer
[SPEAKER_01]: pays.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we can minimize as many of these extra
little things.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is my thought process.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean it's right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It doesn't mean it's wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just that that's the way that my mind
is thought.
[SPEAKER_07]: Looks so nice and blonde.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is what he pressed, and mine's down
there.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to try to taffy mine,
if you did yours?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yours will do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: See if it'll do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll see if we can taffy this.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was a little buttery, but it still was
very stable and gooey and held together
[SPEAKER_07]: really well.
[SPEAKER_07]: You might be able to pull it and get a
different consistency and a really good
[SPEAKER_07]: solid color.
[SPEAKER_07]: Where there's no streaking in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes more work when there's cake in
it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's why I'm a big, try not to make cake
because it makes it more work,
[SPEAKER_01]: more time, more blending, and time adds
up.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a modification of whatever we're
going to try to do to get this done the
[SPEAKER_01]: best we can.
[SPEAKER_07]: Quickness.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let me know if you need help.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you can go ahead and close up my clamps
so my paper and folds don't come apart,
[SPEAKER_02]: that'll help.
[SPEAKER_01]: A bunch of butts in your face.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you just go at it, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: More or less?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I slow, I get it nice and tight.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get a nice little, yeah, I get it nice
and tight.
[SPEAKER_07]: You know, when you feel it, when you feel
it pressing it and then just go a little
[SPEAKER_07]: bit more, I almost let the weight of this
do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll get that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Stay hydrated.
[SPEAKER_02]: Again, I bottomed out and I was still
pushing down.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're still flowing now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're flowing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, blow out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hold on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Reset.
[SPEAKER_01]: Which way?
[SPEAKER_01]: Forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not blow out, but slide out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh.
[SPEAKER_01]: Audible.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay, let's reset.
[SPEAKER_07]: Is it because of this paper?
[SPEAKER_01]: It started, my bag started sliding towards
me, so we're good.
[SPEAKER_01]: We reset.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just had to set her back a little bit
deeper.
[SPEAKER_01]: That could be the, that's the other
downside.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bigger plates, they tend to sometimes
squeeze too forward, like a V shape,
[SPEAKER_01]: and it pushes the bag towards me because I
like to see my edge.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I, sometimes that happens,
but I think we're okay now.
[SPEAKER_01]: We saved the squish.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, I almost, I avoided a blowout.
[SPEAKER_01]: What happened back there, dude?
[SPEAKER_01]: You blew out the back.
[SPEAKER_07]: I told you it was into, you were going too
far in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a blowout.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what happens.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was, you want me to do 20 grams
real quick?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll rock that shit fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: You could still repress it, pull this off.
[SPEAKER_07]: Open it up, put this bag into another bag
and even keep that.
[SPEAKER_07]: And that was one bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a 15U single bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: It also was sticking out the back a little
bit, and it's because the plate is so
[SPEAKER_07]: small.
[SPEAKER_07]: If the plate was wider, it wouldn't have
done that because it would have been a...
[SPEAKER_00]: Did it hit the edge or something?
[SPEAKER_07]: It was over the edge, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it just squeezed out and it's still
right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still salvageable.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll tell you that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still salvageable.
[SPEAKER_01]: We didn't, we didn't, we minimized the
damage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the thing about the Rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: As you learn it, blowouts are going to
happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can minimize them.
[SPEAKER_01]: So obviously one screen is not ideal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm always double bagging.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, so something you got to figure
out and learn.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are the lessons that we go
through, but it's, it's, I don't think
[SPEAKER_01]: that I ruined it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is completely salvageable.
[SPEAKER_01]: The Rosin itself is good.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this, if I needed to, you just open it
up and pour it into another bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, if the yield is... I would do it
immediately.
[SPEAKER_01]: ...in parameters, there's no need to
repress that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Should we do a test and do it immediately?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you want to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: That one, you could probably just... Well,
there's not much left.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look, it's almost see through.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's probably not worth the time.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but it pushed it out the corner.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's your call.
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it's your hash.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm not, I'm not doing nothing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, let's check this number.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause that's quite the square.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't know on 20 grams.
[SPEAKER_07]: I think it should be a little more.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, we didn't finish it either.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we were in like a minute and a half.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I barely went.
[SPEAKER_01]: Halfway through.
[SPEAKER_07]: Not even.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make another one.
[SPEAKER_07]: You sure?
[SPEAKER_07]: I need gloves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Don't even trip.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let this cool down then.
[SPEAKER_07]: Do your thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: This has to cool down cause I can't touch
it anyway.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get hash all over my fingers and get angry
and cranky.
[SPEAKER_07]: It drives me nuts, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: Literally bat shit crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hash on my fingers is like sand on your
feet, you know, walking into the house.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can't do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'll lose my mind.
[SPEAKER_07]: You want to see this quickly?
[SPEAKER_07]: You do this so fast.
[SPEAKER_07]: No problem.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause well, not only that, but my fingers
are already going freaking numb with how
[SPEAKER_07]: small these gloves are.
[SPEAKER_07]: Big fat finger.
[SPEAKER_07]: This guy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The bigger one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: This product is all usable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not like we're throwing it away.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's for sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: I feel like I could have fit 20 in those
two 25s.
[SPEAKER_07]: Can I get two 25s again?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: They were baggy enough, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: It was actually, it fit pretty well for
the, for the nine.
[SPEAKER_07]: We'll do, we'll do 19.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sound good?
[SPEAKER_08]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just short of 19.
[SPEAKER_07]: Screw it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh, there it is.
[SPEAKER_07]: Make it almost 20.
[SPEAKER_06]: Get that out of the way.
[SPEAKER_07]: Now to form this little pucky.
[SPEAKER_07]: Getting it a little bit warm so you can
make it malleable.
[SPEAKER_07]: And I want it to go in one of these bags
right here.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's this manual hand press.
[SPEAKER_07]: Least ideal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Most amount of actual physical labor.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause he had a ton of hash in his mouth.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's going to make your tongue.
[SPEAKER_07]: No, just the tracks that are in it.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just, it's just, yeah, it just makes
it almost go numb.
[SPEAKER_08]: No, it's not like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a tingling.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's like a tingling effect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like you can even do it with BHO.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like when you eat like a really strong BHO
made edible, your mouth will have this
[SPEAKER_07]: like tingly numbness effect.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I got a fairly good rectangle made.
[SPEAKER_00]: That looks great.
[SPEAKER_07]: But I'm going to attempt to slide in here
the best I can.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is, let's weigh it again.
[SPEAKER_07]: He just lost a rosin ball.
[SPEAKER_07]: 19.6.
[SPEAKER_07]: 19.6.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oops.
[SPEAKER_07]: And again, I turned my rosin bags inside
out, which
[SPEAKER_07]: recently has been upsetting some people
and they've been telling me I do it wrong.
[SPEAKER_07]: Of course.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: I had a guy tell me that I should be
washing in a room that's 20 degrees or
[SPEAKER_07]: below or more like below.
[SPEAKER_07]: I was like, really?
[SPEAKER_07]: That hurts.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you want me to like almost die.
[SPEAKER_01]: That fucking hurts.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you also want my water to be so cold
that it'll a little turn into a fricking
[SPEAKER_07]: slurpee.
[SPEAKER_01]: 38 is fucking as cold as I want to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's, that's, that's hurts.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, why are you offering me
suggestions?
[SPEAKER_07]: Go do it yourself.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go freeze your ass off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I put it down to 33 and I was like,
fuck this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't see no change.
[SPEAKER_01]: I run it like 42.
[SPEAKER_01]: Other than it hurts.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're not too far off.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just only cause when I open and close my
door, the temperature fluctuates too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I got a three and a half ton mini split in
the smallest room.
[SPEAKER_07]: So it just gets cold in a second.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't have to worry about my door
opening, but I walk in and out to get
[SPEAKER_01]: warm.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have a heater outside.
[SPEAKER_07]: I keep my 55 is fine.
[SPEAKER_07]: As long as the water is moving in the
water is ice cold.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's not going to come up.
[SPEAKER_07]: But, but, but 45, 50 degrees is ideal for
me is what I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: So there's the puck in there, the folder
over slammer and another one less less.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just going to don't making that
perfect square is really where it's so it
[SPEAKER_01]: can slide in without you.
[SPEAKER_07]: You'll notice that the bag folded.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to actually go back and fix it.
[SPEAKER_07]: If I ever see that I want it to be
perfect.
[SPEAKER_07]: Very, very flush.
[SPEAKER_07]: Even that's a little funky, but the way
the bag is and the way the nugget or the,
[SPEAKER_07]: the hash is so sticky.
[SPEAKER_07]: I don't really have that bigger or much of
an option.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it is what it is.
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_03]: So take me a minute.
[SPEAKER_03]: I like that these are already pre-folded
for you.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's so nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that 50 people are still watching
this.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: 50 people, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Take care.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there any part of what you're doing a
trade secret?
[SPEAKER_07]: No, I don't care.
[SPEAKER_07]: Good luck.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's folded paper.
[SPEAKER_07]: Keep trying.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's origami.
[SPEAKER_07]: You guys can watch all you want.
[SPEAKER_07]: This is going to squirt a lot.
[SPEAKER_07]: So I'm actually going to give it a good,
give it a good length.
[SPEAKER_01]: So he's used to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: He can close up on the money shot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Tom, is this not the first time you held
the camera?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's going on here, Tom?
[SPEAKER_07]: What, what, what did me and George get
ourselves into?
[SPEAKER_06]: All right, here we go.
[SPEAKER_06]: That was good.
[SPEAKER_06]: Exciting.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we are already ready.
[SPEAKER_06]: All righty.
[SPEAKER_06]: This out of the way.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lots
[SPEAKER_02]: of paper folding.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry if my ass is sticking out.
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_07]: What's that stuff called?
[SPEAKER_07]: ASMR.
[SPEAKER_07]: They're like the noises that people like,
like to listen to or whatever that are
[SPEAKER_07]: like, you know what I'm talking about?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think so.
[SPEAKER_00]: They waited for the money shot.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's about to go down right now.
[SPEAKER_05]: Put these together for just a second.
[SPEAKER_07]: That just goes to show you like how easy
this thing is to tip over.
[SPEAKER_07]: Reset this, get this ready.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just wider than your, than your puck
you're about to press.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come on, folded paper.
[SPEAKER_03]: Always a pain in the ass.
[SPEAKER_03]: It never wants to do what you want it to.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're almost that cool.
[SPEAKER_05]: There we go.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: This is going to be pretty awesome.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can even view it from here if you want
to come in with the camera and I'll get
[SPEAKER_05]: out of the way of the light.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'll see if I can.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's already starting to ooze.
[SPEAKER_07]: This might really squirt out.
[SPEAKER_07]: You might want to have a piece of
parchment.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Grab that half of one that I just,
yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tom, say it again.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a squirter.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a squirter.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in flow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a boy.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just don't want the bags to burst.
[SPEAKER_05]: The plates are so, check out what I found
on the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, that's just blow out, blow out from
the last one.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: Feel like it should have been a little
hotter.
[SPEAKER_01]: For that size, huh?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're double the amount.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's still squeezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a longer press then, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Still squeezing.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one's hard to get down, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, and I just really don't want to blow
it out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or fucking knock it over.
[SPEAKER_01]: Got two challenges against you.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm really watching the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's flowing there.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's flowing.
Yeah,
[SPEAKER_01]: you got to, this is a two man press right
here.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's as tight as I can get that thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's a workout, huh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, without like, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's no leverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's no leverage.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the, that's the issue.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, there's no leverage.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm getting too old for this shit,
Pete.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's why you got it?
[SPEAKER_04]: Pete, stick it in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That looks like a big old tongue,
huh?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, it looks good though.
[SPEAKER_04]: It came out good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice, no blow too.
[SPEAKER_05]: No blow in the back.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, no, you're good.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm going to go for maybe another like 30
seconds.
[SPEAKER_05]: Maybe 20.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it comes out and then it cools.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that's why it stopped.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That stuff's probably almost stable
already.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: All these gloves.
[SPEAKER_07]: Circulation.
[SPEAKER_07]: You can scoop it up.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's all here.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to try to taffy yours,
right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You're just ready to do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's doing that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Sorry, I'm going to call that good.
[SPEAKER_07]: I can feel right now that there's still a
lot left in the bag.
[SPEAKER_07]: Dude, my arms like totally, like jelly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You were putting pressure, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: It was no joke.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's heavy duty.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would get tiring after quite a bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: But for a home use, someone who doesn't
have a lot of material to press,
[SPEAKER_01]: you'll get over it.
[SPEAKER_07]: I take it back.
[SPEAKER_07]: That's pretty damn good, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: That thing spit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that block at the front.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, they're in that bag.
[SPEAKER_01]: That big bag there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little soft.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so 19 and a half went in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Let's see what it's left.
[SPEAKER_07]: It feels pretty thick, but it also feels
like we got a lot out.
[SPEAKER_07]: So 19 and a half went in.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's four and a half left.
[SPEAKER_07]: So 19 and a half minus four and a half.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's 15 divided by 19 and a half.
[SPEAKER_07]: Exactly the same 76.
[SPEAKER_07]: Nailed it.
[SPEAKER_07]: 77.
[SPEAKER_07]: Actually, it's just under 77.
[SPEAKER_07]: So yeah, we crushed it again, dude.
[SPEAKER_07]: 20 grammer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this is a wet one.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at her.
[SPEAKER_01]: She's wet and gooey.
[SPEAKER_01]: This would be go right in the jar.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is perfect for that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go in the jar.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'd let it sit for like two days and then
I'd whip the hell out of it and then it
[SPEAKER_07]: would be like nice creamy consistency like
peanut butter.
[SPEAKER_08]: After you whip it, you can smoke it
immediately and it'll last like that for
[SPEAKER_07]: like a solid month and it just doesn't
change much consistency.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't separate.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's just what I notice has the longest
shelf life for one type of consistency.
[SPEAKER_07]: You get the chocolate set, but then it'll
tend to get way chocolatey within a week
[SPEAKER_07]: or something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: What about the stage before you whip it?
[SPEAKER_07]: How long can that last?
[SPEAKER_07]: I mean, it won't even much.
[SPEAKER_07]: It'll stay exactly the same if I left it
there for probably a month.
[SPEAKER_07]: It doesn't really change much.
[SPEAKER_07]: It changes a little bit.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's so hard.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one, it needs to cool off before you
can touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just going to get all the gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did you tap me mine?
[SPEAKER_01]: It got really wet again, so I had to put
it down.
[SPEAKER_07]: Was that yours and this one mine?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: That was yours.
[SPEAKER_01]: I haven't touched it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, you haven't touched it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that these gloves are tappy,
it's not as fun.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, no, no.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is when you just swap gloves because
it's sticky.
[SPEAKER_07]: FYI, for all you kids watching out there,
always change your gloves.
[SPEAKER_01]: Have hundreds on hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Have hundreds on hand.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to home depot.
[SPEAKER_07]: Go to Costco.
[SPEAKER_07]: Or buy alcohol and try to clean them.
[SPEAKER_07]: Get the right sizes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your fingers get sticky, everything's
going to get sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's just the way it works.
[SPEAKER_07]: Makes everything a hassle.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have any more, huh?
[SPEAKER_07]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You hear that?
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm turning the press off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're saving electricity.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good job, press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's hear it for the press.
[SPEAKER_01]: Ultimately, they're going to finish
differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're going to cure differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different textures, different heats,
everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Same material, though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different techniques.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's what's cool about hash and raws.
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody can be creative with their own
techniques to create the hash and then to
[SPEAKER_01]: press the hash.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a difference.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hitting that big number in there in the
70s, that's a great number.
[SPEAKER_01]: Depending on the type of material you're
trying to create, I'd shoot for the 60s
[SPEAKER_01]: and 70s range.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, on my press, that's what this
was at home.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one hits 67.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like this texture where I can actually
use my fingers and not be so sticky on me.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's definitely sticky.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, it's a preference of what you like
to do, how you like to work, what's your
[SPEAKER_01]: style.
[SPEAKER_01]: Don't let somebody tell you you're doing
it wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, it's your choice, man.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone skateboards differently.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hopefully, they can tell you a better way
or another way versus you're doing it
[SPEAKER_01]: wrong.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the easy way out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't like to tell people, hey,
dude, your shit sucks because that's not
[SPEAKER_01]: the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, we don't have any.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry doesn't have any industrial
scale hash makers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really, at this point, does it?
[SPEAKER_07]: There's some like Whistler Tech and those
guys are blowing up.
[SPEAKER_07]: Those machines are massive.
[SPEAKER_07]: There's a guy standing on a stairway,
dumping.
[SPEAKER_07]: Really?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, it's insane.
[SPEAKER_07]: It looks like a mousetrap like that board
game we used to play.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it just like the same process but at
scale?
[SPEAKER_07]: It's massive.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's almost like a giant distilling thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you go wrong there, the stakes are
much higher, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, but they're probably processing huge
outdoor farms, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_07]: Biomass.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah, biomass.
[SPEAKER_01]: I wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's not going to be anywhere near the
quality of these personal grows with
[SPEAKER_07]: personally made.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, you probably could.
[SPEAKER_07]: You probably have to cut down like a 20
lighter.
[SPEAKER_07]: It's a different process.
[SPEAKER_07]: The amount of money that you're throwing
into that thing.
[SPEAKER_07]: You better hope that machine works right.
[SPEAKER_07]: You better hope your returns go good.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're risking a lot of monetary loss.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys did awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was such a hands-on demo.
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll finish off where we started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you to the 50 people who tuned in.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's absolutely crazy.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm like, wait, it's 11 already?
It's almost midnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to stop this.
I'm going to stop this.
I'm going to stop this.
I'm going to stop this.
I'm going to stop this.
