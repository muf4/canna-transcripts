[SPEAKER_00]: So many people are starting to try to
tractor and monocrop cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: I almost feel like on a certain level it's
almost unpharmaceuticalizable or
[SPEAKER_00]: uncorporatizable in a certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Although there will be big farms that
figure out how to do it organically
[SPEAKER_00]: without the use of pesticides,
it's a really difficult plant to know and
[SPEAKER_00]: to have a relationship with and to
control, especially as you're growing it
[SPEAKER_00]: on a bigger level.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think those that try to go too
big, the plant's going to humble them out
[SPEAKER_00]: and throw them some bradma heights.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, you remember Vegas and you know New
West Summit and all these places.
[SPEAKER_01]: You show up at these VC conferences and
it's like, they're like, look how easy it
[SPEAKER_01]: is to grow cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's like, use my machine.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, watch this, watch this happen.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're mechanizing everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: And the idea is it's like, who needs a
farmer?
[SPEAKER_01]: They don't even call us, VCs don't even
call us farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: They call us operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, dude, that's the biggest
disrespectful thing you could ever say.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're operators.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, that's why they're out of touch and
that's why they're not going to succeed.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're seeing it daily.
[SPEAKER_01]: These people are coming in and saying,
well, I thought there was a lot of money
[SPEAKER_01]: in this.
[SPEAKER_01]: I make my money selling cannabis,
I lose it growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like every day because there's
something else that I'm doing,
[SPEAKER_01]: whether or not that's mortgage or new
water pumps or storage or any of the
[SPEAKER_01]: various things.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like a whole life dedication.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's why it's really, really
important now that these small micro
[SPEAKER_01]: branded farmers get access to market.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really important that we don't
come to a market like this, which is,
[SPEAKER_01]: this market is built on relationship
building principles.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is so everyone can meet everyone.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's really important that let's say
like, oh, you're in here, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: offering testing packages to people.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all that's going on.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's not eight or 10 different testing
systems going in that everyone's like,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, were you tested?
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a word like, you know,
there's a word for how you were tested.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you're like, oh, well, we don't want
your medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, well, we do want this guy's medicine.
[SPEAKER_01]: We want this, you know, it's like back and
forth.
[SPEAKER_01]: There needs to be some type of unified
standard.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we're going to gain consistency in the
marketplace and we're going to have to,
[SPEAKER_01]: we're going to have to also shift the word
quality from what the lab results are to
[SPEAKER_01]: what the actual experiential is.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I was talking about that earlier.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, it's like, we have to move past
lab results.
[SPEAKER_01]: We had to move into like how the consumer
is feeling.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, yes, make sure the consumer is
not, you know, smoking like cracklays.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, let's do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: But then when we get into like the actual
quality, when we talk quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not all sterile lab environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, no, by no means.
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I appreciate that you brought that up
too, because, you know, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think one of the big disservices that
labs actually brought into this community,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, in this lead up to regulation
where there was really no demand of
[SPEAKER_00]: testing, you know, is, you know,
a lot of dispensaries and a lot of people,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of patients kind of almost got
hoodwinked and thinking that highest
[SPEAKER_00]: testing means best, you know, and that's
a, that's a really high as high as
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabinoid.
Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So, so, so, so not like, you know,
it's like, yeah, no, it's, and it's such a
[SPEAKER_00]: box in yourself in such a way with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's like, and, and, you know,
if you really want to get into quality and
[SPEAKER_00]: start understanding, like, you know,
testing provide, you know, small
[SPEAKER_00]: measurements to help in the overall
judging of quality, you know, and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, kind of to identify and
understand how much terpenes play a role,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, because terpenes in such a big
way and how much total terpene
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrations there, you know,
and, and how well you're able to preserve
[SPEAKER_00]: these mono terpenes, which boil off at
really low temperatures, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's like in such a big way are,
are what helps to, you know, to,
[SPEAKER_00]: to, to show and give tribute to how well
that plant was grown, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how well it was post harvested and dried
and cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you know, just the slight high bit
of temperature all of a sudden can like
[SPEAKER_00]: zap like, you know, cause anything you do
from the time you harvest the plant,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, it's like, the terpenes are
going away exponentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like, so, so I think in a big
way, like identifying, utilizing terpenes
[SPEAKER_00]: and understandings of how much terpenes
play a role in, in judging effect,
[SPEAKER_00]: they can help you as a tool almost more
than the cannabinoids, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, to incorporate into this metric
of, you know, helping to, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like almost like a wine grading system,
you know, cause like there are two metrics
[SPEAKER_00]: in this 21 kind of point matrix of like
judging quality from like terroir and soil
[SPEAKER_00]: and kind of, you know, like a nutrient
kind of regiments and like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: how well, how, you know, just these,
these, these different, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: quality indicators, you know, cause you
know, how well something was dried and
[SPEAKER_00]: cured, how, you know, the bag appeal,
you know, all these things, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: qualitatively play a major role in judging
quality, you know, whereas the
[SPEAKER_00]: quantitative things like cannabis,
you know, like testing, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: yeah, pesticide testing, certain things to
show and distinguish like that something
[SPEAKER_00]: is, you know, of quality and doesn't have
any public health risk components.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then, you know, terpenes and
cannabinoids are more like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I like to describe them as almost like
they're the data points to help provide a
[SPEAKER_00]: language of meaning and understanding to,
to help incorporate into your
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of judging quality and also
navigating effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: In so many ways, it's not about highest
THC or highest CBD.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, you know, the, the,
the, I think it's such, it's such a
[SPEAKER_00]: magical aspect of this plant is,
is how diverse it is across different
[SPEAKER_00]: strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, when it really comes down
to it, the cannabinoids are almost,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the ratio of cannabinoids are
what ultimately are going to be most
[SPEAKER_00]: effective for treating certain disease or
disorder.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's like one-to-one THC to CBD
is most effective now from GW
[SPEAKER_00]: pharmaceutical research, from all the,
you know, kind of anecdotal patient trials
[SPEAKER_00]: and feedback, you know, one-to-one seems
most effective for multiple sclerosis,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and so then whether or not it's
a one-to-one with high terpenoline or a
[SPEAKER_00]: one-to-one with high mircine is going to
then help to, so it's like, okay,
[SPEAKER_00]: my one-to-one for my multiple sclerosis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now I want to look for a more sedative,
sedative varietal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it'll be mircine or I'm going to look
for a more creative, inspiring cerebral,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is the terpenoline, you know,
and so.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's really important in identifying
appellations, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because when you talk about testing for
terpene, we talk about the full
[SPEAKER_01]: expression, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The word expression comes in.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, how is the plant expressing
itself full?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like, is my sour diesel expressing
itself full?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a mile and a half from the ocean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You know what I'm saying?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like it expresses itself like water.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whether it's going in or out,
we see, we see in certain areas,
[SPEAKER_00]: certain strains show, you know,
like huge expressed, more concentrated
[SPEAKER_00]: amounts and certain terpenes, you know,
kind of show up in more amounts,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, whenever it's going into the sun
versus the same plants grown indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Can you give me a specific example?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you know, just, you know,
just on the most basic example,
[SPEAKER_00]: you blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's really interesting is a blue dream.
[SPEAKER_00]: So blue dreams, typically a mircine
dominant alpha pinin co-dominant strain.
[SPEAKER_00]: And whenever the same plants grown
outside, you see alpha pinin almost
[SPEAKER_00]: double.
[SPEAKER_00]: And become co-dominant or oftentimes like
slightly more dominant than the mircine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so I think certain terpenes like
pinin might have the ability when grown
[SPEAKER_00]: outdoor to produce themselves in much more
significant concentrations.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but then overall to just total
terpene concentration, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: like you were just pointing out with
sourdee.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, can sourdee as a genetic get
its full potential in its expression
[SPEAKER_00]: whenever it's grown in a slightly improper
environment that doesn't allow it the
[SPEAKER_00]: ability to finish off and to, to explode
out the last bit of terpene concentration,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, so I mean, I think, you know,
any, you know, any of it's going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: amazing, you know, as long as it's dried
and cured well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, but just to really see the way that
certain ablations and growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, certain, you know, environmental
conditions, you know, when that plant pops
[SPEAKER_00]: and then when you see it's terpene total
concentration, like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: 40% higher than when it was grown with
indoor.
So,
thank you very much.
