[SPEAKER_00]: How I ended up where I ended up.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my family's in conventional agriculture
and I spent some time in cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: My family gave an opportunity to treat the
alfalfa fields essentially.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I found myself looking for Dragonfly
Earth medicine products at Forever
[SPEAKER_00]: Flowering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I talked to Eric and he just bluntly
told me very clearly, he's like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you should find this Elaine lady.
[SPEAKER_00]: And just go listen to what she says and
just go find that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he said, this lady speaks,
but nobody really understands the depth of
[SPEAKER_00]: what she's talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's like, if you really want to brew
teas, don't follow recipes on the
[SPEAKER_00]: internet.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go find out how to use this microscope as
a tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: He says, if your family farms on the line
and this is serious, do this one thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was pretty fantastic advice,
you know, as far as opportunities even to
[SPEAKER_00]: create a business.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now my wife and I do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so just that phone call has turned
into, you weren't doing that.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, not as a job or career.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I was just trying to help out the
family farm and the family had kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: seen the end of the chemical road and it
was getting more expensive and less
[SPEAKER_00]: profitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was familiar with teas and I had
determined that there was something
[SPEAKER_00]: beneficial going on with Dragonfly and
Rocky Mountain Worm Company.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Eric seemed to know both of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I called Eric trying to find some of
the products so I could just copy what I
[SPEAKER_00]: was seeing, what seemed to be working.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was really, overwhelmed with the
process of a productive recipe because now
[SPEAKER_00]: we're not talking about fooling around the
garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're talking about like a family farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something, you know, is much deeper
going on there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I just wanted to find a concrete
answer that I could feel comfortable and
[SPEAKER_00]: rely on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so Eric said, if that's what you're
looking for, you need to just go find this
[SPEAKER_00]: woman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's been a pretty dramatic
career change.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just functionally wanted to learn how to
use the microscope as a tool and how to
[SPEAKER_00]: actually create this thing that this woman
said, this disease pressures reduction,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, all these things.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you quantify that so that I could
repeat that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And at that time, it was really difficult
to get in touch with that information and
[SPEAKER_00]: get in connection with that information.
[SPEAKER_00]: She would do three and five day workshops,
but that's like a trifold brochure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this woman's been doing this for
40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, in the beginning,
it was like a 10 week online.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could chat with her on Sunday and
watch some videos and that like introduced
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then she came out with the like 16
week module and that was a mind blower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And back when I went through, you had to
find her to learn the microscope and you
[SPEAKER_00]: had to do a two day, two day intensive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it was really difficult to even
learn the skill to quantify that this lady
[SPEAKER_00]: was even telling the truth.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it was hard to get to where you
could sit down and learn how to use the
[SPEAKER_00]: microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I went through it, I had to take a
two day workshop and then find somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: that knew how to use the microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I had to befriend somebody else
that was doing this microscope thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we could sit down for eight hours on a
Sunday and say, this is what this organism
[SPEAKER_00]: is.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is what this organism is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so now you can do an online class and
you learn to a deeper depth than I learned
[SPEAKER_00]: two years ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I've had to continually engage to
increase my tolerances and to stay
[SPEAKER_00]: statistically relevant with my math.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we do that periodically and we all
check each other's math, we all count the
[SPEAKER_00]: same sample.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we stay up on that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But now people are taking these videos and
working through what took me a year and a
[SPEAKER_00]: half to be comfortable to say my math is
correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it took about a year and a half
of fooling with the microscope to say my
[SPEAKER_00]: math is statistically correct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now you can take a 16 week class,
you can take the microscope class.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm seeing these younger guys,
they're really intelligent, finding it in
[SPEAKER_00]: six months and being good at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you know, the thing is evolving
faster than I can even watch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm just trying to be positive and be
proactive and be a part of that movement
[SPEAKER_00]: and, you know, try to help people become
self-sufficient because that's what this
[SPEAKER_00]: is all about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's why this is so far.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this information has been around
for 40 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: The basis of what I built my program on is
is a paper that Elaine wrote in 1987 and
[SPEAKER_00]: the organism to organism interactions and
how those affect plant growth on a biomass
[SPEAKER_00]: level.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they quantified these things.
So,
you know, that's what this is all about.
