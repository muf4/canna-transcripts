[SPEAKER_00]: So, over here we have a majority of our
vape collection.
[SPEAKER_00]: We start with things that use pods such as
the STIZI, we have the Pax Aera pods,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have a wide selection of select brand
vapes here.
[SPEAKER_00]: As you can see, they're extremely popular
for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we keep going through, we have things
such as our disposables and more
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridges, different various batteries,
battery attachments, and then we do have
[SPEAKER_00]: more concentrates, things like live resin,
sauces, shatters, what have you.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also included a few of our infused
pre-rolls in there too, to keep things
[SPEAKER_00]: separated from the ones that are just
flour only.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we keep going forward this way,
we'll have our flour cases here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, this will be things anywhere from
pre-rolls that are solely flour,
[SPEAKER_00]: as we discussed earlier, to prepackaged
apes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There actually are some brands that do
half ounce prepackaged, things of that
[SPEAKER_00]: nature.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we continue on, we do have our edibles
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, we started along here with our baked
goods.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have some Rice Krispies, some crackers,
some cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've also thrown in some juices in there
as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Really great for the summertime as it
starts to get hot now.
[SPEAKER_00]: As we continue forward, we move into our
chocolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Always a fan favorite, can't get enough of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Taras and the Kivas we've carried
forever have always been quite reliable,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it seems that Nug is really making
waves right now, really coming through
[SPEAKER_00]: with some high quality chocolates.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we move forward onto gummy candies
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things like Green Hornets, Kana,
Camino, District Edibles, Edipure,
[SPEAKER_00]: etc.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some of which are brand new and really
killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people have been around for years and
still just seeming to break through
[SPEAKER_00]: forever being popular in the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then we move forward to our CBD line.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have a bunch of different things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Select CBD products,
the Prokana CBD products, Papa and
[SPEAKER_00]: Barkley.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are really going to be staples for
us as the CBD becomes more and more
[SPEAKER_00]: popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: It could be the older generation,
but even the younger generation,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody seems to really be wanting that
CBD effect where they're not getting high
[SPEAKER_00]: throughout the day, but they really can
have a level of serenity and peace,
[SPEAKER_00]: pain free, whatever it is that they're
using the CBD for.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have things that are, I wouldn't
say novelty, but things like bath bombs or
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Things that are just extra fun and a
little bit different.
[SPEAKER_00]: We even have some CBD lip balm,
CBD tea bags, just different things out
[SPEAKER_00]: there that not everybody carries.
[SPEAKER_01]: I notice you have some displays.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have Honey over there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's past Honey?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the Toque brand.
[SPEAKER_01]: Toque, Honey, Candescent, Sensi,
and Plus.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do you decide which brands to throw a
display up for?
[SPEAKER_00]: There are some brands that it's a lot
easier to decide than others.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like the Plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: That one was a really simple one because
it actually eliminated a need to put them
[SPEAKER_00]: in the display case, saving us some room,
putting it on top.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was more of a saving space
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the Sensi Choose.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Candescent, they brought those over
where it says, you know, what do you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to feel?
[SPEAKER_00]: And it kind of gives more of an
explanation on their products.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason for that one is because we have
so many questions about the products from
[SPEAKER_00]: Candescent.
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the Calm do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the Connect do?
[SPEAKER_00]: What does the Cruise do?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that gives them a second while they're
wandering around to really figure that out
[SPEAKER_00]: without having to ask.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe they are shy to ask and they don't
want to seem stupid or whatever it is,
[SPEAKER_00]: even though there are no stupid questions
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, you just never know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that was kind of an easy one to feel
like, yeah, we should put that up there
[SPEAKER_00]: and really help the customers figure that
one out.
[SPEAKER_01]: How about the Honey Vape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Honey Vape over there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same as actually those two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing as before with the Plus.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just saving space for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Our cases are kind of limited and we have
so much product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was nice to be able to put a couple
of which on top, saving us some space
[SPEAKER_00]: inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: So a lot of brands fighting for not much
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: So can you talk about the decision making
process?
[SPEAKER_00]: So that really goes with what's like,
I mean, if you're already super popular
[SPEAKER_00]: and you're already, you know, helping us
out as far as, you know, we're selling a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of you, then we're going to give it a
little bit more space for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: So give me an example of those brands.
[SPEAKER_00]: Someone like Nug, their chocolates are
definitely really popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have all four of them out on
display, even though we could probably
[SPEAKER_00]: just put one or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the Select brand as you saw
earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: They take up quite a bit of space in our
vape case, but they are by far our most
[SPEAKER_00]: popular selling vape brand right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are, you know, so our customers can't
seem to get enough of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely think that that's
something that really helps, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: get us, get you in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's new?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's trending?
[SPEAKER_01]: What's declining?
[SPEAKER_00]: So trending a hundred percent.
[SPEAKER_00]: The second you said that, the first thing
that came to mind was Raw Garden.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those are right over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have not only the sauces and live
resins, but we also have the vape live
[SPEAKER_00]: cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I would say the cartridges are more so
trending right now than anything because
[SPEAKER_00]: it's their newer product, even though they
only have two products out right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: People come everywhere looking for
specific strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if they release a new strain and then
they put it on their Instagram,
[SPEAKER_00]: people will come here and be like,
do you have that one?
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw it on their Instagram or,
you know, I heard that they're going to be
[SPEAKER_00]: releasing full gram cartridges,
which is coming, I think this week.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the second we heard about that,
we got to make sure we got our order in
[SPEAKER_00]: because people are come specifically
looking for that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: The social media thing is really doing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, as far as trending, I would say Plug
Play.
[SPEAKER_00]: That brand is really like making waves and
killing it right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I didn't think that they
would be as popular when we first started
[SPEAKER_00]: carrying them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're right over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Plug Play.
[SPEAKER_00]: They make, it's called cartridges,
essentially, but they're using their own
[SPEAKER_00]: unique device.
[SPEAKER_00]: So kind of like the way that the Pax Era
or the Stizzy have that.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have their own device with their own
little pod cartridges.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing about Plug Play versus the other
brands is that their whole focus is to be
[SPEAKER_00]: really strong, like a dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get big hits, big clouds and that sort
of thing, but they taste great and people
[SPEAKER_00]: are loving them.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have a very limited menu,
just the pods and just the battery,
[SPEAKER_00]: and they don't have too, too many strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have what's called the DNA strains,
the daytime, nighttime, anytime,
[SPEAKER_00]: or they have the exotics, which are going
to be the fruity flavored ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's going on in the concentrate space?
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the concentrate space, what's really
popular?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that's funny because we were talking
about what's declining.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what's really declining is you're
not really seeing many people asking for
[SPEAKER_00]: things like crumble or even really
shattered quite as much anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people are really looking for anything
that's going to be super clean,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether it be live resin, the distillate
syringes, sauces.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, those are more popular for sure,
especially I would say the sauces,
[SPEAKER_00]: because they come with the most flavor and
you really get a full spectrum high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You get really, really good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So people do appreciate that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that implies a more sophisticated
user.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say that nowadays people are going
to be ripping up point out the dab.
[SPEAKER_00]: Every once in a while you will get that,
especially here, because our demographic
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't super young.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, I would say that we see that
more than any other shop.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it's not that likely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely, though, people are going to I
feel like they're becoming more
[SPEAKER_00]: connoisseurs now with these high end
products coming out because they don't
[SPEAKER_00]: want any of those chemicals or things that
they used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people used to not care about.
[SPEAKER_00]: But as far as like terpenes go and things
like that, the regular consumer is far
[SPEAKER_00]: more knowledgeable than they used to be.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's more so what they're looking
about is like the exotic strains or
[SPEAKER_00]: something that tastes really good versus
that something that's going to get them
[SPEAKER_00]: the most high.
[SPEAKER_01]: So even though you have an older
demographic, they are coming in here
[SPEAKER_01]: saying, I saw this on Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whether it be Instagram, sometimes weed
maps or, you know, because there really
[SPEAKER_00]: isn't a very much Facebook or anything
like that going on anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Instagram seems to be the head of social
media currently.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, even with our demographic,
we're still getting customers in here at
[SPEAKER_00]: that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, I would say the majority of
it is 35 and above.
[SPEAKER_00]: So a lot of the working class parents,
adults, just people in that age really,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and those people are super tech
savvy.
[SPEAKER_01]: So talk about, can you talk about weed
maps?
[SPEAKER_01]: Like, is it a love hate relationship?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's definitely things that we love
about weed maps because with weed maps,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you very rarely get a first time
customer who says that they found you from
[SPEAKER_00]: something other than weed maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's almost always going to be that,
oh, I was in the area and I looked on weed
[SPEAKER_00]: maps and you guys were there.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I saw you guys on weed maps.
[SPEAKER_00]: You had a coupon or, you know,
you had the product that I was looking for
[SPEAKER_00]: when I searched it into weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, weed maps is always great for
that type of a thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there are some things that
happened.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I wouldn't say that's necessarily weed
maps fault because, you know, sometimes
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll want to get a product verified on
weed maps, but that would be on the other
[SPEAKER_00]: company's end.
[SPEAKER_00]: You put it in hoping to, you know,
get a pending request to get it verified,
[SPEAKER_00]: almost like a celebrity would on
Instagram.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they go ahead and confirm,
yes, we do supply that product in that
[SPEAKER_00]: store and they will confirm and verify it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the waiting game, I would say,
is a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even so with the coupons, you know,
you put in the coupon and then you got to
[SPEAKER_00]: wait for weed maps to approve it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that can take anywhere from 24 to
72 hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a lot of just a waiting game
situation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But besides that, weed maps is so helpful.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you don't, you know, there's a
couple things here and there like they
[SPEAKER_00]: have illegal shops on it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's always not fun for us, you know,
because we try so hard to do everything we
[SPEAKER_00]: can to be by the books.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're, you know, you know, I personally
have not.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure if upper management has,
but it's definitely something that,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we're not appreciative of for
sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we we like to keep it with only
legal shops on the site for sure.
[SPEAKER_01]: And how many like when you go and search
on weed maps, how many illegal shops do
[SPEAKER_01]: you see in your kind of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you know, I wouldn't say that I like
go and spend a lot of time searching for
[SPEAKER_00]: that to be totally fair.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, there was one that we did
notice pop up the other day, this other
[SPEAKER_00]: store, and we went on weed maps and lo and
behold, there they were.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was all, you know, it just it always
happens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It is what it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: But on the other hand, they drive in like
98%.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why that's why it totally is love
and hate, because like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: you don't really get first time customers
who said that they found you any other
[SPEAKER_00]: way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I have a question about the more
discriminating user with concentrates.
[SPEAKER_02]: Does that attitude translate over the
flower or people more discriminating about
[SPEAKER_02]: their flower?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So and it's going to fall into the same
category.
[SPEAKER_00]: The people who are going to be just as
much of connoisseurs about their
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrate, they're going to be the same
way with their flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you see more of a split, I think,
with the flower than you do with the
[SPEAKER_00]: concentrates.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's just solely because
concentrates right now, especially people
[SPEAKER_00]: like raw garden are able to deliver high
quality at a decent price, whereas with
[SPEAKER_00]: flower, it's still really scattered.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're still able to get, you know,
we have twenty dollar eights, but they
[SPEAKER_00]: might not be quite as great quality as our
forty dollar eights.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's still a little bit of a barrier
with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, yeah, I would say that definitely we
have people super knowledgeable when they,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, they come in usually knowing
what they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: They usually are asking to see THC
percentages and things like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is something that, you know,
years before was unheard of.
[SPEAKER_00]: People never even understood, let alone
knew what they were talking about when it
[SPEAKER_00]: came to things like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it is really interesting to see how
much the consumer's knowledge has evolved.
[SPEAKER_02]: So then the next obvious question is,
is that as you're paying attention to
[SPEAKER_02]: this, it has to influence your decision
about what you're going to stop and what
[SPEAKER_02]: you're going to decide.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_02]: Has it evolved like in the last year?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's kind of hard because we're
always trying to find the best quality at
[SPEAKER_00]: the best price because there's always the
taxes to filter in as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So customers will come in hoping to get,
you know, a thirty five dollar eight.
[SPEAKER_00]: And occasionally they still are unaware of
the fact that, you know, a thirty five
[SPEAKER_00]: dollar eight is going to bounce them up to
whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Forty eight dollars, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's about finding that
balance majority of the time, because I
[SPEAKER_00]: mean, we have our like I said,
our most expensive eights are forty
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars, but we don't have quite so so
many of them because of the fact that with
[SPEAKER_00]: tax they're already going to come out to
about like fifty something dollars,
[SPEAKER_00]: fifty six dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, yeah, at the end of the day,
it's always about finding the best
[SPEAKER_00]: possible stuff at the best possible price.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: With concentrates, how many people come in
for brand specific product?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're seeking a specific brand.
[SPEAKER_00]: With concentrates, I think more so than
flour, 100 percent, because people are
[SPEAKER_00]: used to the concentrate world being being
branded already from the beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was already kind of a branded
situation, whereas the flour market was
[SPEAKER_00]: always based off dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, back in the day, it was just
grabbing out of a giant jar and putting it
[SPEAKER_00]: into a container for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas now you're going by brand and
that's something that they're not used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So much opportunity.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: So get back to flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what what is your I'm thinking indoor,
outdoor, top shelf mids like what what is
[SPEAKER_01]: your you're kind of an affluent
neighborhood.
[SPEAKER_01]: So what do they consider top shelf?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, at this at this shop,
like I said, our most expensive are the
[SPEAKER_00]: forty dollars and those are our legacy
eighths, the legacy strain eighths.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those ones, I love those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones are definitely going to be the
top right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not an affluent area right here.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is not this is not what you would
say.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like affluent.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like it's creeping northward,
but it's yeah, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I mean, with that in mind and I don't
want to say they're the top like they're
[SPEAKER_00]: the best stuff we have.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the most expensive definitely at
our highest price point.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Dank Republic, our house brand,
those ones range from thirty dollars to
[SPEAKER_00]: forty dollars.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have all sorts of, you know,
varieties, whether it be, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: highest ones testing at like twenty nine
percent THC to down to I think we have
[SPEAKER_00]: like a seventeen or something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's kind of our range there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we try to keep it that way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because like I said, everybody is becoming
kind of a connoisseur now.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're going to come in.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your highest testing THC?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or can I see that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's the THC percentage on that?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's going on with it?
[SPEAKER_00]: One day was it packaged?
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, very meticulous about what
they're looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I mean, they're all indoor with
those ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also carry a bunch of the outdoor
strain or outdoor grown brands like
[SPEAKER_00]: Flocana.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones are quite popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those ones are nice because they take
from different farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So people do like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because they are getting a variety,
even if it's, you know, similar strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like once we had a sour diesel,
we also had a super sour diesel.
[SPEAKER_00]: But because they came from different
farms, they were super different strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: That was really exciting for a lot of our
customers, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: What else do we carry?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have the Emerald Family Farms.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are another nice outdoor one from up
north.
[SPEAKER_00]: People really do enjoy those.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they work with their sister company,
Loyal.
[SPEAKER_00]: So those ones and another one that people
really enjoy of the outdoor, the outdoor
[SPEAKER_00]: grown.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those ones usually go from anywhere
for like twenty eight dollars to twenty
[SPEAKER_00]: five dollars on the eighth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So super reasonably priced.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is the price pressure downward?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like, oh, it's always down to pressure
down.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like people want cheaper.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it seems like right now that's
really what people are looking for.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, I really think it's
because of the tax situation, because,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, we have a lot of the time people
are trying to bulk up and get as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: they can.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, and then they hear that
it's going to be like three hundred
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars or something like, oh,
no, let's kind of take it back or let's
[SPEAKER_00]: find something else that we can do
instead.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or, you know, but that's why we always
like to offer things like our deals here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like with our our house brand,
the Dank Republic brand, we do have a deal
[SPEAKER_00]: where we offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's on our board, actually, I believe,
eight eighths, eight eighths to the price
[SPEAKER_00]: of six.
[SPEAKER_00]: So things like that we always try to offer
so they still can get quite a bit for a
[SPEAKER_00]: better deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: Talk about now let's go from the consumer
side to the the back end dealing with
[SPEAKER_01]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: It seems like supply is tightening up,
meaning there's less flour passing
[SPEAKER_01]: testing, which means less concentrate,
less flour, less everything, which means
[SPEAKER_01]: prices would logically go up.
[SPEAKER_01]: So are you seeing an uptick in the prices
that whether it's a flour brand or a
[SPEAKER_01]: concentrate brand or an edible brand?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'm actually really not too
much, to be honest with you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm you know, it's a really wide range of
price points, whereas whether it be the
[SPEAKER_00]: prepackaged bud, which is normally what
you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to be honest with you, I'm not seeing
an increase that much unless it's somebody
[SPEAKER_00]: who is really like really really popular
in the market, but usually somebody who's
[SPEAKER_00]: like really popular based off like I don't
know if the good word for it is hype.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just getting a lot of whether it
be social media or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're just getting a huge following so
they feel that they can put their price
[SPEAKER_00]: point up super high that, you know,
they're worth it, even if it might not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but I really am not seeing too much
of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: People are really trying to be competitive
right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many different distributors do you
deal with?
[SPEAKER_00]: Us?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, God.
[SPEAKER_00]: I couldn't even tell you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to say 50 something.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that means they are in competition with
another.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they they're really I mean,
really competitive prices.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like more so than not.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're all looking for market share.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mm hmm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, everyone's fighting for shelf
space.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless they happen to get an exclusive on
something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: In flower, what kind of like is cookies
all the rage?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like what's funny about that is that
cookies was very popular up north for
[SPEAKER_00]: quite a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know if it still is now,
but right right now in this area,
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel like everybody's super satiated
with Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're seeing so much glue everywhere,
back and forth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I feel like everyone in L.A.
[SPEAKER_00]: is kind of sick of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's funny is that sick of Gorilla Glue?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Gorilla Glue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to say the cookie space I
think has come and gone already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's where we're getting to
with Gorilla Glue now is the bear with the
[SPEAKER_00]: end of the Gorilla Glue and everyone's
sick of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're starting to pass us by here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So where's the hype now?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's funny is that everybody always
at least in this area predominantly,
[SPEAKER_00]: everybody really was looking for the OG
really heavy Indica was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And normally what we're seeming to find is
a lot more hybrids, not quite so many of
[SPEAKER_00]: the heavy Indica strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's always I always think that's
kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because that's what people really
want.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's interesting to see that there's
not too much of it right now.
[SPEAKER_02]: What other major trends are you seeing
that you could speak to?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I definitely think just in general,
the micro dosing world as far as edibles
[SPEAKER_00]: is really trending right now because
people are wanting to medicate all day
[SPEAKER_00]: without feeling slumped or maybe without
other people in their lives knowing that
[SPEAKER_00]: they're high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, that helps a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was going to say I could show you
what I was talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: So micro dosing, we have the Petras.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are 2.5 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_02]: Petras are tasty too.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And those ones we just got.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we just got a couple of new flavors of
those as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, the 2.5 milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's really nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: We also have the Doses Mints.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're kind of like an oral orange tic
tac.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those, again, are only about two
milligrams per piece.
[SPEAKER_00]: But in general, those type of things are
really becoming popular, like I said,
[SPEAKER_00]: because people can use it throughout the
day, whether they're, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: at home, at work, maybe just take the edge
off of some stress relief, something like
[SPEAKER_00]: that without feeling overwhelmingly high
or anything like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, those are very popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I mean, edibles in general are ranging
from 10 to five milligrams.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for not I don't want to say everybody,
but for a lot of people, five milligrams
[SPEAKER_00]: is still pretty pretty micro dose.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you guys going to start delivery soon?
[SPEAKER_00]: Hopefully soon.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not sure about dates on that,
but we definitely have talked about it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, are you free to talk a little bit
about like how many people you do a day or
[SPEAKER_02]: what the range is?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's in the 200s, but I'm not exactly sure
on a specific number.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's still more of a great thing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Talk to me a little bit about my favorite
product, pre-rolls and what you're seeing
[SPEAKER_02]: happen in pre-rolls.
[SPEAKER_00]: Pre-rolls are really becoming more and
more popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it's because of the
convenience factor about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everybody wants something that's ready to
go, ready to smoke right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, the fact that they can just,
you know, kind of keep it in your pocket.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's ready.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we have things like our our house
pre-roll packs, these little black boxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones I really like as far as like
what I was saying earlier about just being
[SPEAKER_00]: able to throw it in your pocket,
throw it in your purse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing will break.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't have to worry about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they're ready to go for whatever it is
to the beach, to a concert, just life in
[SPEAKER_00]: general.
[SPEAKER_00]: I really enjoy those.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's cool is that we also have things
like the Candescent flight pack.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you already are familiar with
Candescent and you've only tried maybe one
[SPEAKER_00]: or two, you haven't tried the other ones,
that's a great way to go because that
[SPEAKER_00]: includes one of every kind of their
joints.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the whole thing, too,
is I always talk about how I really think
[SPEAKER_00]: that the cannabis industry and the kind of
craft beer industry are super similar.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, we're all doing things like
that, you know, where you could get a beer
[SPEAKER_00]: flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get a joint flight.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I really enjoy that kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I love about them also is they're
such a malleable product.
[SPEAKER_02]: They have infused products infused with
different ones.
[SPEAKER_02]: You can use top flour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then also, they're all different
sizes.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you have like a really high T,
so you can have a look much smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's funny that you say that because
with our half gram, five dollar joints,
[SPEAKER_00]: I always refer to that as a personal size
joint because I feel like it's perfect for
[SPEAKER_00]: just one person.
[SPEAKER_00]: Smoke it by themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're good to go.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then they can continue.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas the ten dollar full gram joints,
you could definitely share that with a
[SPEAKER_02]: friend or something if you want to like
gender wise or anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Are there any like, you know, things that
you see like, you know, and it's
[SPEAKER_02]: demographic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there are definitely are some things
for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like so when you're kind of in the like,
I want to say like 30 to 50 mom category,
[SPEAKER_00]: that's where you're getting a lot of
things like convenience, pre rules,
[SPEAKER_00]: disposable vape pens, stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, as far as that same age range,
but with men, I get a lot more of just
[SPEAKER_00]: like the cartridges, like the one gram
cartridges, things like that, more into
[SPEAKER_00]: things that have to do with like
technology.
[SPEAKER_00]: So lots of like the batteries and the pods
and things like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you're a mom, is discretion also
important?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I would say so.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think that's why the disposable pens
are so much more popular for that typical
[SPEAKER_00]: area, because they're small and skinny.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't really look like anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then as soon as you're done,
you can throw away the evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that's why that becomes super
popular.
[SPEAKER_00]: Same with the pre rules.
[SPEAKER_00]: As soon as you're done, you could just
throw it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's gone.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's no evidence.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, as far as the older
crowds go, whether it be male or female,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's really just about the buds or
the vapes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Vapes have become very popular for the
older generation.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think because a lot of the flour that
we're smoking nowadays is a lot stronger
[SPEAKER_00]: than certain things that they were smoking
before.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because of that, the vapes,
I think, are a nice kind of ease into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can really control your high
better with like one or two puffs.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, I feel like I can take a little bit
more or I need to cut back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Whereas when you're smoking just flour,
you might have gone too far without
[SPEAKER_00]: noticing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
