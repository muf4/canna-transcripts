[SPEAKER_00]: Je veux dire, ça démoralise l'esprit en
lui-même parce qu'il n'y a pas de nom sur
[SPEAKER_00]: lui-même.
[SPEAKER_00]: C 'est pas à dire que tout le monde doit
avoir un nom pour être intéressant.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mais tu veux savoir ce que tu penses.
[SPEAKER_00]: C'est tout ce que je veux dire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Et peut-être aussi la linéaire,
parce que la partie de l'histoire est
[SPEAKER_00]: intéressante.
[SPEAKER_02]: Le profil de terpènes, tu as besoin de
données.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tu sais, qu'est-ce que cette personne a
fait pour moi ?
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, c'est là que ça vient.
[SPEAKER_02]: C'est le problème, ils ne pensent pas...
[SPEAKER_02]: C'est que l'origine est tout.
[SPEAKER_02]: C'est la guidance vers la qualité.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mais ils veulent simplifier tout.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cette plante est tellement compliquée qu
'on a besoin de la simplifier.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mais si tu la simplifies trop
profondément, ça devient une
[SPEAKER_02]: misinformation.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tu sais ce que je veux dire ?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oui, il y a des plantes qui sont plus...
[SPEAKER_02]: relaxantes et élevées.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mais c'est comme ça, ce qui fait ça,
ce n'est pas de la merde.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ce n'est pas Sativa Indica, c'est une
terre.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tu sais ce que je veux dire ?
[SPEAKER_02]: Donc, si tu ne expliques pas ça aux gens,
c'est littéralement aromatherapie.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tu as besoin de gens... C'est pas... C'est
une autre chose avec les herbes
[SPEAKER_00]: canadiennes, c'est qu'elles radient,
ou qu'elles radient pour prendre les
[SPEAKER_00]: microbes, qui prennent toutes les
terpènes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Mais même à la drogue psychoactive,
si tu n'as pas de terre, pour les apporter
[SPEAKER_02]: dans ton système de sang, c'est la seule
chose qui les caractérise.
[SPEAKER_02]: Et puis, ça modulera toute l'expérience
dans ton récepteur.
[SPEAKER_02]: Si tu n'as pas de terre, qu'est-ce qui se
passe ?
[SPEAKER_02]: Comment tu les ingénie ?
[SPEAKER_00]: C'est une partie de la dilatation de tes
cellules et de ton neurologie.
[SPEAKER_00]: C 'est les terpènes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Et maintenant, il y a des gens qui se
battent contre les entourages effets.
[SPEAKER_02]: J'ai eu un mec qui s'agissait de moi sur
les entourages effets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Il m'a dit, donnez-moi des littératures
qui promotent les entourages effets.
[SPEAKER_02]: Avez-vous entendu parler d'un mec qui s
'appelle Ethan Rousseau ?
[SPEAKER_02]: Regarde son livre !
[SPEAKER_02]: Il va te dire tout ce qu'il veut.
[SPEAKER_00]: Il y a une très longue littérature,
pas seulement... Mais je veux dire,
[SPEAKER_02]: ne me donnez pas un article qui n'a pas de
base scientifique, qui vous apporte votre
[SPEAKER_02]: position, quand vous n'avez pas encore
vérifié la littérature.
[SPEAKER_00]: J'ai parlé de ça pour toujours.
[SPEAKER_00]: Et ça s'arrête de l'herbalisme commun,
si tu apprends de la naturopathie ou de la
[SPEAKER_00]: médecine naturelle.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ils harvassent des herbes au matin pour
avoir plus de terpènes, et d'autres herbes
[SPEAKER_00]: herbales qu'ils vont utiliser.
[SPEAKER_02]: Je suis en train de faire ça ici,
pour harvester à la nuit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Ils me disent, pourquoi tu fais ça ?
[SPEAKER_02]: C'est parce que la plante n'utilise pas de
terpènes à la nuit.
[SPEAKER_02]: La plante ne sent pas après la nuit,
à 1h du matin, selon où tu es.
[SPEAKER_02]: Si elle sent, tu perds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Quand tu harvasses à 2h de l'après-midi,
c'est pas si bon.
[SPEAKER_02]: Tu dois arrêter.
[SPEAKER_02]: Au jour de la lumière, ça commence à... As
soon as the insect lives, the real life is
gone.
[SPEAKER_02]: They need to use it to control everything
around them.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at night, there is nothing happening.
[SPEAKER_02]: They block the function and they do
something else.
[SPEAKER_02]: The plant is so economic that it doesn't
need it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's preserving.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're taking it at a point when it's
kind of...
[SPEAKER_02]: And people were saying, why do you think
people harvest grapes at night ?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's because there is more conservation
than just because the pleasure of working
[SPEAKER_02]: at night.
[SPEAKER_00]: I hear a lot about a lot of farmers,
for the standpoint of production,
[SPEAKER_00]: will take the buds off of the branch and
put it on screens, and then put it into
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: The next bucket from there, but isn't
there something to buds or flowers being
[SPEAKER_00]: still on the stem and having it off ?
[SPEAKER_00]: Not necessarily a whole stock,
but for a period of time.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even just for the bag appeal, if your bud
stays on one side while it's dry,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's going to flatten up.
[SPEAKER_02]: Those leaves, are going to compress the
membrane of the resin head, they're going
[SPEAKER_02]: to break, everything is going to stick.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you trim, it's going to look like
shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: When you hang it, not only the plant is
still feeding, your drying is slower and
[SPEAKER_02]: everything, but you have buds that are
not... You haven't disturbed your
[SPEAKER_02]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_02]: When it's pressed like that, that part
that is compressed is not going to dry the
[SPEAKER_02]: same way than the ones that are...
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole air flow and stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: What are some of the things that you look
for in material to make it ?
[SPEAKER_00]: I know that you're looking for partly a
relationship with the farm and that makes
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of sense, but do you look at the
resin heads through a lens ?
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you do ?
[SPEAKER_02]: The color of your resin head is not going
to tell you how much resin is formed
[SPEAKER_02]: inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: The color, the shape, anything about a
resin head, a trichome gland has nothing
[SPEAKER_02]: to do with the flowering cycle of the
plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: They are excroissants that the plant
produces to protect itself or to capture
[SPEAKER_02]: pollen because it's wind pollinated.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not part of the main morphology of
the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need somebody to look at the main
metabolism of the plant, at the flower
[SPEAKER_02]: that they are growing, so that the peak of
the flower time is the peak maturity of
[SPEAKER_02]: the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you could look inside the resin head
and see how much resin is formed,
[SPEAKER_02]: yeah, but the color of a cultivar full
sun, or in the shade, or in the green
[SPEAKER_02]: house, or indoor, the color is going to
change.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the amount of UV-ray exposure that
does the coloring.
[SPEAKER_02]: It doesn't change the quality of the resin
produced inside, outside the coloring.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy that you have a whole industry
that base the peak of the flowering of the
[SPEAKER_02]: main metabolism of the plant on secondary
metabolism.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where do you get that ?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where is the science behind ?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean ?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like you grow flower.
[SPEAKER_02]: When somebody grow tomato or corn or any
agriculture, any agricultural product,
[SPEAKER_02]: do they look at the defense system of the
plant or do they look at what they are
[SPEAKER_02]: growing on that plant ?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean ?
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on guys.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even the fucking basics they don't get
because it's all based on misinformation
[SPEAKER_02]: and nobody ask for the science behind.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like because such and such say so,
and I see it on YouTube, that's it,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to fucking question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and just learn about trichomes and
the waxes and the lipids and everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I came here, I had 18 years of
experience with the tool, and I worked
[SPEAKER_02]: once a year, three, four months to make my
stuff.
[SPEAKER_02]: That was it.
[SPEAKER_02]: When I came here, I was good with the
tool, but because I realized that it was
[SPEAKER_02]: medicinal and stuff in my head,
I don't know what happened, but I saw it
[SPEAKER_02]: as a craft.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as a craftsman, there is two things,
the product and the tool, and the product
[SPEAKER_02]: defines the tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I realized that I was super fucking
good with tool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I could even do it with my bare hands,
but I didn't know what was the product.
[SPEAKER_02]: I called it pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had never seen a picture, a macro.
[SPEAKER_02]: I had no fucking idea what I was working
with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So here was not only to prove
[SPEAKER_02]: the depth of traditional production,
I needed to teach myself what I was
[SPEAKER_02]: working with.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what is a trichome?
[SPEAKER_02]: What's happening in the trichome?
[SPEAKER_02]: And then knowing how the cannabinoids form
each other and can transform each other,
[SPEAKER_02]: I can manipulate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now it's like, now I'm really good
because not only I have that 18 years
[SPEAKER_02]: experience in producing, but I know my
product.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you've tried different resins,
ones that are grown indoors, ones that are
[SPEAKER_00]: grown hydroponically.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you drawn towards a regenerative
living soil resin head?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything there for you?
[SPEAKER_02]: The pure, full expression of the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You don't have the tarp, you don't have
the shit.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the longevity of the resin after you
making it?
[SPEAKER_02]: I would need to experience cultivar for
cultivar.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is so much that I don't even fucking
know what happened when I aged my ash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like in the 18th century, the people
had been making wine for 8,000 years,
[SPEAKER_02]: but they didn't know what they were doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you see a difference in resin heads
from something grown in a greenhouse?
[SPEAKER_00]: As opposed to a full sun?
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's not in the resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because of the diffused light that might
come from the... No, for me it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: question of how much resin is formed
inside the resin head.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's like, when do you harvest?
[SPEAKER_02]: There is three days window.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you to the day if you
harvested early or late.
How?
[SPEAKER_02]: A resin head is made like a fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: There is an abscission under it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that abscission becomes smaller and
smaller and smaller, the riper the resin
[SPEAKER_02]: head is.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you cannot see it.
[SPEAKER_02]: But when I learned this, I realized that I
was actually shaking a fruit tree instead
[SPEAKER_02]: of shaking, agitating a plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: So when you have a fruit tree,
you want to have the ripest fruit or you
[SPEAKER_02]: go and smell it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or you just shake a tiny bit first time
and you have the ripest fruit.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then a tiny bit stronger and stronger and
stronger, and I wash my stuff 12 times.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I found out that flour with 28% THC,
the best sugar trim you can dream of,
[SPEAKER_02]: would give me like a big party of tricone
heads, but they're empty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Really?
[SPEAKER_02]: So you cannot have cannabinoid in the
resin head without the formation of the
[SPEAKER_02]: resin.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the closer you come to that three days
window, the more resin there is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right, which is going to be essentially
protecting that cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cannabinoid is almost volatile
without the resin behind it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, but it's like, how can you have
cannabinoid without the resin?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, I don't fucking get it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I know no one who can tell me what the
fuck is going on.
[SPEAKER_02]: Put that into science or numbers as well.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I know for a fact, because for the
past five years, every time I tell
[SPEAKER_02]: somebody, did you harvest early?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like two weeks, a week, la-la-li,
la-la, every time.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell you when it goes overboard,
I can see it, my temple balls.
[SPEAKER_02]: That resin head, it's the bibliography of
the life of the plant and its environment.
[SPEAKER_02]: And how you took care of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's the book I read.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been reading that book since I was 17
years old.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm 62.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I can tell stuff, even if I don't have
the science telling me the reason behind
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really bothering me a lot,
because when you see quality, and I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: almost getting there, but I don't know
what the last magical stuff is happening.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's part of the intuitive connection.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm totally dependent on my farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: To be able, the farmer need to look at the
flower and see that it is perfectly formed
[SPEAKER_02]: and at the peak of its flowering cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: And maybe harvest it at night.
[SPEAKER_02]: If possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: You need to give them the infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Working with big boy and big money,
as much as it really bothers me a lot,
[SPEAKER_02]: they give me the means to do stuff with
the farmer and to get the quality.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: And to connect with the plant on a deeper
level.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have two choices.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I go with the big boy who give me all
the tools, all the shit and the promo and
[SPEAKER_02]: the means to bring shit on the table at
the highest level.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or I hook up with small farmer that have a
little processing license at the same time
[SPEAKER_02]: on the farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I make little hub, because my machine
is only making now.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a production of my machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can make little hub, you know what I
mean?
[SPEAKER_02]: In the farm for the farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it doesn't have the same impact.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: There's still so much change happening
too.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's hard for people to get behind any one
thing at the moment.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't have a license.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't want to give money on something
that is provisory.
[SPEAKER_02]: That they can tell me, no, tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, you're not going to have it anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because ultimately it takes you away from
making good medicine, which is what you
[SPEAKER_00]: really want to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a point I... Just reading your shirt.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've never been a producer.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've been making ash all my life.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's part of what I do.
[SPEAKER_02]: But producing is like what's appealing to
it.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the quality I was making in
India, it took me three, four months,
[SPEAKER_02]: every year, to make my stash.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Every day.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the good thing about being an
annual farmer and not necessarily a
[SPEAKER_00]: perpetual harvest farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gives you a chance to connect with what
you've done for the year and see how to
[SPEAKER_00]: preserve something over the course of the
winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: But at the same time, it's like now,
at that time I saw that making quality in
[SPEAKER_02]: quantity wasn't something that an
individual could do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now I have a machine.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can spin a kilo of resin every eight
hours.
[SPEAKER_00]: How much starting material does it take?
[SPEAKER_02]: I can put five, six kilos of material in
just 50 gallons.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that's wet weight?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I do two loads a day in eight hours
with 10% return.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a really long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you do 12 spins within...
[SPEAKER_00]: In those few hours?
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on the trim.
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on what I want.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like if I discover something and I
want to find the melt, I'm going to do a
[SPEAKER_02]: bunch of small washes.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I know the farmer and the strain and I
know that these three, four first washes
[SPEAKER_02]: are like... In what bags?
[SPEAKER_00]: You put them together.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are you using all bags?
[SPEAKER_02]: I will do that first wash.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can define how strong I shake my tree.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the depth of my slice of ripeness
depends on that power I put in my
[SPEAKER_02]: agitation, in my shaking.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are you keeping the 90 and the 70?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't separate.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, just between 190 and 45?
[SPEAKER_02]: 45 to 160.
[SPEAKER_02]: I make it as wide as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Otherwise, you just have a slice of the
wall.
[SPEAKER_02]: I rather have it as wide as possible.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just put one ash on the market.
[SPEAKER_02]: If I put 70, 90 and 130, so what is what?
[SPEAKER_02]: What is the good stuff?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're all different on top of it.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you really check them, they're not the
same, obviously.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's something that... So in order for
you to work with a bunch of small farms,
[SPEAKER_00]: say in the California area, you'd have to
work with a processor or someone that has
[SPEAKER_00]: a license for distribution, is that
correct?
[SPEAKER_00]: If it's above.
[SPEAKER_02]: Here, because I need them to package my
farmer's flower so that they can put it on
[SPEAKER_02]: there.
[SPEAKER_02]: I need that support.
[SPEAKER_02]: For sure.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it's this market.
[SPEAKER_02]: For me, anyway, it's like my relation with
the farmer.
[SPEAKER_02]: After, when I give this to somebody,
that dude is between the patient and us.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have machines now?
[SPEAKER_02]: They're available.
[SPEAKER_02]: They're back.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's why I go to MGBSCA and they put it
back for the first time on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so you're going to go down there and
sort of be able to have it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Available.
[SPEAKER_02]: I needed it for me.
Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're talking a lot about Canada
because of Lachlan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, Lachlan, yeah, yeah,
totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know I've been getting to know him over
the years.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, and it's like... From Canada,
you can do shit that you cannot do here.
[SPEAKER_02]: I wouldn't trust a patent here.
[SPEAKER_02]: In Canada, it's different because it's
your country.
[SPEAKER_02]: Even if the plant is a Schedule 1,
it's recognized differently in Canada.
[SPEAKER_02]: It has much more value than a patent here.
[SPEAKER_02]: If they tell you, oh, but we did that when
the plant was illegal, you need to do it
[SPEAKER_02]: again.
[SPEAKER_02]: They can do that all day long.
[SPEAKER_01]: Sous-titrage ST'501
