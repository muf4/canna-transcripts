[SPEAKER_01]: Hello, we're here today at the Science of
Organic Regenitive Cultivation Conference
[SPEAKER_01]: in Southern Humboldt, California,
deep in the heart of the Redwoods,
[SPEAKER_01]: also known as the Cannabis Heartland.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm Craig Johnson, and we're here
today with a couple fellow farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Jared, and this is my wife,
Angela.
[SPEAKER_01]: Jared and Angela caught my eye the first
day of the conference.
[SPEAKER_01]: One of the presenters was up there,
and I saw Jared signing, and I thought
[SPEAKER_01]: that was something that was definitely
missing.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I didn't even realize, you know,
we think we have all these other barriers
[SPEAKER_01]: to entry with the cannabis world,
but I didn't think about the barriers of
[SPEAKER_01]: not hearing the words and the information
that is being shared.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says it's really nice that we're able
to come here and come educate ourselves
[SPEAKER_00]: and the information that's here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she says, and trying to help create a
language for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, she says the words match the
pictures of what's actually happening in
[SPEAKER_00]: the world and helping them get a better
picture of the cannabinoids, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: the molecules being stuck together.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says in trying to develop a language
that we're using it and we're testing it
[SPEAKER_00]: out to see how it works and if it helps
her understand better, and it really does
[SPEAKER_00]: help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it says, without the language,
I don't feel like I'm able to understand
[SPEAKER_00]: it, so I need to be able to develop that.
[SPEAKER_00]: For our cannabis industry and the science
behind it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's important.
[SPEAKER_01]: One thing I noticed, you started to spell
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would imagine with a lot of words like
cannabinoid, terpenes, endocannabinoid
[SPEAKER_01]: system, and now you didn't spell.
[SPEAKER_01]: Could you explain that a little bit?
[SPEAKER_00]: She says when I started spelling,
it just throws everything off.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I can't understand what we're talking
about.
[SPEAKER_00]: You lose me.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says the point is just to have the
language so it can flow smoothly,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, so we can have the conversation
and I can understand it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How would you say regenerative?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe the Rs into the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I have another one to ask you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that is, you know, in my mind,
the sign to go burn one would be this.
[SPEAKER_01]: What is your sign or is there a correct
sign or a slang sign?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's more slang.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not really appropriate for cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: The sign for smoking.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says it's very, very obvious to
everybody around that you're trying to go
[SPEAKER_00]: get high.
[SPEAKER_00]: You want to be discreet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis, you know, the outline of the
heart and that's more accurate portrayal.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love that.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you guys are here at the conference
learning and sharing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's your farmer or where do you even
have a cannabis farm or just vegetable
[SPEAKER_01]: farm?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are you guys up to?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, Applegate Valley.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said, we have a medical grow and a
farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, it's quality medicine and we built an
ecosystem and we feed the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: the earth and water.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says we have vegetables, but lots of
different types of vegetables and herbs
[SPEAKER_00]: and flowers in our gardens.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all companion cropped and keep bad
bugs away and keep the good bugs around.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, the integrated pest management.
[SPEAKER_01]: Amazing.
Amazing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you folks for sharing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she says you're more than happy and
you're welcome.
[SPEAKER_01]: And hopefully next year we can have
someone signing the entire conference and
[SPEAKER_01]: you can maybe share an update on your
work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the work doesn't happen without
people like you and me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And others here because we can't do it
alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, we're deaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a group of deaf people.
[SPEAKER_00]: I need voices for the voiceless that
without that support and this opportunity
[SPEAKER_00]: never happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: That made me think of another thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is there a farmer group or is there a
group or a website you can direct us to,
[SPEAKER_01]: to get more people involved from the,
uh, the side and the deaf community side?
[SPEAKER_00]: She says we're using a lot more resources
to help get the word out.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says, and raise awareness in that,
in the world and to be able to share this
[SPEAKER_00]: information with this world is such,
it's a unique opportunity and to be able
[SPEAKER_00]: to build a farm with them and show them
how to do it hands on, how to build an
[SPEAKER_00]: ecosystem and about pollinators and just
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing that goes into it, the bugs,
integrated pest management, teas,
[SPEAKER_00]: fermentations.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, and to be able to share that
opportunity, maybe one day our hope is to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to have a rec garden where we can
fly the deaf people in from all over the
[SPEAKER_00]: world where they can come here and they
can learn how to be able to farm organic
[SPEAKER_00]: medicine, you know, and just do it from
nature and work with us in a symbiotic
[SPEAKER_00]: relationship.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, it's really, really important.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautifully said.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what's the name of your farm?
[SPEAKER_00]: Homegrown organics.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says it's a combination of a couple of
different words.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says RX and then Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, and then organic in sign language,
it's homegrown or X.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's the Oregon, this is a sign for
Oregon.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you throw out the R and X.
[SPEAKER_01]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll have to work on that one a little
bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: One sign at a time.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's deaf community.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that brings me to another question.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it just the two of you or is your
community amongst partnerships like this?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, is there more of you together up
there?
[SPEAKER_00]: She says I have a small circle of deaf
friends that I grew up with that we came,
[SPEAKER_00]: they come and they helped us and we've
been learning together how to be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: At our home.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's been really nice to be able to
have that experience, to be able to share
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says the other deaf friends that live
up there in the state will go to
[SPEAKER_00]: dispensaries and they would drop off flour
for us when we're still available to a
[SPEAKER_00]: legal medical market.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they would come down to harvest and
learn how to build the soils and make
[SPEAKER_00]: those type of compost teas and how to be
able to trim, how to cure, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: package process.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says the business of it and try to
interpret the laws and the rules as
[SPEAKER_00]: they're evolving.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says there's so much to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: She says the deaf community is very
detailed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's quality in their work.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beautiful, beautiful.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, thank you guys for sharing your
story and we'll probably connect again,
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whether it's through your network that
you're sharing with us.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
