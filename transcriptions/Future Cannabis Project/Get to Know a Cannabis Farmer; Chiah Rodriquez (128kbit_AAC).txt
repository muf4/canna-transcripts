[SPEAKER_00]: So I've been farming cannabis for about 16
years on my farm and we are sun-grown
[SPEAKER_00]: primarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do organic farming like above and
beyond organic methods and we live in
[SPEAKER_00]: Redwood Valley, which is in Mendocino
County and our spot is really unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're up on the top of a hill and we have
amazing sunshine all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we don't really have a fog influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: So on our farm we grow a lot of strains
that do well without getting powdery
[SPEAKER_00]: mildew.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're pretty disease resistant and bug
resistant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And our little zone have a kind of a prime
location of sun all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my husband is a breeder and he's been
doing some of his own proprietary genetics
[SPEAKER_00]: for the last 20 years and at our farm for
about 16.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we focus on a couple of strains.
[SPEAKER_00]: One originally like a true kush.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we bred that in with a Romulan cross,
which we now we have at the true
[SPEAKER_00]: Barrymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she does really great.
[SPEAKER_00]: She doesn't get powdery mildew at all.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super strong indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that does really great at our place
and also some of her sister strains,
[SPEAKER_00]: other phenotypes of the same genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at like the blue whale is one of
our also one of our other proprietary
[SPEAKER_00]: genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with the lemon fire too,
which is a great lemon fire OG,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is a great sativa strain that does
super well in our area as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are kind of like our top strains,
I would say of our farm and things that we
[SPEAKER_00]: focus on with our brand, our can of
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we mix the natural soil with nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we also do pots, smart pots
around the property.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm doing some boxes this year and kind of
mixing it up a little bit, trying out some
[SPEAKER_00]: different methods.
[SPEAKER_00]: Are the boxes new?
[SPEAKER_00]: The boxes are brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's something that we haven't done
before, but we're having good luck with it
[SPEAKER_00]: with water retention and the plants are
happier.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're kind of doing more like hedge
rows this year and kind of doing like
[SPEAKER_00]: trellising over the top instead of our
usual bamboo method like we have been
[SPEAKER_00]: doing in the past.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's so far so good.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's working out pretty well.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we used to do, you know, we were in the
9.31 program in Mendocino County,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was an exemption program.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had the 10,000 square feet exemption
for our property.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we did that for a few years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this year we're still within the
10,000 square foot model.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we decided that we're going to shift
it up a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we can count our square footage by
the estimated circumference of how big the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant is going to get, which is kind of
who knows, you know, how do you estimate
[SPEAKER_00]: that from the beginning?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we do our best.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we kind of tried some other methods
to maximize square footage.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so far it's seems great.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we thought we were over 10,000 square
feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when we did all the counts,
we're actually only like 7,500,
[SPEAKER_00]: which was way more manageable for us.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's 10,000 square feet.
[SPEAKER_00]: We really need like three or four full
time people on that square footage farm.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a big job.
[SPEAKER_00]: 10,000 square feet like is 100 by 100,
but it's really not.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's spread out.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of different jobs to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's a lot of upkeep, as you know,
like as they get bigger and just trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: like keep up with them more than anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: So every time, every year has been a
little bit of a new experiment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We keep trying different methods and
figuring out what we like best and going
[SPEAKER_00]: with that and seeing how it works.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next year maybe wipe out one
method and go with what worked better.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're kind of narrowing that down and
also like seeing which plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: which genetics do better in the natural
soil mixed with the nutrients versus the
[SPEAKER_00]: smart pots and versus the box too.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think that a lot of our terracing was
kind of dug out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We live on the top of a not like a rock
knoll.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we had to create some soil in the
very beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So long, long time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it has kind of like maybe naturalized
is a good term.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know exactly, but we've sort of
like tilled in new stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And over the years we keep like adding to
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it has kind of created this sort of
like top soil in our garden, which was
[SPEAKER_00]: never there before.
[SPEAKER_00]: We sifted out thousands of pounds of rock.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just to get actual soil where we are.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that's how we started, which was a long
time ago.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now things are like really flourishing
and happy and doing good in that
[SPEAKER_00]: environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do compost tea brews mostly for like
good bacteria, not so much feeding.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I feel like a lot of our goodness
comes from the soil itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: This year we got a bad soil recommendation
that kind of went awry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so the soil, well, I'm not going to
get into names or whatever, but we had a
[SPEAKER_00]: soil mixture that we thought was a lot
stronger than it was.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the plants weren't doing that great.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were kind of like, what is going
on?
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe there's another issue.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we got into really looking at like
maybe there was something with some pests
[SPEAKER_00]: or something else.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started researching it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then my husband's like, I'm just going
to go back and look at the company where
[SPEAKER_00]: we got the soil from and really started
looking into it and did some tests on it
[SPEAKER_00]: and was like, oh shit, this doesn't have
anything in it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we started packing it, doing more top
dressing and packing it full more
[SPEAKER_00]: nutrients with the compost tea.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that seems to help a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it helps to mitigate other issues too
that plants really love it.
[SPEAKER_00]: That live bacterial brew.
[SPEAKER_00]: Go.
