[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, dang.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is it, Mac?
[SPEAKER_08]: What did you say it was?
[SPEAKER_08]: Mac, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not Mac 1, though.
[SPEAKER_08]: 2017, we got those seeds ran through.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want a little green hat?
[SPEAKER_08]: Some varieties have that food quality that
you just kind of want to eat some of it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you live where?
[SPEAKER_08]: I live in Covillo, Round Valley,
in Mendocino County.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just a few ridges over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, but it took a while to get here.
[SPEAKER_08]: It took a while to get here.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, all back country roads.
[SPEAKER_07]: So what did it introduce us to the lineup
that you brought?
[SPEAKER_08]: So most of these are velvet perps crosses.
[SPEAKER_08]: Velvet perps is a strain that I've been
developing for the past eight or nine
[SPEAKER_08]: years now, which came from a family strain
that we've been working with for a while.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a very purple, distinguished bud.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it definitely pops out.
[SPEAKER_08]: If you look at it and see it, there's not
much bud that looks like it.
[SPEAKER_08]: So it definitely gives you that eye
appeal.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's pretty crystal-y.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it smells really good.
[SPEAKER_08]: So most of these are just crosses of the
velvet perps.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I used the velvet perps and crossed it
with all the other varieties that I've
[SPEAKER_08]: been developing, too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I've been breeding for the past eight
or 12 years now.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what do you like about the velvet
perps that you want to experiment with in
[SPEAKER_07]: a bunch of different directions?
[SPEAKER_08]: I've found that it's very
disease-resistant and resilient to frost.
[SPEAKER_08]: And it's a pretty good vigorous plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So they get pretty good size.
[SPEAKER_08]: When it's trimmed all down, the pounds are
like, you know, this big.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're very dense buds and weighty.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it makes for a good production
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's why I wanted to cross it into
all of my other ones to make them stronger
[SPEAKER_08]: and, you know, just have more of a diverse
seed stock, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: And can the guy standing next to you try
it?
[SPEAKER_08]: Absolutely.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: You want to try the velvet perps?
[SPEAKER_08]: Or you want to try something else?
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you got that's kind of the most
uppity?
[SPEAKER_08]: Most uppity.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Maybe a velvet skywalker.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Don't forget another reason we crossed all
those vines is because we just wanted to
[SPEAKER_08]: create this whole velvet vine.
[SPEAKER_08]: The reason we crossed all these varieties
together with the velvet perps is so we
[SPEAKER_08]: could have a velvet line.
[SPEAKER_08]: Because I found out that, you know,
whenever we have the velvet perps in a
[SPEAKER_08]: dispensary, they always tell us that it's
the number one seller that they've ever
[SPEAKER_08]: had.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, it flies off the shelf quicker
than anything else.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good problem to have.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a good problem.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah, it's a lower THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's around like 17 to 18.
[SPEAKER_08]: So for overall, it's a good for everybody,
you know, if you don't want to get so
[SPEAKER_08]: super baked.
[SPEAKER_08]: But at the same time, it's a good overall
like day smoke and night smoke.
[SPEAKER_08]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is the velvet skywalker.
[SPEAKER_08]: Skywalker goo crossed with the velvet
perps.
[SPEAKER_08]: This is awesome.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're growing in the earth,
not even in pot beds?
[SPEAKER_08]: All in the earth.
[SPEAKER_08]: Raised beds that we sheet mulch and use
just local manure and our own manure that
[SPEAKER_08]: we produce on the farm.
[SPEAKER_08]: So everything's in the ground,
full sun, out of greenhouses, no plastic
[SPEAKER_08]: grown under on them or over them.
[SPEAKER_08]: So everything's as natural as we can do to
produce these beautiful plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we try to grow as large as we can.
[SPEAKER_08]: So most of them.
[SPEAKER_07]: So as large as you can.
[SPEAKER_07]: How many are you?
[SPEAKER_07]: Do you have a plant limit or a canopy?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's a canopy limit.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have two 5,000 square foot gardens.
[SPEAKER_07]: But you like to grow big plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, we like to grow big plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So one plant will grow one plant in a nine
by nine area.
[SPEAKER_07]: And what's the philosophy behind that?
[SPEAKER_07]: Because you don't do that, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: I do.
[SPEAKER_07]: You do grow as big as you can.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, we've always grown that way.
[SPEAKER_08]: Throughout regulations, it's always been
like, oh, only 25 plants.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we've always just been trying to
maximize.
[SPEAKER_07]: So that's kind of where my question's
going, which is now that you don't have
[SPEAKER_07]: that limit that you have to work around,
are you growing it because you think it's
[SPEAKER_07]: the best plant or because it's what you've
done for a long time?
[SPEAKER_08]: It's what I've done and what I know and
what I love to do.
[SPEAKER_08]: I like to see the full expression of each
plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: So having them out there for three full
cycles of the season, like spring,
[SPEAKER_08]: summer, and fall, the plant is in taking
all that information from the cosmos,
[SPEAKER_08]: from the soil, to producing all this
beautiful medicine.
[SPEAKER_08]: So that's what we really try to do is make
real medicine so that everybody can enjoy.
[SPEAKER_08]: And get excited about, you know,
that's what it's about.
[SPEAKER_08]: So what are your initial expectations?
[SPEAKER_00]: Me?
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a quiet excitement.
[SPEAKER_08]: To tell you the truth, I actually haven't
tried this cross yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'm excited to try it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, most of these are all new to me
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: So this is all like, I mean, I can only
smoke so much weed at a time.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I haven't really tried them all yet,
you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just bust these out for this little
conference here.
[SPEAKER_07]: So you have your personal joint roller
next to you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well, I got that same kind of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, when I'm going through a lot of
varieties, what gets hard for me is when I
[SPEAKER_02]: hit one that I love and all of a sudden I
just, I want to consume it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm like, yeah, but I should keep
going with all this other stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like, I find all of a sudden I realize
I haven't even tried.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that I've produced.
[SPEAKER_07]: It may not be what the market wants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_07]: And you're like, damn you people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, no, I see myself like going towards
like at least trying the things that
[SPEAKER_00]: people are hyping up or whatever.
[SPEAKER_03]: Hopefully from a couple sources.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I had a couple, three purple ones come
out.
Great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_03]: I knew it was the genetic.
[SPEAKER_03]: The genetics, not the temperature.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's definitely the genetics.
[SPEAKER_08]: The velvet perps, the genetics came from a
jagu line, which is like a purple jasmine
[SPEAKER_08]: goo, aft goo.
[SPEAKER_08]: So the purple jasmine is very dominant
purple trait.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's not like that real like carrot top
smell.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: My native friends were going crazy about
it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's awesome.
[SPEAKER_08]: This velvet candy is one of my favorites
too.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just, this is a new one.
[SPEAKER_08]: Candyland goo crossed with the velvet
perps.
[SPEAKER_08]: That turned out really nice.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just like the colors like popping out
and the crystals.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the crystals look so much more
against the purple background.
Right.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_03]: I actually photographed some of them.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, I bet.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're very photographer at all.
Right.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're very photogenic.
[SPEAKER_07]: So in terms of your like predominantly
where, where do you see all your sales
[SPEAKER_07]: coming from?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like is it concentrated locally or is it
like, like are you selling down in LA and.
[SPEAKER_08]: We're sending it right now to local
company that bucks it, trims it,
[SPEAKER_08]: and then distributes it wherever we want.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we're going to have like companies that
we work with already, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: and, you know, wherever it goes,
it's fine with us.
[SPEAKER_08]: As long as, you know, they can send it
out, but as long as they reference like
[SPEAKER_08]: Sunroots Farm, our name on there,
we're good with that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, we're not trying to like fill
jars that are at our farm or anything.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's too much work.
[SPEAKER_08]: We sell wholesale and that's it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like after that, we're, we're,
we're good.
[SPEAKER_07]: What are your thoughts on what you do
smart?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's great.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's wonderful.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I'm just kind of taking it in cause
there's this common thing that's going on
[SPEAKER_00]: in all this, all these crosses that like,
that I really like that I haven't seen in
[SPEAKER_00]: a long time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The, the Jagu totally makes sense that
that's, it's bringing in that flavor.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like for whatever reason in my circle,
that just hasn't been around in,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, a decade or something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's, that's super fun.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, the Jagu is a local strain to
Covalo.
[SPEAKER_08]: My brother and his friend Noel actually
collaborated and produced that one like,
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't know, probably 15 years ago now.
[SPEAKER_08]: And throughout the years, we've just been
breeding with certain phenotypes that come
[SPEAKER_08]: out and selecting the ones that we like.
[SPEAKER_08]: Though we had this one seed stock that
each seed just came out totally different.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, Oh, this one's a silver goo.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one's a strawberry.
[SPEAKER_08]: This one's a lemon.
[SPEAKER_08]: All in the same like cross, but they had
all these different flavors.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, yeah, all the expressions.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was, it was just like a little,
yeah, it was amazing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like those seeds.
[SPEAKER_08]: I wish I had some still.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew corn like that this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Someone gave me one year of corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, I'll plant it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Man, it had yellow corn, white corn,
blue corn, red corn, orange corn.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just like.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: The one they gave me was blue and white.
[SPEAKER_03]: I kind of checked it.
[SPEAKER_08]: We grew some like red flint corn this
year.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's really beautiful corn.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This was some heirloom strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't get the name of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: The main thing I was concerned is to go
work in my northern climate.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: This platinum velvet right here is,
this is one of my new favorite strains.
[SPEAKER_08]: That one just like.
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: For the purple and then it's got like,
yeah, there's a.
[SPEAKER_08]: Almost a blue.
[SPEAKER_08]: Orange hairs and blue.
Yeah.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's see, in there that's like,
just the beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: Which is the one we're looking at was the
one that just carried it all the way
[SPEAKER_00]: through to the core.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what did you say the cross was on this
one?
[SPEAKER_08]: This is a platinum goo diesel crossed with
the velvet perps.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: What do you got going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: This is actually some lamb spread that we,
we got, we've been messing with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, something I like to delve into
more as opposed to like kind of other
[SPEAKER_00]: things that I, that I work with,
you know, like this, that are a little bit
[SPEAKER_00]: more standard on the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's cool to like put something out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that that's just, it's actually,
it's bringing something much more unique
[SPEAKER_00]: to the market and like, to see people
actually consume something like this that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't have the visual appeal of my other
varieties.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to like, to be like, wow, I wasn't
expecting it to be an actual experience
[SPEAKER_00]: that somehow like that automatically it's
going to be lesser than because it's not
[SPEAKER_00]: carrying these, these visual appeals.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, so something like this
that just fall.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like I just think it falls a lot more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't want to even say more flat,
but it's just like, I've consumed so many
[SPEAKER_00]: variations of product like that in the
last five or 10 years that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's hard for me to really differentiate
it as like a new experience, even though
[SPEAKER_00]: if it has a new name and like,
and these are all varieties that are just
[SPEAKER_00]: coming into my life from different
directions, different popular things that
[SPEAKER_00]: are being bred and like to come across
something that has fallen out of favor a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit or as a, you know, not,
not in production or circulation and be
[SPEAKER_00]: like, oh my God, this truly is cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: This actually has this thing in some
unique merit where all of a sudden I want
[SPEAKER_00]: to hold, I'm not so, I'm not so quick to
just like let it pass through my hands.
[SPEAKER_08]: Well, every, I think I feel like every
like variety, even if it's not like what
[SPEAKER_08]: you're saying as visually appealing,
it definitely has its benefits,
[SPEAKER_08]: even if it's, you know, it may not look
so, you know, so.
[SPEAKER_07]: But it's how do you get the public to
appreciate that, right?
[SPEAKER_07]: When they're going after bag appeal and
jar appeal now, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, yeah, or screen appeal or numbers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think those are the two.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Testing and like, yeah, when those are
hitting mid and high twenties,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, and this is not, then that makes
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Harder to get rid of.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or yeah, even get people to experience on
a smaller level versus, yeah, when I just
[SPEAKER_00]: give it away and share it with people that
I love, I get, I get to have that
[SPEAKER_00]: interaction in a way that bringing another
new popular varietal, the people in my
[SPEAKER_00]: core center are bored.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like they're kind of like, okay,
cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Versus when I like dabble into this other
stuff for my own enjoyment, I see it
[SPEAKER_00]: around me and like my, my group of people
where they truly get excited.
[SPEAKER_07]: You're like, they like the stuff I like.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or just I even if it turns out that like,
okay, this one isn't my perfect thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: At least it was cool getting there because
it was different.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I've been, that's what I've
been having a lot of fun with recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what new kind of like experiments are
you doing on the farm?
[SPEAKER_07]: Like what are you playing with,
whether it's like composting or?
[SPEAKER_08]: This next year I'm actually going to do
some direct sowing like in February.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just pop some seeds out there right where
I plant.
[SPEAKER_08]: Just to see.
[SPEAKER_08]: Of what?
[SPEAKER_08]: Of what I'm going to grow.
[SPEAKER_08]: They're like, you know, something,
something like this.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, I see.
[SPEAKER_08]: Instead of like starting them in the green
house and blah, blah, blah, transplanting,
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to go out there because I mean,
I usually don't clone like if you're going
[SPEAKER_00]: to put them outside, outside, outside in
February, you're just going to let them
[SPEAKER_08]: just let them do their thing.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I always like have volunteers coming
up in my garden and they do just fine,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know?
[SPEAKER_08]: So if they're in the right place and I,
you know, given the right care,
[SPEAKER_08]: you know, if it's going to be a crazy
storm, I might go over there out there and
[SPEAKER_08]: like cover them up with like a little pot
or something for the night.
[SPEAKER_08]: But you know, I'm going to see how that
turns out.
[SPEAKER_08]: Cause I feel like it might be a lot better
than doing all this extra work,
[SPEAKER_08]: transplanting, making soil to start your
seeds in, you know, all that.
[SPEAKER_08]: So just trying to minimize, you know,
the impact and the work cause it's
[SPEAKER_08]: definitely a lot to deal with in this
spring time.
[SPEAKER_07]: And this coming February is the first
February you're going to do it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: I'm going to try it.
[SPEAKER_07]: Like in an ideal world, just a whole bunch
of them, like evenly spread out around the
[SPEAKER_07]: property.
[SPEAKER_08]: I'll probably just like stick five or six
seeds right where I want, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: a plant and then pick the best one.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then there's the whole thing too with
the taproot and the whole root system that
[SPEAKER_00]: it just never has that weird experience.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like it's, it's going for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like from day one, you put it in a pot and
it's always going to get root bound,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, no matter what it is.
[SPEAKER_08]: So unless you're like transplanting it
before it needs to be transplanted,
[SPEAKER_00]: which can work, but it can have it's own
set of problems.
[SPEAKER_08]: You're always disturbing the roots,
you know, and you transplant and then it
[SPEAKER_08]: has that shock of being in a new ground
and being outside.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I just want to like avoid all that.
[SPEAKER_08]: Does anyone know any good ball games?
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, no, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: We got to do some hippie.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's, that's definitely, that,
that, that's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't want to reach out to you again on
like how, how the plant, it seems like a
[SPEAKER_00]: trade off, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, okay, maybe it is going to be a
little bit rough in the beginning for the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant, but.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, that'll make it more strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: It'll make it more resilient to,
you know, everything else.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, yeah, the strongest one.
[SPEAKER_07]: So Tina's going to jump in.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Cause I've noticed like everybody keeps
smelling one thing she brought.
[SPEAKER_07]: Oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_07]: Everyone's been digging that.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Sounds good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: The Bernie Mac.
[SPEAKER_08]: Bring the Bernie Mac in.
[SPEAKER_08]: I want to smoke some of that one.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, this is funny is like,
even though I do, I miss all kinds of
[SPEAKER_00]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the few events I can do and
I feel like I'm the one with the
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial.
[SPEAKER_03]: Supermodels.
[SPEAKER_03]: Variety.
[SPEAKER_03]: These people actually have unique.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, somebody's going to appreciate these
hippie chicks.
[SPEAKER_03]: No, it's got to look like this.
Eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's what I'm loving about this.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even the table and everybody's like,
oh yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is my values too.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's a little left.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was very gratifying to open this and
see that.
[SPEAKER_09]: I was like, Hey, come out.
[SPEAKER_09]: Right on.
[SPEAKER_09]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Y'all.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, there was this.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there were several in here that I
was so excited about.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'd like to see which ones are yours and
yours as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: I didn't bring anything because I travel
across the border.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't you introduce these guys to
what you brought?
[SPEAKER_09]: Sure.
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Bernie Mac as label and this is
Sapphire.
[SPEAKER_09]: So Sapphire is a two to one CBD to THC bio
vortex genetics.
[SPEAKER_09]: And you know, I was just, I'm just really
into colas right now and just like seeking
[SPEAKER_09]: and see really kind of get a sense of the
plant.
Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And really trying to draw the,
um, like the bud and the flower back to
[SPEAKER_09]: the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so this group, we grew this in three
different environments.
[SPEAKER_09]: And one of them was in these deep Google
cultures.
[SPEAKER_09]: One of them was in a shallow Google
culture and the other in boxes.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this is shallow Google culture.
[SPEAKER_09]: I can tell by the structure because the
structures got like the deep Google
[SPEAKER_09]: cultures ended up being kind of more like
big and fluffy and, and, and big mommas,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, like really big expressive
divas.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then the smaller Google culture,
medium sized buds, medium sized colas,
[SPEAKER_09]: but a lot of, um, some girth and then the
boxes tighter, smaller bugs.
[SPEAKER_09]: Fascinating.
[SPEAKER_09]: Would love to hear.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, there's lots of things to talk
about.
[SPEAKER_09]: But would love impressions at,
you know, any point.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then this one, this is the Bernie Mac
that's left, which is cool.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I had done this.
[SPEAKER_09]: Oh, let's say there's a couple crazy
looking buds with sugar leaf.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I wanted to leave this once again,
I wanted to leave like all the leaf on all
[SPEAKER_09]: the sugar leaf so you could just kind of
check out the, um, yeah, I like to see it
[SPEAKER_05]: where you still get to see what it looks
like.
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, that's all good.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's just sugar.
[SPEAKER_09]: And if you can feel the number less that
we're talking about trichomes and trichome
[SPEAKER_09]: development, and you can kind of feel like
this is definitely a greasy, greasier than
[SPEAKER_05]: gravelly.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Greasier trichomes.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_09]: You can break one off.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's got that nose.
[SPEAKER_05]: You can feel it.
[SPEAKER_05]: What do you call that one?
[SPEAKER_09]: This is Bernie Mac.
[SPEAKER_09]: And, um, the genetics, um, of this are by
Capulater.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this was something that we picked up
to do some phenohunting.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this was absolutely the weakest.
[SPEAKER_09]: It was the weakest.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were the weakest moms, the weakest
clones.
[SPEAKER_09]: When we transplanted them, they had
transplant shock for two weeks.
[SPEAKER_09]: They were slow to come back and there were
several times when I thought about pulling
[SPEAKER_09]: them out and replacing them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then we just kept going with them and
going with them.
[SPEAKER_09]: And because we had this incredibly
extended, like late summer, they suddenly
[SPEAKER_09]: came on in September and we finished
cutting the first week of December.
[SPEAKER_09]: So they were, it was like the rare season
for the late bloomer because we just
[SPEAKER_09]: didn't have any weather.
[SPEAKER_09]: We started them with the clones.
[SPEAKER_09]: We cut the clones in, I want to say March.
[SPEAKER_09]: No, maybe later.
[SPEAKER_09]: I kept, I think it was April that we kept
the clones.
[SPEAKER_09]: But I was going to give up on them several
times and then she ended up being the
[SPEAKER_09]: superstar, the clone superstar of the
year.
[SPEAKER_09]: So, um, I'm glad I didn't give up and had
a really powerful, had a profound lesson
[SPEAKER_08]: about late bloomers and you never know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Give them a chance.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had a similar experience that it's like,
I haven't grown this, but this is just the
[SPEAKER_00]: regular Mack and I hunted it a couple of
years ago and last season and this season
[SPEAKER_00]: it like, you know, definitely struggled in
terms of speed of veg in comparison to
[SPEAKER_00]: everyone else.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when it started, the flower
really worked out in our environment.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, at least where I'm at and
like it just flowers really healthy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just came on for me and come on.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's your elevation?
[SPEAKER_00]: 1200 to 1900, depending on where and how
far are you from the coast?
[SPEAKER_00]: We're in Blocksburg.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know exactly and in miles,
but like, yeah, so I think there were like
[SPEAKER_00]: 15 miles east of the 101 and that would be
like probably had about a Miranda.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I don't know what that would be from
there out to the coast.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's about 20 miles from the 101.
[SPEAKER_05]: Less, a little less of the crow flies.
[SPEAKER_05]: No, it's 20 miles.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: So you might be about 40 miles.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: How about you guys?
[SPEAKER_08]: Um, we live in the Valley Flora Covalo,
which is around 1400 feet, but the
[SPEAKER_08]: mountains go around like 7,000 above us.
[SPEAKER_08]: So we have our own little micro climate
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: And then your climate is probably
completely different.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, we have short seasons.
[SPEAKER_09]: So what's your elevation?
[SPEAKER_09]: How far from the closest ocean are you?
[SPEAKER_03]: We're eight hours inland, like we're far
from ocean.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, it's in the mountains,
about 4,000 feet elevation.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we're lucky.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have like a good sun.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not everybody where we live has good sun.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, how do you decide, you know,
you work with the environment,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: To figure out how you're going to
cultivate?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pretty important to find the right
strains that will work in our climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: So which ones work for you?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some ones out there, like seaweed
is one, and one called jellyfish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Jellyfish.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, those are the ones I've liked.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was one my friend was working with.
[SPEAKER_03]: He was calling it white grizzly.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that one, it just didn't have the
jellyfish.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it was a really reliable, it's not
going to get mold, and it's going to
[SPEAKER_03]: finish straight.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then people started breeding that one
with this other one called seaweed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's got like a much nicer look,
and a better finish here.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I've been learning about auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Wanted to breed a bit more with auto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am rolling, I think I'm rolling some of
this maculari just put on the table.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, I just pulled it out of that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is you, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And these were all sun roots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, and we just... This color is
incredible.
[SPEAKER_07]: Amazing.
[SPEAKER_07]: We were talking about that earlier.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think I did some of this last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Josh and Kelly gave me some seeds,
and I was doing light depth, and had all
[SPEAKER_03]: these crazy purples coming out.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm pretty sure it was from you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_09]: Velvet perps, maybe?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_09]: Did you smell that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's amazing.
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm curious about something.
[SPEAKER_09]: When you see trichomes falling off,
right?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, is that abundance?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that temperature?
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that humidity?
[SPEAKER_08]: Probably a little humidity.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was really dry when I... Strength of
the stalk.
[SPEAKER_09]: Strength of the stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I think it's one factor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not disagreeing with anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think it's the same, but the longer the
capitulate stalk, the more likely it is to
[SPEAKER_00]: break off.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would be interested to say, since
there's all kinds of different glands,
[SPEAKER_00]: and some for our purposes are more
valuable than others on the same bud,
[SPEAKER_00]: is it all the same?
[SPEAKER_00]: So are there equal percentages of those
same different types of trichomes left on
[SPEAKER_00]: the bud as on the bag or glass or
something?
[SPEAKER_09]: Interesting.
[SPEAKER_09]: Which glands are most prone to drop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that advantageous?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like you're saying, is it just because of
an abundance?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, I see it probably more in indica.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, whatever.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's it called, indica?
[SPEAKER_00]: Dense the frosty buds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Most of what kind of sells well for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's kind of like a discussion I've
been having with a couple of people.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were kind of talking about this
with something like the lamb spread that
[SPEAKER_00]: just doesn't have visually nearly as much
crystal or frost as most of my other
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties, but it's way less likely to
have stuff shedding off on the bottom of
[SPEAKER_00]: the bag.
[SPEAKER_00]: It also doesn't get those high numbers on
tests, but still has an effect that could
[SPEAKER_00]: be considered strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when we say strong, and then we are
also talking about numbers meaning
[SPEAKER_00]: strength, there is kind of an issue there.
[SPEAKER_09]: So is that leaf to calyx ratio?
[SPEAKER_09]: Right.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is that part of what's happening?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, there's a lot more leaf in there
than in like some other variety that I
[SPEAKER_09]: grow that's like... Or like this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, or like that, which share way more
parental lineage, like way more similar
[SPEAKER_00]: varieties than that coming out of left
field.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah, this looks more like a land race.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all these have been polyhybrid crosses
with other polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: And this one?
[SPEAKER_00]: That one and this one are... They're
called Donnie Burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely more like on the...
Donnie Burger.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it Donnie Burger?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, that's liver.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's more like what I...
[SPEAKER_00]: I personally like more... Is this a
heritage genetic?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, it's a more new... But it's like more
on that... I don't know enough about
[SPEAKER_00]: terpenes to really speak, but I guess like
humaline, when people talk about earth,
[SPEAKER_00]: like deep earth, cushy flavors.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is just a different phenyl of
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think it has a little bit more of
what I guess what they call gas or
[SPEAKER_00]: whatever, but... Whoa.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's got your pickles and your relish on
there.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's kind of an Afghani nose to it,
right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, like I wouldn't consume those
all the time, but I really like having
[SPEAKER_00]: something really strong in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I realized something kind of recently
is like a simple thing for me in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: describing, like I don't care what strain
something is.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think like most people here,
but one distinction I do like to make is I
[SPEAKER_00]: like really more uppity type of weed for
the most part.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then when it's not that, I like it to
be this strong antithesis to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the weed that personally doesn't speak
to me that much is all this stuff in the
[SPEAKER_00]: middle.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just kind of like murky.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's subjective, but for me,
and that's where I'm going back to this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of thing I've been talking and
thinking about a lot recently is my own
[SPEAKER_00]: like personal hypocrisy around producing
so much product that would fall into that
[SPEAKER_00]: very category.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty and it's not that it isn't
potent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Clearly by its tests, it's something,
but for my personal consumption,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's falling flat in some area because
it's not really pulling me strongly in
[SPEAKER_00]: either direction.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's just something.
[SPEAKER_07]: Well,
[SPEAKER_09]: is it also like different personalities?
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah, right.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's interesting because this is
like an adaptogen, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: And it has so much to do with like
personally a two-to-one, four-to-one,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, eight-to-one.
[SPEAKER_09]: It sits pretty well with me during the
day.
[SPEAKER_09]: And at night like nighty, this is nighty
night for me, you know?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I can't really smoke this during the
day.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or actually, yeah, this is just THC.
[SPEAKER_09]: But nighty night a little bit before like
not right before bed because it's clarity
[SPEAKER_09]: and it's kind of like, but it's pretty
heavy THC.
[SPEAKER_08]: And so it's pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's pretty intense.
[SPEAKER_09]: Or if I have like, you know, a lot of
communications to do, it's like
[SPEAKER_09]: conversations will go way too long.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like if I'm just trying to stay to my list
and get down a brass tacks for the day and
[SPEAKER_09]: get it done, then it's... No.
[SPEAKER_09]: If there's some creative time or time in
the garden, go.
[SPEAKER_09]: And that's awesome, right?
[SPEAKER_09]: But it's also, I've been thinking about
how much this is like, this resembles art.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like flower with the intention that goes
into it and the personality and the
[SPEAKER_09]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's like the synthesis of life
experience.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, there's nobody who doesn't.
[SPEAKER_09]: Does it exactly the same?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so is there a way to... So what's the
criteria on like, on taste?
[SPEAKER_09]: How do you account for taste or like
personal relationship with something?
[SPEAKER_09]: You know?
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like, it's like to me, it's more like
music or art or love than wine or beer or
[SPEAKER_09]: food or any, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: I find like just growing the plant
throughout the year you build a
[SPEAKER_08]: relationship with it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like each time you go out in the garden,
you're building a relationship to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Every time you clean it out, you know,
and you know, check it for bugs,
[SPEAKER_08]: you're building that relationship.
[SPEAKER_08]: So, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, you remember plants from years
ago, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Oh, yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I remember every plant in my garden for a
long time.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like that's a relationship.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can go out in my garden and know what
every plant is like.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or what like back in previous years.
[SPEAKER_00]: I remember in that spot.
[SPEAKER_09]: That was the one.
[SPEAKER_09]: What's that spot going to do this year?
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's the beauty of like starting
seeds and planting them with seeds because
[SPEAKER_08]: you never know really what you're going to
get.
[SPEAKER_08]: So until you see the expression of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: And that's what really makes it special to
me.
[SPEAKER_09]: When do you see the expression?
[SPEAKER_00]: When like, when is there a true,
I guess that's kind of open question.
[SPEAKER_00]: But one thing that I would say is like,
if I'm working with things that are way
[SPEAKER_00]: out of left field or something,
then I see there's much earlier.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it gets tricky.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think sometimes when I'm working with 10
versions of the same, I'm working on
[SPEAKER_00]: narrow gene pools and we're trying to
claim diversity and variety out of what's
[SPEAKER_00]: really not.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that's what the market is screaming
for.
[SPEAKER_00]: Playing along with that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like when I get to come across
these truly different flavors,
[SPEAKER_00]: I think there's like somebody not even
like because the bigger the biggest amount
[SPEAKER_00]: of different types of pot, I looked at it
together.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's a way bigger spread because
people are pulling things out of,
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, out of their own collection
of their parents collection, their
[SPEAKER_00]: friends, grandparents collection like
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: You brought 12 dryers, 12 different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you've you are pretty much like all
these crosses here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is there anything?
[SPEAKER_08]: Except for this lemon head.
[SPEAKER_08]: I just bought some seeds actually the last
year for like the first time because I
[SPEAKER_08]: wanted a super lemony variety that I could
cross back and I crossed it into the
[SPEAKER_08]: velvet perp.
[SPEAKER_08]: So next year we'll have some.
[SPEAKER_08]: It was just like some seed junkies or
something off the Internet.
[SPEAKER_08]: But I wanted to broaden the gene pool and
make something more unique, you know,
[SPEAKER_08]: like a purple super purple that has like a
lemony smell to it.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, there's nothing like that yet.
[SPEAKER_08]: So.
[SPEAKER_08]: We'll see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_08]: Exciting.
[SPEAKER_09]: A bunch of two to one crosses.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like we have this one called Lunar
Bouquet that's Harley Sue crossed with
[SPEAKER_09]: Rosemary.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so it's got a nice like blueberry
overtone and it's also a bit earthy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I want to cross that back into higher
THC to really find a true one to one is
[SPEAKER_09]: what I'm looking for, like searching for
and put the right one to one.
[SPEAKER_09]: And and so there's some hunting to do
around that.
[SPEAKER_09]: But that's one that I'm most excited
about.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about you?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I'm just right in the transitioning
between indoor and outdoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm really trying to figure out what
I'm going to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: With with this, you know, the whole
legalization and all that up in Canada.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's exciting to pursue outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: So most of the things I've been working
with the last few years have been in the
[SPEAKER_03]: medical program and the indoor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's part of this trip is like
research, even like trying to figure out
[SPEAKER_03]: what to move forward with.
[SPEAKER_03]: My program is changing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like those those ones I mentioned earlier,
like the jellyfish in the sea.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the ones that I've been working
with more recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're the ones I'm going to go with
unless I find something different.
[SPEAKER_03]: But yeah, my climate is so specific.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just try just anything.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's really interesting to see what's
going to acclimate outside to inside or
[SPEAKER_09]: inside to outside.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah, yeah, like the like that was
kind of like the transition thing,
[SPEAKER_03]: right?
[SPEAKER_03]: So you see which ones are hardy and which
ones are prone to mold or mildew.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I'm just on that adventure of you
know, the transition of legalization and
[SPEAKER_03]: discovery, discovering, you know,
what's going to work for for my dream,
[SPEAKER_03]: right, to to to grow some fields of it.
[SPEAKER_08]: Have you tried the ruderalis up there?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, that's I've been looking into,
too, because, yeah, I haven't not tried
[SPEAKER_03]: it, but I've been talking to folks about
it because I think that might be a real
[SPEAKER_03]: way to go.
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan.
[SPEAKER_03]: Dan.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I'll talk to him.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because that's I mean, to fight the
unpredictability of the fall.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Like that would be a good solution.
[SPEAKER_03]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I mean, I've been so stoked and
see like I feel like this has happened in
[SPEAKER_00]: all kinds of I don't know, things that I
caught like when they were new and I don't
[SPEAKER_00]: know, because it didn't catch me at that
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: I didn't really go anywhere with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Meanwhile, other people were.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like when ruderalis or when,
you know, people started pushing auto
[SPEAKER_00]: flowers 115 years ago, maybe maybe longer.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like it really started to come on the
forefront, like whatever mid late 2000s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they just weren't there for the most
part, at least what we saw.
[SPEAKER_00]: And and now I'm seeing some product that's
pretty impressive.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think there's some breeding with
the ruderalis, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: What do you say?
[SPEAKER_09]: Dan's are looking good, right?
[SPEAKER_08]: Dan's are looking good for a ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_08]: Like, yeah, hell yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: And he was like saying that if you you can
breed, you know, he three or four years
[SPEAKER_08]: down the line, we're going to have a
ruderalis velvet perp.
[SPEAKER_08]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: That's exciting.
[SPEAKER_08]: Very cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: The folks I was talking to got two crops
this year with the ruderalis.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they planted their seeds like 10
days, two weeks before harvest right next
[SPEAKER_03]: to the ones they're about to harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: So then they had a protected environment
and said it worked out pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is slick right there.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that's I know people doing a lot more
work than that.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's a great idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're like, I love which seeds in the
ground.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right next to it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And in theory, it's insane.
Yes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Stop being simple.
[SPEAKER_09]: Is it the right soil balance though?
[SPEAKER_09]: Like, so like what's going on with the
soil when something like flowers are
[SPEAKER_09]: finishing and then you're starting again?
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like I kind of like I'm kind of of that
persuasion.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that again, like, but if this also
works, it works pretty well, but it's
[SPEAKER_00]: saving in all these other ways.
[SPEAKER_00]: There just might be like such a place
where that trade off makes sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: How are you getting two crops a year like
without light depping?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like, what are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what he told me he's doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm like, whoa.
[SPEAKER_09]: If the genetics are there waiting,
waiting, waiting, waiting.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: He said the first crop was 60 days and the
second one was 70.
[SPEAKER_03]: From seed to flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: From seed to flower.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seed to harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: Seed to harvest.
[SPEAKER_03]: 60 days.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said it was he did the math.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was 20 percent more overall harvest
than a single crop of big plants.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'm considering I'm actually going to
visit his farm when I get back.
[SPEAKER_03]: No trellising.
[SPEAKER_03]: He invited me for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Show me photos.
[SPEAKER_08]: With my big plants, I have to like cage
them three times, you know.
[SPEAKER_08]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I have like a little inner one and the
big.
[SPEAKER_08]: Outer one and then a net around that just
to keep them from falling over.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's how when I grew yours, that's what
I was doing.
Exactly.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was like, I took some pictures of my top
step of the stepladder, doing some pruning
[SPEAKER_03]: and tying up.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm like, yeah.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's one of the cool things about growing
in terraces.
[SPEAKER_09]: There are spots where you can stand on a
terrace above another terrace and like
[SPEAKER_09]: utilize that.
[SPEAKER_09]: It's like a scaffolding system.
[SPEAKER_08]: I live on a flat valley, so I can't do
that.
[SPEAKER_09]: You know, that must be terrible.
[SPEAKER_08]: There's so much extra space to use.
[SPEAKER_09]: It would be really wonderful if you guys
could come by on your way out tomorrow.
[SPEAKER_09]: There's going to be, I think, a few people
that might trickle down some three parcels
[SPEAKER_09]: away.
[SPEAKER_09]: So like three parcels away from here.
[SPEAKER_09]: Down Island Mountain Road towards town.
[SPEAKER_09]: And just see like, I mean, it's it's
incredibly challenging.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like there are these tiny little terraces
with like steps to all over.
[SPEAKER_09]: Why are they?
[SPEAKER_09]: Little roads.
[SPEAKER_09]: They vary.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it's all like none of it's consistent.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like the county and the state hate us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hate us.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was going to ask you about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the state came to my garden,
they're just like, what do you do?
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've worked it all out.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I made a lot of concessions and went
through a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like when I've seen pictures of your
garden, it's like I was going to ask you,
[SPEAKER_00]: how did that work with them?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, I spent a lot of time explaining why
I shouldn't be taxed for interplanting,
[SPEAKER_09]: like for companion planting.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so the inspector was like,
well, it's part of the cannabis.
[SPEAKER_09]: I mean, it's part of your garden.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, well, it's part of the
canopy.
[SPEAKER_09]: And I was like, well, just kind of
consider the return on on this,
[SPEAKER_09]: you know, on these plants.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like on the on the companions.
[SPEAKER_09]: Like I'm not going to sell this comfrey
and I'm not going to sell this caster and
[SPEAKER_09]: I'm not going to sell this, you know,
any of this amaranth.
[SPEAKER_09]: And so why am I being taxed on this for
footage for it?
[SPEAKER_09]: And so and then I started explaining like
the reason why it's so important,
[SPEAKER_09]: like for the for the soil health and for
the plant health and environmental health
[SPEAKER_09]: and all of it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And he by the end of the inspection,
he was like, OK, I think I get it.
[SPEAKER_09]: And it was just a beautiful education
piece, really.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's so great to hear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what agency was this specifically?
[SPEAKER_09]: Well, it was a county inspector working
for the state because the state isn't
[SPEAKER_09]: sending inspectors out.
[SPEAKER_09]: They're using county inspectors.
[SPEAKER_09]: Now.
[SPEAKER_09]: That.
[SPEAKER_09]: That.
That.
That.
