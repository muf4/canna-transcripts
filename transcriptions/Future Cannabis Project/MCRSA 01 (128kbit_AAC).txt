[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Nate Bradley.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm the executive director of the
California Cannabis Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the topic for this panel here is 2018,
January 1, what's next?
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as you know, with the state
medical laws that were passed last year,
[SPEAKER_03]: the date for the licenses to, for the
whole process to start was January 1,
[SPEAKER_03]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_03]: So we're going to get different
perspectives from everybody on the panel.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then we just had our special guest
added on, Congressman Dana Robacher,
[SPEAKER_03]: who will be giving us a federal update on
what he's been working on on medical
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis and for cannabis issues for us in
Washington, D.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: the last couple years.
[SPEAKER_03]: So first, let me introduce everybody else.
[SPEAKER_03]: To my left, we have BOE board member Fiona
Ma, who has been a champion.
[SPEAKER_03]: We have, I'm also proud to have,
we are proud that we have assembly member
[SPEAKER_03]: Reginald Jones Sawyer, who was a key
author last year to make sure that these
[SPEAKER_03]: medical laws even happened in the first
place.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we also have Michael Stevenson from
Horizon Water and Environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we'll be talking about the water
permitting and a lot of the other issues
[SPEAKER_03]: that they are working on.
[SPEAKER_03]: First, before we get into talking about,
though, 2018, I'd like to hear from my
[SPEAKER_03]: panelists to my left about how we got here
in the first place.
[SPEAKER_03]: As one of the key authors on the bill,
a lot happened over the last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, the bill almost died a few times.
[SPEAKER_03]: It was until two days before the end of
the legislative session before we even
[SPEAKER_03]: knew anything was happening.
[SPEAKER_03]: So why don't you kind of give us an update
of how we got here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, I'm Reggie Jones Sawyer, and I
represent the 59th Assembly District with
[SPEAKER_00]: the South Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now, when I was in college,
I may have seen some people do marijuana,
[SPEAKER_00]: but marijuana was not my thing when I
first started in the assembly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And what bothered me more than anything
else as someone who worked for the City of
[SPEAKER_00]: Los Angeles for 25 years, and like I like
to tell people, I am a recovering
[SPEAKER_00]: bureaucrat, it always bothered me that it
took us all this time for us to come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with rules and regulations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And one of the first things that we
realized, there were many attempts by
[SPEAKER_00]: individuals, individuals who had the best
at heart to create regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, they just couldn't get it across
the finish line.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with the other five members of what
I call the team, Assemblymember Rob Bonta,
[SPEAKER_00]: Assemblymember Ken Cooley, Assemblymember
Ken Lackey, Assemblymember Wood,
[SPEAKER_00]: and Senator McGuire and myself,
we said this is a big, big, big,
[SPEAKER_00]: big lift.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you know anything about
legislation, and I'm sure the congressman
[SPEAKER_00]: can tell you how difficult it is to get
legislation through, it required every
[SPEAKER_00]: last one of us with different skill sets
and different parts of California
[SPEAKER_00]: represented.
[SPEAKER_00]: As I said, I'm from South Los Angeles,
but we also had Dr. Wood, who's a dentist,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also is from Northern California,
knew a lot about the growers, along with
[SPEAKER_00]: Senator McGuire.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Bonta was from the Oakland area.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mr. Cooley was from Sacramento and is an
ordained minister.
[SPEAKER_00]: And Mr. Lackey is a former Marine,
ex-highway patrolman, and a Republican.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we had a large constituency that
represented, I think, most of California,
[SPEAKER_00]: if not all of California.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was important for us to move this
along.
[SPEAKER_00]: We nicknamed ourselves the Sexy Six,
and we went at it as hard as you could
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly go.
[SPEAKER_00]: When we first came up with the original
record, recommendations for how to
[SPEAKER_00]: regulate medical marijuana, everyone had
their own ideas of what it could be.
[SPEAKER_00]: We learned early that it wasn't about we,
it was about I.
[SPEAKER_00]: I want this in medical marijuana,
and I want that, which kind of alienated a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of our constituencies, and we couldn't
get to a number where we could ultimately
[SPEAKER_00]: get it passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we made a concerted effort to put
in the bill as much as we could believe
[SPEAKER_00]: would get passed.
[SPEAKER_00]: So where, for example, I use Mr. Lackey,
who is a highway patrolman, for him,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was very, very important for us to have
regulation on when people are driving
[SPEAKER_00]: while under the influence of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_00]: As all of you know, in this room,
proper testing had not been done yet,
[SPEAKER_00]: and we don't know what kind of regulations
we need to do to make sure that if
[SPEAKER_00]: someone's under the influence,
we can capture where they are,
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not they can drive or not,
and ultimately, what their impairment
[SPEAKER_00]: level is.
[SPEAKER_00]: We put in the bill research so that the
University of California will go out and
[SPEAKER_00]: research different industries and
methodologies for how you determine
[SPEAKER_00]: whether or not a person is under the
influence.
[SPEAKER_00]: That satisfied him, and ultimately,
I think it satisfied a lot of public
[SPEAKER_00]: safety individuals who are definitely
against any type of marijuana legislation.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we were able to get them on board,
along with several other groups,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we went out and actually talked
directly to each individual.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ultimately, we were able to get the
legislation passed through overwhelmingly
[SPEAKER_00]: in the Assembly and the Senate,
which the government ultimately signed.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what you need to understand is that
every aspect of this that we could
[SPEAKER_00]: possibly put in with the understanding
that we would have to come back with
[SPEAKER_00]: clean-up language was done, because at the
end of the day, it was about all of us,
[SPEAKER_00]: we, make it a concerted effort to finally
have regulations on medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis so that if in the future,
if in the future like November,
[SPEAKER_00]: we have adult-use marijuana, hopefully,
that is the baseline that we use to
[SPEAKER_00]: ultimately regulate that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that we know kind of how we got there,
I'd like to actually hear from the
[SPEAKER_03]: Congressman for a moment, sort of on what
he thinks of, because we've got
[SPEAKER_03]: regulations here at the state level.
[SPEAKER_03]: Obviously, the big question is D.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll talk about banking and finances in a
little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: From your point of view, you've been sort
of one of the champions in D.C.
[SPEAKER_03]: for years on this.
[SPEAKER_03]: What change have you seen, and do you
think there's hope in the future to get
[SPEAKER_03]: more legislation passed?
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we are winning this war.
[SPEAKER_04]: It is a war for people to live their own
lives and for our country to reaffirm that
[SPEAKER_04]: freedom is the fundamental value that
which our country was founded upon.
[SPEAKER_04]: We are winning that battle.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it took more than just being righteous
or right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It took the right approach for this issue
to get us over the hump.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've spent 15 years voting the right way,
but for the last three or four years now,
[SPEAKER_04]: we've been winning those votes,
and it came down to this.
[SPEAKER_04]: We actually challenge the Republicans who
claim to believe, as I believe,
[SPEAKER_04]: in individual freedom, who claim to
believe in the doctor, especially since
[SPEAKER_04]: Obama came in, the doctor-patient
relationship, the same people who claim
[SPEAKER_04]: that they believe in states, rights,
and limited government.
[SPEAKER_04]: All of those things are principles that
would lead you to the belief that the idea
[SPEAKER_04]: that the federal government should get
between a person and a plant like this is
[SPEAKER_04]: absolutely absurd and absurd.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's a violation of everything that we
supposedly believed in principle as
[SPEAKER_04]: Republicans.
[SPEAKER_04]: So how do we get the Republicans to
actually wake up and acknowledge that?
[SPEAKER_04]: Because I had all the votes from the
Democrats all along.
[SPEAKER_04]: By the way, that was an easy vote for them
because they were simply doing what they
[SPEAKER_04]: thought was politically right for
themselves because their constituency
[SPEAKER_04]: believed that it should be.
[SPEAKER_04]: There was no price for them to pay to do
what we consider the right thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: They couldn't stand on this issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: So the Republicans had to supposedly buck
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: What happened is we changed the debate
over what the issue was.
[SPEAKER_04]: The issue was, should medical marijuana be
legal?
[SPEAKER_04]: No.
[SPEAKER_04]: It became, should the states and the
people therein decide whether or not
[SPEAKER_04]: medical marijuana will be legal in their
state?
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we did that, I have to brag,
I did come up with that strategy.
[SPEAKER_04]: Once we actually did that, we won.
[SPEAKER_04]: We won the first time, and every time
since we've been gaining strength.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what's been making the difference?
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of you have made the difference,
but let me tell you the specific people
[SPEAKER_04]: who's made that momentum, that dynamic,
and it still is growing on our side.
[SPEAKER_04]: First of all, the veterans.
[SPEAKER_04]: Veterans going into seeing their
congressperson and saying, why are you
[SPEAKER_04]: keeping us from something that will help
us?
[SPEAKER_04]: So God bless you guys.
[SPEAKER_04]: How stupid was it anyway to say,
oh, we can't let you use medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_04]: because it might lead to opium.
[SPEAKER_04]: Here, have an opiate.
[SPEAKER_04]: Give me a break.
[SPEAKER_04]: So anyway, the veterans groups were
important.
[SPEAKER_04]: And here's another group, by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Older Americans.
[SPEAKER_04]: What is wrong with having, and this isn't
just for medical purposes, what is wrong
[SPEAKER_04]: with having some 80-year-old person
enjoying themselves with smoking a joint?
[SPEAKER_04]: Big deal.
[SPEAKER_04]: So we're gonna spend billions of dollars
[SPEAKER_04]: on something that is so stupid as that.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so, I mean, there's a lot of things
they do stupid in Washington, but this is
[SPEAKER_04]: gonna be one of the worst.
[SPEAKER_04]: And you are helping bring rational thought
back to this issue.
[SPEAKER_04]: And between the seniors and you folks,
and I will have to tell you that I
[SPEAKER_04]: believe, I've talked to Don Trump.
[SPEAKER_04]: He will not, at least from what he's told
me and to others, is that if the states
[SPEAKER_04]: legalize marijuana, he is not gonna
interfere with the states.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so I've heard him say that a couple
times.
[SPEAKER_04]: But of course, with Don, you never know
what the hell he means.
[SPEAKER_04]: So, you can't have it, all of that.
[SPEAKER_04]: But look, we're in this together.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have made a lot of progress.
[SPEAKER_04]: Again, I think that this whole issue,
over the years, has downgraded the value
[SPEAKER_04]: of freedom in our country.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you have law enforcement agencies who
think they can just come in and take money
[SPEAKER_04]: and property away from people,
not even having to have search warrants or
[SPEAKER_04]: justification or having a conviction
before they steal property, this is
[SPEAKER_04]: outrageous.
[SPEAKER_04]: It never would have been accepted by the
people who founded this country and wrote
[SPEAKER_04]: into our Constitution.
[SPEAKER_04]: And wrote into the Declaration of
Independence about how they were opposed
[SPEAKER_04]: to confiscation of property.
[SPEAKER_04]: So this is, we are, we are the patriots.
[SPEAKER_04]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Oh, I like this, look at this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Make cannabis great again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to get this.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm trying to get this to Don.
[SPEAKER_04]: But anyway, it's up to, but as the way
democracy works and democratic government
[SPEAKER_04]: works, be very clear that it doesn't work
simply because the principle is right.
[SPEAKER_04]: It means people have to go out and get
that job done with the hard work of making
[SPEAKER_04]: sure you're getting the attention of the
members who, the people who were elected
[SPEAKER_04]: to make decisions, and then the people of
the United States.
[SPEAKER_04]: All I can say right now, and on as well,
but the bottom line is, the momentum is on
[SPEAKER_04]: our side.
[SPEAKER_04]: The momentum is on our side and we will
win this.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it won't be won on its own.
[SPEAKER_04]: It will win because the effort and time
and energy and commitment that we all put
[SPEAKER_04]: into this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm with you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_04]: God bless you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: One last thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: One last thing, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: This is, I really have to say this.
[SPEAKER_04]: Look, I was, the reason I'm here is I had
a doctor's appointment.
[SPEAKER_04]: I had a doctor's appointment this morning
and my plane that was supposed to go out
[SPEAKER_04]: at one o'clock was canceled, so here I am,
okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: And anyway, I wanted to go to the doctor's
office because, you know, I spent 25 years
[SPEAKER_04]: really heavy duty surfing, okay?
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah, I'm the guy down there.
[SPEAKER_04]: Hey man, let's go surfing, man.
[SPEAKER_04]: How about it, dude?
[SPEAKER_04]: Okay, I'm the guy out in the water there
having fun for 25, enjoying my freedom,
[SPEAKER_04]: all right?
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I did, is I exercised and I
surfed away all of the cartilage in my
[SPEAKER_04]: arms and I have severe arthritis.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here I am putting on some of that
cannabis salve on my arm.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, I'm really in pain, real pain.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here I am, I'm putting this cannabis
salve on my arm.
[SPEAKER_04]: And by the way, a lot of seniors who are
not surfers get the same sort of arthritis
[SPEAKER_04]: pain that I've gotten.
[SPEAKER_04]: Whatever it is, maybe they've been working
rather than surfing.
[SPEAKER_04]: So here I put it on and in about 15
minutes, pain goes away, but then it comes
[SPEAKER_04]: back in an hour.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now here's what I want to tell you.
[SPEAKER_04]: I know how these things work.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had marijuana or cannabis been legal,
by the way, not only would our farmers be
[SPEAKER_04]: making billions of dollars growing hemp
for rope and medical marijuana and using
[SPEAKER_04]: it for fun marijuana, as well,
but the bottom line is I only get an
[SPEAKER_04]: hour's worth of comfort from my pain right
now.
[SPEAKER_04]: Had it not been illegal, by now,
there would have been genetic
[SPEAKER_04]: cross-breeding and you would have had a
marijuana plant that would give people
[SPEAKER_04]: suffering pain an alleviation of their
pain for maybe 10 hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: What a wonderful thing to do for someone
who's suffering in dramatic pain,
[SPEAKER_04]: but to increase their level where they
don't suffer that pain for hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Our bureaucrats have stolen that from all
of these people suffering from these type
[SPEAKER_04]: of diseases.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it's not too late.
[SPEAKER_04]: We'll recapture the ground and we will
cross-breed cannabis and that cannabis
[SPEAKER_04]: will go to help alleviate the pain for
hours and hours for senior citizens to
[SPEAKER_04]: come.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I just thought I'd share that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you for that.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the next two questions, first we'll be
at Fiona and then we'll bounce over to
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael.
[SPEAKER_03]: In 2018, a lot of these businesses are
going to be coming forward for the very
[SPEAKER_03]: first time.
[SPEAKER_03]: If they're coming to you with tax
paperwork, with things like that,
[SPEAKER_03]: what kind of things should they have ready
to go and what should they know and be
[SPEAKER_03]: prepared to do when they come to file
their taxes for the very first time?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so hello.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hello, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So my name is Fiona Ma and I started my
political career on the San Francisco
[SPEAKER_02]: Board of Supervisors.
[SPEAKER_02]: So like the congressman said, in San
Francisco it's all about relieving pain
[SPEAKER_02]: and making sure patients have access to
cannabis that's affordable when they need
[SPEAKER_02]: it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And when we got to the legislature,
I served from 2006 to 2012, we never
[SPEAKER_02]: talked about cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know, I didn't really think it was
an issue until I got on the State Board of
[SPEAKER_02]: Equalization where all of a sudden the
Board of Equalization is supposed to be
[SPEAKER_02]: collecting sales taxes on dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of my first questions when I got
on the board, January 2015, was how much
[SPEAKER_02]: are we collecting?
[SPEAKER_02]: And everybody at the agency looked at us
and said, we don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I said, well, how can a tax collection
agency not know how much we're collecting
[SPEAKER_02]: from an industry?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it kind of makes sense now,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We are not keeping lists at the Board of
Equalization because we don't want the
[SPEAKER_02]: federal government to come and say,
who is in the cannabis business?
[SPEAKER_02]: How much are they paying?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: Who are they?
[SPEAKER_02]: So we don't keep those lists.
[SPEAKER_02]: But we are also saying you need to be
compliant with your taxes, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: That is so important.
[SPEAKER_02]: And under Prop 215, one of the
requirements is if you are a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're supposed to get a seller's permit
and collect and remit sales taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, some of the more sophisticated,
larger, older dispensaries have been
[SPEAKER_02]: complying.
[SPEAKER_02]: So they have been doing the right thing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Some of the newer players in the industry
have not necessarily been doing that.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that's one of the reasons we are
here, is to say you need to get your
[SPEAKER_02]: seller's permit.
[SPEAKER_02]: If you are selling to the public,
you need to collect the proper amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: tax based on where you are located.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're supposed to remit it to
the Board of Equalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I think that's important in 2018 that
many of the local jurisdictions are going
[SPEAKER_02]: to be issuing the licenses.
[SPEAKER_02]: And one of the criteria we believe is
gonna be compliance.
[SPEAKER_02]: How compliant have you been in obeying the
laws?
[SPEAKER_02]: Have you been paying your taxes,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you say no, but you've been in
business for 15 years, that could be a
[SPEAKER_02]: problem, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So I would say it's never too late to
start.
[SPEAKER_02]: Get your seller's permit if you haven't
gotten it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Definitely, you know, we have a lot of
information on our website.
[SPEAKER_02]: We go out and give seminars.
[SPEAKER_02]: I have a lot of staff members here who can
help you with that.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I think that is first and foremost.
[SPEAKER_02]: There were a couple bills in the
legislature this past season and we're
[SPEAKER_02]: hoping they pass.
[SPEAKER_02]: Assemblymember Mike Gibson has AB 821 to
remove the 10% fee on licensed cannabis
[SPEAKER_02]: operators.
[SPEAKER_02]: And as the congressman knows, banking is
very, very difficult for this industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yet all of the tax agencies assess a 10%
penalty if you pay in cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: How is that fair that you are penalizing
an industry and giving them no other
[SPEAKER_02]: option but paying by cash?
[SPEAKER_02]: So Assemblymember Gibson has a bill on the
governor's desk right now if you wanna
[SPEAKER_02]: weigh in.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's AB 821 to remove the 10% penalty if
you pay your taxes in cash.
[SPEAKER_02]: The second one is also by Assemblymember
Gibson, AB 567, which would create a tax
[SPEAKER_02]: amnesty for any business that comes
forward voluntarily in a certain window in
[SPEAKER_02]: 2017.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if this bill passes, there will be a
small window.
[SPEAKER_02]: Companies, cannabis dispensary operators
should come forward, pay their taxes for
[SPEAKER_02]: this year and the last three years to
avoid any sort of penalty.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now the BOE, we can legally come in and
audit you and go back three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you don't have any tax records,
it's gonna be very hard to defend what our
[SPEAKER_02]: auditors are just gonna assume is your
practice.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what we do is normally we will sit
outside your dispensary and count the
[SPEAKER_02]: number of people that come in on a three
day period and we try to pick different
[SPEAKER_02]: days like a weekday, a weekend,
an evening and then they average out how
[SPEAKER_02]: many people come in to your desk at your
dispensary, they average about how much
[SPEAKER_02]: they think they're spending and then we
extrapolate back three years.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you don't agree with that number
but you don't have any tax records,
[SPEAKER_02]: you're probably gonna lose when you come
before us on the appeals board and we are
[SPEAKER_02]: starting to hear cases now at our board of
cannabis operators who disagree with our
[SPEAKER_02]: auditors but don't bring us anything.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so that is just something I would just
like to give you guys a tip about is keep
[SPEAKER_02]: records, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: If our auditors come out, you don't agree,
you have better records, we will use your
[SPEAKER_02]: records at least, that's like the minimum.
[SPEAKER_03]: Michael, from just switching gears a
little bit from finances to farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Come 2018, what are some of the things
from your point of view that farmers are
[SPEAKER_03]: gonna have to be ready to do if they're
not doing it now, what should people in
[SPEAKER_03]: that world do to be prepared?
[SPEAKER_01]: Right, that's a really good question and
just by way of background, I work in
[SPEAKER_01]: private industry, we work on regulation
development and environmental impact
[SPEAKER_01]: reports for state agencies on regulatory
programs and maybe four years ago my
[SPEAKER_01]: business partner said to me, he said,
wouldn't it be neat if we did the
[SPEAKER_01]: environmental impact report for
legalization of marijuana in California,
[SPEAKER_01]: I said, yeah, that'd be great,
how would we ever do that?
[SPEAKER_01]: And here we are four years later doing it,
so this is a very exciting time for us.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we are helping, we're right at the
outset right now with the Department of
[SPEAKER_01]: Food and Agriculture and their medical
cannabis cultivation program and
[SPEAKER_01]: identifying all the regulations that
they're gonna need to establish and adopt
[SPEAKER_01]: and have ready to go and implement on
January 1st, 2018.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I can say is as was mentioned
before with lawmaking, developing a
[SPEAKER_01]: regulation regulatory program like this
and the associated software that the
[SPEAKER_01]: state's gonna have so people can apply for
their licenses online and establishing a
[SPEAKER_01]: track and trace system that's gonna trace
the product through the whole production
[SPEAKER_01]: cycle, that's a heavy lift and the state
has a lot on its plate right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would say their primary focus is on
complying with what the statute says,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's a lot of additional functionality
and things they'd like to be able to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that they're not gonna be able to do on
day one and they're gonna face that in
[SPEAKER_01]: over time.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they're looking at just basically
meeting the requirement that they're able
[SPEAKER_01]: to take applications and they're able to
issue those licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: So some of the things that growers can be
looking for if you are intending to apply
[SPEAKER_01]: for a license is first of all,
you're gonna need to have your local
[SPEAKER_01]: approval in hand if you're gonna be a
medical cannabis grower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that will change under Prop 64 for
recreational cannabis cultivation,
[SPEAKER_01]: does not require a local approval.
[SPEAKER_01]: But as things stand now for medical
cultivation, you're gonna need to have
[SPEAKER_01]: that approval in place.
[SPEAKER_01]: In fact, before you go to the Department
of Food and Agriculture to get your
[SPEAKER_01]: license, you're gonna need to have every
other state and local agency approval in
[SPEAKER_01]: hand demonstrated that you've gotten that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that may be a stream bed alteration
agreement from the Department of Fish and
[SPEAKER_01]: Wildlife.
[SPEAKER_01]: It may be coverage under the general order
for the regional water quality control
[SPEAKER_01]: board.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically CDFA is gonna bat last.
[SPEAKER_01]: The second thing I could say is that a lot
of the requirements that are gonna be
[SPEAKER_01]: placed upon growers now are things that
maybe a lot of growers have not had to
[SPEAKER_01]: handle in the past.
[SPEAKER_01]: And these are really things that many
other businesses are up to speed on.
[SPEAKER_01]: But because cannabis production has not
really been a regulated program by the
[SPEAKER_01]: state in the past, many business people in
this industry don't understand these.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this includes Cal OSHA regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And workplace safety standards for farm
workers.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who are working on the cannabis
sites.
[SPEAKER_01]: People who are part of the trimmer
community and are coming for short periods
[SPEAKER_01]: of time to different cannabis farms.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's gonna need to be proper sanitation
facilities offered for them.
[SPEAKER_01]: Places where they can stay.
[SPEAKER_01]: So there's gonna be, in addition to just
complying with the state's requirements
[SPEAKER_01]: for the Department of Food and Agriculture
is gonna place, there's also a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: just basic laws related to running a
business such as having your board of
[SPEAKER_01]: equalization seller's permit.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's really in brief some of the
requirements.
[SPEAKER_03]: One of my favorite stories when I was
first starting CCIA was one of my founding
[SPEAKER_03]: board members is a rice farmer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Took me up to his property and just said,
showed me his one acre of land he had
[SPEAKER_03]: ready to go for that one day.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he looked at me and just said,
Nate, I've been filling out these
[SPEAKER_03]: Department of Food and Agriculture forms
since I was 15 years old.
[SPEAKER_03]: I know what I'm doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: Most of these guys don't.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we need to make sure that they know
what they're doing.
[SPEAKER_03]: That they know how to be in compliance
with all of this.
[SPEAKER_03]: So that way they all don't just get mowed
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's gonna be key.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what we're gonna do.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks for watching!
Thanks for watching!
