[SPEAKER_05]: Our next panel, which is the industry
perspective.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Nate Bradley, Executive Director with
California Cannabis Industry Association.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hezekiah Allen, Chair and Executive
Director for the California Growers
[SPEAKER_05]: Association.
[SPEAKER_05]: And Keith Stevenson, Executive Director of
the Purple Heart Patient Center.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Christy Knoblick.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm excited to be here to provide some
feedback, so thank you for the
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I am the owner and co-founder of Kiva
Confections.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're a chocolate manufacturing company,
edibles company, located in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we also do distribution throughout the
state.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm here as a member of CCMA and CCIA,
the California Cannabis Industry
[SPEAKER_00]: Association.
[SPEAKER_00]: I sit on the board of directors there,
and I also chair the manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: committee.
[SPEAKER_00]: The CCIA has worked with the legislature
to provide feedback on both MRSA and Prop
[SPEAKER_00]: 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're excited to continue to do that
with you, to work together and provide
[SPEAKER_00]: some collaboration so we can make sure we
get the system done right.
[SPEAKER_00]: As a part of the association, we've
created 12 major points that we are
[SPEAKER_00]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking to focus on, I'm only going to
talk about four today.
[SPEAKER_00]: But to highlight, we really want to
emphasize the importance of one system.
[SPEAKER_00]: So medical and recreational coming
together, and we think that will ease in
[SPEAKER_00]: the ability to become compliant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So one of the first items is the
importance of a phase in with the
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing program.
[SPEAKER_00]: So Lori Ajax mentioned this earlier as
well.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the ability for a licensed business to
also be able to work with unlicensed
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses for a set amount of time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will just allow the industry to
get going and won't bring things to a
[SPEAKER_00]: complete standstill.
[SPEAKER_00]: The other item is the thresholds for
ownership.
[SPEAKER_00]: So currently MRSA has 5% ownership.
[SPEAKER_00]: We'd like to see that come up to where
Prop 64 is with the 20% ownership.
[SPEAKER_00]: The concern there is with a 5% ownership
component, there will be a restricted
[SPEAKER_00]: access to capital.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that could potentially stifle growth
for our new and growing industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And also could present problems for
publicly traded companies.
[SPEAKER_00]: If 5% is that threshold for ownership,
they may be coming in and out of
[SPEAKER_00]: compliance as a publicly traded company.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we'd really like to see 20% on that
ownership component.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then also we'd like to see the
elimination of the cross licensure
[SPEAKER_00]: restrictions with MCRSA to allow vertical
integration just like we see it in Prop 64
[SPEAKER_00]: that's been proposed there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So MRSA is restrictive and Prop 64 has
that vertical integration component.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then finally the last issue,
and this one is of the utmost importance
[SPEAKER_00]: to me personally and to the groups we
represent.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is distribution, and so we would like to
see the distribution component that's
[SPEAKER_00]: brought up in Prop 64 versus the one
that's in MRSA which requires a third
[SPEAKER_00]: party independent distributor as a
manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: A large component of my business and
really of the way that the industry is
[SPEAKER_00]: operating right now allows for both
manufacturing and distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're definitely concerned that
restrictions restricting the amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution licenses just to those who
are solely doing distribution could have
[SPEAKER_00]: serious implications on the industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And specifically around innovation and
kind of the entrepreneurialistic spirit of
[SPEAKER_00]: California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we would like to be able to bring
products, see products brought to market
[SPEAKER_00]: through manufacturers, cultivators,
everybody having access points in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: distribution.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Please, Mr. Stevenson.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wish to speak about a few topics.
[SPEAKER_03]: One is multiple permits under one roof,
also known as colocation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definition of premise, also suitability,
also known by some cities as equity based
[SPEAKER_03]: permits.
[SPEAKER_03]: Modify the closed distribution model under
the MRSA and allow for both third party
[SPEAKER_03]: distributors and licensed in house
distributors owned by licensed
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivators, manufacturers, and or
retailers and eliminating cross licensure
[SPEAKER_03]: restrictions in the MRSA by allowing
vertical integration as currently
[SPEAKER_03]: authorized by Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_03]: My name is Keith Stevenson.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am the owner and operator of the Purple
Heart Patient Center Dispensary,
[SPEAKER_03]: which has been serving patients since
September the 18th, 2006 and is the
[SPEAKER_03]: longest running dispensary in Oakland.
[SPEAKER_03]: As a former resident of Los Angeles,
I went to aviation maintenance college and
[SPEAKER_03]: became a licensed technician for United
Airlines for 17 years before two hip
[SPEAKER_03]: replacement surgeries forced an early
retirement, which led to my involvement in
[SPEAKER_03]: the medical cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I started Purple Heart from the ground up
and currently have 26 employees.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am the textbook definition of a small
business owner.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am fortunate that unlike some of my
colleagues, I have not been incarcerated
[SPEAKER_03]: nor do I have a criminal record.
[SPEAKER_03]: I am also fortunate that the cannabis
industry has given me and has opened many
[SPEAKER_03]: other doors that would not have happened
in other fields.
[SPEAKER_03]: Before I give my input on a path forward
in the new cannabis world, I would like to
[SPEAKER_03]: thank Ms. Ajax and her staff as I was the
second dispensary they visited and I
[SPEAKER_03]: appreciate their efforts to make
themselves accessible and learn about my
[SPEAKER_03]: industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: While distinctions between the medical and
adult use cannabis frameworks are
[SPEAKER_03]: important, discrepancies between the two
frameworks will complicate implementation
[SPEAKER_03]: for state and local agencies and make
compliance more difficult for licensees.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that stated, key points include
multiple permits under one roof,
[SPEAKER_03]: also known as colocation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Multiple permits under one roof is helpful
to the geographic fabric and zoning of
[SPEAKER_03]: cities.
[SPEAKER_03]: This maintains the composition of
businesses in certain hubs, helps create
[SPEAKER_03]: natural clusters, and is beneficial to
public safety as the businesses are easier
[SPEAKER_03]: to monitor.
[SPEAKER_03]: Whether it's a dense urban city or smaller
rural city, consolidating various usage
[SPEAKER_03]: and permits into one location is a better
use of space.
[SPEAKER_03]: As an example, a medicinal cannabis
campus, similar to what biotechnology
[SPEAKER_03]: companies or public private research
centers do should be encouraged.
[SPEAKER_03]: Definition of premise, similar to a
previous topic, the final definition of
[SPEAKER_03]: where premises, as determined by the
licensing entities, will have a
[SPEAKER_03]: significant impact on local ordinances,
as well as on a licensee's ability to
[SPEAKER_03]: legally operate one state license or
issue.
[SPEAKER_03]: With so many cities and counties banning
or severely restricting cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses in their communities,
it is critically important that multiple
[SPEAKER_03]: licenses, both medical and non-medical,
be permitted on one premise.
[SPEAKER_03]: This model will allow cannabis businesses
to relocate to locally approved hubs,
[SPEAKER_03]: encouraging the creation of natural
clusters and minimizing potential impacts
[SPEAKER_03]: to public safety as clustering multiple
businesses in one location is easier to
[SPEAKER_03]: monitor and regulate.
[SPEAKER_03]: Suitability, also known by some cities,
is equity.
[SPEAKER_03]: The war on drugs has been a war on
low-income people of color.
[SPEAKER_03]: As part of the remedy, ALMA must benefit
low-income people of color and low-income
[SPEAKER_03]: communities of color.
[SPEAKER_03]: Any efforts by proponents of mass
incarceration to roll back the sentencing
[SPEAKER_03]: reforms, to limit community reinvestment,
or to create barriers to economic
[SPEAKER_03]: participation by persons with limited
capital or prior drug records would
[SPEAKER_03]: undermine basic fairness of the act and
reinforce the institutional racism of the
[SPEAKER_03]: war on drugs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Considering that men and women of color
have been disproportionately punished by
[SPEAKER_03]: the war on drugs and suffered immense
harm, many individuals with past drug
[SPEAKER_03]: offenses on their records have been
excluded from participating in this new
[SPEAKER_03]: industry, thereby furthering historic
inequities.
[SPEAKER_03]: Modify the closed distribution model under
the MRSA and allow for both third party
[SPEAKER_03]: distributors and licensed in-house
distributors.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cheers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Owned by licensed cultivators,
manufacturers, and our retailers.
[SPEAKER_03]: Strict track and trace requirements in the
MRSA language will already be tracking
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis products from seed to sale.
[SPEAKER_03]: The state already has the authority to
audit the operation of all licensees.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mandating that distribution only be
performed by an independent distributor
[SPEAKER_03]: will not reduce or prevent unlawful
diversion and could have the unintended
[SPEAKER_03]: effect of increasing diversion and earlier
points in the supply chain prior to the
[SPEAKER_03]: distribution choke point.
[SPEAKER_03]: My last topic, eliminating cross licensure
restrictions in the MRSA by allowing
[SPEAKER_03]: vertical integration as currently
authorized under Prop 24, the MRSA
[SPEAKER_03]: language places restrictions on the number
and type of licenses cannabis businesses
[SPEAKER_03]: may acquire.
[SPEAKER_03]: Prop 64 does not include prohibitions
against cross licensure and permits an
[SPEAKER_03]: existing vertically integrating small
business in the industry to be licensed by
[SPEAKER_03]: the state without forcing it to divest
itself of any part of its enterprise.
[SPEAKER_03]: To facilitate enforcement and compliance,
there should be parity between cross
[SPEAKER_03]: licensure rules in the medical and adult
use cannabis regulations.
[SPEAKER_03]: With that, I look forward to your
questions.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Allen, please.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's an honor and a pleasure, great
responsibility to be here today discussing
[SPEAKER_01]: the path forward after Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chair Caballero, Chair Salas, Chair Wood,
and indeed Chair Ridley-Thomas,
[SPEAKER_01]: we think all four of your committees need
to play a very important role in this
[SPEAKER_01]: going forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: My name is Ezekiah Allen, Executive
Director of the California Growers
[SPEAKER_01]: Association.
[SPEAKER_01]: Membership organization with more than 900
members, 40 board members representing
[SPEAKER_01]: communities in 17 counties from LA to
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_01]: My comments today focus on closing the gap
between MCRSA and Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: First and foremost, cannabis cultivation
is agriculture and should be regulated by
[SPEAKER_01]: the Department of Food and Agriculture.
[SPEAKER_01]: Chair Caballero, your presence today and
your committee's attention here is a great
[SPEAKER_01]: breakthrough in this policy area.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm going to primarily direct my
comments to you and Vice Chair Mathis,
[SPEAKER_01]: though he stepped out of the room.
[SPEAKER_01]: First and foremost, one size that does not
fit all for cultivation licensing,
[SPEAKER_01]: both Prop 64 and MCRSA have tiered
licenses.
[SPEAKER_01]: MCRSA contains cottage specialty small and
medium to ensure that regulatory
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements and fees are appropriately
scaled to the size of the grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Prop 64 creates all of these licenses,
with the exception of the cottage
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation license.
[SPEAKER_01]: Additionally, Prop 64 creates the type
five unlimited scale license in 2023.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to cultivation licenses,
we have two recommendations.
[SPEAKER_01]: And a word of caution, we would like to
ensure that the type 1C cottage
[SPEAKER_01]: cultivation license is carried from MCRSA
into Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to restrict the type five
license created in Prop 64, at least until
[SPEAKER_01]: such time as the federal government
authorizes out of state sales.
[SPEAKER_01]: Word of caution, California is already
over producing cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: Going bigger isn't going to make
regulating any easier.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recommend that this legislature
maintain limits on the scale of each grow
[SPEAKER_01]: while continuing to ensure unlimited
licenses will be available for small and
[SPEAKER_01]: specialty growers.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it comes to hemp, Proposition 64 is a
big step forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hemp is a huge opportunity for farmers
with lots of flat acres, marginal soils,
[SPEAKER_01]: and who might have some issues with water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If they need a resilient crop that can be
used for a lot of different things,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is the answer.
[SPEAKER_01]: However, there are some very real
challenges, both legal and operational,
[SPEAKER_01]: and we encourage the convening of an
informational hearing focused specifically
[SPEAKER_01]: on implementation of measures related to
hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: It really is that big for our farmers.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a critical code section in the
MCRSA that was omitted from Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or BMP code section 19328 establishes
restrictions on the types of businesses
[SPEAKER_01]: licenses that an entity may hold
simultaneously.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the section was omitted,
Prop 64 opens the flood gate to
[SPEAKER_01]: consolidation and conglomeration.
[SPEAKER_01]: We call on the legislature to correct this
with legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our growers are especially vulnerable and
we do prefer the 5% threshold for cross
[SPEAKER_01]: ownership.
[SPEAKER_01]: We would like to note that agricultural
co-ops and existing code are a great way
[SPEAKER_01]: to achieve efficiencies and onboard
investment capital without pushing
[SPEAKER_01]: independent businesses out.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the flip side, there's a critical
section that was included in Prop 64 but
[SPEAKER_01]: omitted from MCRSA.
[SPEAKER_01]: We strongly encourage the legislatures to
include the Prop 64 residency requirements
[SPEAKER_01]: in the MCRSA, ensuring that California
businesses have adequate time to meet the
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements before the flood of out of
state interests moves in.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, Prop 64 and MCRSA both
agree in the omission of a critical
[SPEAKER_01]: license type, non-storefront dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: When we talk about balancing between
access and neighborhood impacts,
[SPEAKER_01]: delivery services are a critical
component.
[SPEAKER_01]: Over the last year, we have worked through
with local government and law enforcement.
[SPEAKER_01]: There is no known opposition to these
provisions at this time.
[SPEAKER_01]: They are included in AB 64.
[SPEAKER_01]: We strongly encourage the establishment of
a non-storefront dispensary license in
[SPEAKER_01]: both Prop 64 and MCRSA.
[SPEAKER_01]: The marijuana tax included in Prop 64 is
hugely problematic.
[SPEAKER_01]: We recognize that changing the tax
language is going to be very difficult,
[SPEAKER_01]: though the task is simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can form the marijuana tax as closely as
possible to AB 2243 and SB 987 that were
[SPEAKER_01]: deliberated by your legislature last year.
[SPEAKER_01]: Specifically, a very high concern,
we think that the cultivation tax could be
[SPEAKER_01]: a barrier for entry for as many as 75% or
more of the state's cultivators,
[SPEAKER_01]: if not clarified.
[SPEAKER_01]: The proposition is inconsistent in
describing when the point of tax is due,
[SPEAKER_01]: when the product is harvested,
when the product leaves the cultivation
[SPEAKER_01]: site, and when the product enters the
commercial marketplace.
[SPEAKER_01]: That is a huge discrepancy in code.
[SPEAKER_01]: I've been a grower all of my life.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know that harvest is a long process.
[SPEAKER_01]: Times are tight, money is tight.
[SPEAKER_01]: We need to shift that burden to the point
where the product enters the commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: marketplace or else we just won't be able
to make ends meet.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's all I got for today.
[SPEAKER_05]: Everything you've heard from the local
perspective, from law enforcement,
[SPEAKER_05]: from what the agencies are doing,
I mean, do you agree, not agree?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, obviously there's still policy
issues that we need to discuss,
[SPEAKER_05]: whether it's transportation or cultivation
sizes or potency, for instance.
[SPEAKER_05]: But in terms of the coordination and the
work together, do you feel like that's
[SPEAKER_05]: fruitful, it's working, it's not working?
[SPEAKER_05]: I mean, how are you seeing this with your
daily businesses?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sure, so I would say overall we've been
engaged multiple times by the regulatory
[SPEAKER_00]: bodies.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've met a few times with the health
department.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been to a few of the stakeholder
meetings that Laurie has put on.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I would say overall input, we've been
able to define some pretty clear channels
[SPEAKER_00]: for giving input.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems as though we're in February
here, so we have a lot of work that's
[SPEAKER_00]: still needs to be done, but I would say
we're on the path to getting there.
[SPEAKER_00]: A full implementation of the system in
January still seems difficult.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's obviously a lot to be
accomplished.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think that the industry is very
willing to participate and kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: people's hearts are in the right place.
[SPEAKER_00]: The industry is very patient focused.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so with the best intentions,
I think we'll get there, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll reiterate that and say that our
experience with the agencies has been
[SPEAKER_01]: fantastic.
[SPEAKER_01]: This has been a seemingly hopeless and
impossible task from the time you guys set
[SPEAKER_01]: out to write the legislation.
[SPEAKER_01]: It took years to get to the breakthrough
that the MCRSA was.
[SPEAKER_01]: The reason that I maintain hope and
confidence that this will get done is
[SPEAKER_01]: because of the coordination we've seen
between the agencies, because of their
[SPEAKER_01]: access, because of how available they have
been.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we speak very highly of the work
that they've done.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has to be noted that in the absence of
regulation, there are a number of business
[SPEAKER_01]: models that have grown up that maybe
aren't the way that the state would like
[SPEAKER_01]: to see our marketplace move forward.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so there is tremendous strain,
particularly as those business models are
[SPEAKER_01]: disrupted.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we are trying to work through those
tensions.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our organization has taken the approach of
just tracking as closely as possible with
[SPEAKER_01]: non-traditional allies, local gov law
enforcement, and really trying to present
[SPEAKER_01]: not just a uniform unified industry
perspective, but a unified stakeholder
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's slow, it's tedious, but the
agencies are giving us hope and confidence
[SPEAKER_01]: at this point.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'd like to say personally, I think it's
incredible what the state agencies have
[SPEAKER_03]: been able to do in a collaborative effort.
[SPEAKER_03]: My initial irritations were with the BOE,
just trying to pay taxes.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was bounced around from Oakland to San
Francisco to San Jose.
[SPEAKER_03]: And you're talking about carrying large
sums of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's only to pay a bill, and now that the
state has taken appropriate actions and
[SPEAKER_03]: saying, hey, this is one of the premier
issues that we've got to deal with,
[SPEAKER_03]: is intake of the revenue.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that the fact that the state has
come together and worked across board with
[SPEAKER_03]: all the various entities have shown a
willingness to get this thing done for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, you take into consideration where you
have MRSA and Ms. A Jackson-Herter,
[SPEAKER_03]: their staff and others were working
towards a common goal.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you interject Proposition 64,
as I would say, the goal post has been
[SPEAKER_03]: moved.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the state agencies are still doing a
phenomenal job and working together and
[SPEAKER_03]: seeing this through.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just dealing with MRSA alone was a
insurmountable task.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then you add to that and you
exacerbate it by adding Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I read these articles and these
articles are somewhat written in an
[SPEAKER_03]: unfavorable manner towards the state
agencies as well as the legislators.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I just want to know from someone
that's inside of this looking out that I
[SPEAKER_03]: understand what you're dealing with and I
appreciate the work that everyone's doing
[SPEAKER_03]: together.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Let me ask, because some issues were
brought up and with your association,
[SPEAKER_05]: and with your businesses, concentration in
certain areas, edibles was another one.
[SPEAKER_05]: And just the public safety aspect,
how are you guys dealing with those?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are the discussions you're having
with folks, not just in your associations
[SPEAKER_05]: or things that you're hearing?
[SPEAKER_05]: Like most people, if you're in the world,
everyone's talking in that kind of
[SPEAKER_05]: industry or in that world.
[SPEAKER_05]: So how are you dealing with those issues?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, when it comes to issues of having
product and when the language takes place
[SPEAKER_03]: next year, January 1st, we test all our
products to the level that we're
[SPEAKER_03]: comfortable with and it's higher than what
the state probably would ask for.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the inventory that we have on hand,
I believe that we will be in a position to
[SPEAKER_03]: continue to sell that inventory.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, based on what I'm hearing from
the state, we'll probably limit our
[SPEAKER_03]: purchasing power or abilities in the
fourth quarter and kind of just let
[SPEAKER_03]: everything bleed out.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll point to the over concentration issue
and raise one of our membership's primary
[SPEAKER_01]: concerns, which is under concentration.
[SPEAKER_01]: And ultimately, I think the best way of
ensuring a balance between neighborhood
[SPEAKER_01]: impacts and access is to make sure that
there's one or two stores everywhere and
[SPEAKER_01]: there's not two dozen stores anywhere.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I definitely defer to the League of
Cities in that regard with the local
[SPEAKER_01]: control issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are definitely encouraging folks to be
very mindful of their communities.
[SPEAKER_01]: For example, in Sacramento, we supported a
community reinvestment fund that is a
[SPEAKER_01]: voluntary 1% down in your district,
particularly Mr. Ridley-Thomas.
[SPEAKER_01]: We are working with folks on measure M to
ensure those considerations are included
[SPEAKER_01]: in the post-measure D framework.
[SPEAKER_01]: Too many of these businesses in any one
place and not enough in another place,
[SPEAKER_01]: they're sort of flip sides of the same
problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what we'd like to get to do is get to
a point where things are well regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: and not banned and not concentrated,
ultimately.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hit that nice middle point.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, just working as closely with the
league, with CSAC, with RCRC, with the
[SPEAKER_01]: various stakeholders who really know more
about those topics and trying to track
[SPEAKER_01]: very closely with them as we move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Please, Ms. For, when it comes to public
safety for edibles, earlier Dr. Karen
[SPEAKER_00]: Smith from the DPH was speaking about the
threshold set by the food manufacturing
[SPEAKER_00]: industries.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cannabis manufacturing can get right
on board with most of what's being done in
[SPEAKER_00]: the rest of the world.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need thresholds.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we need thresholds for pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: We need thresholds for microbiological
contaminants.
[SPEAKER_00]: That will also potency as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that will maintain consistency and
potency from product A to product Z,
[SPEAKER_00]: batch after batch, year after year.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that responsibility should be shifted
to the manufacturer.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's also how it's done in the rest of
the world and with regular food
[SPEAKER_00]: manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So license holders will need to be held
accountable for those thresholds and for
[SPEAKER_00]: meeting those.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also, I think a huge area to show kind of
how responsible the industry is going to
be.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is in marketing and advertising,
and under no condition do any cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: operators want to see their products
consumed by children.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is bad for consumers, bad for
business, bad for the industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_00]: So nobody wants that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So part of the work that we've done with
the manufacturing committee is come up
[SPEAKER_00]: with a code of conduct for marketing and
advertising.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's borrowed from the Distilled
Spirits Council.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just talks about what we're not
going to do, basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're not going to show people overly
impaired.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're not going to print Santa Claus on
our marketing materials.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very basic, but very thorough points.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think there's a lot of education
that we need to do among the consumer
[SPEAKER_00]: base.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is certainly a responsibility on
the side of the manufacturer to not make
[SPEAKER_00]: products that are attracted to children.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we also need to educate consumers on
where to store them, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they need to be out of reach of
children.
[SPEAKER_00]: And kids need to know these products in
this package or in this child-resistant
[SPEAKER_00]: exit bag, for example.
[SPEAKER_00]: These are not for kids, these are for
parents.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think once we start having those
conversations, we'll be well on our way to
[SPEAKER_00]: a responsible system.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I think that's what Dr. Smith had
said was OPEC could see the product and
[SPEAKER_05]: then the child-resistant features that are
accompanied with them.
[SPEAKER_05]: We are running short on time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Ridley-Thomas.
[SPEAKER_04]: I would argue that there's no such thing
as under-concentration in these
[SPEAKER_04]: businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's probably not even legally defined.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'll take the two that would be in
Leimert Park and give them anywhere else,
[SPEAKER_04]: anywhere else, literally.
[SPEAKER_04]: And while you say that the local
governments are experts, they are not.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are simply stakeholders.
[SPEAKER_04]: The experts are the people who will bother
me in the middle of the night when these
[SPEAKER_04]: businesses are overrun, particularly the
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now, it's not the whole supply.
[SPEAKER_04]: And this is something that the voters in
their wisdom decided to embrace,
[SPEAKER_04]: and many members of this legislature
support.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it is unacceptable if this system is
so porous that it allows for substantial
[SPEAKER_04]: concentration.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I will blow your phone up as it
happens.
[SPEAKER_04]: One thing I would think that you can help
us with in Los Angeles in the immediate
[SPEAKER_04]: notwithstanding measure M.
[SPEAKER_04]: Will be whether or not we can get the
unlicensed businesses or these different
[SPEAKER_04]: business models to quickly come into the
marvelous light.
[SPEAKER_04]: And there's only so much that local
government, the community groups,
[SPEAKER_04]: that the press can do.
[SPEAKER_04]: The industry is going to have to step up.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I'm not necessarily asking for a
response, but with due respect,
[SPEAKER_04]: because of how over-concentrated it
becomes, there will not be many of these
[SPEAKER_04]: facilities in the Palisades, and I'm quite
sure.
[SPEAKER_04]: I didn't look at all how it passed,
but it passed a little higher on the west
[SPEAKER_04]: side than it did in south Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_04]: It passed in south Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_04]: You all did a good marketing job.
[SPEAKER_04]: But it's not even comparable what happens
to Ms. Noblet from the industry
[SPEAKER_04]: association.
[SPEAKER_04]: To this legislator's ears, it sounds like
that you're arguing in your opening
[SPEAKER_04]: statement for less regulation.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's unacceptable.
[SPEAKER_04]: That will not be something that will hunt.
[SPEAKER_04]: Now Oakland is different from Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_04]: The Bay Area was much more accepting of
various types of marijuana being
[SPEAKER_04]: distributed in your areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: Good for you, good for the people that you
work around.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's not the same in Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_04]: Nor will it be tolerated when things like
cash carrying businesses get robbed,
[SPEAKER_04]: stores get broken into, and we have a
concentration of individuals who are
[SPEAKER_04]: trying to access these services if they're
not using one of the mobile distribution
[SPEAKER_04]: services.
[SPEAKER_04]: So it's a little different, the argument
that you bring.
[SPEAKER_04]: But regulation, in and of itself,
and the reduction in regulation is an
[SPEAKER_04]: unacceptable argument for this type of
industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I would caution that as you come and
testify in your industry association that
[SPEAKER_04]: you pay your membership dues and you
employ advocates to market on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Reduced regulation is an unacceptable
argument.
[SPEAKER_04]: It doesn't even stand to reason because of
things like being able to test whether or
[SPEAKER_04]: not somebody is intoxicated.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's not even the word.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Ridley taught us things that we
discussed in the earlier pattern.
[SPEAKER_04]: I get it, but Mr. Chairman, to be clear,
this witness spoke to that in her opening
[SPEAKER_04]: that they wanted essentially, in a
condensed version of that, reduced
[SPEAKER_04]: regulation or the state to appreciate that
the industry is needed to mature.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's an unacceptable argument.
[SPEAKER_04]: That is really an unacceptable argument.
[SPEAKER_04]: The best case scenario for this would be
something like three tiers where
[SPEAKER_04]: wholesale, retail, and distribution are
separate and do not have ownership stakes.
[SPEAKER_04]: And capital, frankly, will come to the
market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Capital will come to those businesses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And just because you want a profit from
one part of another, maybe something of
[SPEAKER_04]: which you have to give up for being in
this industry is to not be able to have
[SPEAKER_04]: different parts of the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_04]: But to me, that is an unacceptable
argument.
[SPEAKER_04]: To have reduced regulation in what is
essentially a nuisance industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I refuse to allow us to normalize this
discussion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And it is different for different areas.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's all I have to say, Mr. Chairman.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think you've made your point and
where you stand on these issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think when Ms. Noblich, I think it
was, was talking earlier, it was about the
[SPEAKER_05]: different tiered sections for
transportation.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm trying to figure out, just for
clarification, are we moving, you're not
[SPEAKER_05]: asking for less.
[SPEAKER_05]: The way I heard it was not less
regulation, but that we move to a
[SPEAKER_05]: regulatory body within the scheme work of
the two propositions that have passed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that's kind of where we're at.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, yeah, I'll just respectfully clarify
what I meant to say there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I think that the two points I was
trying to make was that businesses that
[SPEAKER_00]: don't have a license will be able to work
with businesses that are getting up to
[SPEAKER_00]: speed, or I guess those that have licenses
and those that don't have licenses will be
[SPEAKER_00]: able to work together for a set amount of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I think where I misunderstood is in
allowing a vertical integration.
[SPEAKER_00]: Was it potentially that?
[SPEAKER_00]: So Prop 64 allows for vertical
integration, so we're not suggesting that
[SPEAKER_00]: we go outside of either of those two
systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: But that we bring MRSA closer to what
we're seeing in Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think our industry needs regulation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You could take a look at my business.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've been operating as though we've had
regulation for six years.
[SPEAKER_00]: We test all of our products, as Keith had
mentioned they do as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We test all of our products for food
safety, for microbiological contaminants
[SPEAKER_00]: for potency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I can sit here and tell you very
honestly, that I fully believe that we
[SPEAKER_00]: need safe products out there, and we need
to make sure the right players are
[SPEAKER_00]: operating in the right way.
[SPEAKER_00]: So by no means do I think the industry
needs to continue how it's been,
[SPEAKER_00]: because we've grown up past that,
and it's time to adopt sensible,
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible regulation, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Respectfully, Chair, a brief comment
related to vertical integration and the
[SPEAKER_01]: independent mandate for distribution.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to be clear, Chair Ridley-Thomas,
our organization did not support Prop 64
[SPEAKER_01]: for some of the very reasons I think that
you point out.
[SPEAKER_01]: We think it relaxed regulations too
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: Of course, there's a concern about
regulatory capture from the government's
[SPEAKER_01]: perspective.
[SPEAKER_01]: Our concerns are more focused on market
capture, but they are very similar pieces
[SPEAKER_01]: of the same issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't see Prop 64 as relieving the
mandate for a licensed distribution tier
[SPEAKER_01]: in the supply chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: We simply see that it's allowed to be
cross licensed with other licensees.
[SPEAKER_01]: This will, in effect, create one of the
worst outcomes, whereby well capitalized,
[SPEAKER_01]: well positioned businesses will be able to
vertically integrate, realize those
[SPEAKER_01]: efficiencies, and gain a competitive
advantage.
[SPEAKER_01]: While the smaller, most vulnerable
businesses, particularly the growers,
[SPEAKER_01]: will continue to be left working with an
independent distributor because they
[SPEAKER_01]: simply can't afford to cross license.
[SPEAKER_01]: The micro business license type that was
created by Prop 64 does create some relief
[SPEAKER_01]: for relief to this, but at the end of the
day, what we want to be very careful about
[SPEAKER_01]: is that as we ease regulations,
which I think some stakeholders are
[SPEAKER_01]: certainly calling for, we don't want to do
that in a way that it disproportionately
[SPEAKER_01]: benefits well capitalized businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we do ease those restrictions,
but it's a very high financial burden,
[SPEAKER_01]: we'll produce some of the worst outcomes
possible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so just wanted to be attentive to that
issue.
[SPEAKER_01]: We do tend to prefer the more regulated
framework in the MCRSA.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a starting point, and as we get our
bearings as a marketplace, as we figure
[SPEAKER_01]: things out and have better data,
then we can move forward into a more
[SPEAKER_01]: relaxed framework.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know everyone's working hard to
create that regulatory scheme work and
[SPEAKER_05]: framework for us to operate off of.
[SPEAKER_05]: We'll continue to have additional hearings
to talk about some of these things.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know we'll be debating some of these
policy areas in terms of vertical
[SPEAKER_05]: integration, transportation, tiered,
not tiered system in the near future as we
[SPEAKER_05]: continue to move forward.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I know, I believe each of the chairs
have probably talked to each of the
[SPEAKER_05]: departments as well and a number of the
stakeholders that continue to come into
[SPEAKER_05]: our offices on these issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: So definitely looking forward to those
discussions.
[SPEAKER_05]: But Mr. Wood?
[SPEAKER_02]: Just a comment, kind of a clarification.
[SPEAKER_02]: When MCRSA was put together, one of the
reasons that we looked at limiting
[SPEAKER_02]: vertical integration was the desire to
keep businesses smaller.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so grandfathering existing businesses
that are vertically integrated isn't an
[SPEAKER_02]: issue for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: What I'm concerned about is the mega
business that comes in grows in an
[SPEAKER_02]: unlimited scale or limited only by
geography or water or whatever at huge
[SPEAKER_02]: scales that can then test their own
products, manufacture their own products,
[SPEAKER_02]: and sell their own products in their own
stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know of any other industry out
there that does that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Certainly not at the scale.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's one of the concerns that after
hundreds of hours of deliberation with the
[SPEAKER_02]: legislature, we chose to do it a certain
way.
[SPEAKER_02]: So obviously we see a conflict.
[SPEAKER_02]: We see a conflict here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Distribution from the legislature's
perspective was a tax collection point.
[SPEAKER_02]: Primarily a tax collection point.
[SPEAKER_02]: So what I didn't see in Prop 64,
which I still fail to see, is how we're
[SPEAKER_02]: going to reconcile that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because how are we going to collect the
taxes, which was a big push by the
[SPEAKER_02]: coalition of how this was going to play
out well for California, a billion dollars
[SPEAKER_02]: in taxes.
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are we going to collect those taxes
without some sort of a component related
[SPEAKER_02]: to distribution or testing or something?
[SPEAKER_02]: So how that all comes together so that the
promise of the taxes for the legislature
[SPEAKER_02]: to protect kids, to protect the
environment, to protect against the black
[SPEAKER_02]: market is actually realized.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see how all of this plays
together.
[SPEAKER_02]: But certainly from a business perspective,
the concept of unlimited vertical
[SPEAKER_02]: integration, I think there's a challenge
there that certainly is in huge conflict
[SPEAKER_02]: with what the legislature envisions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we'll see how it plays out.
[SPEAKER_05]: We probably could have a whole hearing
just on that.
[SPEAKER_05]: Just on this one topic.
[SPEAKER_05]: Mr. Stevenson, please, and let's move on.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yes, when we speak of vertical
integration, one of my most expensive line
[SPEAKER_03]: items in our budget is purchasing cost of
goods.
[SPEAKER_03]: If I'm able to produce the majority of the
things that I need in house, that allows
[SPEAKER_03]: me to be a much more fiscally responsible
business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I operate under the premise that when
I initially started doing this,
[SPEAKER_03]: people went to jail.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as the industry has chosen to grow up
and expand, I've been forced to grow my
[SPEAKER_03]: business, which either I can do it if I
want or I don't have to.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm choosing to do it.
[SPEAKER_03]: What I do not want is for the legislative
assembly to limit the size and growth of
[SPEAKER_03]: my business.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not concerned about anyone coming from
outside with unlimited amounts of money.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm not concerned about any
multi-conglomerates.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because as long as there's a federal state
issue, they're not going to come into this
[SPEAKER_03]: space.
[SPEAKER_03]: I don't anticipate these businesses coming
into this space for at least ten years.
[SPEAKER_03]: Mr. Ridley-Thomas and Mr. Silas,
you come from areas, you represent areas
[SPEAKER_03]: that have high unemployment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm very aware of your area, Mr.
Ridley-Thomas.
[SPEAKER_03]: I grew up in South Central Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is an emerging paradigm, an emerging
market that has the opportunity to
[SPEAKER_03]: gainfully employ those individuals who are
unemployable.
[SPEAKER_03]: I asked you to look at this in a different
light.
[SPEAKER_03]: I understand what you're dealing with in
LA.
[SPEAKER_03]: The issue in LA is not with the industry,
it's the lack of oversight by the city of
[SPEAKER_03]: Los Angeles.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't have those issues in Northern
California.
[SPEAKER_03]: So when you guys, and I'm not being gender
specific, when you all look at this
[SPEAKER_03]: business model, I want you to look at it
with a clear, concise, state of mind that
[SPEAKER_03]: this has been permitted since 1996,
and it's time for the industry to grow up.
[SPEAKER_03]: And please do not limit me by legislative
laws.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: Thank you, thank you guys for your
comments and for being here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Obviously, like I said, we could probably
have a hearing just on this and we will
[SPEAKER_05]: have an additional follow-up hearing
because I know there are other
[SPEAKER_05]: associations and alliances and whatnot
that weren't able to be on this agenda
[SPEAKER_05]: because it was already packed.
[SPEAKER_05]: We started working on this hearing last
year right after the proposition passed.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we'll continue to hold another one as
we move forward for this upcoming year.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then obviously, we'll do the
oversight.
[SPEAKER_05]: As legislators in coming years to see how
everything is going along.
[SPEAKER_05]: But thank you guys for your testimony and
thank you for being here.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
