[SPEAKER_01]: So another example of the pains that we
face beyond banking, beyond taxes,
[SPEAKER_01]: would be we recently were sued under
California law under Proposition 65.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is something that no one ever told
us about.
[SPEAKER_01]: No lawyers ever really warned us about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But basically, at Proposition 65,
it says under California law that cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: is one of the chemicals that causes
cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you've seen these signs before at
restaurants that say Proposition 65.
[SPEAKER_01]: We may have chemicals that cause cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I guess dispensaries were supposed
to post a sign, and no one really knew
[SPEAKER_01]: this, that says cannabis may cause cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now that's crazy to us because obviously
people are coming in here to help get rid
[SPEAKER_01]: of their cancers.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what happened was there was an
individual lawyer who went to maybe about
[SPEAKER_01]: 20 dispensaries in the state of
California.
[SPEAKER_01]: And basically to put together a lawsuit to
sue the dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he sued all of us and said,
they came to the collective.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't have a Proposition 65 sign.
[SPEAKER_01]: Therefore, they're suing us.
[SPEAKER_01]: About eight of us got together with one
lawyer and formed a group and defended it
[SPEAKER_01]: as a group.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I remember that after about six months
or so into the deal, our lawyers called
[SPEAKER_01]: us.
[SPEAKER_01]: We all got on the phone and they said,
hey, they're willing to settle now.
[SPEAKER_01]: You guys, you did violate the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're going to have to pay this.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're going to have to pay their attorney
fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we think we got a really good deal.
[SPEAKER_01]: But you're going to have to post several
signs all over the store.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my immediate reaction was,
well, I don't want to post a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: signs all over the store that says
cannabis causes cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: What are we supposed to do?
[SPEAKER_01]: We'll just do that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he said, well, they're really pushing
to have all these notices.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if we try to fight this more,
we're going to have to pay the attorney
[SPEAKER_01]: fees.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still going to lose.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe they'll do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I felt like, well, I represent
patients.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm the president of a nonprofit.
[SPEAKER_01]: They spend their money here.
[SPEAKER_01]: They have faith in us.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think for the patients, my worst
fear would be that someone knows a
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis patient.
[SPEAKER_01]: They come home with some product,
say an elderly.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was thinking like an elderly person that
gets cancer or something like that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And they look at the package and they say,
well, I'm not going to try this because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's says right on the package that it
causes cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they could not try it.
[SPEAKER_01]: They could die.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's just unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we actually, we fought the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did have to pay more money.
[SPEAKER_01]: But at the end of the day, we made it for
everyone in the industry in California to
[SPEAKER_01]: post a small amount of signage.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we have to have one, when you walk into
the showroom, you need to have one visible
[SPEAKER_01]: and then either on your receipt or on the
point of sale system itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we put ours on our receipt.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then we put one sign in the showroom.
[SPEAKER_01]: But they actually wanted like,
it was going to be like four or five
[SPEAKER_01]: signs.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we said no.
[SPEAKER_01]: And now our thing would be, we got to
change this law.
[SPEAKER_01]: But with all the fights we have on our
hands, we'll see when we get to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But we need to come together as an
industry and change this ridiculous law
[SPEAKER_01]: that says cannabis causes cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, I didn't get to how much we had to
pay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, it was, it was like 16 or 17,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then it was 8,000.
[SPEAKER_01]: Then we had to pay our lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it was like over 20 grand.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the crazy thing is that this attorney
that sued us, he didn't even have to prove
[SPEAKER_01]: that it causes cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unfortunately, and I'm not that well
versed on this, but unfortunately,
[SPEAKER_01]: sometime in the past, the state of
California actually used a study that I
[SPEAKER_01]: was told was by Donald Tashkin,
MD, who is a lawyer.
[SPEAKER_01]: He's a big cannabis doctor at UCLA.
[SPEAKER_01]: And he's been in the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I heard that he had an early study
that said cannabis causes cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they could cause cancer.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's what they use for Prop 65 law.
[SPEAKER_01]: But since then, he's overturned that study
and said that that's not true.
[SPEAKER_00]: What is the evidence that marijuana
smoking, habitual marijuana smoking can
[SPEAKER_00]: lead to lung cancer?
[SPEAKER_00]: With respect to the development of lung
cancer, we found no evidence of any
[SPEAKER_00]: increased risk of lung cancer occurrence
in association with marijuana smoking
[SPEAKER_00]: alone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The marijuana smokers, if anything,
had a reduced risk for developing lung
[SPEAKER_00]: cancer.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not a significantly reduced risk,
but reduced less than one fold.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that means reduced.
[SPEAKER_00]: THC actually has an anti-tumoral effect.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these are studies that were done both
in experimental animals and in cell
[SPEAKER_00]: culture systems.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for different kinds of cancer,
for lung cancer, breast cancer,
[SPEAKER_00]: thyroid cancer, prostate cancer,
gliomas, brain cancer, that the
[SPEAKER_00]: development and growth actually of the
tumor is suppressed by THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And metastases are also suppressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: The average smoker of marijuana whom we
recruited smoked three joints a day for
[SPEAKER_00]: about 15 years.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what do we find?
[SPEAKER_00]: For any category of cannabis use,
including heavy use, heavy use we define
[SPEAKER_00]: as more than 10 joint years.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we looked at 20 joint years and 30
joint years.
[SPEAKER_00]: For every category of marijuana use,
the ratio was less than one, meaning
[SPEAKER_00]: reduced risk.
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't significantly reduced,
but it was reduced.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so that's what we need to get in front
of the legislators and change this law.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's kind of far from our minds with
all the other stuff we have to deal with.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've already settled.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
Thank you.
