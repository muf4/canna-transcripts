[SPEAKER_08]: This is City Council direction to staff on
regulating the sale, manufacturing,
[SPEAKER_08]: cultivation, transport, taxation,
and licensing all in one night of the
[SPEAKER_08]: adult use of non-medical marijuana in the
City of West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have staff with us to give a report.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight we bring to you the topic of adult
use of marijuana, also called non-medical
[SPEAKER_04]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: As we all know, personal use of marijuana
will become legal in January.
[SPEAKER_04]: Along with personal use comes a lot of
decisions that local jurisdictions have to
[SPEAKER_04]: make regarding land use regulations of
marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: Planning staff, along with the City
Attorney's Office, Code Compliance,
[SPEAKER_04]: and Finance have been reviewing state law
and attending various seminars on this
[SPEAKER_04]: topic.
[SPEAKER_04]: Tonight's staff report is not asking the
council to adopt an ordinance or to make
[SPEAKER_04]: any specific decisions.
[SPEAKER_04]: Instead, it's to provide the City Council
information and to ask the council for
[SPEAKER_04]: direction on how the council would like us
to respond to the new world that's coming
[SPEAKER_04]: towards us in January.
[SPEAKER_04]: So with that, I'd like to introduce Jerry
Hittleman, a contract planner that is
[SPEAKER_04]: working on this item for us, and he will
provide the presentation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you, honorable mayor and council
members.
[SPEAKER_03]: As you know, the Proposition 64 was
approved last November, and it legalizes
[SPEAKER_03]: non-medical use of marijuana by persons 21
years of age, and allows people to
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivate up to six plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: It creates a state regulatory and
licensing system that is in the works
[SPEAKER_03]: right now, and it allows local governments
to prohibit or regulate license commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: retail sales, and actually encourages them
to do that prior to January 1st,
[SPEAKER_03]: 2018, when the state will start issuing
licenses.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is a comparison chart showing medical
versus non-medical marijuana regulation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Under taxation, as you know, you can have
license fees, but in order to do a sales
[SPEAKER_03]: tax, you would have to have a valid
initiative, and the earliest to do that is
[SPEAKER_03]: in 2019.
[SPEAKER_03]: It allows local regulation to prohibit or
regulate non-medical marijuana,
[SPEAKER_03]: and then personal cultivation is allowed,
and that can be done indoors, but outdoor
[SPEAKER_03]: regulation can be prohibited, and you can
also regulate the indoor cultivation by
[SPEAKER_03]: commercial growers, and the outdoor
cultivation as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: On personal use, people 21 years or older
can use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can possess up to 28.5 grams.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's about a baggie of loose marijuana,
or eight grams of concentrated,
[SPEAKER_03]: such as a food product, and, of course,
you may smoke or ingest marijuana or
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana products.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there are some personal use
restrictions.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no smoking in a public place.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's no smoking where tobacco is
prohibited.
[SPEAKER_03]: Within 1,000 feet of a school,
when driving or riding a vehicle,
[SPEAKER_03]: and cities may prohibit smoking in
city-owned buildings, and employers may
[SPEAKER_03]: also maintain a drug-free workplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: Again, cities may regulate or reasonably
regulate the indoor cultivation of up to
[SPEAKER_03]: six plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can do it on a greenhouse or other
structures, and local governments may
[SPEAKER_03]: regulate or prohibit outdoor cultivation.
[SPEAKER_03]: What are reasonable regulations?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can require a cultivation permit.
[SPEAKER_03]: That requires the permit holder to allow
the city to come in and inspect to make
[SPEAKER_03]: sure you have a six-plant limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're not drawing from the electrical
power grid or presenting a health hazard
[SPEAKER_03]: or using more water than is reasonable.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, you can enforce the building and
fire codes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Cities may regulate or prohibit marijuana,
but you cannot prohibit the transport on
[SPEAKER_03]: public roads.
[SPEAKER_03]: So if someone wants to transport marijuana
through the city on a public road,
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to allow that.
[SPEAKER_03]: The state standards are minimum standards.
[SPEAKER_03]: The city can regulate much stricter than
the state can.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, under commercial operations,
also the city is not required to enact a
[SPEAKER_03]: regulatory screen.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, again, the state will begin
issuing licenses on January 1,
[SPEAKER_03]: 2018, and the city can place prohibitions
on and regulate commercial marijuana.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, there are, again, as John mentioned,
we want you to look at some local policy
[SPEAKER_03]: issues about what the city wants to
regulate or prohibit certain parts of this
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana proposition.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the first one is, do you want to enact
regulations for non-medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: businesses?
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, do you want to require retailers to
enforce eligibility of medical marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: cards, which would enforce a sales tax
exemption?
[SPEAKER_03]: And also, do you want to impose local
taxes on marijuana?
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, moving on, should the city allow
existing medical marijuana collectives to
[SPEAKER_03]: also sell non-medical marijuana?
[SPEAKER_03]: That would limit it to the sale of the
four existing collectives that are already
[SPEAKER_03]: in West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the next two bullet points just talk
about, do you want to reevaluate the
[SPEAKER_03]: licensing requirements for dispensing of
medical and non-medical marijuana?
[SPEAKER_03]: Moving on, should the city limit the
number or location of marijuana retail
[SPEAKER_03]: stores?
[SPEAKER_03]: And then getting to the taxation issue
again, should the city tie approval of any
[SPEAKER_03]: retail sales of marijuana to the passage
of a related sales tax ballot initiative,
[SPEAKER_03]: which could, the earliest you can do that
is 2019, so you'd have to wait till that
[SPEAKER_03]: time.
[SPEAKER_03]: Also, prohibit smoking or use of marijuana
can public property again, prohibit the
[SPEAKER_03]: possession and smoking of marijuana at any
public place.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you want to allow the manufacturer
extraction testing or processing of
[SPEAKER_03]: marijuana plants or products?
[SPEAKER_03]: And also warehousing is another thing to
consider.
[SPEAKER_03]: Should that be allowed or regulated?
[SPEAKER_03]: Then again, should the city impose indoor
cultivation regulations that are
[SPEAKER_03]: reasonable?
[SPEAKER_03]: And should the city allow outdoor
cultivation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, the next steps towards non-medical
marijuana regulation, we propose holding a
[SPEAKER_03]: series of community meetings this month
and next month, coming back to the council
[SPEAKER_03]: for further direction in late summer of
this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: In the fall, we'd go to the planning
commission and review a draft marijuana
[SPEAKER_03]: ordinance and then bring that ordinance to
the city council for approval in the fall
[SPEAKER_03]: or winter.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank you, and we're open for
questions on regulating marijuana.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mayor.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to ask a question of staff
before we get to speakers.
[SPEAKER_14]: When we're talking about regulating
marijuana in this area, does it have to be
[SPEAKER_14]: tied to the land?
[SPEAKER_14]: Does it have to be a land use issue,
or can we tie it to a bill or a business
[SPEAKER_14]: license and make it a business licensing
issue instead of a land use issue?
[SPEAKER_14]: Or can we do both, or can they preclude
one another?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think typically it would probably be
both.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's how we did medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's a planning.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's allowed in the zoning ordinance,
but then it's really regulated through the
[SPEAKER_04]: business license permit.
[SPEAKER_14]: Because the reason I ask is there may be
some operators that we want to continue to
[SPEAKER_14]: work with and others who may be a disaster
for us that we don't want to continue to
[SPEAKER_14]: be in business with them.
[SPEAKER_14]: So all right, thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_07]: Hal Lewis, Jackie Sueback, followed by
Wesley Bridal.
[SPEAKER_02]: First, my name's Hal Lewis.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am extremely excited.
[SPEAKER_02]: As you know, I did have a business here at
one time called Alice's Care Center,
[SPEAKER_02]: which helped patients get through their
times of need.
[SPEAKER_02]: I own a manufacturing company who deals
with topicals only.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not trying to get people high.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're trying to get people better through
topicals, tinctures, and suppositories.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I am excited to be able to come back to
West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now, let me get this up because I have a
statement from Jackie Sueback,
[SPEAKER_02]: and a lot of things have changed.
[SPEAKER_02]: One of the things I'd like to ask of is if
we could change the name from marijuana to
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis, which the BCR did, because
marijuana is a derogatory, basically,
[SPEAKER_02]: comment.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a slang word for cannabis.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is from Jackie Sueback.
[SPEAKER_02]: Good evening, mayor and council members.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am sorry that I am unable to attend this
session tonight.
[SPEAKER_02]: I am certain that you all know how very
important this topic is to me,
[SPEAKER_02]: and that if I could be here, I absolutely
would.
[SPEAKER_02]: But unfortunately, that is not the case
this evening.
[SPEAKER_02]: And in the meantime, I prepared this
statement.
[SPEAKER_02]: In the interest of creating fair,
equitable, and inclusive cannabis policy
[SPEAKER_02]: for West Hollywood community, I'd like to
reference two major things that just
[SPEAKER_02]: happened in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: One, the governor recently proposed a
trailer bill as part of the state budget
[SPEAKER_02]: to serve as reconciliation between medical
and adult use regulation.
[SPEAKER_02]: And two, the state agencies responsible
for cannabis, including the Bureau of
[SPEAKER_02]: Marijuana Control and Cannabis Control,
issued the first draft of the regulations
[SPEAKER_02]: this past Friday.
[SPEAKER_02]: Unfortunately, these two sets of proposed
regulations do not line up the way we
[SPEAKER_02]: believe they should.
[SPEAKER_02]: Be so, it's going to take a little time to
get this all sorted out.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'd like to make note that some of the
information contained in your staff
[SPEAKER_02]: reports have already changed and will
likely change again after the 45-day
[SPEAKER_02]: public comment period is complete.
[SPEAKER_02]: One simple example of this is the question
of should the city allow medical and adult
[SPEAKER_02]: use cannabis to be sold in the same place?
[SPEAKER_02]: Depending on how this all goes down at the
state, that may not be allowed anymore.
[SPEAKER_09]: I believe... Thank you, Hal.
[SPEAKER_07]: Wesley Bridal?
[SPEAKER_09]: Hal?
[SPEAKER_02]: Can you finish that statement?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yes, thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm sorry I'm not that fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Not to be able to be sold in the state.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, not to be able to be sold in the
state.
[SPEAKER_02]: I believe it is really important at this
juncture to not limit the amount of
[SPEAKER_02]: licenses in any category, especially for
dispensaries, although I urge you to
[SPEAKER_02]: continue this conversation.
[SPEAKER_02]: I also encourage you to hold off on making
any financial decisions because at this
[SPEAKER_02]: point, many of these proposals and
proposed regulations could still change as
[SPEAKER_02]: it relates to state licensing and could
have a direct impact on the existing
[SPEAKER_02]: cannabis businesses already established in
the city.
[SPEAKER_02]: Finally, I just want to impress one other
point upon you that involves public
[SPEAKER_02]: consumption.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all realize that this is a safety issue
and one that really affects law
[SPEAKER_02]: enforcement.
[SPEAKER_02]: Food for thought rather than ban it and
force people out on the streets to legally
[SPEAKER_02]: consume, which is exactly what will
happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Issue on-site consumption licenses to any
and all retail establishments in the city
[SPEAKER_02]: that request it.
[SPEAKER_02]: As long as they are compliant with the
city and state laws, there should be no
[SPEAKER_02]: problem and it will immediately alleviate
any public safety concerns.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you so much for your time.
[SPEAKER_02]: I look forward to continuing this dialogue
with you.
[SPEAKER_02]: Sincerely, Jackie Zubeck.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Hal.
[SPEAKER_08]: Wesley Bridal to be followed by Aaron
Burke.
[SPEAKER_16]: Wesley A.
[SPEAKER_16]: Bridal, West Hollywood, speaking as a
private citizen.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you, Mayor.
[SPEAKER_16]: Council members and thank you city staff.
[SPEAKER_16]: People say West Hollywood is an LBGT city
and I agree, the city is supportive and
[SPEAKER_16]: representative of the LBGT community.
[SPEAKER_16]: But I would take it a step further and say
that West Hollywood is a city activist.
[SPEAKER_16]: Our city has activists in every shape,
shade, and gender identity.
[SPEAKER_16]: We have a big tent of advocation that
includes cannabis activists.
[SPEAKER_16]: It has been said that West Hollywood is a
creative city, but when I look at the
[SPEAKER_16]: staff report, I don't see our hallmark
creativity.
[SPEAKER_16]: I see more of the same.
[SPEAKER_16]: ALMA has provided for the adult use of
cannabis and has given us the opportunity
[SPEAKER_16]: to show our fellow Californians how a city
at the forefront can be a welcoming to a
[SPEAKER_16]: burgeoning new sector of our economy.
[SPEAKER_16]: Yet the staff report doesn't mention any
of the new businesses that are allowed
[SPEAKER_16]: under Prop 64.
[SPEAKER_16]: It speaks nothing of on-site use locations
like coffee shops in Amsterdam,
[SPEAKER_16]: nor does it talk of other cannabis
businesses who operate in upscale health
[SPEAKER_16]: and beauty sectors.
[SPEAKER_16]: New economies need new ways of thinking
and to change our norms.
[SPEAKER_16]: Here in our city, we have sex shops and
loud and proud bars that might be shut
[SPEAKER_16]: down if they had to operate under the same
legislation that we subject our cannabis
[SPEAKER_16]: dispensaries to.
[SPEAKER_16]: Not to mention that our local laws have
left us with a list of people who want to
[SPEAKER_16]: open cannabis dispensaries 30 plus long,
while others mysteriously transfer
[SPEAKER_16]: ownership and management.
[SPEAKER_16]: Only one of the four dispensaries still
operates under the original owner.
[SPEAKER_16]: Now, I don't want West Hollywood to go to
pot.
[SPEAKER_16]: I don't envision a radically different
West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_16]: I envision the same city that we know and
love, where we take a stand against
[SPEAKER_16]: oppression and implement creative
solutions to build towards a more
[SPEAKER_16]: inclusive society.
[SPEAKER_16]: So in a time when 45 appointed Attorney
General Jeff Sessions says good people
[SPEAKER_16]: don't smoke marijuana, it is my hope that
West Hollywood is a town that says,
[SPEAKER_16]: we welcome the cannabis culture and our
town will continue to be a tourist
[SPEAKER_16]: destination location for all oppressed
people.
[SPEAKER_16]: Thank you for your time and consideration.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Wesley.
[SPEAKER_08]: Aaron Burke to be followed by Amanda Hyde.
[SPEAKER_12]: Thanks to the City Council for considering
this issue.
[SPEAKER_12]: My name is Aaron Burke.
[SPEAKER_12]: I'm with Monk Provisions and half of our
team lives here in West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_12]: We hope that the city eventually adopts a
rigorous application process for folks
[SPEAKER_12]: that are hoping to get a license.
[SPEAKER_12]: We're local, but we've worked in a number
of states.
[SPEAKER_12]: We've worked with regulators in Arizona
and Illinois and Massachusetts and seen
[SPEAKER_12]: how it's gone down in a lot of these
different jurisdictions.
[SPEAKER_12]: The more involved legislators are,
the better the operators end up being.
[SPEAKER_12]: A number of states have tried to,
some places have gone with the lottery
[SPEAKER_12]: system and not tried to do a qualitative
review and it's just ended up leading to
[SPEAKER_12]: subpar operators and the types of
dispensaries that are less desirable that
[SPEAKER_12]: we've all seen.
[SPEAKER_12]: West Hollywood has supported some of the
medical dispensaries here in town.
[SPEAKER_12]: It's led to some of them being the leaders
in the state.
[SPEAKER_12]: Without local support, dispensaries have a
hard time operating the way they could and
[SPEAKER_12]: the way they should.
[SPEAKER_12]: Now that Prop 64 has passed and the
industry has widespread support,
[SPEAKER_12]: the city of West Hollywood has an
opportunity to raise the bar and to remain
[SPEAKER_12]: a leader and to continue to inspire cities
and folks like the Icelandic folks that
[SPEAKER_12]: were mentioned earlier that are so excited
about West Hollywood and I think that
[SPEAKER_12]: there are a number of us that look forward
to making you very proud.
[SPEAKER_12]: So thank you.
[SPEAKER_07]: Thank you, Aaron.
[SPEAKER_07]: Amanda Hyde to be followed by Kat Packer.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hello, council.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've lost my voice, so you will have to
excuse how Kathleen Turner I sound.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have been a leader in the cannabis
world and so we've set a tone for that
[SPEAKER_05]: world and people look to us for our
policies and we are in a rare position of
[SPEAKER_05]: having the infrastructure, the means,
and the social programs to curate and
[SPEAKER_05]: create the cannabis experience that we
want.
[SPEAKER_05]: Whereas in other cities where they don't
have the means and the money, they're
[SPEAKER_05]: going to take in everything because they
want that money coming in to do things
[SPEAKER_05]: like fill potholes and such.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we're in this rare opportunity where we
aren't beholden to the same thing as they
[SPEAKER_05]: are.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I think rather than taking a pause and
watching what everyone else does,
[SPEAKER_05]: we need to be creative as we like to say
all the time and actually be leaders
[SPEAKER_05]: rather than followers.
[SPEAKER_05]: Also, I think leaving things the same is
not creative at all.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm personally not happy with things are.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who's to say that the businesses that we
have right now are the best of the best?
[SPEAKER_05]: If it wasn't open, market that was
inclusive, would those businesses last?
[SPEAKER_05]: Because I know that at West Hollywood's
business experience, you have to be the
[SPEAKER_05]: best of the best in any form of business
in order to survive here.
[SPEAKER_05]: We really curate original, unique,
amazing experiences as businesses and I
[SPEAKER_05]: don't understand why we wouldn't do that
the same when it comes to this as a
[SPEAKER_05]: business and we wouldn't take in that
taxation so that we could keep on having
[SPEAKER_05]: the social services that we have.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just see it as a missed opportunity.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think we really need to reach out into
our community because I think we have a
[SPEAKER_05]: very amazing demographic of people that
are successful in business and successful
[SPEAKER_05]: in ways and we should really, I like that
we're going to have community meetings,
[SPEAKER_05]: but we really need to make sure that the
community knows they're going to be
[SPEAKER_05]: happening because I go to all this and I
have a hard time finding out what's
[SPEAKER_05]: happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: But thank you so much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Amanda.
[SPEAKER_09]: Kat Packer to be followed by William
McNeely.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hello again to City Council.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Kat Packer and I'm a policy
coordinator with an organization called
[SPEAKER_00]: the Drug Policy Alliance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Through my work with the Drug Policy
Alliance, I've been focused very heavily
[SPEAKER_00]: on the implementation of the Adult Use of
Marijuana Act in its reconciliation with
[SPEAKER_00]: the Medical Cannabis and Regulation and
Safety Act.
[SPEAKER_00]: As Hal Lewis had already said,
just this past Friday, the Bureau of
[SPEAKER_00]: Medical Cannabis Regulation released its
draft regulations and a few weeks prior,
[SPEAKER_00]: the governor released his trailer bill.
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that to say that there is a lot
moving around the state in terms of
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis policy and a lot is changing.
[SPEAKER_00]: I've been participating very heavily
statewide and in particularly in Los
[SPEAKER_00]: Angeles County in the city to have
conversations about how to make cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: policy more inclusive and more equitable.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why this is particularly
important and especially here in
[SPEAKER_00]: California is that having a cannabis
license can be the very difference between
[SPEAKER_00]: profit and a crime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here in the state of California,
low-income communities and communities of
[SPEAKER_00]: color have been specifically targeted.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't necessarily know what the
demographics and arrest statistics look
[SPEAKER_00]: like for the city of West Hollywood,
but if they trend similar to the rest of
[SPEAKER_00]: California, let me just give you one
statistic.
[SPEAKER_00]: In 2015, black people were two times more
likely to be arrested for a marijuana
[SPEAKER_00]: misdemeanor and five times more likely to
be arrested for a marijuana felony.
[SPEAKER_00]: This was in 2015, where we know that folks
could have just paid $40 and walked into
[SPEAKER_00]: some place on Venice Beach.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so as we're talking about jobs and
creating economic opportunities,
[SPEAKER_00]: I want to make sure that we are thinking
and being inclusive of those communities
[SPEAKER_00]: that have been criminalized for the exact
same plan.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Kat.
[SPEAKER_08]: William McNeely to be followed by Michael
Buigalevich.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening.
[SPEAKER_13]: My name is William McNeely, Bill.
[SPEAKER_13]: Good evening, council and staff.
[SPEAKER_13]: I'm here to support the fact of having
recreational marijuana and to have medical
[SPEAKER_13]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree with a lot of the state
suggestions that I heard about last
[SPEAKER_13]: Monday, saying that the governor prefers
that the medical and recreational be sold
[SPEAKER_13]: at different, not on the same location or
the same space.
[SPEAKER_13]: I agree with that.
[SPEAKER_13]: I think this, I reiterate what other
people said.
[SPEAKER_13]: This is a creative city.
[SPEAKER_13]: I know you'll come up with a creative
solution.
[SPEAKER_13]: You did with medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_13]: You were a leader.
[SPEAKER_13]: I see no reason why you're not going to be
in this instance also, and I hope you do
[SPEAKER_13]: so.
[SPEAKER_13]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Michael Buigalevich will be our last
speaker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Council and members of the public,
good evening again.
[SPEAKER_01]: Michael Buigalevich.
[SPEAKER_01]: So another very easy breezy staff report
that centers on a complex topic on a
[SPEAKER_01]: burgeoning industry that stems from a very
potent drug.
[SPEAKER_01]: West Hollywood has the greatest proportion
of people within the county versus other
[SPEAKER_01]: cities who receive housing assistance with
federal money.
[SPEAKER_01]: And as anyone should know, but most people
don't, because staff chooses to overlook
[SPEAKER_01]: this, the use of marijuana, medical or
otherwise, is prohibited.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you're talking prohibition from
residents who are either section eight,
[SPEAKER_01]: project-based section eight, anyone
receiving HOPWA funds.
[SPEAKER_01]: In this city, it doesn't take
responsibility to acknowledge this fact
[SPEAKER_01]: and to say what is going to happen should
that person choose to believe in
[SPEAKER_01]: Proposition 64 and not be advised on what
they're willing to risk.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's always interesting to hear the
benefits of taxation that will come
[SPEAKER_01]: towards social services when, in many
ways, social services is adversely
[SPEAKER_01]: affected by marijuana.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has an ill effect on those with mental
illness, especially those who are
[SPEAKER_01]: homeless.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I just ask you to think about this in
some detail.
[SPEAKER_01]: Think about this in deeper terms and to
have the wherewithal and the
[SPEAKER_01]: responsibility to advise your residents
what their rights are and are not.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Michael.
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilmember Duran.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you, Mayor.
[SPEAKER_14]: I have some more follow-up questions now,
maybe for staff.
[SPEAKER_14]: If staff doesn't know, maybe some of the
people in the audience may.
[SPEAKER_14]: The Farr-Roerbacher amendment to the
federal budget would have prohibited the
[SPEAKER_14]: DEA from using any funds to go after
medicinal marijuana in those states that
[SPEAKER_14]: have medicinal marijuana.
[SPEAKER_14]: Was the Farr-Roerbacher amendment included
in the budget that the Congress just
[SPEAKER_14]: passed this week?
[SPEAKER_14]: Does anybody know?
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Anybody out there from Drug Policy
Alliance know?
[SPEAKER_14]: Did Farr-Roerbacher make it?
[SPEAKER_14]: Don't know.
[SPEAKER_14]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_14]: All right.
[SPEAKER_14]: So the reason I ask is because that's a
question we're going to have to deal with
[SPEAKER_14]: as we continue to try to regulate in this
area.
[SPEAKER_14]: This is actually a topic I know a lot
about.
[SPEAKER_14]: It's ironic.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know because I'm sober and don't use
alcohol or drugs, but I actually know a
[SPEAKER_14]: lot about this particular issue because of
the history of the AIDS epidemic and the
[SPEAKER_14]: role that medicinal marijuana played when
we used to have to argue in court medical
[SPEAKER_14]: necessity, long before there was a
Proposition 215 and long before there was
[SPEAKER_14]: a Proposition 64.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that the big issue and the biggest
concern I have is the continuing conflict
[SPEAKER_14]: between federal and state law that's going
to continue to exist and how we attempt to
[SPEAKER_14]: navigate and regulate in an area with a
federal attorney general and government
[SPEAKER_14]: that could potentially be hostile to the
states or localities on this issue.
[SPEAKER_14]: I mean, we know what happened when the
city helped the Reverend Scott Imler buy a
[SPEAKER_14]: building here in the city of West
Hollywood for the Los Angeles Cannabis
[SPEAKER_14]: Resource Center back in 1990.
[SPEAKER_14]: In 2006 and in the year 2001, the Bush
administration seized that building.
[SPEAKER_14]: The city actually, we forfeited the
building was taken under the drug
[SPEAKER_14]: forfeiture laws from the city of West
Hollywood is the one and only time that
[SPEAKER_14]: the United States actually took an asset
from the municipality citing drug
[SPEAKER_14]: forfeiture laws.
[SPEAKER_14]: So what I know to be true is when the
federal government wants to play mean and
[SPEAKER_14]: nasty, they will play mean and nasty in
this area.
[SPEAKER_14]: To me, I think the idea about community
meetings, I don't think I support that.
[SPEAKER_14]: And here's the reason why.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's always great to get public
opinion and public input.
[SPEAKER_14]: And there should be a place for that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think in the upcoming months,
we should get some teams of experts rather
[SPEAKER_14]: than just community input.
[SPEAKER_14]: People will have a lot of opinions about
this particular issue.
[SPEAKER_14]: What they won't have is a lot of
expertise.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I think what's going to be more
helpful to us is to have expertise on the
[SPEAKER_14]: issue of what Governor Brown is doing up
in Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_14]: I heard Mr. McNeely say Governor Brown is
recommending that the medicinal and
[SPEAKER_14]: non-medicinal be in separate places.
[SPEAKER_14]: I thought I read in the LA Times the
governor wanted them merged together.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's correct, right?
[SPEAKER_14]: Yeah, the governor actually wants them
merged together, medicinal and
[SPEAKER_14]: non-medicinal in the same place.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think it's best we have some expertise
on that.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're still going to run afoul of the
banking issues that exist that people who
[SPEAKER_14]: are involved in marijuana, whether it's
medicinal or adult use, are still going to
[SPEAKER_14]: have problems with banking systems that
will not allow them to bank because it's a
[SPEAKER_14]: violation of federal law.
[SPEAKER_14]: Mr. Vokalevich brought up an issue that
does actually exist.
[SPEAKER_14]: And at some point, we will have to educate
our residents about the fact that if
[SPEAKER_14]: you're caught smoking a joint in federal
HUD property, you will be evicted,
[SPEAKER_14]: notwithstanding Proposition 64 or the
easing of the laws on marijuana use.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that's an issue that exists in the
state of California because it's federally
[SPEAKER_14]: funded building.
[SPEAKER_14]: Those are smaller issues.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think the issue of cultivation,
I think, is problematic in West Hollywood
[SPEAKER_14]: because we don't have a lot of real
estate.
[SPEAKER_14]: We don't have a lot of GDP.
[SPEAKER_14]: We're too dense for cultivation.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think trying to get into the issue of
regulating cultivation in people's homes
[SPEAKER_14]: or backyards is beyond the enforcement
resources that we have, and we should
[SPEAKER_14]: probably not do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: But I think that we probably should
prohibit cultivation in the city because I
[SPEAKER_14]: don't think we have enough geography or
real estate for that to happen.
[SPEAKER_14]: We've also received communications from
Edison that they're not sure they'd be
[SPEAKER_14]: able to supply the power that would be
necessary to do that.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think ultimately we're going to be
involved in the distribution issue.
[SPEAKER_14]: I also want to understand from the experts
if Proposition 64 on the issue of
[SPEAKER_14]: transportation and distribution delivery
services means that the health and safety
[SPEAKER_14]: code sections that have to do with
transportation of controlled substances
[SPEAKER_14]: are no longer going to be enforced in the
state courts.
[SPEAKER_14]: Traditionally, you cannot transport
controlled substances.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I just want to make sure that whatever
we're doing here that we're not running
[SPEAKER_14]: afoul of the criminal statutes on
transportation and distribution for
[SPEAKER_14]: controlled substances.
[SPEAKER_14]: The issue around taxation, I think the
people of the city of West Hollywood have
[SPEAKER_14]: voted repeatedly to tax themselves and
everything from homelessness to transit,
[SPEAKER_14]: and I imagine that there will be strong
support.
[SPEAKER_14]: In fact, we know from a recent community
survey there's strong support for taxation
[SPEAKER_14]: of marijuana in the city of West
Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think we should move forward at some
point in getting that on the 2019 ballot.
[SPEAKER_14]: I just want to understand then how we're
going to possibly get into the regulation
[SPEAKER_14]: business before we tax them and making
sure that if we're going to then move
[SPEAKER_14]: forward to taxation that we do it in a way
that's timely.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm open to the suggestion of expanding
beyond the four existing collectives that
[SPEAKER_14]: exist.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know the number.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know how many.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'm a little concerned about the merger of
medicinal marijuana with adult use for the
[SPEAKER_14]: reason that I think the Trump
administration has given early signals
[SPEAKER_14]: that they're going to leave medicinal
marijuana alone, but they're not as clear
[SPEAKER_14]: about adult use.
[SPEAKER_14]: And I actually think the medical marijuana
collectives in the city would have far
[SPEAKER_14]: greater protection in their current role
as medicinal distributors, and if we allow
[SPEAKER_14]: them to then expand into adult use,
do we place them at risk of federal
[SPEAKER_14]: prosecution?
[SPEAKER_14]: Should we be making them aware of the
risks that are involved?
[SPEAKER_14]: Let them decide at what risk they're
willing to take.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I think that ultimately opinions from
the community are great, but I think we
[SPEAKER_14]: need some expertise to help guide us
through some of these policy decisions.
[SPEAKER_14]: On the issues of the conflict between
state, federal, and local regulation,
[SPEAKER_14]: how we are going to regulate through
Planning Commission or Business License
[SPEAKER_14]: Commission or both in terms of the
operation.
[SPEAKER_14]: Whether we expand beyond the four,
I'm open to it, and I just don't know what
[SPEAKER_14]: the number is and how we would go about
doing that.
[SPEAKER_14]: I know that staff told me at one point
they were keeping a list of people who
[SPEAKER_14]: were interested in doing this.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it should.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't think it should be a random draw,
and I don't think it should be a who's
[SPEAKER_14]: ever next on the list draw.
[SPEAKER_14]: I think that we should have some sort of
process involved, and we can check the
[SPEAKER_14]: capital that exists behind any of these
potential operations, the level of
[SPEAKER_14]: expertise on these particular issues.
[SPEAKER_14]: Background checks.
[SPEAKER_14]: I'd rather have a little bit more of a
thorough vetting if we were going to
[SPEAKER_14]: expand rather than just going who's next
in order or a random draw through a lotto,
[SPEAKER_14]: and how we do that in a way that's fair
and equitable when obviously there are a
[SPEAKER_14]: lot of people who would like to get into
this very lucrative business potentially.
[SPEAKER_14]: That's what's got me scratching my head.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't have the answer to that,
but I think that's something we can look
[SPEAKER_14]: at as we move forward on these issues.
[SPEAKER_14]: So I know we want to try to get this
enacted by the end of the year,
[SPEAKER_14]: and we've probably got a couple of stops.
[SPEAKER_14]: The Planning Commission and the Business
License Commission before it comes back
[SPEAKER_14]: here, but I think in the short term
getting the right experts at a meeting
[SPEAKER_14]: where the public can provide their
opinions is going to be more important to
[SPEAKER_14]: me than just meeting with the community.
[SPEAKER_14]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Thank you, Mayor.
[SPEAKER_17]: I really want to thank everyone who,
number one, took the time to stay with us
[SPEAKER_17]: through the previous part of this meeting
to speak now, and I continue to learn and
[SPEAKER_17]: know there's a lot more learning to do,
and so this kind of information delivery,
[SPEAKER_17]: which is pretty direct, is very much
appreciated, and certainly all of you are
[SPEAKER_17]: welcome to contact my office directly.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm happy to meet with you, sit down and
discuss at length, as I have with several
[SPEAKER_17]: different sets of people already,
and I'm willing to and want to talk with
[SPEAKER_17]: all of you as well, because I think the
recurring theme that I agree with most,
[SPEAKER_17]: and it's really a sort of three-part
theme, one is that we have an opportunity
[SPEAKER_17]: to do this in a really extraordinary way,
and the four dispensaries that we have I
[SPEAKER_17]: don't think are ready to sort of operate
in prime time yet.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think they serve the medical use
community quite well, exquisitely in fact,
[SPEAKER_17]: but I think I can imagine a $400 a night
tourist on the Sunset Strip having a
[SPEAKER_17]: certain experience and someone shopping on
Melrose having a different experience,
[SPEAKER_17]: someone on the East Side having yet a
third experience, and none of those
[SPEAKER_17]: experiences are captured by our current
series, and maybe that's three of three
[SPEAKER_17]: experiences, or maybe that's three of 25
experiences, but I think the market will
[SPEAKER_17]: give us some hints pretty quickly,
and so I'm interested to see and I'm
[SPEAKER_17]: interested in that.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm also interested in figuring out how we
can coordinate this effort with a tax,
[SPEAKER_17]: and I guess one of the questions I have
for staff is can we issue business
[SPEAKER_17]: licenses that would expire if the city
does not adopt a tax?
[SPEAKER_17]: So on January 1st, 2018, you don't have to
answer now, but I think this is a question
[SPEAKER_17]: we wanna, I would like to get answered.
[SPEAKER_17]: On January 1st, 2018, businesses can go
into business, but if the city does not
[SPEAKER_17]: adopt a tax on March, whatever it is,
5th, 2019, those business licenses would
[SPEAKER_17]: expire and they would have to close in 60
days or something, during which time we
[SPEAKER_17]: could make a different decision,
but I think for me, I'm not willing to
[SPEAKER_17]: have us wait until March of 2019 to open
dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's, you know, maybe we don't
need to be in a hurry, but I just think
[SPEAKER_17]: that that doesn't really put us in the
catbird seat, as it were.
[SPEAKER_17]: I also think we should have a fairly
lenient policy about on-site use.
[SPEAKER_17]: This is now a legal issue, a legal product
in the state of California, and telling
[SPEAKER_17]: people that they can only buy it and
squirrel themselves back to their house to
[SPEAKER_17]: use it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I can't actually think of another product
that we treat in that way.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, certainly there are products that
are maybe best used in private locations,
[SPEAKER_17]: but I just think in some way we should not
just allow for that opportunity,
[SPEAKER_17]: but we should carefully figure out how
that opportunity is the best version for
[SPEAKER_17]: our city and what are the parking
requirements for it and all kinds of
[SPEAKER_17]: things, because this is the world that
we're in, and our state voted for it,
[SPEAKER_17]: and I think I, for one, understand why it
passed, and I think that our city can
[SPEAKER_17]: provide a fairly exquisite experience
around the entire experience.
[SPEAKER_17]: Finally, I want to return to something
Michael Voikolewicz said, and I think
[SPEAKER_17]: Councilmember Duran followed up on.
[SPEAKER_17]: Yes, we have a federal government.
[SPEAKER_17]: We all know this.
[SPEAKER_17]: It's 3,500 miles away, and sometimes it's
in our bedrooms, so we have to be sure and
[SPEAKER_17]: careful that as a city, we're delivering
all the information.
[SPEAKER_17]: We're telling you how this works and how
it doesn't work and where some of the
[SPEAKER_17]: traps and pitfalls and danger zones may
be, because as Councilmember Duran said,
[SPEAKER_17]: we can't necessarily protect you from the
long arm of the federal government.
[SPEAKER_17]: Especially if they were to choose West
Hollywood as a location to make a point.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's an important piece that we
can't leave behind the education of what
[SPEAKER_17]: our federal government thinks of what it
is we're doing.
[SPEAKER_17]: I have one last question that I also don't
need an answer to tonight, but I'm just
[SPEAKER_17]: wondering if it's possible to set a
minimum fee for a business license or have
[SPEAKER_17]: an auction as a way to raise revenue for
the city's implementation of this,
[SPEAKER_17]: or if merely setting the business license
cost is the only way to engage with
[SPEAKER_17]: possible vendors.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think that's all the things that I
wanted to bring up.
[SPEAKER_17]: So far, thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Councilmember Horbath?
[SPEAKER_06]: Thank you, Mayor.
[SPEAKER_06]: I want to thank the members of the public
who came out to speak as well.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that we're in mostly uncharted
territory, although we've been at the
[SPEAKER_06]: forefront of the piece that isn't
uncharted territory, and I hope that we
[SPEAKER_06]: stay there moving forward.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there are certainly a lot of
considerations.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think, as I understand it, staff is
asking for direction from City Council on
[SPEAKER_06]: where we want to go next, but there really
aren't recommendations from staff based on
[SPEAKER_06]: what sort of options there are.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wish we had some more information
from you about what some of the
[SPEAKER_06]: consequences of some of those choices
might be.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree with Councilmember Duran that
we're going to get the best information
[SPEAKER_06]: from folks who are stakeholders in this
industry and who have some degree of
[SPEAKER_06]: expertise.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think working with them first to make
sure that we're understanding from folks
[SPEAKER_06]: who are doing this and are aware of the
latest and greatest in terms of
[SPEAKER_06]: regulation, but also in terms of what sort
of businesses are out there.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm certainly open.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think I'm certainly open to expanding
the number of licenses and the kinds of
[SPEAKER_06]: businesses that we have here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think that retail is very, a retail shop
that sells a topical is much different
[SPEAKER_06]: than a cannabis bar that would be a place
for onsite consumption.
[SPEAKER_06]: So regulating those two things would be
very different for me.
[SPEAKER_06]: One feels like a cosmetics place and one
feels like a bar.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I think the question of medical
versus adult use is one that we've heard
[SPEAKER_06]: brought to us from the community.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are concerns about access of medical
cannabis as opposed to those who are
[SPEAKER_06]: participating in the new regulation under
64.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think making sure that we are
creating and continuing to protect safe
[SPEAKER_06]: access for patients is important.
[SPEAKER_06]: And also equally important is making sure
that we're keeping cannabis out of the
[SPEAKER_06]: hands of underage non-patients.
[SPEAKER_06]: So separate facilities, I understand
there's a debate about where the governors
[SPEAKER_06]: add on that and where we're going to go,
but I think that when you keep the
[SPEAKER_06]: facilities separate, you avoid issues like
that, although without necessarily
[SPEAKER_06]: understanding from an informed point of
view what the consequences of separating
[SPEAKER_06]: them are.
And so I think that's a very important
issue and I think that's a very important
[SPEAKER_06]: issue for the public to understand and to
understand what the consequences of
[SPEAKER_06]: separating them might be for that same
issue.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I would like some more information on
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think you've raised the issue of whether
there would be consumption in public
[SPEAKER_06]: spaces.
[SPEAKER_06]: And for me, that issue feels a lot like
smoking or drinking, smoking cigarettes or
[SPEAKER_06]: drinking in public.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I don't agree with the comments that
were made about we're just going to shove
[SPEAKER_06]: people out in the streets.
[SPEAKER_06]: No, we're not.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I think that we have to figure out
what the right spaces are where people can
[SPEAKER_06]: consume cannabis and in what manner.
[SPEAKER_06]: I understand there's been discussion at
least brought to the planning commission
[SPEAKER_06]: about delivery services.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I don't know how we regulate other
types of delivery services at this point
[SPEAKER_06]: in the city anyway.
[SPEAKER_06]: So do we regulate pharmaceutical
deliveries?
[SPEAKER_06]: Do we regulate wine deliveries?
[SPEAKER_06]: What kind of deliveries do we regulate,
if any?
[SPEAKER_06]: And so again, echoing Council Member D
'Amico's comments, since this is a legal
[SPEAKER_06]: substance, what are some of the things
that we can be comparing it to in
[SPEAKER_06]: comparable uses that would make sense in
terms of regulation?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think there are certainly a number of
public safety questions we need to ask.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are questions and some of my
colleagues in other communities have been
[SPEAKER_06]: raising the issue of what amount of,
I don't know what the right language
[SPEAKER_06]: around this is, but what amount of
consumption, what would a DUI litmus test
[SPEAKER_06]: or percentage be?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't even know if that's possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if science is behind that at
this point.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I also know that another public safety
issue is banking and making sure that
[SPEAKER_06]: whatever businesses do come to West
Hollywood that we're helping them figure
[SPEAKER_06]: out what financial mechanisms they're
using to make sure these businesses don't
[SPEAKER_06]: become targets of some of the crimes of
opportunity that we've seen happening in
[SPEAKER_06]: the city from time to time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think there are, as much as I would
like to provide direction, I feel like
[SPEAKER_06]: that's almost about as specific as I can
be given that we don't have a lot of
[SPEAKER_06]: information to start from.
[SPEAKER_06]: I agree that I'd like to start with expert
opinion and bringing that information into
[SPEAKER_06]: the conversation before we go to the
public.
[SPEAKER_06]: I think we have to have an informed policy
to be considered by the public,
[SPEAKER_06]: not sort of the other way around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I'll see if I have anything to add
after, as we're moving towards a motion.
[SPEAKER_06]: Thanks.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay, thank you.
[SPEAKER_09]: Mayor Pro Tem.
[SPEAKER_11]: Thank you, and thank you to all of the
people who came out to speak tonight.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't use marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't drink.
[SPEAKER_11]: I have a lot of history of substance abuse
in my family, so that's a choice I've
[SPEAKER_11]: made.
[SPEAKER_11]: The voters have made a choice in
California to allow for adult use of
[SPEAKER_11]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: It's something that I think the voters in
West Hollywood supported pretty heavily.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we've had, as a city,
a history of supporting, certainly,
[SPEAKER_11]: medical use of marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: The voters have decided that adult use
marijuana is something that is permitted
[SPEAKER_11]: now in the state of California.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that we should, as a city,
embrace it in the same way that we
[SPEAKER_11]: embraced the use of medical marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: We are not really in the business of
opening up one of these establishments.
[SPEAKER_11]: The people who want to do that are,
of course, risking the federal law being
[SPEAKER_11]: enforced against them.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have to work out their own
relationships with landlords and the risk
[SPEAKER_11]: that's entailed there.
[SPEAKER_11]: They have to work out their banking
relationships.
[SPEAKER_11]: That is not something that is the city's
responsibility.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're not opening up one of these
establishments.
[SPEAKER_11]: We're here in a regulatory capacity.
[SPEAKER_11]: And so I think that we need to figure out
what kind of regulations are appropriate,
[SPEAKER_11]: given that this is the reality.
[SPEAKER_11]: You put in here one of the possible
actions would be for us to ban the
[SPEAKER_11]: operation of adult use marijuana
facilities or cannabis facilities in West
[SPEAKER_11]: Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think that was put in there kind of
rhetorically, because I don't think that's
[SPEAKER_11]: where the city is going to go,
and certainly not where I think we should
[SPEAKER_11]: go.
[SPEAKER_11]: You asked us a series of questions,
and I'm going to go through them in order
[SPEAKER_11]: of the questions you've asked.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I understand it's difficult for us to
answer them, because, as Lindsay said,
[SPEAKER_11]: we don't have complete information.
[SPEAKER_11]: The first one is, should the city allow
the existing medical marijuana collectors
[SPEAKER_11]: to sell non-medical marijuana?
[SPEAKER_11]: That sounds like a question that we can't
really answer, because that may be decided
[SPEAKER_11]: by the state.
[SPEAKER_11]: So perhaps that's an issue that needs to
be deferred.
[SPEAKER_11]: Should we limit non-medical marijuana to
locations where there are currently
[SPEAKER_11]: licensed medical marijuana dispensaries?
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't think that's the appropriate
response.
[SPEAKER_11]: As my colleagues have indicated,
if they're combined, maybe they're not the
[SPEAKER_11]: best people to operate those facilities.
[SPEAKER_11]: They may be, but I don't know that we
necessarily want to limit to four
[SPEAKER_11]: locations.
[SPEAKER_11]: For any other business, coffee shops,
the ones that sell coffee, we allow the
[SPEAKER_11]: market to dictate.
[SPEAKER_11]: People can open up the business if they
get their license, and then the
[SPEAKER_11]: marketplace determines who's successful
and who isn't.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I think this is different,
and I think that we do need to be more
[SPEAKER_11]: cautious about this.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do think that we need to have some
kind of limit on locations.
[SPEAKER_11]: As you already indicated, we probably need
to keep them away from schools.
[SPEAKER_11]: We need to keep them away.
[SPEAKER_11]: And that's what state law already
contemplated.
[SPEAKER_11]: The initiative already contemplated that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I like my colleague's suggestion,
Councilmember Domenico's, about if we go
[SPEAKER_11]: ahead with licensing and regulation,
having those regulations tied into or
[SPEAKER_11]: terminate once we have a sales tax.
[SPEAKER_11]: If we don't have a tax, then the
permissions or the licenses expire.
[SPEAKER_11]: So having some kind of provision to do
that.
[SPEAKER_11]: The use of non-medical marijuana on public
property, I think we already prohibit
[SPEAKER_11]: smoking in most public places.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think we should treat this in the same
way that we treat tobacco.
[SPEAKER_11]: Home delivery, that's the one that,
as Lindsay said, we don't necessarily
[SPEAKER_11]: regulate other home delivery.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm just concerned that home delivery of
marijuana, that it might become a target
[SPEAKER_11]: for criminal activity, especially if you
have a big delivery truck, like a Brinks
[SPEAKER_11]: truck, delivering marijuana.
[SPEAKER_11]: That could be a target for people.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not certain about what to do there.
[SPEAKER_11]: Allowing licensed non-medical marijuana to
cultivate marijuana indoors, I'm just not
[SPEAKER_11]: certain.
[SPEAKER_11]: Allowing manufacturer extraction testing
or processing, again, I'm not certain.
[SPEAKER_11]: I'm not certain that our commercial areas
are really appropriate for that.
[SPEAKER_11]: I don't know enough about it.
[SPEAKER_11]: The warehousing and storage doesn't seem
appropriate for West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_11]: We really don't have any other warehouses
here for any kind of product.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I just don't know that that's
appropriate.
[SPEAKER_11]: Reasonable regulations on indoor
cultivation to ensure it doesn't exceed
[SPEAKER_11]: the parameters allowed by law,
I think that seems reasonable.
[SPEAKER_11]: That we would make sure that indoor
cultivation complies with the law.
[SPEAKER_11]: And outdoor cultivation, backyards,
private patios or balconies, again,
[SPEAKER_11]: as long as it's one or two plants,
I don't think anyone's going to notice or
[SPEAKER_11]: particularly care or that it's going to be
a priority.
[SPEAKER_11]: But I'd want to know a little bit more
about that.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I do think we should prohibit smoking
of marijuana on city property,
[SPEAKER_11]: just like I think we prohibit smoking
tobacco.
[SPEAKER_11]: On city property.
[SPEAKER_11]: I may be incorrect there, but I think we
probably should do that.
[SPEAKER_11]: On the bigger policy issue, I think the
big issue for me is how do we ensure that
[SPEAKER_11]: we get the best possible operators?
[SPEAKER_11]: The idea of opening it up and having first
come first serve doesn't get us the best.
[SPEAKER_11]: Having some kind of bidding war doesn't
ensure that we get the best.
[SPEAKER_11]: It may ensure that we get people who have
the most money behind them, but that
[SPEAKER_11]: doesn't mean that we're gonna get the best
operators.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I really want us to come up with some
kind of process where we're reviewing
[SPEAKER_11]: proposals and making sure that the people
who are going to get the licenses in West
[SPEAKER_11]: Hollywood for this are going to be high
quality businesses that are serving the
[SPEAKER_11]: local community and serving visitors to
West Hollywood and providing a very
[SPEAKER_11]: positive experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: Thank you, Mayor Pro Tem.
[SPEAKER_08]: I have some questions.
[SPEAKER_08]: First of all, does the ABC allow smoking
marijuana in places that sell alcohol?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, that would be something to think
about.
[SPEAKER_03]: We'll look into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: We don't know that right now.
[SPEAKER_08]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then we do allow smoking tobacco in
our parks, but we also don't... I mean,
[SPEAKER_08]: there are gonna be restrictions in terms
of being near daycare centers and
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever, so I think that's something that
we have to think about.
[SPEAKER_08]: And also just to double check your map
about where daycare centers are and
[SPEAKER_08]: schools, because I think Maimonides is
missing from the map, and there is no
[SPEAKER_08]: daycare center on Huntley.
[SPEAKER_08]: However, there are daycare centers that
are in Los Angeles, which are within a few
[SPEAKER_08]: blocks of West Hollywood, and I think we
need to take that into consideration.
[SPEAKER_08]: Whatever we decide should be in the spirit
of our law, and it should apply to LA as
[SPEAKER_08]: well.
[SPEAKER_08]: I can see where we, at least starting out,
we would want this to be a planning and a
[SPEAKER_08]: business license.
[SPEAKER_08]: We have MCUPs for alcohol licenses,
right?
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, I think it is something that we
should look into.
[SPEAKER_08]: I would imagine we wanna look at maybe
whatever we have in terms of the medical
[SPEAKER_08]: marijuana now with radius, of how many we
would want within a thousand foot radius,
[SPEAKER_08]: how close we would want to allow a store
to residential, knowing that our
[SPEAKER_08]: residential and our commercial are very
close together, and we have had some
[SPEAKER_08]: concerns about places being close to
residences.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I think we need to be mindful of that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I know that we wanna be a leader in this,
but I don't think it hurts to look at what
[SPEAKER_08]: other states have gone through to see what
they've done right and what they've done
[SPEAKER_08]: where they're changing their own laws now
because of, for example, in Colorado or
[SPEAKER_08]: wherever, just to learn from others'
experience.
[SPEAKER_08]: I don't think we necessarily have to
reinvent the wheel.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I would suggest that we look at that.
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, honestly, I wish that we had had
this report in January because it is
[SPEAKER_08]: complicated.
[SPEAKER_08]: It's probably one of the most complicated
issues that we're gonna be dealing with,
[SPEAKER_08]: and I agree with Councilmember Duran that
I would like to get advice from experts in
[SPEAKER_08]: this field to just feel more confident
about how we move forward with this.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also wonder, if this is a cash business,
how do we ensure that we're getting the
[SPEAKER_08]: tax money, whether, I don't know,
the sales tax or any tax that we put on
[SPEAKER_08]: locally?
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, experience with cash businesses
are that you don't see that.
[SPEAKER_08]: You don't see necessarily everything that
cash that's passing hands.
[SPEAKER_08]: I also have some concerns about delivery,
and so I, you know, again, I mean,
[SPEAKER_08]: at this point, I'm open, but I think that
it is important that we look at all sides
[SPEAKER_08]: of this because not only do you have the
possibility of a public safety issue for
[SPEAKER_08]: the people delivering, but also the people
who are receiving, you know, that they're,
[SPEAKER_08]: I mean, a stranger's going into someone's
home.
[SPEAKER_08]: So I mean, these are just all things to
think about.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, you know, regarding medical,
having some that are, the medical
[SPEAKER_08]: marijuana places versus the non-medical,
I mean, I can see where there would be
[SPEAKER_08]: benefits to keeping them separate.
[SPEAKER_08]: Also for the consumer, because,
you know, the experience might be very
[SPEAKER_08]: different.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, for a consumer that is using
marijuana for medical purposes,
[SPEAKER_08]: for medicinal purposes, they may not want
the frills and the, you know, fancy or
[SPEAKER_08]: whatever, you know, whatever different
things that might be offered.
[SPEAKER_08]: They may just, you know, want to make sure
that they go in, that they feel safe,
[SPEAKER_08]: that they, you know, get their medicinal
marijuana and they leave.
[SPEAKER_08]: And again, I just think this is a really
complicated, a complicated issue,
[SPEAKER_08]: and it's complicated in terms of land use,
and it's complicated in terms of
[SPEAKER_08]: licensing.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think we need to, we need to move on
this now pretty quickly if we want to make
[SPEAKER_08]: the January 2018 deadline, because I don't
think, I don't think not doing anything is
[SPEAKER_08]: the answer.
[SPEAKER_08]: Council Member D'Amico.
Thank you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Excuse me.
[SPEAKER_17]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_17]: Mr. Hittleman, can you go to the slide
that showed the sort of suggested next
[SPEAKER_17]: steps?
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it started with community meetings
and then a planning commission.
[SPEAKER_17]: And so I just wanted to bring up for the
council and the staff and actually really
[SPEAKER_17]: our city manager, because he's our sort of
point person when we're not, when we don't
[SPEAKER_17]: have a staff report.
[SPEAKER_17]: But so I have the sense that we should
probably have maybe 45-day updates or
[SPEAKER_17]: something like that, that really keeps us
checked in.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm with Council Member Duran and I guess
Council Member Horvath.
[SPEAKER_17]: Actually, I don't remember if you said
this or not, but I'm actually not thinking
[SPEAKER_17]: we need to have too many community
meetings.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think it wouldn't hurt for our Chamber
of Commerce to have a meeting,
[SPEAKER_17]: and maybe one of their chamber mixers can
be a cannabis, you know, a cannabis
[SPEAKER_17]: discussion.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I think, I think our community,
you know, we voted, you don't want to buy
[SPEAKER_17]: pot, don't go in a pot store.
[SPEAKER_17]: I mean, it would sort of be, well,
it's a little flip, but I think Mayor
[SPEAKER_17]: Horvath, I mean, excuse me, Mayor Meister
was clear that we want to be really
[SPEAKER_17]: careful about the neighborhoods we're
placing them in and how we're going to
[SPEAKER_17]: interact with that.
[SPEAKER_17]: But I just don't see that we need to have
several community meetings to get input
[SPEAKER_17]: from our community members.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we need experts to tell us.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I'm just concerned that late summer is
a little late.
[SPEAKER_17]: We have a meeting in, typically a meeting
in July and a meeting in August,
[SPEAKER_17]: and last year we had one meeting in
September, one meeting in October,
[SPEAKER_17]: one meeting in November, one meeting in
December.
[SPEAKER_17]: So I'm thinking we probably need to have
this discussion sooner than late summer,
[SPEAKER_17]: which is September or August, because I
think we need to.
[SPEAKER_17]: Give you enough time to do this and get it
to the planning commission and have them.
[SPEAKER_17]: And also our state will be making choices
as well.
[SPEAKER_17]: So in terms of that process, that's what I
wanted to lay out two things that we
[SPEAKER_17]: really try and push up the council city
council direction and regulating
[SPEAKER_17]: marijuana.
[SPEAKER_17]: And we have that maybe in July or August
at the latest and that we have,
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm sorry, the first meeting in August.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think this is going to probably be one.
[SPEAKER_17]: So the first will be the only,
and then ask our chamber to participate
[SPEAKER_17]: and maybe do one community meeting.
[SPEAKER_17]: But maybe that community meeting can
happen after we make our initial direction
[SPEAKER_17]: to the council.
[SPEAKER_17]: Please.
[SPEAKER_08]: Can I suggest that maybe we have a study
session?
[SPEAKER_08]: The city council and maybe with,
if you know, with these experts,
[SPEAKER_08]: I think that, you know, it's kind of
unfair to have this discussion during a
[SPEAKER_08]: council meeting when there's, you know,
we, we really need to have the time and
[SPEAKER_08]: not feel pressured by the fact that it's,
you know, 10 30 at night, maybe a
[SPEAKER_15]: subcommittee.
[SPEAKER_15]: How about a subcommittee or two?
[SPEAKER_15]: So we can move more quickly.
[SPEAKER_08]: You know, I'm, I'm fine with whatever my
colleagues want.
[SPEAKER_08]: But, you know, I, I don't think it would
hurt to have a study session because I
[SPEAKER_08]: think we all, we all want to have an idea
of what's going on and what it all means.
[SPEAKER_08]: And, and if we can do that, maybe in June,
would that be too early?
[SPEAKER_14]: Well, I was thinking before we got to the
study session, maybe a subcommittee of
[SPEAKER_14]: council get in there and start working
with the experts.
[SPEAKER_14]: So at least we have two of us plugged in
with all the experts.
[SPEAKER_14]: And so we're able to talk to one another
at the study session.
[SPEAKER_08]: And then, and then maybe have a study
session in, in June or June.
[SPEAKER_08]: Or July with the council so that,
you know, we can get our questions
[SPEAKER_08]: answered, not feel like we're under
pressure.
[SPEAKER_08]: Public would have an opportunity to listen
and to, you know, give, provide input.
[SPEAKER_08]: But again, I think this is a complicated
issue.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think, you know, having this
discussion at 10 30 at night when really,
[SPEAKER_08]: I think we all, we want, we want to do
this right.
[SPEAKER_08]: And I think it would be helpful.
[SPEAKER_08]: At least for me to have that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Mayor, if I may, we also did approve as a
council, the annual cannabis education
[SPEAKER_06]: forum that will be coming.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I believe it's happening in August.
[SPEAKER_06]: So perhaps that might be an opportunity
for folks to get a sense of the direction
[SPEAKER_06]: we're heading and what's happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe we can at least have some role in
that conversation that's happening at that
[SPEAKER_06]: time.
[SPEAKER_15]: Mayor, with the subcommittee, I have an
interest in doing it.
[SPEAKER_15]: Just experiences I have.
[SPEAKER_14]: I don't know if any of my other colleagues
wish to do subcommittee on this.
[SPEAKER_17]: I'm interested, but if you're interested
or you're interested or I'm interested in
[SPEAKER_17]: doing it very much.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I'm not really in favor of a
subcommittee because I think it,
[SPEAKER_11]: as the mayor said, this is really
important.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think we should all be involved with
it from beginning to end.
[SPEAKER_17]: That seems fair too, especially if we can
do what she, what she suggested is have a
[SPEAKER_17]: six o'clock study session early at,
you know, a six o'clock study session that
[SPEAKER_17]: maybe defers the start of our meeting a
bit, but gets this out.
[SPEAKER_17]: Cause if we did that, we would have 150
people listening.
[SPEAKER_17]: And that might be part of that community
effort as well.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_10]: And then looking at staff, could we come
back at the second meeting in June with
[SPEAKER_10]: that schedule of when we're going to have
the study session and we get to explain
[SPEAKER_10]: what we're going to do and what we're
going to do.
[SPEAKER_10]: I think we can do that.
Yes.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_09]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think that based on what I'm hearing,
there is some broad consensus here that at
[SPEAKER_11]: least on some major points that the city
does want to allow for adult use cannabis.
[SPEAKER_11]: I think council is recognizing that we
play a regulatory role that we have some
[SPEAKER_11]: questions about the nature of the
regulations and some of the details,
[SPEAKER_11]: but I think on the broad policy issue,
there is some consensus here that it makes
[SPEAKER_11]: sense for us to be a leader here and have
regulations in place beginning January of
[SPEAKER_11]: 2018.
[SPEAKER_11]: And I think there's at least a couple of
us who've talked about the importance of
[SPEAKER_11]: taxation as well.
[SPEAKER_11]: So I think this is something that you've
gotten some direction and hopefully when
[SPEAKER_11]: you come back to us, we can narrow the
focus and we'll have some more
[SPEAKER_11]: information, but again, thank you.
[SPEAKER_04]: Also, I think I also heard, I think that
there wasn't a lot of support for
[SPEAKER_04]: warehousing or manufacturing where those
are the only things taking place.
[SPEAKER_06]: I was just actually going to jump in on
that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I, while I understand that geographic and
based on the kinds of facilities we have
[SPEAKER_06]: in the city, a warehouse and how we think
about it is probably not the likeliest
[SPEAKER_06]: thing to happen here.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I do think that there may be some,
and this is where experts will be really
[SPEAKER_06]: helpful.
[SPEAKER_06]: There are some potential opportunities for
cultivation and sites that are the size of
[SPEAKER_06]: existing buildings in West Hollywood.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so, and there might be some benefit to
keeping all of that in one site versus
[SPEAKER_06]: having things traveling and transporting
I'm not sure.
[SPEAKER_06]: So while it sounds like we are likely in
agreement about the likelihood of it
[SPEAKER_06]: happening in the city, probably not.
[SPEAKER_06]: I am interested in knowing more from
experts what the cost benefit of that
[SPEAKER_06]: might be.
[SPEAKER_17]: And I sort of want to say the same thing
about manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think a sort of small, I don't want to
say homemade, but a small manufacturer who
[SPEAKER_17]: manufactured products in small batches
that sort of that was their thing.
[SPEAKER_17]: That was what they were providing.
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's where we make it.
[SPEAKER_17]: Here's where you buy it.
[SPEAKER_17]: I think we want to allow for that as well,
like a fine restaurant or a wine bar or
[SPEAKER_17]: sort of that sort of thing.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: One last thing.
[SPEAKER_11]: As we look at regulations, I think Council
Member D'Amico brought up the point of
[SPEAKER_11]: on-site use.
[SPEAKER_11]: We treat on-site consumption of alcohol
different than a retailer that sells
[SPEAKER_11]: alcohol and perhaps that's something that
we should be looking at as well.
[SPEAKER_07]: Anyone else?
[SPEAKER_07]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_11]: So do we need a motion or did you just get
to sufficient?
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's the direction.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think we got a lot of good direction
like you indicated.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's pretty clear that the City Council
wants us to go forward with looking at
[SPEAKER_04]: opening up the city and making sure that
we have to address this subject in a
[SPEAKER_04]: strong way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
Thank you.
