[SPEAKER_01]: Best practices and having personnel files,
disciplinary files, handbooks,
[SPEAKER_01]: policies, procedures, those sort of things
in place so that when an environment which
[SPEAKER_01]: right now is very collegial and everybody
sort of knows each other and is growing
[SPEAKER_01]: together, goes through some sort of a
cyclical nature and people need to be let
[SPEAKER_01]: go or someone has a performance issue and
they claim discrimination or something
[SPEAKER_01]: along those lines, the company has
something to go back to to say well these
[SPEAKER_01]: were our policies and procedures for
example, here's the discipline we gave
[SPEAKER_01]: you, these are the warnings we gave you,
here's our open door policy for example
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you really had all these concerns
which you're now voicing and you didn't
[SPEAKER_01]: voice way back when, why not, those sort
of things.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's been a big issue on the
compliance front.
[SPEAKER_01]: On the discrimination and harassment
front, I think a lot of what we've seen is
[SPEAKER_01]: a nascent industry sort of growing up very
quickly and in the early days of the
[SPEAKER_01]: industry, you would have everybody sort of
being friends, everybody sort of knows
[SPEAKER_01]: each other or they're referred in from
somebody they know, it's a very
[SPEAKER_01]: comfortable situation, there's not a lot
of boundaries or rules or policies or
[SPEAKER_01]: procedures in place to sort of lay some of
the expectations out there and things were
[SPEAKER_01]: pretty loose.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a bad environment to be in from an
employer standpoint because people will
[SPEAKER_01]: right or wrong get the understanding that
they can get away with certain things,
[SPEAKER_01]: that certain behavior might be okay in
this industry whereas if you went to work
[SPEAKER_01]: for a law firm and you wore a suit and a
tie just by operation of the way you're
[SPEAKER_01]: dressed and the environment that you're
in, you might think oh well this doesn't
[SPEAKER_01]: really fly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The cannabis industry is no different than
any other industry, you are employers,
[SPEAKER_01]: these are your employees, you have to take
steps to create a professional environment
[SPEAKER_01]: so that individuals understand we don't
want you doing certain things and if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're an employee that is subjected to
some behavior that they don't like,
[SPEAKER_01]: we want you to tell us about it so that we
can take steps and we have policies and
[SPEAKER_01]: procedures out there that tell anybody in
the universe, if you tell us about stuff,
[SPEAKER_01]: we will do something about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's the sort of environment that you
want to create in a business to put
[SPEAKER_01]: yourself at least in a good starting spot
if something bad happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: People are gonna do stupid things,
it's just human nature.
[SPEAKER_01]: But from a company standpoint,
if you can show that you have a policy,
[SPEAKER_01]: you have a procedure, you have an open
door and over time you've got a track
[SPEAKER_01]: record for doing stuff when people
complain, that puts you in the best seat
[SPEAKER_01]: possible if somebody does something stupid
and injures another employee or harasses
[SPEAKER_01]: another employee.
[SPEAKER_00]: My analogy or my example of what would be
appropriate somewhere is in the NBA on the
[SPEAKER_00]: basketball team, they pat each other's
butts.
[SPEAKER_00]: What would happen if you were walking down
the hall and one of your colleagues patted
[SPEAKER_00]: you on the butt and you were like,
you rocked it in court yesterday.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'd be like, that was weird.
[SPEAKER_01]: Without going too deep into the definition
of sexual harassment, there is a context
[SPEAKER_01]: to some of these things and there's some
famous cases out there, one involving a
[SPEAKER_01]: bunch of writers for the show Friends
where they're developing topics for the
[SPEAKER_01]: show and the nature of the business is
talking about relationships and sex and
[SPEAKER_01]: who's sleeping with who or which
relationship.
[SPEAKER_01]: In that context, there's gonna be a
discussion about sex.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you're a line worker at McDonald's
and you're making hamburgers, there's no
[SPEAKER_01]: reason for you to be discussing sex with
your coworkers.
[SPEAKER_01]: Similarly in the cannabis space,
there's a conversation probably that would
[SPEAKER_01]: take place about legalization of drugs or
legalization of cannabis or that sort of
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: But outside of that, there's really no,
why would you be discussing sex,
[SPEAKER_01]: for example, or race or maybe the topic
would be social equity.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's a discussion about social
equity and what that means in that
[SPEAKER_01]: context.
[SPEAKER_01]: But to discuss somebody else's race and I
heard you're a particular race and does
[SPEAKER_01]: that mean that you are blank?
[SPEAKER_01]: We're outside the bounds of what the
context of that discussion should be given
[SPEAKER_01]: the industry.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, it just needs to become more
professional, I think, is the overarching
[SPEAKER_01]: theme that we're trying to tell people and
what we're sort of encountering is very
[SPEAKER_01]: loose, very lax environment, some of which
business owners are telling us,
[SPEAKER_01]: well, this is what I want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're telling them, look, no good deed
goes unpunished.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have this very lax environment,
that's okay if people wear jeans and
[SPEAKER_01]: t-shirts to work, but you also need to
have a conversation with your employer
[SPEAKER_01]: about what sort of behavior is appropriate
and what's expected of them so that they
[SPEAKER_01]: don't mistake the fact that you can wear
shorts and a t-shirt to work to mean you
[SPEAKER_01]: can wear certain outfits to work that are
going to be inappropriate or because a
[SPEAKER_01]: female employee is wearing a particular
outfit, a male employee can start
[SPEAKER_01]: commenting on her body.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just, they don't go hand in hand.
[SPEAKER_00]: So some of the things that if you were to
grow up as a business, you'd what,
[SPEAKER_00]: like employee handbooks and training
programs and can you just give me some
[SPEAKER_00]: examples of like some easy, low-hanging
fruit that a business that has no
[SPEAKER_00]: procedures or protocols or best practices
could start it on?
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of blocking and tackling,
some of the basics are going to be,
[SPEAKER_01]: there's certain things that you have to
have by law in terms of your payroll
[SPEAKER_01]: records.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have a commission agreement with an
employee, it has to be in writing.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to keep certain, you have to
provide certain notices to individuals
[SPEAKER_01]: when they're hired.
[SPEAKER_01]: These sort of things just have to be there
and you should be documenting that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: giving these sort of things and keeping
those in a personnel file.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond some of those mandatory things,
the employee handbook would be the first
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that I would probably mention.
[SPEAKER_01]: And there are different levels of
sophistication.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's sort of a magic number around 25
and 50 employees where different laws
[SPEAKER_01]: start to kick in.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I would tell an individual,
if you've got less than 50 employees,
[SPEAKER_01]: you can have a pretty simple handbook that
sort of covers the basics and lets you
[SPEAKER_01]: communicate to your employees what's
expected of them, provides required
[SPEAKER_01]: notices and gets you going.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you get past 50 employees,
some additional statutes kick in where you
[SPEAKER_01]: have to add some things to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, it's not some mountainous task.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of the stuff that's sort of in the
can and a good lawyer or a good HR
[SPEAKER_01]: consultant can give it to you pretty
quickly.
[SPEAKER_01]: The other thing that is somewhat required,
somewhat recommended would be training.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you're in California and you've got
employees, you should be training your
[SPEAKER_01]: managers on sexual harassment.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's a requirement under the law.
[SPEAKER_01]: Beyond that, in terms of educating
managers, it's not required by the law,
[SPEAKER_01]: but like a handbook, I would encourage
employees or employers, excuse me,
[SPEAKER_01]: or cannabis businesses to be doing it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teach them what disability and lead
management looks like.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of times people don't understand
what an individual's rights are in terms
[SPEAKER_01]: of if they're sick or they're disabled or
they're injured on the job, what they
[SPEAKER_01]: should be doing.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's a giant area of liability right now
for employers across all industries and
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis will be no exception.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teach managers about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Hours and wage and hour issues.
[SPEAKER_01]: Teach your managers about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have an expectation that people are
working a particular schedule,
[SPEAKER_01]: help them understand that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Help them understand what the requirements
for meal periods and rest breaks are.
[SPEAKER_01]: Educate them on the fact that they can't
be changing employees' work hours or
[SPEAKER_01]: adjusting clocks without legitimate
reasons and some documentation on those.
[SPEAKER_01]: Try to stave off some of the stuff that
will get you sued down the road.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if something happens, again,
from an employer standpoint, you want to
[SPEAKER_01]: be able to say, this is outside the norm.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is not what we expected, whether it's
discrimination or a manager manipulating
[SPEAKER_01]: somebody's time card.
[SPEAKER_01]: You want to be able to show from a company
standpoint, that's not the expectation.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not what you want.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you had some effort out there to try
to prevent it from happening.
[SPEAKER_01]: Again, people will do silly things and
they will make mistakes, but the more you
[SPEAKER_01]: can do from a company standpoint to show
that that's not what was expected,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is not a company-wide practice or
procedure, the better you will do at
[SPEAKER_01]: staving off big damage claims,
punitive damages, certain penalty
[SPEAKER_01]: provisions under the labor code,
that sort of stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
