[SPEAKER_00]: There's another interesting aspect about
Canadian law people don't really
[SPEAKER_00]: understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you do a small trial in the United
States and your formulation shows
[SPEAKER_00]: efficacy, you are then required to go the
FDA route.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't take it to the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now shown efficacy, you have to go
through the full whole hog FDA testing.
[SPEAKER_00]: In Canada, and that's hundreds of millions
of dollars, in Canada we can take some of
[SPEAKER_00]: our formulations, do a trial, a small
trial that shows that it's efficacious and
[SPEAKER_00]: go a nutraceutical route and start selling
it immediately and making claims on what
[SPEAKER_00]: it does based on the documented study that
we did.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's an avenue.
[SPEAKER_00]: The United States' approach keeps medicine
off the shelves, keeps remedies off the
[SPEAKER_00]: shelves.
