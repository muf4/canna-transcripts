[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so I guess the key is to pay
attention right You get that 8% terpene
[SPEAKER_03]: strain and you don't know why it's a
bummer Cool so on data collection To be
[SPEAKER_03]: able to understand What our purpose is,
you know, a lot of people come into and
[SPEAKER_03]: say I just want to grow a shit ton of weed
Well, I mean, you know, okay Well,
[SPEAKER_03]: I want to I want to grow this type and I
want to grow this well, you got to kind of
[SPEAKER_03]: understand what your focus is You know and
focus is a hard thing for some of us
[SPEAKER_03]: Exactly so really really one of the one of
the highest benchmarks to really aim for
[SPEAKER_03]: is the pre planning right because this is
the phase that really tells us what our
[SPEAKER_03]: business model is and what we're trying to
build for the market that we're trying to
[SPEAKER_03]: produce for The the plants that we're
trying to grow and cultivate for that
[SPEAKER_03]: production method and how we're actually
even gonna do it down to the what is my
[SPEAKER_03]: facility gonna look like who Am I gonna
hire for it?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so pre planning is one of those steps
in the process that kind of gets
[SPEAKER_03]: overlooked when creating the business
model It's it's easy to it's easy to get
[SPEAKER_03]: 40 million and throw it into a huge
project But without knowing and
[SPEAKER_03]: understanding what you're actually trying
to achieve.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's a lot of wasted money.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so Let's start over here with Anya.
[SPEAKER_03]: What kind of things in the pre planning
realm that you see are kind of an often
[SPEAKER_03]: Mistake and things that people can do to
kind of help mitigate that that risk at
[SPEAKER_01]: the beginning Oh, I feel like that's a
minefield of a question right there I
[SPEAKER_01]: Think From an example standpoint one of
the biggest mistakes that people make is
[SPEAKER_01]: Expecting that they can have a budget
without a plan So you say you can throw 40
[SPEAKER_01]: million dollars into a huge project And if
you have no plan you can be 40 million
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars in and not two-thirds of the way
through the project so Not understanding
[SPEAKER_01]: that there actually has to be a plan to
Determine a process and a budget is I
[SPEAKER_01]: think mistake number one the number of
people that come to me that say we have a
[SPEAKER_01]: building We want to build out XYZ.
[SPEAKER_01]: They've got a drawing on a napkin.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much is it gonna cost me?
[SPEAKER_01]: It's gonna cost you anywhere from two
hundred thousand dollars to ten million
[SPEAKER_01]: dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: So Like if that's the starting point and
the expectation is that you're gonna get
[SPEAKER_01]: Anywhere within a reasonable range to be
able to make a plan You're already in the
[SPEAKER_01]: weeds and I swear I didn't mean that as a
joke The planning has to happen on the
[SPEAKER_01]: project and the development before you
even get to how much is this gonna cost me
[SPEAKER_01]: and if you Don't do it in that order You
will ultimately wind up Not seeing a
[SPEAKER_01]: return and you will ultimately wind up
failing before you even start So there are
[SPEAKER_01]: many other things that I could speak to
about that, but I'm gonna stay with that
[SPEAKER_02]: one Yeah, so I could speak on this for a
minute as well, you know for From for me
[SPEAKER_02]: in sort of environmental control HVAC
world What we see is the biggest I don't
[SPEAKER_02]: know lack of understanding is how much
it's gonna cost to control the environment
[SPEAKER_02]: in your greenhouse or or your warehouse
and You know, I think that you know
[SPEAKER_02]: Speaking of squirrels is that we get so
growers get so focused on certain
[SPEAKER_02]: technologies It could be lighting where it
could be a hydro a new hydroponic system
[SPEAKER_02]: or a new automation system and they forget
about the other pieces and how the all
[SPEAKER_02]: those pieces will integrate together and
People come up with very unrealistic
[SPEAKER_02]: budgets, especially for environmental
control And you know, we had a project
[SPEAKER_02]: once where they were gonna spend $100,000
on the latest LED technology $25,000 on
[SPEAKER_02]: sensors are gonna put sensors everywhere
and $5,000 on an HVAC system and I'm just
[SPEAKER_02]: like what are you gonna control with all
your sensors?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know when it comes to greenhouse
Versus warehouses even is where is the
[SPEAKER_02]: best location?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where are you located?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know if if you know where you're gonna
be located doesn't make more sense to have
[SPEAKER_02]: an open greenhouse It could be a high
tunnel right cold flame cold frame
[SPEAKER_02]: greenhouse because you have good breezes
and you have a pretty mild climate and you
[SPEAKER_02]: just want some protection and some light
depth but if you're in a harsher climate,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, do you need a closed greenhouse
and if you do that's you know $150 a
[SPEAKER_02]: square foot type of Greenhouse this is not
a cold frame $5 a square foot greenhouse
[SPEAKER_02]: and don't split the difference either
because it's pretty expensive so For me,
[SPEAKER_02]: it's budget is you know growers under
having a realistic budget about what?
[SPEAKER_02]: Their facility or their greenhouse is
going to to look like in the end So,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know kind of going back to the
question of you know initial planning
[SPEAKER_00]: stages and things like that, you know,
obviously there are a lot of ways to Skin
[SPEAKER_00]: a cat is one of the sayings that I like to
use and so, you know understanding one
[SPEAKER_00]: what your Model is is probably helpful,
you know and given that, you know the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry and Regulations and you
know things are moving quite rapidly.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, my suggestion would be that
Whatever you plan on Plan on it being lean
[SPEAKER_00]: and plan on it being nimble, you know if
you go in big and heavy And hard and
[SPEAKER_00]: frontloaded all and you're like,
we're just gonna crush it we're gonna see
[SPEAKER_00]: such crazy returns and You miss out on
some of the pieces that you know
[SPEAKER_00]: pre-planning like well, we didn't invest
into an on-site extraction We didn't put
[SPEAKER_00]: that in our model because we're we're
gonna grow all a grade flower You know not
[SPEAKER_00]: recognizing that like a much better model
would be incorporating that potentially
[SPEAKER_00]: waste stream into the overall
profitability of the business And so,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know That's that's just sort of a
tidbit.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm sure all of us could go on You know
the mistakes that have been made and the
[SPEAKER_01]: money wasted but you know pre-planning
electricity coming from right Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: it can be pretty dynamic and as we see
it's rapidly evolving I came from the
[SPEAKER_03]: organ market and I'm sure we've all heard
about kind of the challenges in the the
[SPEAKER_03]: evolution that that market has Taken and
if anything that showed us all that we
[SPEAKER_03]: have to just be ready and available to
adapt to the circumstances But there is
[SPEAKER_03]: there is a certain level of pre-thought
and understanding now that we know these
[SPEAKER_03]: certain markets are this way you wouldn't
move into Oklahoma and expect it to just
[SPEAKER_03]: be the most amazing thing it's gonna be a
challenge so knowing what your local
[SPEAKER_03]: legislature has to offer and the potential
changes that might come is Is really
[SPEAKER_03]: important to bring into that pre-planning
phase.
[SPEAKER_01]: I also just to capitalize on what you said
being nimble and being ready to change I
[SPEAKER_01]: think is huge and Recognizing to the what
now you and I were speaking about earlier
[SPEAKER_01]: that none of these changes are changing a
wall color So when the company that you
[SPEAKER_01]: based your design off of starts having all
sorts of manufacturing problems with your
[SPEAKER_01]: fixtures and you decide to go with a
different fixture You're starting all the
[SPEAKER_01]: way back from the beginning everything
changes every single aspect of your
[SPEAKER_01]: facility changes by one tiny little
seemingly insignificant change of a piece
[SPEAKER_01]: of equipment and recognizing that Yes,
you're gonna have to be prepared to do
[SPEAKER_01]: that because technology is changing every
other day new stuff is coming out
[SPEAKER_01]: companies are coming up companies are
falling down people are failing we are
[SPEAKER_01]: learning constantly and Very often we
suggest to people that they phase a
[SPEAKER_01]: project Instead of going all in all out
right from the beginning Yeah,
[SPEAKER_03]: absolutely and another one of those
aspects of that is actually the design of
[SPEAKER_03]: the facility itself So you understand your
business model somewhat you understand the
[SPEAKER_03]: road path on where you're going You've
started to bring in the team that can
[SPEAKER_03]: design this system for you Now you
understand how am I gonna lay this out
[SPEAKER_03]: whether it be a greenhouse whether it be
an indoor facility How am I gonna lay this
[SPEAKER_03]: out?
[SPEAKER_03]: What does the law in my state require?
[SPEAKER_03]: What am I allowed to do?
[SPEAKER_03]: What are my limitations?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of retrofit designs.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of new construction designs
So maybe let's kind of go into some of the
[SPEAKER_03]: differences in in in the actual
implementation of the design for retrofit
[SPEAKER_03]: compared to a brand new build and some of
the challenges that have you've seen
[SPEAKER_00]: comparatively In in a nutshell Well,
I could say I've had the misfortune
[SPEAKER_00]: perhaps of Dealing with a lot more
retrofits and pre-built facilities than
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, the ideal fresh build That being
said, you know, I think it's yeah,
[SPEAKER_00]: right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty important to you know,
once you're Have some some clear
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding of what you're working with
It's pretty important to understand the
[SPEAKER_00]: limitations of that system You know again
back to kind of what the model is and what
[SPEAKER_00]: what you're striving to produce You know
if you have hoop houses At 4,000 square
[SPEAKER_00]: feet certainly don't have a model where
you think you're gonna produce here
[SPEAKER_00]: around, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, if you have a greenhouse in the
desert You know understand that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna use a lot of water for pad cooling,
you know And you're gonna use a
[SPEAKER_00]: significant amount of power to run those
fans all the time and so, you know It's
[SPEAKER_00]: really in the minutiae that that the
efficiency is found and you know until you
[SPEAKER_00]: continue to you know amass more data and
understand what those data points can be
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're you're Only making as
much progress as as what you can sort of
[SPEAKER_03]: analyze and capture in that way and on
that I just want to add to we don't want
[SPEAKER_03]: to leave out the you know, the the outdoor
scaping as well too because there's a lot
[SPEAKER_03]: of situations where you come into a
previously used farm or a previously used
[SPEAKER_03]: Spot of land and you have to make
something of it too.
[SPEAKER_03]: So let's not let's not forget about the
retro as far as the land goes So I'm
[SPEAKER_01]: actually that's actually what I was gonna
speak to not just land but buildings as
[SPEAKER_01]: well If we're talking retrofit of a space
not necessarily retrofit of an existing
[SPEAKER_01]: farm what was that space used for before
and We are seeing and it comes back to
[SPEAKER_01]: planning in terms of understanding Where
is it actually most efficient for you to
[SPEAKER_01]: land right for a long time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Everybody wanted to go out agriculturally
because that was gonna Be the cheapest
[SPEAKER_01]: because land was inexpensive property was
inexpensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: You had a lot of space You had a lot of
options.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well as it turns out there is not an
extensive electrical grid out in
[SPEAKER_01]: agricultural territory because we didn't
farm this way we had not massive
[SPEAKER_01]: electrical usage on farms and so what
people learned after the fact I may say is
[SPEAKER_01]: that as it turned out it was going to cost
them $400,000 to bring enough electricity
[SPEAKER_01]: to their facility so okay now everybody
wants to go in an urban environment,
[SPEAKER_01]: but Buildings and rent are really
expensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we're gonna find a previously used car
lot and we are going to dump a bunch of
[SPEAKER_01]: greenhouses on that car lot Wow,
what's the remediation question there?
[SPEAKER_01]: What are the other facilities around you
doing in a highly urban industrial
[SPEAKER_01]: environment and how does that impact the
product that you're Producing coming out
[SPEAKER_01]: of that environment So what mitigations do
you need to put in place in order to make
[SPEAKER_01]: that retrofit safe and effective?
[SPEAKER_01]: For the business that you are now going to
be operating in there You You
