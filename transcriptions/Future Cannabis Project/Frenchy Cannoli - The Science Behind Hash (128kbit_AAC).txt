Qu'est-ce qu'il s'est passé à l'époque ?
[SPEAKER_00]: Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé ?
[SPEAKER_00]: Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé à l'époque ?
[SPEAKER_00]: Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé à l'époque ?
[SPEAKER_00]: Qu'est-ce qui s'est passé à l'époque ?
[SPEAKER_00]: already gave me a break.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it was still illegal.
[SPEAKER_00]: You still could be busted.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's mostly a deal with the cops.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you don't feel like the scum of the
world.
[SPEAKER_00]: You feel like a bad boy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it's not legal, but it's part of
the culture and has been for hundreds and
[SPEAKER_00]: hundreds of years.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, it was a bit more
comfortable.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in Ash country, you work with a plant
mostly in the winter, because that's when
[SPEAKER_00]: it's dry and cold and you can actually
separate sticky resin head.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you work with a bundle of dry flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like the connection with the plant
is not really strong.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, everything was resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: In India, it changed a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: In India, it becomes spiritual.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like you dedicate every smoke to a
god.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the cannabis plant is supposed to have
been born in a drop of the elixir of life
[SPEAKER_00]: that falls from the sky.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's a pretty big deal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And there also, it's still illegal in
India, but it's like it gives you that
[SPEAKER_00]: space of mind where you don't have that
negative pressure on you.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all my life, I met Ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what I did all my life,
even when I started to play around to
[SPEAKER_00]: smoke Ash straight up, I started to work
with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I traveled in this producing
country, I didn't really go at the feet of
[SPEAKER_00]: Ashishin to learn the trade.
[SPEAKER_00]: I went that deep and I stayed that long in
this producing place, because to get the
[SPEAKER_00]: Ash I wanted to smoke, you needed to make
it yourself.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not for sale.
[SPEAKER_00]: What I wanted, it's a stash of the local.
[SPEAKER_00]: So instead of coming and just buying
something and staying at best a few days,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was staying months with the family.
[SPEAKER_00]: And while you're not there to learn,
because you work in their workspace and
[SPEAKER_00]: you work with their tool, and they're the
only one you can ask questions,
[SPEAKER_00]: actually, because there were no Google,
no books about it, nothing about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You do learn.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then in India, that's Ashish,
that's dry and cured raisin.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then in India, it became different because
you stick the raisin on the palm of your
[SPEAKER_00]: hand when the plant is live at the peak of
a flowering time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there you have a pretty strong relation
with the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But still, as much as I could appreciate
the flower that I was carrying to collect
[SPEAKER_00]: that raisin, it was still all about the
raisin.
[SPEAKER_00]: I started to understand flower when I came
here to the States.
[SPEAKER_00]: And during those 18 years solid traveling
in producing country, people could
[SPEAKER_00]: appreciate that I had made the Ash,
but nobody truly cared that I did it.
[SPEAKER_00]: What was important was where did I go to
make that Ash.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's what the quality came from the
place I want to make it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that if you stay in a valley at 800
feet, or if you go up the mountain today,
[SPEAKER_00]: walk at 8,000, well, you don't get the
same genetics, you don't get the same
[SPEAKER_00]: raisin.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what quality means.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that I made it here, but in the
Himachal Pradesh, in the state here,
[SPEAKER_00]: but which valley which hamlet did you go
to make it?
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's the quality of the raisin.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's land, the climate, and the genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's never, I mean, in my whole lifetime,
it had never been the guy who made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I came here to the States,
everything changed because I realized that
[SPEAKER_00]: the plant was medicinal, and I had no idea
that the plant was medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I did the same than any producing
country.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you want the good stuff, you go to the
producing place, you go as deep as
[SPEAKER_00]: possible inside, and you hook with a
family.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you cannot do, you cannot hook with a
family in an emerald triangle the same way
[SPEAKER_00]: that you hook with a family in Pakistan,
in India, in Nepal, or in Morocco.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I used an emerald cup to be able to
connect with a farmer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I started to work with
aficionados, it was still the land,
[SPEAKER_00]: it was still the climate, but behind the
cultivar, they were the breeder,
[SPEAKER_00]: which changed a lot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Credit has to be given.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, it's not like in producing
countries.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is actually a farmer that is
dedicated for six months so that plants
[SPEAKER_00]: thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: In producing countries, they cut the
ground, they throw the seeds during the
[SPEAKER_00]: rainy season, and that's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: They harvest.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in my mind, I became more like a
winemaker, and I worked with certain
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivar that I grown in certain vineyard.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the value of what I do, it's not me
making it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the point of origin and the people
that created the product I work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything that you see on IG,
it's not me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's an expression of the quality that is
grown in an emerald triangle with
[SPEAKER_00]: sun-grown plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's vastly different.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put me in a shitty farm in Morocco,
I'm not going to do the same quality.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like I am totally dependent on the
farmer and on the genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is nothing more important in my life
than my small farmer thriving,
[SPEAKER_00]: because otherwise, I cannot do anything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Going back, so all those 18 solid years of
making ash, when I came here to America,
[SPEAKER_00]: I was pretty good with the tool.
[SPEAKER_00]: But for me, making ash was just something
I was doing every year to be able to smoke
[SPEAKER_00]: good stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really a pastime.
[SPEAKER_00]: Something that was really important
because I would have given anything to be
[SPEAKER_00]: three, four months in a mountain in India,
or like three, four months of making ash
[SPEAKER_00]: was like they were nothing in those 18
years that could have taken me away from
[SPEAKER_00]: it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I came here to the States with
that vision of it's actually a medicine as
[SPEAKER_00]: well, in my head, I became more like a
craftman.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a craftman, there is two things in
their life.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a product you work with and there
is a tool you work with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I knew the tool super well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had played with tool left and right with
many families in different country,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I had no clue.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was totally ignorant about the product I
was working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was calling that pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: Outside America, loose resin head,
tricon head are called pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is not really helpful to define the
product you're working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: So not only because I am so controversial
in what I do, not only did I need to prove
[SPEAKER_00]: myself, but during all these 18 years
solid traveling in producing country,
[SPEAKER_00]: I have experienced a lot of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I had never had answer for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like in ash producing countries,
they don't sieve their resin, their
[SPEAKER_00]: plants, they don't sieve them until they
are three to nine months cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't use the word cured.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just keep them in a specific room for
so long.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you ask them, why do you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it makes better resin,
which is true.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they press and you ask them,
why do you press and why do you eat,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's because it makes better ashish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the answer, it's a fact that they know
and that has been proven through
[SPEAKER_00]: generation and generation and generation
of ash maker.
[SPEAKER_00]: But they don't have the science behind.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just know that it's it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had a lot of questions when I came
and I had the ability to touch science.
[SPEAKER_00]: And for me, the first things I needed to
know was what is it that I am actually
[SPEAKER_00]: sieving?
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichome.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trichome, it's already a world in
itself.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant kingdom produced somewhere
around 200,000 organic compounds in those
[SPEAKER_00]: trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's basically the tool that the plant
use to manipulate every living mobile
[SPEAKER_00]: organism for reproduction.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to think that the plant
kingdom has 500 million years of evolution
[SPEAKER_00]: on top of us.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're definitely aware and they are most
certainly have a sense of intelligence
[SPEAKER_00]: because they literally rule the planet
through an expression of terpene and those
[SPEAKER_00]: 200,000 compounds that they produce.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have been able to conquer the whole
world while they are not mobile.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is something behind that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we know a lot of things about
trichomes, but science cannot figure out
[SPEAKER_00]: what the full potential of those 200,000
compounds can be because there is no
[SPEAKER_00]: alchemy that can even visualize so much to
play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this goes from the most toxic to the
most beneficial compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is on the planet.
[SPEAKER_00]: So trichomes are pretty widely used by the
plant kingdom, but there is only one plant
[SPEAKER_00]: in 400,000 plants known that produce
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trichomes are mostly seen as two in two
categories.
[SPEAKER_00]: You have the Aries.
[SPEAKER_00]: The Aries ones that really look like
little air and they are pretty abrasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have the glandular trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's the glandular trichomes that
produce those organic compounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the cannabis plant produce
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the cannabinoid plant can produce
cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: Biosynthetics, the two most common
compounds in a molecule in a plant
[SPEAKER_00]: kingdom, terpene and phenol, everything
that you eat that is green is phenol.
[SPEAKER_00]: And terpene, everything that smells is
terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's interesting is terpene is highly
toxic and phenol is pretty toxic too.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get really sick over dosing on
phenol.
[SPEAKER_00]: Only the cannabis plant can take two toxic
compounds and make 150 plus non-toxic one.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty badass.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the cannabis plant has five types of
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: She has two types of Aries ones.
[SPEAKER_00]: They come straight up when the plant
grows.
[SPEAKER_00]: On the first leaves, they are already
apparent.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then during the growth, they are
mostly on the underside of the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is protection against predator
because they are pretty abrasive.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are so abrasive that it give a lot of
people problem when they are trimming
[SPEAKER_00]: because it give allergy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that abrasivity and those organic
compounds that the plant secret that cause
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's a protection against predator in a
certain way.
[SPEAKER_00]: We may be helping on the pollination,
but we are on the predator side too.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when it's really dense, also,
it protects the leaf from dehydration.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we have three types of glandular
trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: The first one are those really,
really tiny, tiny little trichomes,
[SPEAKER_00]: the bulbous one.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are 10 micron diameter and with a two
cell, tiny little trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They don't produce cannabinoids.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't really know what they're used to.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's known is that they produce some
organics that help clean the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you have the capital cecille.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's those bigger resin heads that look
like they are stuck directly on the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you look horizontally, there is
actually a small stalk to it, but you
[SPEAKER_00]: really need to see them horizontal.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are 70, 100 micron diameter.
[SPEAKER_00]: They do produce cannabinoids and we don't
really know what other function they have
[SPEAKER_00]: for the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you have the capital stalk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Everything with a long stalk is a capital
stalk and when the stalk is a little
[SPEAKER_00]: smaller one from the other, it's different
stage of the growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those ones produce cannabinoids a lot more
than the cecille just because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dimension of the shell chamber,
eight times plus, quantity-wise.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to understand that trichomes
are not part of the main metabolism of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: What the plant produces in those trichomes
are called secondary metabolites.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant produces those trichomes first
when it's flower time and pollination
[SPEAKER_00]: time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If there is a lot of sticky substance on
the flower, you're gonna collect a lot
[SPEAKER_00]: more pollen.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you get a lot more than normal because
the plant goes bunker, not getting pollen,
[SPEAKER_00]: so it produce more because it want to be
sure that some pollen is gonna come.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you keep a male in your grow room,
they go even crazier because they know
[SPEAKER_00]: there is a male in the room and they are
not getting it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a second aspect of that
production of trichomes.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a protection aspect of that
extraction.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's the defensive system of the plant
which trigger it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need climatic condition.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to stress your plant to be able
to get that stage of production of resin.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you have a lot of those stalk resin
trichomes next to each other and the head
[SPEAKER_00]: are basically touching each other,
the length of the stalk is the corridor of
[SPEAKER_00]: air that's take air condition basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So that there is nothing that can hamper
the full function of the leaf and it
[SPEAKER_00]: protect it from dehydration during the day
when it's really hot and during cold night
[SPEAKER_00]: from the cold burning the leaf.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the stronger the climatic difference
night, night and day are, the more you go
[SPEAKER_00]: into that second production of resin head
which you hardly have when you work in
[SPEAKER_00]: indoor because you really want to
stabilize everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to flip her out.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to make the plant understand
that it gonna get a little colder.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you don't need to put her at 25,
you know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need to trigger it and there is
also actually some nutrients that could do
[SPEAKER_00]: that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think I have it in the note I would
send you.
[SPEAKER_00]: But I didn't check the dude yet.
[SPEAKER_00]: But there is a way to trigger the
defensive system of the plant without
[SPEAKER_00]: having to stress it indoor.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you do greenhouse, it's easier.
[SPEAKER_00]: When the plant it's ungrown, well,
that's what it does.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you have to really understand that you
do not create, you do not grow tricone.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant produce them to protect herself
or for pollination which is really very
[SPEAKER_00]: different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you cannot judge the maturity of your
flower which is the peak of the main
[SPEAKER_00]: metabolism by the expression of the
secondary metabolism.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has nothing to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You cannot judge something that the plant
use to protect itself to tell you how ripe
[SPEAKER_00]: the flower is.
[SPEAKER_00]: However, that three peak window of
perfection for harvest is really define
[SPEAKER_00]: the amount of resin that is forming your
resin head.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you cannot judge the maturity of the
plant by the flower, by the resin,
[SPEAKER_00]: but that maturity of the resin is going to
be defined by that peak flower cycle.
[SPEAKER_00]: I told you that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So once I had the idea of what was the
tricone, then I needed to know what was
[SPEAKER_00]: going on in those tricones because I
didn't know much about cannabinoid and all
[SPEAKER_00]: that stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was not existing in the 70s and 80s and
90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the plant, some precursor of terpen,
nutrient, all the enzymes that do the
[SPEAKER_00]: synthase of transformation go through the
stock, is stored on the underbelly of the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: The precursor of terpen become terpen.
[SPEAKER_00]: They pass into that main secretory
vesicle.
[SPEAKER_00]: There they bond with the phenol through
different synthase.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just the binding of the two most
common molecule, but the magic behind that
[SPEAKER_00]: bonding and biosynthesis, it's crazy and
they have figured out, I think,
[SPEAKER_00]: half a dozen of those synthases.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are far from understanding the whole
transformation of all the cannabinoid in a
[SPEAKER_00]: plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's pretty hardcore, but you don't really
need to understand the science behind
[SPEAKER_00]: those transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to understand the transformation
stage only to be able to manipulate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: You don't need to to be a scientist to be
able to use science.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just need their conclusion to be able
to step and go further.
[SPEAKER_00]: Once the cannabinoids are formed,
they go through that membrane and they
[SPEAKER_00]: store into that secretory cavity that
slowly, slowly, slowly filled up and the
[SPEAKER_00]: other one becomes smaller.
[SPEAKER_00]: So then, the first cannabinoid that come
from the synthase, it's CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the first one.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBGA looks so difficult to make that you
can grow cannabinoid on yeast,
[SPEAKER_00]: but you need the CBGA to start with.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have not figured out how to make the
CBGA in lab.
[SPEAKER_00]: They need to take it from the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, knowing that the CBGA is the first
synthase, if you have flower lab tests
[SPEAKER_00]: with a lot of CBGA, well, there is a good
chance that you didn't wait enough for the
[SPEAKER_00]: transformation of CBGA into CBDA,
THCA and CBCA and all the other
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabinoid to happen because it's very,
very, very, very rare that a plant stays
[SPEAKER_00]: in that CBGA state.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are freaks and it's very rare.
[SPEAKER_00]: There is a lot of people who claim having
high CBGA plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you can get a lot of high CBGA if
you are there three weeks early,
[SPEAKER_00]: two weeks early.
[SPEAKER_00]: You got plenty of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But at the same time, don't get me wrong.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you extract and you want CBGA because
the CBGA plant are so rare, it's a pretty
[SPEAKER_00]: good way to get your CBGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: The thing is you don't get as much and the
cost of it is huge because if like me,
[SPEAKER_00]: if you are a farmer, if the guy want your
other three weeks earlier or three weeks
[SPEAKER_00]: later, well, the difference in price is
not gonna be really big.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know what I mean?
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant give you all those cannabinoid
with the carboxyl acid group compound
[SPEAKER_00]: attached to it, the A.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that A block all psychoactive aspect of
the cannabinoid?
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that as long as you have that
A, it's a medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: Doesn't matter which cannabinoid you're
playing with.
[SPEAKER_00]: You need to get off that A to be able to
have this full psychoactive power of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do that through
decarboxylation.
[SPEAKER_00]: The heat transform that carboxyl acid into
CO2.
[SPEAKER_00]: The more heat you apply, the faster it
goes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you reach a point where there is
another transformation of the cannabinoid
[SPEAKER_00]: into another level of cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: That transformation is also an oxidation
and a degradation of the resin,
[SPEAKER_00]: but it's a transformation at the same
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you create literally different
cannabinoids, CBN and CBND.
[SPEAKER_00]: More soporific aspect, more powerful
chronic pain medicine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like it has some amazing aspect too.
[SPEAKER_00]: When you smoke, you don't want it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you smoke ash and you press it
with a source of heat, the whole play,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's to be able to get THC and not CBND.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we talk about it when we'll be
pressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But knowing this has changed a lot into my
ability to create more different ash and
[SPEAKER_00]: to understand deeper what I play with.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't have the IQ to understand the
science behind this transformation.
[SPEAKER_00]: But just knowing those steps tell me
everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can do pure CBD ash now because I know
how to manipulate the heat that even if I
[SPEAKER_00]: have some THC with my CBD, I can get rid
of the THC and make it CBN all day long.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the same, depending on the ratio of
cannabinoids that the plant is doing,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, because I can to a certain level
have the ability to transform them,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm making a little bit more than making
ash when I was in producing country.
[SPEAKER_00]: I can produce different produce,
psychoactive and medicinal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: My playground became much bigger now,
not only because of the diversity of
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivars that you have here, but because
of that much deeper knowledge of the
[SPEAKER_00]: product I'm working with.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpenes.
[SPEAKER_00]: Terpenes are really, really, really
important.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you think of it, there is nobody who
would buy any cannabinoid derivative
[SPEAKER_00]: without putting his nose inside the box.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's everywhere and it's been doing that
forever and ever and ever.
[SPEAKER_00]: At the same time, terpenes, the oldest
medicine on earth is aromatherapy and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene medicine basically.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it was interesting that it never had
any foothold in the cannabis industry
[SPEAKER_00]: until the federal realized that if you
actually study the terpene profile of the
[SPEAKER_00]: bust, you can define the origin of that
bust.
[SPEAKER_00]: From that, they made a bunch of studies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Even when the studies are against
cannabis, the dude is a scientist and he
[SPEAKER_00]: states the facts he has found during his
research.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you can pick up a lot of really super
interesting facts.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't matter the direction that study
was taken.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's super interesting, and a bit
disappointing also to tell you the truth,
[SPEAKER_00]: terpene is a terpene is a terpene.
[SPEAKER_00]: Limonene is a limonene, doesn't matter
where it comes from.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought that, yeah, okay, a limonene is
a limonene, but the limonene that creates
[SPEAKER_00]: that specific resin, isn't it a little
more special than another term from any
[SPEAKER_00]: other fruit?
[SPEAKER_00]: If you put it with that specific ratio of
cannabinoid, it's the same.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's cool on the other hand is that the
terpene profile of the plant is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's made of hundreds plus terpene and a
lot of them you can't quantify them.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that that specific entourage
effect, that specific power that the plant
[SPEAKER_00]: is giving you cannot be duplicated.
[SPEAKER_00]: To a certain level, it give us a territory
that the big pharma will never be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: access.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're interested into separating
everything and dosing western medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's gonna change the face of medicine,
but they will never be able to lock down
[SPEAKER_00]: that exact power that that plant is giving
you as a therapeutic medicine,
[SPEAKER_00]: which give us the ability to do stuff with
that plant without having to be bothered
[SPEAKER_00]: by the big pharma because we don't play in
the same playground anymore.
[SPEAKER_00]: The terpene literally modulates the whole
experience that you're gonna have and
[SPEAKER_00]: they're finding out during all those
western medicine research, doesn't matter
[SPEAKER_00]: the ratio of cannabinoid that you ingest,
depending on the terpene that you put with
[SPEAKER_00]: that ratio of cannabinoid, the whole
experience psychoactive and medicinal is
[SPEAKER_00]: gonna be different.
[SPEAKER_00]: Also the terpene has the ability to
maximize the absorption of cannabinoid.
[SPEAKER_00]: It can literally pass through a cell
membrane and lock down in the inside of
[SPEAKER_00]: the cell.
[SPEAKER_00]: With that power, of absorption that the
terpene have, if you have a product that
[SPEAKER_00]: doesn't smell good and taste good,
it cannot be good because, not only
[SPEAKER_00]: because it's not a good experience,
but that all that power of absorption and
[SPEAKER_00]: that whole experience that terpene would
give you with those cannabinoid is not
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: So as a ash maker, when you work with trim
and there is a level, I will show you,
[SPEAKER_00]: during the setup where if it smells bad or
if it doesn't smell, you don't even want
[SPEAKER_00]: to work them because there will be no
power in that medicine, doesn't matter how
[SPEAKER_00]: melty it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now before we take a break,
you always use the word extraction for the
[SPEAKER_00]: ice water methodology.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you have to understand that to make an
extraction, you need to take an element
[SPEAKER_00]: from the inner core of a body.
[SPEAKER_00]: That means that you can extract gold,
you can extract gold, you can extract a
[SPEAKER_00]: teeth, you can extract petrol,
you can extract a lot of stuff with a
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanical force.
[SPEAKER_00]: But what I do, it cannot be an extraction
because the trichomes are protuberance,
[SPEAKER_00]: they're excrescence on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are not part of the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: They are protuberance on the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the word extraction cannot apply to the
methodology I use.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: The methodology I use is sieving.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that second part is gonna be all about
dry sieving.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because it's all come to that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Water is just an element that we use to
make it easier and better.
[SPEAKER_00]: And break time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you for watching.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
See you next time.
[SPEAKER_00]: See you next time.
