[SPEAKER_04]: My name is Andrea Sparjazwa.
[SPEAKER_04]: I am the science editor at Cannabis
Business Times.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm joined today by Beau Whitney,
who is the vice president and senior
[SPEAKER_04]: economist at New Frontier Data.
[SPEAKER_04]: In this session on globalization,
consolidation and segmentation,
[SPEAKER_04]: we're going to be discussing production
shifts as global markets open up how the U
[SPEAKER_04]: .S.
[SPEAKER_04]: will play a role in the expanding markets,
the cost structures that will be needed to
[SPEAKER_04]: compete moving forward in the next five
years, and what sort of policy standards
[SPEAKER_04]: will need to be put in place to help steer
the industry towards sustainability.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'd like to start a little with an
introduction into how you got or became
[SPEAKER_04]: interested in cannabis economics and how
New Frontier Data has enabled you to
[SPEAKER_04]: further your interests and have a voice in
market trajectory.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, thank you.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's just a pleasure to be here.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I really want to thank all those
involved for allowing me to have a little
[SPEAKER_03]: bit of a venue today to talk about the
global cannabis marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: I've been in the cannabis industry for
about five years now.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was teaching in economics class and one
of my students started asking about how to
[SPEAKER_03]: set up companies, how to set up business
structures and the like.
[SPEAKER_03]: He let me know that he was in the cannabis
industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I asked him how large the market was.
[SPEAKER_03]: And he said, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're the economist.
[SPEAKER_03]: You tell me.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I was very intellectually curious.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't in the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was teaching economics, working in high
tech industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I just went for it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And realizing how large the market was in
Oregon, I decided to do this full time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a result, I put together a forecast
for Oregon first and then national.
[SPEAKER_03]: Around that time, New Frontier Data was
getting started.
[SPEAKER_03]: They realized that there wasn't a whole
lot of data in the space.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of policy decisions were being made
in a vacuum or based upon headlines.
[SPEAKER_03]: Somebody getting really high in Colorado
and not being able to leave their hotel
[SPEAKER_03]: room, for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they realized that there was an
absence of data.
[SPEAKER_03]: They went about it on the East Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was doing similar efforts on the West
Coast.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then about three years ago,
we combined our inlet and insights.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's been amazing ever since.
[SPEAKER_03]: One thing that's interesting is that five
years ago, I was this dorky economist in a
[SPEAKER_03]: sweater vest.
[SPEAKER_03]: And over the course of that five years,
now I've been to practically every
[SPEAKER_03]: continent.
[SPEAKER_03]: We talked about policy for hemp and higher
THC cannabis in Zimbabwe last year.
[SPEAKER_03]: Heading to Berlin for the ICBC conference
in April.
[SPEAKER_03]: This is the second time we've been
speaking there.
[SPEAKER_03]: Went down to Panama.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a lot of these conversations were with
ministry level members, presidential
[SPEAKER_03]: advisors and the like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So who would have thought five years ago
that that would be the course of cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: five years later?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been an amazing journey.
[SPEAKER_04]: Where are we now in terms of U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: production environments, in terms of
indoor, outdoor and greenhouse ratios?
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of the cultivation right now is
forced indoors due to the illegality of
[SPEAKER_03]: the higher THC cannabis production.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, a lot of the production on the
West Coast is done outdoors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the outdoor crops are being
exported to other places around the
[SPEAKER_03]: country.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think 81% of all of the cultivation
is sold through illicit channels.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot to that question.
[SPEAKER_03]: But as things get more mainstream,
I envision larger scale commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: farming.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that would be more outdoor in nature
due to the cost structure.
[SPEAKER_03]: Doesn't mean that a lot of those craft
growers are going to be out of a job or
[SPEAKER_03]: out of a business.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just I think that there will be fewer
of the craft growers relative to the
[SPEAKER_03]: larger commercial ones.
[SPEAKER_04]: What other things are influencing
production shifts in the U.S.?
[SPEAKER_04]: And do you think there will be production
divergence between cannabis and hemp
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis markets?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, what's driving a lot of this is
cost.
[SPEAKER_03]: Consumers are very cost conscious.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's high levels of elasticity in the
demand, meaning that consumers are price
[SPEAKER_03]: sensitive.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so in that sense, if you have
inexpensive cannabis, then consumers will
[SPEAKER_03]: gravitate towards it.
[SPEAKER_03]: That's why policy is really important
because if you have high taxation like
[SPEAKER_03]: they do, say here in California,
then it may price the legal growers out of
[SPEAKER_03]: the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: So price is a determinant.
[SPEAKER_03]: But quality is as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're seeing is indoor remains
competitive because of the nature of its
[SPEAKER_03]: quality and its consistency.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're seeing imports and interdictions
from Mexico and the like going way down.
[SPEAKER_03]: Considerably like 80%, 90% fewer
interdictions over the last four or five
[SPEAKER_03]: years.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's because the cannabis coming
from Mexico and south of the border,
[SPEAKER_03]: it can't compete with quality.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a quality aspect and a pricing
aspect, which is driving innovation into
[SPEAKER_03]: the marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: Cannabis was an industry long before
prohibition.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sears catalogs used to sell it.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the ironies of prohibition is that
it gave us a community as well,
[SPEAKER_04]: a movement.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you see large scale indoor
production playing out against the craft
[SPEAKER_04]: market?
[SPEAKER_04]: And will craft cannabis continue to hold
its place within the industry?
[SPEAKER_04]: And how can those craft players strategize
to retain a substantial market share
[SPEAKER_04]: against big businesses?
[SPEAKER_03]: It's been interesting because we study not
only the higher THC cannabis market,
[SPEAKER_03]: but the industrial side of the cannabis
market as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're seeing a little bit of a
divergence just in that aspect.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the hemp side, there is large
commercial operations generating tens of
[SPEAKER_03]: millions of pounds per year in biomass.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the smaller farmers cannot compete
with that in terms of price.
[SPEAKER_03]: So what they are doing, and this is kind
of in its nascent stages, they're teaming
[SPEAKER_03]: up with their fellow farmers in
communities and forming co-ops.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the co-op model is rather prevalent
in the hemp industry, whereas I think on
[SPEAKER_03]: the higher THC side, it's gonna take a
while for that part of the market to
[SPEAKER_03]: develop.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what's interesting is that,
like I said earlier, there's going to be a
[SPEAKER_03]: place for both sides of the business,
the commercial and the craft growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just going to, I think, shift more
heavily towards the commercial side as
[SPEAKER_03]: this market matures and as the regulations
go more national and international.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's move up north a little bit to
Canada.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think Canada will be a major
producer?
[SPEAKER_04]: And is there a future for large scale
greenhouses in Ontario and the like?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, a lot of the licensed producers,
or LPs, invested heavily in the Canadian
[SPEAKER_03]: markets.
[SPEAKER_03]: They got this war chest of money from
inflated stock prices and the like,
[SPEAKER_03]: and they've deployed that money to
establish these large commercial indoor
[SPEAKER_03]: grows.
[SPEAKER_03]: Unfortunately, they got a little bit too
far out over their skis, and there wasn't
[SPEAKER_03]: sufficient demand in the Canadian market,
which is roughly the size of the
[SPEAKER_03]: California market.
[SPEAKER_03]: There wasn't enough demand to satisfy all
that supply.
[SPEAKER_03]: In addition to that, in the Parliament and
in Canada, they've set up some policies
[SPEAKER_03]: which have limited the pace of the
deployment of the retail system.
[SPEAKER_03]: So not only do you have this large amount
of supply, or at least supply capacity,
[SPEAKER_03]: you don't have the ability to get it into
the consumer's hands.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's exacerbated the illicit
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: There was hope, and I think this was
reflected in the stock prices,
[SPEAKER_03]: that the Canadians could translate that
large capacity into the export market.
[SPEAKER_03]: But that hasn't materialized as much as
people had thought, and as a result,
[SPEAKER_03]: they're not hitting their numbers.
[SPEAKER_03]: The large licensed producers are not
hitting their numbers like they thought
[SPEAKER_03]: they would.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's some barriers to entry,
say, in the European Union, which is the
[SPEAKER_03]: market of choice for those producers.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's been barriers to entry that were
unanticipated, and it's influenced the
[SPEAKER_03]: amount that could actually be exported.
[SPEAKER_03]: So are they gonna be large players?
[SPEAKER_03]: I kinda doubt it.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had their run, and it didn't go so
well, but there's gonna be other countries
[SPEAKER_03]: that are going to supplant them
eventually.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's still some time in the Canadian
market, but I think their time is running
[SPEAKER_03]: out.
[SPEAKER_04]: You mentioned stocks, so let's kind of
touch over to that very quickly.
[SPEAKER_04]: We've seen a great deal of variability
with stock performance.
[SPEAKER_04]: How has current market volatility impacted
the development and consolidation of the
[SPEAKER_04]: industry in North America, and what will
it look like over the next five years?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, the access to capital has been a
major thorn in the side of the development
[SPEAKER_03]: of the cannabis industry in the United
States.
[SPEAKER_03]: Not having banking, not being heavily
taxed via 280E, it's really impacted the
[SPEAKER_03]: growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: But what has also impacted is the ability
to get financing to run your business.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so as a result, there's been,
as the market has expanded in the US,
[SPEAKER_03]: in Illinois, Michigan, and elsewhere,
there's been more players requiring more
[SPEAKER_03]: money, but there just hasn't been as much
money available.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now it doesn't mean that there's no money
out there, but it's just tougher to get.
[SPEAKER_03]: So as growers, as operators, people really
need to be cognizant of how competitive
[SPEAKER_03]: the financing market is, and they need to
put their best foot forward in terms of
[SPEAKER_03]: making the pitch to acquire that money.
[SPEAKER_04]: In our phone discussion, we talked a
little bit how the stock market can also
[SPEAKER_04]: drive innovation.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you want to talk a little bit about
that as well?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, as more and more players enter into
this space, and as investors toggle
[SPEAKER_03]: between their risk tolerance, sometimes
it's really riskier, they'll do more on
[SPEAKER_03]: the plant-touching side.
[SPEAKER_03]: In other aspects, if there's a change in
attorney general, for example,
[SPEAKER_03]: there may be shifts in the risk tolerance
of those investors, and so they may invest
[SPEAKER_03]: in the infrastructure or the picks and
shovels.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's because there's been that
toggling between plant-touching and
[SPEAKER_03]: non-plant-touching investment,
it's driven innovation even in that sense.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also as the cost is a major
factor and profitability comes into play,
[SPEAKER_03]: then that's driving innovation as well.
[SPEAKER_03]: Areas to reduce cost, energy consumption,
lighting, air movement, especially on the
[SPEAKER_03]: indoor side, all of this comes into play
and is driving that type of innovation.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's also driving innovation on the
propagation side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Four or five years ago, I never even
thought about stem cell propagation.
[SPEAKER_03]: Very, very low cost, and that's an
innovation that was outside of the
[SPEAKER_03]: industry, but has since been brought in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's talk a little bit about biomass
production.
[SPEAKER_04]: Biomass production for plant extraction
and minor cannabinoid isolates,
[SPEAKER_04]: including CBD, is a rapidly expanding and
competitive commodity market.
[SPEAKER_04]: How will supply and demand influence where
and how this area of the industry develops
[SPEAKER_04]: over the next five years?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, on the industrial side of things,
with the farm bill that was passed in
[SPEAKER_03]: 2018, a lot of people jumped into the
market.
[SPEAKER_03]: The number of acres licensed, for example,
increased over 400%.
[SPEAKER_03]: It went from roughly 100,000 acres
licensed to 500,000 acres, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: And so a lot of people got in thinking
that they were just gonna get rich and
[SPEAKER_03]: everybody was gonna be doing CBD and all
this stuff.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that wasn't the case because there was
a lot of infrastructural and supply chain
[SPEAKER_03]: issues that people didn't anticipate when
they jumped in.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the supply chain has really limited
the growth and development of the
[SPEAKER_03]: industrial hemp market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now that's starting to change,
but it's gonna take a lot of time.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's gonna take years and not months,
for example.
[SPEAKER_03]: And processing seems to be the biggest
bottleneck in the entire supply chain.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of demand out there,
and so there's been talks of oversupply.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just oversupply relative to the
capacity for the processors to process it.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's not necessarily, in my opinion,
it's not necessarily oversupply relative
[SPEAKER_03]: to the demand.
[SPEAKER_03]: You've got large cosmetic manufacturers,
you've got large beverage providers that
[SPEAKER_03]: are just waiting in the wings doing their
product development, but they just don't
[SPEAKER_03]: trust the supply chain yet, and so that's
inhibiting the growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: The demand's there, just not enough supply
making it into the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Where will it be in five years?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think certainly those supply chain
issues in terms of not only processing,
[SPEAKER_03]: but packaging, transportation,
storage, drying, all of that on the
[SPEAKER_03]: biomass side and the industrial side will
have a place in the market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's, I think the opportunity for
industrial hemp is far larger than the
[SPEAKER_03]: higher THC side of cannabis because
there's more product offerings and product
[SPEAKER_03]: capabilities.
[SPEAKER_03]: The fiber side, everybody talks about CBD
because it's sexy, but there's
[SPEAKER_03]: bioplastics, there's food products,
there's industrial applications that
[SPEAKER_03]: people really aren't talking about,
but I think that is the next wave of the
[SPEAKER_03]: industrial side of cannabis.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially how that can kind of,
I think, revitalize rural communities too,
[SPEAKER_04]: the idea that where you could have hemp
farming and industrial production and
[SPEAKER_04]: manufacturing within the same town and
allow those communities to grow again.
[SPEAKER_04]: I'm really excited about that too.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, that's where that whole co-op
concept comes into play because large
[SPEAKER_03]: consumers of isolate or distillate on the
CPG side, they're looking for consistency
[SPEAKER_03]: in their product offerings and their
product inputs, the raw material inputs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so communities have the opportunity to
sync up, plant the same strain,
[SPEAKER_03]: harmonize on their production capacity and
their capabilities, and then cobble
[SPEAKER_03]: together enough supply to satisfy these
large actors in the space.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's go back to the sort of global idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: In equatorial regions, we're talking about
outside of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_04]: and North America, will outdoor and
greenhouse biomass production be a
[SPEAKER_04]: competitive force against indoor giants in
cooler climates, and how will discussions,
[SPEAKER_04]: let's start there, I'll follow up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that debate is still gonna
occur with respect to producing cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: in tropical areas because of the moisture
content and the humidity.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's issues associated with mold
and other things that need to be
[SPEAKER_03]: addressed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's not a whole lot of seeds or
genomes, let's say, that thrive in
[SPEAKER_03]: tropical regions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's large opportunities for
those that can supply into those areas.
[SPEAKER_03]: However, one thing that was, I mentioned
earlier that we were in Zimbabwe and we
[SPEAKER_03]: talked to the government about deploying a
hemp program there and kind of outlined
[SPEAKER_03]: jobs and economic development and the
benefits.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they started a program just recently.
[SPEAKER_03]: What they didn't realize is that because
of their proximity relative to the
[SPEAKER_03]: equator, the plants grew faster and they
matured quicker and they had a faster time
[SPEAKER_03]: to market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there was a competitive advantage
that they didn't even realize that they
[SPEAKER_03]: had as a result of that.
[SPEAKER_03]: They had to adjust their propagation
strategies and their cultivation
[SPEAKER_03]: operations and the like to adjust for
that, but they were pleasantly surprised.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that is one thing that
we'll see as more and more global cannabis
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation occurs.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there are players like in Thailand and
Laos that are looking at establishing a
[SPEAKER_03]: foothold to supply into Asia.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they have low inputs from a cost
perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they may be able to take a lot of
the market share that the colder climate
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivators currently have.
[SPEAKER_04]: And once we start to see a global market,
expanding global market, the idea that we
[SPEAKER_04]: could actually start to cultivate
chemovars in their land race environments
[SPEAKER_04]: and being able to have that specialization
is very exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I mean, in that sense, the
opportunities are really unlimited.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now over 80 countries have some form of
cannabis legalization, either for CBD,
[SPEAKER_03]: for medical, for industrial hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so the US market in that sense is
actually behind and they need to catch up
[SPEAKER_03]: in order to remain competitive in the
global marketplace.
[SPEAKER_04]: How will discussions around climate change
and industry sustainability influence
[SPEAKER_04]: sourcing outcomes?
[SPEAKER_03]: I think on the climate change side of
things, what it's driving is the
[SPEAKER_03]: conversation and education.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's a really good thing to do.
[SPEAKER_03]: The education about what the carbon
footprint is, what the impact of water
[SPEAKER_03]: consumption, use of pesticides in the
environment.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think all of that is good to analyze and
study and educate people.
[SPEAKER_03]: What we're also seeing is that it's
changing the behavior of investors.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those that have a brand that
highlight their lack of environmental
[SPEAKER_03]: impact, let's say, and their
considerations for climate change in life,
[SPEAKER_03]: those are differentiating factors that are
good for a brand that they can promote in
[SPEAKER_03]: the future.
[SPEAKER_03]: We're also seeing on the investment side
that, and this is similar for wine growers
[SPEAKER_03]: as well, they're competing for the same
land and they're chasing land
[SPEAKER_03]: opportunities north.
[SPEAKER_03]: So for example, some of the Napa Valley
growers of grapes are moving into southern
[SPEAKER_03]: Oregon and competing for southern Oregon
land.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so it's increasing the property
valuations as a result.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of movement and a lot of
influence that climate change has had on
[SPEAKER_03]: the industry as a whole.
[SPEAKER_04]: As an industry in its infancy,
the cannabis industry has the opportunity
[SPEAKER_04]: to really take hold of sustainability and
innovation.
[SPEAKER_04]: And present a model, a standard of best
practices for other environments.
[SPEAKER_04]: We have people here today obviously that
aren't just in the cannabis industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: How do you see that playing out over the
next five years, that sort of interaction
[SPEAKER_04]: between the cannabis industry and other
agriculture?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I think that in driving of the
innovation, a lot of this has come from
[SPEAKER_03]: within the industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's been a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that over time, this will
expand because for the longest time,
[SPEAKER_03]: the community was very secretive and
because of the illicit nature of it.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there wasn't as much mind share that
has occurred that it didn't occur
[SPEAKER_03]: previously and it's starting to occur now.
[SPEAKER_03]: So now that people are talking,
they're sharing best practices,
[SPEAKER_03]: and the like, and as a result,
there's a greater push towards
[SPEAKER_03]: sustainability just because it's in the
conversations.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then I'm not sure if cannabis has
gotten the respect that it's due in terms
[SPEAKER_03]: of the maturity of the market,
the generations of effort that people have
[SPEAKER_03]: put into it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's not as much of a push from
the outside on the sustainability side as
[SPEAKER_03]: there is from the inside.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's pushing out, it's unfortunate.
[SPEAKER_04]: You really take charge if we do it right.
[SPEAKER_04]: What are you seeing now in terms of
cannabis and hemp cannabis commodity
[SPEAKER_04]: product price fluctuation?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so on the higher THC side,
as markets mature and you get more
[SPEAKER_03]: cultivation, then prices just naturally go
down.
[SPEAKER_03]: On the industrial side, it was a buyer's
market this last harvest, meaning that the
[SPEAKER_03]: processors had the upper hand because
there was limited capacity and as such,
[SPEAKER_03]: they were able to drive the price down.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I didn't necessarily see a bottom.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought that there might be,
but I saw some quotes out there at 40
[SPEAKER_03]: cents or 60 cents per percent of CBD for
hemp biomass, which was just shocking
[SPEAKER_03]: considering just a year ago, it was
approaching $4.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one thing to consider though is
that although it's a highly competitive
[SPEAKER_03]: market in the US, both for industrial and
for higher THC cannabis, people need to
[SPEAKER_03]: keep a watchful eye on the international
development because those people that are
[SPEAKER_03]: looking at the Thailand market,
they want to drive their production costs
[SPEAKER_03]: down to less than a penny a gram.
[SPEAKER_04]: Especially if we're talking about
competing with, talking about cannabis as
[SPEAKER_04]: medicine, a 10 cent per pill ibuprofen,
how do we get to that point?
[SPEAKER_04]: What kind of price point do we need to get
to with commodities, with hemp commodities
[SPEAKER_04]: to be able to actually compete against
pharmaceuticals and over-the-counter
[SPEAKER_04]: drugs?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so as the prices go down on a global
basis, then that will benefit those folks
[SPEAKER_03]: that need it most, the medicinal patients
that don't have the means in which to
[SPEAKER_03]: acquire their medicine.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I see that as a good thing.
[SPEAKER_03]: It just makes it challenging from a
business perspective in that interim
[SPEAKER_03]: period.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, and one other thing is that not only
is the cannabis cultivation expanding
[SPEAKER_03]: globally and driving the competitive
nature and on the global side,
[SPEAKER_03]: other countries are an existential threat.
[SPEAKER_03]: But keep in mind that the pharmaceutical
companies aren't necessarily standing
[SPEAKER_03]: idle.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're creating products and doing
more research.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so they're just as much as an
existential threat than just the global
[SPEAKER_03]: marketplace.
[SPEAKER_03]: And here's an example.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in 2017, the CBD market was roughly
$700, $800 million.
[SPEAKER_03]: And half of the CBD was supplied by the
marijuana side.
[SPEAKER_03]: Half of it was supplied by the hemp.
[SPEAKER_03]: Fast forward just into 2019, now a full
third of the market is supplied from GW
[SPEAKER_03]: Pharma.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there's that existential threat
that's occurred that people weren't
[SPEAKER_03]: necessarily anticipating even two or three
or four years ago.
[SPEAKER_04]: That being said, I think we've seen a
shift away from people's trust in
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceuticals, especially after the
opioid crisis.
[SPEAKER_04]: How will cultural paradigm shifts like
increased interest in local and organic
[SPEAKER_04]: sourcing and alternative medicine in the
wake of the opioid crisis influence the
[SPEAKER_04]: future of the cannabis market?
[SPEAKER_03]: So I think that will play a large role.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because we've done, at New Frontier Data,
we've done a lot of surveys, not only in
[SPEAKER_03]: the US, but globally.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we're about to come out with some
results on the EU CBD studies and the US
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD surveys.
[SPEAKER_03]: And what we're seeing, not to steal any
headlines here, but what we're seeing is
[SPEAKER_03]: that people, while they don't necessarily
want pharmaceutical drugs and supply,
[SPEAKER_03]: they trust it from a safety perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so until the point comes where the
cannabis market can demonstrate that
[SPEAKER_03]: there's safe, consistent supply,
dosage that's consistent on a delivery
[SPEAKER_03]: mechanism that people trust, then there's
always gonna be that stigma attached from
[SPEAKER_03]: a safety perspective.
[SPEAKER_03]: But once they can overcome that,
then it's very, very viable that they can
[SPEAKER_03]: steal a lot of market share away from the
pharmaceutical demand.
[SPEAKER_04]: Do you think there's any possibility of
any sort of policy shift that would allow
[SPEAKER_04]: pharmaceutical research and craft and
industry growers to all have a little
[SPEAKER_04]: piece of the pie?
[SPEAKER_03]: There's a lot of discussion on these very
topics, reform for veterans,
[SPEAKER_03]: allowing for research, and in fact,
we just helped prep some folks for some
[SPEAKER_03]: congressional testimony for next week in
DC.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they're really pushing for the ability
to do research, the ability to allow
[SPEAKER_03]: veterans access in order to move this
along.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just recently I spoke in Portland,
Oregon at the Oregon Health Sciences
[SPEAKER_03]: University.
[SPEAKER_03]: The topic was the benefits of cannabis on
the human body.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's not a whole lot of research
out there, except for some good work being
[SPEAKER_03]: done in, say, Israel or Canada and like.
[SPEAKER_03]: But a lot of the doctors there that had
done some research showed that there was
[SPEAKER_03]: an impact on the human body, but it just
needed more research in order to fully vet
[SPEAKER_03]: it out.
[SPEAKER_03]: To see what's an appropriate dosage,
what impact does it have on spasticity,
[SPEAKER_03]: on pain management, and you know,
childhood epilepsy and the like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it's just, there's gonna be more
research done and there's a push.
[SPEAKER_03]: A lot of discussions at the federal level.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just, it's unfortunately just taking
some time.
[SPEAKER_04]: In the last few minutes before we move to
questions, I know you have an interest in
[SPEAKER_04]: talking about intentionality.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'd like to give you a little time to
kind of go into that.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, you know, it's a lot of the,
in the research that we've done,
[SPEAKER_03]: there's the concept of intent that's
coming up a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmers in France, for example,
growing industrial cannabis with the
[SPEAKER_03]: intention of supplying a specific market.
[SPEAKER_03]: Farmers in the Midwest, for example,
that are coming together to grow a
[SPEAKER_03]: specific crop for fiber or for a specific
product.
[SPEAKER_03]: That intentionality has been just,
it's been coming up a lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: But in addition, there's been people that
have jumped into this market that want to
[SPEAKER_03]: do good things for good people.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that intention also has been really
resonant with me personally, as well as
[SPEAKER_03]: with others, because it just promotes
goodness.
[SPEAKER_03]: In a world right now where that can be
considered a challenge.
[SPEAKER_04]: Is there anything else that you'd like to
add that we haven't covered today?
[SPEAKER_03]: No, I think that just a couple of closing
thoughts.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's, right now it's roughly a 13
billion dollar legal market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's growing for higher THC just
alone.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's just in the United States.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's really a 70 billion dollar market
if you look at the illicit activity and
[SPEAKER_03]: the illicit distribution channels.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a tremendous opportunity for
those that get in here still, if they have
[SPEAKER_03]: a good value proposition, then they can
get some money.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there's this tremendous opportunity
still.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now based upon some research that we did
last year, the global market's a 350
[SPEAKER_03]: billion dollar market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And 230 million consumers globally just
have hired THC cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a market out there that is
relatively untapped.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for those people that have the vision,
have the ability, have the mindset,
[SPEAKER_03]: the sky's really the limit.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's very, very exciting.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's still in its nascent stages.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that's what really gets me going in
the morning.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't want to close my computer down
at night as a result.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, we'll have to come back in five
years and see how we did.
[SPEAKER_04]: With that, I will move towards questions.
[SPEAKER_03]: So the question was the GW Pharma number.
[SPEAKER_03]: We had forecasted that in 2019 they had
about a third of the U.S.
[SPEAKER_03]: CBD market share.
[SPEAKER_03]: The other equally distributed between
higher THC cannabis and industrial
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: They are the only pharmaceutical CBD.
[SPEAKER_04]: They are the only CBD pharmaceutical on
the market.
[SPEAKER_04]: Everything else is within the industry.
[SPEAKER_04]: So as far as the ability of doctors to
prescribe any sort of cannabis outside of
[SPEAKER_04]: a medical program, that really is the only
option beyond your dronabinols and
[SPEAKER_04]: sesamates and such that were from like the
1980s that were THC like compounds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Forgive me if this came up already,
but have you spoken about the size of the
[SPEAKER_02]: home grow sector and how that would impact
the overall market and the future of home
[SPEAKER_02]: grow in the cannabis industry?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, so the question is about regarding
home grow and the percentage of the
[SPEAKER_03]: market.
[SPEAKER_03]: In our analysis, we've only seen maybe two
or three percent of the total production
[SPEAKER_03]: is based in home growth.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it doesn't really necessarily move the
needle as much as large scale commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: operations, outdoor production and like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Going forward, it's really tough to say.
[SPEAKER_03]: In my opinion, though, when you can buy
tomatoes at the grocery store versus
[SPEAKER_03]: growing them, that's kind of the analogy I
make.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so people want to dabble into the home
cultivation side.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I'm not anticipating that everybody
will stick to it in the long run.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think that's an excellent question.
[SPEAKER_04]: I do think it is very important moving
forward that as new states come online,
[SPEAKER_04]: they allow people to grow at home.
[SPEAKER_04]: I mean, it is it is not going to be
everybody's cup of tea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Not everybody is going to have a garden
full in the backyard.
[SPEAKER_04]: But for the people who need large
quantities, who want to make sure they
[SPEAKER_04]: know how it's sourced to find a chemo bar
that they really like and want to keep it
[SPEAKER_04]: going, who want to have control over their
own medicine, that has to be a priority.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I don't think it's just as my own
personal opinion, and I'm not an
[SPEAKER_04]: economist, but I don't think it's going to
compete with the market as a whole.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, people still want something,
you know, that they can.
[SPEAKER_04]: Their grocery stores still exist,
even though gardens, you know,
[SPEAKER_04]: people are growing gardens.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think it's extremely important that
that is in place in every single state.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hi, thanks for the presentation.
[SPEAKER_00]: My name is Eric O'Mottos.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm with the Greenhouse Lighting
Consortium.
[SPEAKER_00]: My question is regarding market where the
market is going.
[SPEAKER_00]: We get questions sometimes people asking
with the legalization here in the US
[SPEAKER_00]: coming up on these states, eventually
getting national legalization.
[SPEAKER_00]: Where the cultivation going to go?
[SPEAKER_00]: We work with lighting.
[SPEAKER_00]: So my question has this.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to see the lighting market.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the final question is, if it gets
legalized everywhere, do you think the
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation going to go to greenhouses?
[SPEAKER_00]: They going to go outdoors?
[SPEAKER_00]: And would they move to the southern states
where you have a lot of lighting?
[SPEAKER_00]: Or are they going to go up north and going
with the controlled environmental
[SPEAKER_00]: agriculture set up?
[SPEAKER_00]: So those market trends.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is that possible to do in a steamative and
gases?
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, the the longevity of the indoor
market will be determined by the federal
[SPEAKER_03]: regulators because right now each state
has to set up their own closed system in
[SPEAKER_03]: order to legalize and cultivate and
distribute cannabis.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's great for suppliers of the
picks and shovels into the market because
[SPEAKER_03]: you have to set up a new market in every
state that legalizes.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now there are some there's a push to allow
for exports out of states that have a
[SPEAKER_03]: competitive advantage such as California,
Oregon, Washington, Colorado.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so if that push to allow for exports
occurs and comes to fruition, then that
[SPEAKER_03]: could be a threat to the size of the
opportunity for greenhouse suppliers for
[SPEAKER_03]: indoor lighting and HVAC and the like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So in the short run, over the next few
years, definitely a strong opportunity for
[SPEAKER_03]: suppliers that support the indoor and
greenhouse grow operations.
[SPEAKER_02]: We talked to a lot of craft artists and
cultivators, whether no matter how they're
[SPEAKER_02]: growing in the northern region,
they look to the development of
[SPEAKER_02]: Appalachian as something that will really
help them survive.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think that role will be and
other things like that that might help
[SPEAKER_02]: support craft growers?
[SPEAKER_03]: So one of the negatives about large scale
cultivation is that it limits the amount
[SPEAKER_03]: of different varietals in this space.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's why I appreciated your
answer on home grows is because you'll
[SPEAKER_03]: have that different varietal that works
well with that individual person.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, as I see it in the future,
there'll be AVA or aviary zones where
[SPEAKER_03]: growers will grow in specific regions of
the country with specific soil composition
[SPEAKER_03]: and humidity and climate.
[SPEAKER_03]: And they'll be known for those limited
productions.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so I think that there's great
opportunity for small scale production of
[SPEAKER_03]: that nature.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's similar to wine, right?
[SPEAKER_03]: You grow a particular varietal of grape
and then it's a limited run because you
[SPEAKER_03]: have limited space in which to grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think that is very, very viable in the
future.
[SPEAKER_03]: Now, with respect to the Appalachia
region, I was in recently in Tennessee and
[SPEAKER_03]: Kentucky I mean, Appalachia, Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, right.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sorry.
[SPEAKER_03]: I thought you.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so no, with Appalachia.
[SPEAKER_03]: So no, I think there'll be specific zones
that will be known.
[SPEAKER_03]: There'll be destinations.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll set up Canada tourism.
[SPEAKER_03]: You'll come to that vineyard model.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that's definitely viable.
[SPEAKER_03]: For a lot of the states that can grow.
[SPEAKER_01]: Appreciate you mentioning Canada tourism.
[SPEAKER_01]: And maybe you could just talk a little bit
more about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a cannabis policy professional,
I recognize that we have a huge lack of
[SPEAKER_01]: license types that encourage the tourism
side of the business.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it ends up being just yet another
piece of the underground market for
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis.
[SPEAKER_01]: But maybe anything that you've seen or
what you might expect to happen around
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis tourism.
[SPEAKER_03]: So on the Canada tourism side,
what we saw in our numbers in the forecast
[SPEAKER_03]: is that there is this Canada tourism
effect.
[SPEAKER_03]: We saw it heavily in Nevada because people
come into Nevada.
[SPEAKER_03]: They go to Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: They have their fun over a weekend.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we predicted what the surge in demand
would be relative to the Canada tourism in
[SPEAKER_03]: Nevada.
[SPEAKER_03]: But we underestimated it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because what people do is they buy way
more than they could possibly consume over
[SPEAKER_03]: that weekend in Las Vegas.
[SPEAKER_03]: But there is an effect of Canada tourism
from into Oregon and into California and
[SPEAKER_03]: the like.
[SPEAKER_03]: Even in the northeast with Massachusetts
and going up into the New England area.
[SPEAKER_03]: And there's a viable market there.
[SPEAKER_03]: The viability, though, will be determined
by the regulators in those states.
[SPEAKER_03]: Because they can have a major influence on
setting up policies that are favorable for
[SPEAKER_03]: Canada tourism or not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then also social consumption is
another issue that is on the forefront
[SPEAKER_03]: right now.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so there are these pushes in Colorado
and Oregon and elsewhere to allow for
[SPEAKER_03]: social consumption.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's kind of lower on the priority
list than some of the other things like
[SPEAKER_03]: export, like supply and demand and
balancing licenses and the like.
[SPEAKER_03]: So it hasn't quite percolated up yet to be
one of those issues that will coalesce
[SPEAKER_03]: with the policymakers and will succeed
through the legislative process.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it's a huge industry.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's just relatively untapped right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I think that's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: We did a great job.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you very much.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thanks, everyone.
[SPEAKER_03]: Thank you.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Bye.
Thank you.
Bye.
