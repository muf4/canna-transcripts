[SPEAKER_02]: to Jackson urine chart for the 250 people
still watching at midnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: But that's actually, I want to just,
can people like type in where they're
[SPEAKER_02]: watching from?
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause we're on the West coast time zone
and it's already midnight.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'm like, are you people in Boston?
[SPEAKER_02]: Are you in South Africa?
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to talk about that?
[SPEAKER_00]: Uh, I can.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, um, I just gave us our learning
moment for the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: One little, one little teachable thing
here.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, over the years, you know,
we, we started, I think I kind of break it
[SPEAKER_00]: down on this, but you know, usually like
when, when we started growing,
[SPEAKER_00]: everything was kind of in small pots and
you kind of taught like keep them wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can't overwater.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's why you use good dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have bad dirt, it's too dense.
[SPEAKER_00]: Maybe you got to watch out, but you just,
use good dirt to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: It drains well and keep a soaking wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, I remember guys over the years
who would just take a dripper and stick it
[SPEAKER_00]: in there and it would come from gravity
feed from their spring and they would
[SPEAKER_00]: literally just have water going all the
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just put a pile of some food on top and
let it drip through.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and everything was always fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then we started to grow, um,
you're allowed to grow six plants and then
[SPEAKER_00]: you're allowed to grow 25 plants and
people try to stick to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you figure, oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: I put them in a, now I tried putting them
in a, I put them in a, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: a 65 gallon pot and then they outgrew
that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you try a hundred and try 200,
go 300.
[SPEAKER_00]: Some people use 600 gallon pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now, you know, they make fabric pots,
um, grassroots fabric pots that are killer
[SPEAKER_00]: killer, uh, fabric, uh, pot company.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, I'm not sponsored by them,
but they're, you know, I recommend their,
[SPEAKER_00]: their pots are cool, but you get these
huge pots, um, or you grow in the ground
[SPEAKER_00]: or whatever it is.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you get this huge volume of dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, once they get really,
once, once you get really, uh,
[SPEAKER_00]: deep soil and it's far from the outside,
you know, like, uh, when we used to do a
[SPEAKER_00]: little bit of mushroom growing,
they would tell us, you know, don't make
[SPEAKER_00]: your container bigger than about 12 inches
across and 12 inches deep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because when you get further than that to
the inside, you tend to your meat,
[SPEAKER_00]: your, your, your substrate tends to get,
um, anaerobic, you know, and you lose the
[SPEAKER_00]: oxygen in there and you start to get
different, um, decay and stuff,
[SPEAKER_00]: which, you know, is, is, is similar if you
have soil that's really wet.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so we started to notice there was
this thing that would happen where we look
[SPEAKER_00]: at the plants and we'd be like,
damn, it seems like the beds, the plants
[SPEAKER_00]: are so big and it's so hot out,
like the plants aren't getting water at
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom anymore, or the foods not reach
in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause we're getting the deficiencies at
the top of the plant and the top there's
[SPEAKER_00]: food and there's a lot and it's wet,
but what's it like down below?
[SPEAKER_00]: And you know, sometimes you, somebody
would like, like pop off a board off their
[SPEAKER_00]: beds or dig down in their pot to see what
was going on and all this different stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, um, um, I had a thing maybe four
or five years ago or something when,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, when pretty much no one had heard
about root aphids and then I had root
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids in my pots and, um, it was,
and then I noticed, you know, my,
[SPEAKER_00]: my, my pots, I had 65 gallon pots and I
had 300 gallon pots and the 300 gallon
[SPEAKER_00]: pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'll have root aphids all over the place
and the plant started to look a little
[SPEAKER_00]: weird in the top of the plant kind of
starts to yellow.
[SPEAKER_00]: The leaves curl down a little bit.
[SPEAKER_00]: When they flower, that flower develops a
little slower.
[SPEAKER_00]: It usually winds up really killer because
it's technically it's underfed.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not getting the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times that's good,
uh, tasty weed, like in Jamaica,
[SPEAKER_00]: what they call ITAL when you plant it and
you don't feed it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, we were kind of like,
well, what, so what's the deal here?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it underwatered, overwatered,
underfed, overfed?
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it accumulating salt at the bottom?
[SPEAKER_00]: What the hell's going on?
[SPEAKER_00]: You know?
[SPEAKER_00]: And I, and I would see it at different
people's places and a lot of the time it
[SPEAKER_00]: would be like one plant seed guy.
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know, you know, whatever,
and we'll figure it out and everything
[SPEAKER_00]: else is killing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you don't want to change your program
that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, and the plants are still huge.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just this little tip.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're like, this should be the biggest
buds, but they're not, they're a little
[SPEAKER_00]: bit more lean and they're not really what
they should be.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, um, at a certain point, um,
I, I, because I have the 65s going and I,
[SPEAKER_00]: and the 300s going, uh, I, I actually,
um, I actually hit up bamboo because,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, bamboo, you know, is, uh, he's a smart
dude.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's experienced with a lot of stuff and
he's, he's, uh, well educated.
[SPEAKER_00]: He has, uh, you know, a better education
than me and, uh, and a lot of experience
[SPEAKER_00]: to go along with it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, he goes to Davis and does
classes on breeding and talks to a lot of,
[SPEAKER_00]: a lot of people and, uh, and, uh,
you know, sells beneficials and all this
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I, I hit him up and I go, you know,
what's the deal with these things that he
[SPEAKER_00]: does?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you want to do nematodes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then he goes, you know, it's usually a
sign if they're out of control that you're
[SPEAKER_00]: overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, before this, I had already kind
of known a little bit about the
[SPEAKER_00]: overwatering causing the yellowing,
but you get the rude aphids and it's
[SPEAKER_00]: exasperated.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just much, much higher levels of the
same symptoms when you get rude aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I thought, oh, it's the rude
aphids causing these symptoms.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I noticed that my 65s that dried out on
a regular basis, I couldn't find any rude
[SPEAKER_00]: aphids in them, but the rude aphids came
in bags of this particular soil that I
[SPEAKER_00]: bought and it, and I had used that soil
for, for five and a half inch pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so all my starts had come from the
same infected soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was having a hard time going,
okay, the 65s they don't exist in and the
[SPEAKER_00]: 300s they're just rampant.
[SPEAKER_00]: So what's the difference here?
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily I had that little bit of
control to look at.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, I realized that, you know,
there's, because bamboo was the one who
[SPEAKER_00]: mentioned, he goes, you know, it's usually
overwatering if they're really out of
[SPEAKER_00]: control.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, so I try all this stuff,
but then I just realized that then I see
[SPEAKER_00]: that it's definitely the watering thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I back up on the water.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, the rude aphids basically disappear
and these symptoms disappear.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, um, and so, uh, I'm throwing this in
there because this is a little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: bonus information because people don't
really know this about rude aphids.
[SPEAKER_00]: Rude aphids don't really hang around in
soil that drains well.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like that's how it works in vineyards and
things where they can be a huge problem.
[SPEAKER_00]: If the soil is different, then they just
kind of peter out and they don't,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, keep a population and they,
and they eventually, um, eradicate
[SPEAKER_00]: themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: So anyway, um, the post was basically just
saying, Hey, you can buy this $40 water
[SPEAKER_00]: meter.
[SPEAKER_00]: You stick it down to the bottom of your
pot and you can tell if that's the reason.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you could be getting the same
symptom from it being too dry as well at
[SPEAKER_00]: the bottom of your pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: And people who really have their shit
together a lot of times will elevate their
[SPEAKER_00]: pots and put them up on like some big
rock, like some gravel so they can drain
[SPEAKER_00]: extra well.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that will help with that size pot so
that instead of it being, um, up against
[SPEAKER_00]: something that's wet all the time,
there's air underneath them.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, the kind of the thing about
fabric pots is they cause air pruning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So your roots hit the side and then they
branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: Extra.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have a regular pot made out of
plastic and you go to like, like in a
[SPEAKER_00]: seven gallon or something, you go to pick
it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: You'll notice there's not a lot of roots
around the stock.
[SPEAKER_00]: The roots have circled around the outside,
but in a fabric pot or an air pot or a
[SPEAKER_00]: root builder pot, what happens is they
reach the outside and then they branch.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, um, by actually putting them up on
some rock, then you gain that same benefit
[SPEAKER_00]: at the very bottom a little bit more
because they, they root prune.
[SPEAKER_00]: What happens is they hit the air and it
sends them a signal that don't go any
[SPEAKER_00]: further, you know, branch out and they
bush off the same way as if you're at a
[SPEAKER_00]: top of plant for people who are familiar
with what happens when you, when you top
[SPEAKER_00]: your plants, you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so anyway, the, the post was just
telling people like, Hey, if it looks like
[SPEAKER_00]: this, get a water meter, a moisture meter,
cause it's likely you're overwatering.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then sometimes you discover like
you'll have, you'll have plants and,
[SPEAKER_00]: and you'll notice like one leaf will droop
and then another leaf will droop and
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll be like, the whole plant looks
beautiful, but there's like five leaves
[SPEAKER_00]: and they're better droopy and it'll come
and go and you can't figure out what's
[SPEAKER_00]: going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: And a lot of times what'll happen is you
have in the roots, you have, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have dry spots that are in there and
you can't tell you take the moisture meter
[SPEAKER_00]: and you probe it around and you go,
okay, I'm giving it enough water,
[SPEAKER_00]: but right over here in this little area,
it's not getting enough water.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you need to kind of make a little,
make a little, uh, a little recessed area
[SPEAKER_00]: and let the water go there extra to even
it out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then you'll notice it goes away.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, uh, um, so anyway, just watering,
it's funny cause you can be super
[SPEAKER_00]: experienced working in one way,
but then you go to try to grow these
[SPEAKER_00]: monster plants or you hook up drip and
you're used to hand watering or you change
[SPEAKER_00]: emitters or you don't realize it,
but where your emitter goes in the line,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, there's a leak.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're getting triple the water and you
don't know it because you haven't been
[SPEAKER_00]: inspecting it all the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause you just figure your stuff works.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, so it was just a heads up to people
that watering winds up being, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: really, although it seems like the
simplest part of growing something,
[SPEAKER_00]: give it water.
[SPEAKER_00]: The water levels are huge and,
um, people who monitor it, um,
[SPEAKER_00]: really scientifically, you know,
they, they let that, they let it swing.
[SPEAKER_00]: They go, okay, we take the moisture up to
80, we got to drop to 20, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: in beds, you do it different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in bloom, you do it different.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I'm not somebody who does everything
monitored really carefully like that,
[SPEAKER_00]: but I do like to monitor well enough that
I'm not having, I'm not taking a big hit.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I don't grow under good beat us
with least space.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it doesn't really matter to me if my
plant gets this slightly different yield,
[SPEAKER_00]: but what I can't have is just,
um, is a, uh, um, you know, a failure
[SPEAKER_00]: where the plant is just all messed up,
you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: So, uh, that's what the post was.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a good summary.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this is, uh, you had posted something
about tobacco, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so actually I think Steve raiser
dropped off, but these are from seeds he
[SPEAKER_02]: gave me.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I have like this little one.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like
[SPEAKER_02]: this one.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I love, I love, so what I love about
these things is that night they get
[SPEAKER_02]: totally erect and they just like all the
leaves shoot straight up.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then in the daytime, they all just
droop and get super lazy, like lounging,
[SPEAKER_02]: which is kind of interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, yeah, I've noticed, uh, what's trippy
is that, uh, I have mine in an area where
[SPEAKER_00]: they're shaded for part of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it's like, they, um, adjust
their, their, um, their, uh, level of,
[SPEAKER_00]: uh, of water, uh, uptake and
transpiration.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like, you put them in the,
I have them in the shade and then they're
[SPEAKER_00]: like really happy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then the sun hits them and then they
start to wilt.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then if I put them out where they get
the sun really early in the morning,
[SPEAKER_00]: um, then it's like they can stay more
level and they know it's, it's like
[SPEAKER_00]: they're ready for it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so then they just look normal,
um, all of the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was something that I didn't,
I didn't really realize.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it happened kind of with all the
different plants that I had that were in
[SPEAKER_00]: the shade and then the sun hit them when
it was already intense, which was kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like pulling up almost like pulling a plan
out of a greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: Um, when it's hot out, they want to freak
out a little bit and stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, Can I add to, uh, the, uh,
the overwatering thing.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, really good point to make,
you know, overwatering is probably the
[SPEAKER_01]: most common mistake made by growers,
you know, from expert to beginner.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, it's just really easy to do.
[SPEAKER_01]: And for outdoor growers, you know,
when I'm, when I have like new people on a
[SPEAKER_01]: farm that I'm running and I'm,
you know, trying to take people with very
[SPEAKER_01]: little experience and try to cram all my
experience into them, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: it's, it's really, you just take
everything, you simplify it, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: in the spring time, it's colder out.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plants have smaller root systems.
[SPEAKER_01]: They need a lot less water, you know,
um, as they grow, you know, they need
[SPEAKER_01]: more.
[SPEAKER_01]: But the biggest indicator that I always
tell people, cause you know what Jackson's
[SPEAKER_01]: talking about where you see that,
you know, I've seen gardens where people
[SPEAKER_01]: have 10 pound plants and it's just one
half of the plant or one little branch.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if they don't catch it early and start
treating it with the right type of,
[SPEAKER_01]: you know, like a nematode or other like
inoculants, um, you know, you can lose
[SPEAKER_01]: those plants, you know, and you see it
pretty commonly.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the indicator that I always tell people
when I'm teaching them is under watering
[SPEAKER_01]: and overwatering both have the same signs
and the leaves is your leaves are droops,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And so the only difference that's really
common sense and really basic is if your
[SPEAKER_01]: leaves are overwatered and you feel right
there in the leaf stem, you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: feel that it's rigid and that it's filled
with water inside.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's nice and stiff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if your plants are under watered,
your leaves are still drooping and this is
[SPEAKER_01]: going to be all fucking weak because
there's no fucking water in there and you
[SPEAKER_01]: can feel it pretty easily.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that's kind of like a beginner's tip
to, to seeing if you've overwatered or
[SPEAKER_01]: underwatered, they have the same look,
but it's just as simple as seeing if
[SPEAKER_01]: there's moisture inside the stem.
[SPEAKER_01]: And another thing that I think helps guide
people and learning how not to overwater
[SPEAKER_01]: is if you under water, and you're vigilant
and you pay good attention to detail in
[SPEAKER_01]: your plants, you can just add more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's fine.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you overwater, you have to fucking let
it dry out before you can do anything
[SPEAKER_01]: about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's better to underwater than
overwater.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you had to make one of those mistakes
and a good grower is going to be vigilant,
[SPEAKER_01]: pay a lot of attention to detail,
catch it before it becomes a problem.
[SPEAKER_01]: Simply add more water.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you continue to overwater, it will lead
to, you know, potential pest problems like
[SPEAKER_01]: the root aphids, but everything else from
viruses and really anything that can harm
[SPEAKER_01]: a plant from pH fluctuations and lack of
nutrient uptake.
[SPEAKER_01]: So yeah, overwatering big common mistake.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's just as simple as just knowing
what to look for.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
