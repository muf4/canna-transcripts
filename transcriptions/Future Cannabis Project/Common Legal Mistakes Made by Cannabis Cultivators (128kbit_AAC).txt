[SPEAKER_00]: Some of the common things that we're
seeing from established growers who are
[SPEAKER_00]: sophisticated operators who let's say have
a number of grows across the state of
[SPEAKER_00]: California and have been preparing for
this transition and who are well prepared
[SPEAKER_00]: to comply with all the state regulations
with regard to cultivation and already
[SPEAKER_00]: have really you know a very well known
brand and distribution system and all of
[SPEAKER_00]: that so get what the state is attempting
to do and is in the process of doing is
[SPEAKER_00]: one of the biggest challenges is the I
need a home for my business or I need to
[SPEAKER_00]: be able to have the city or county in
which I'm operating issue business permits
[SPEAKER_00]: so that's kind of number one is you know
where do I land or I am landed and can I
[SPEAKER_00]: move forward in that area do they have a
permitting process in place or do I
[SPEAKER_01]: literally need to pick up and move to a
more that's right that's right that's
[SPEAKER_00]: right and then what we're finding now if
you look at city okay so so how to address
[SPEAKER_00]: that maybe let me speak to that first how
to address if your municipality does not
[SPEAKER_00]: specifically authorize cultivation or any
type of cannabis business now this is when
[SPEAKER_00]: even though I am a lawyer and I'm a
business and corporate attorney to the
[SPEAKER_00]: cannabis industry and we do especially
over the last several years you know
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of political work and
political strategy that goes into working
[SPEAKER_00]: on these types of matters these days so
and it all the analysis is always client
[SPEAKER_00]: and site and moment in time specific so it
isn't because the child the challenge is
[SPEAKER_00]: the political mechanism is not in place
yet that that's that's the challenge I
[SPEAKER_00]: want to be able to have a cultivation
permit from my county but that political
[SPEAKER_00]: mechanism isn't in place how do we get
there then it's understanding what is the
[SPEAKER_00]: political process in my particular area
who are the players involved right it's
[SPEAKER_00]: this it's a really a political strategy
and that type of very detailed analysis
[SPEAKER_00]: what will it take to get me there is it
meetings with particular people within the
[SPEAKER_00]: economic development department is it a
very coordinated effort and organizing
[SPEAKER_00]: amongst other growers like we did in Santa
Barbara County saying here's it you know
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got a bunch of farmers here a bunch
of flower farms that are all I mean many
[SPEAKER_00]: of whom are having some challenges because
carpentry yes that's right and so you know
[SPEAKER_00]: people are foreclosing on their farms or
what do I do you know like not being able
[SPEAKER_00]: to kind of support themselves anymore well
geez here's this cannabis industry or many
[SPEAKER_00]: many cannabis farmers that had already
located there over a long period of time
[SPEAKER_00]: so kind of recognizing that there's a
collective need getting organized
[SPEAKER_00]: understanding that a political process and
interfacing with local elected officials
[SPEAKER_00]: and various agencies requires coordination
sophistication thinking about what is good
[SPEAKER_00]: public policy in this area how do we how
do we explain that we are indeed
[SPEAKER_00]: responsible community members what sort of
messaging is going to be around this and
[SPEAKER_00]: listen listen to what the needs are of the
community don't be shy about that
[SPEAKER_00]: political discourse involves many
different perspectives one has to be calm
[SPEAKER_00]: and understand that the way that things
are best done usually involves that we sit
[SPEAKER_00]: around a table and we listen to each other
and we come up with strategy and we come
[SPEAKER_00]: up with you know some solution that maybe
doesn't meet everyone's needs as much as
[SPEAKER_00]: they think that they have needs but you
know is this building collaborative effort
[SPEAKER_00]: and we're seeing that done in santa
barbara county it's really such a lovely
[SPEAKER_01]: thing so you know however it takes to so
you're positive about what you are
[SPEAKER_01]: currently seeing where santa barbara
county is going as it relates to canada's
[SPEAKER_00]: cultivation absolutely at all of that said
nothing as we i think become older in life
[SPEAKER_00]: we recognize nothing is fully black and
white right and there are so it's
[SPEAKER_00]: contoured there are challenges there right
there and there will be challenges in this
[SPEAKER_00]: process and the role of the industry or
the role of the growers is to identify
[SPEAKER_00]: that this proposal by the county is not
workable and why that is and give support
[SPEAKER_00]: for that in terms of at the hearings
through talking with media through talking
[SPEAKER_00]: with each other through talking with their
neighbors who are not in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: industry so continuing a process of
education around why a part of you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: proposal by the county wouldn't be
workable right this is a conversation so
[SPEAKER_00]: is it positive at least the county is
having the conversation my god they have
[SPEAKER_00]: they actually have town hall meetings and
we'll take meetings with folks in the
[SPEAKER_00]: industry so that very open door process is
a really remarkable one when you have that
[SPEAKER_00]: and you know we have so so so many cities
and counties that don't even want to have
[SPEAKER_00]: the conversation don't want to talk to
people who are in the industry or really
[SPEAKER_00]: make that political process an incredibly
non-transparent one so that instead what
[SPEAKER_00]: you see is and now we'll skip to here's a
challenge that folks are having instead
[SPEAKER_00]: what you see is a municipality says all
right we want to get in the industry or
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got some folks who are pushing us to
allow the industry to cite their
[SPEAKER_00]: businesses in our municipality we like the
idea because of revenue jobs and whatever
[SPEAKER_00]: really positive public or we believe in it
as a matter you know whatever reasoning
[SPEAKER_00]: behind it and so because but for whatever
reasons not creating a transparent or very
[SPEAKER_00]: public rulemaking process or a very
shortened time frame for that or very
[SPEAKER_00]: little feedback from the community you
have a finalized set of local rules the
[SPEAKER_00]: local ordinance zoning ordinance and maybe
a regulatory ordinance in addition that
[SPEAKER_00]: deals with kind of operations and
applications and all of that that gets
[SPEAKER_00]: finalized three four weeks later the
application comes out and two to four
[SPEAKER_00]: weeks later a very voluminous expensive
application that maybe is seventy thousand
[SPEAKER_00]: dollars like what is being proposed in the
city of LA to the fees just to apply for
[SPEAKER_00]: one permit comes out no cultivation too
for anything in the in the city of LA so
[SPEAKER_00]: you know they come out and suddenly you
know you're kind of one is kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: scrambling to get organized and on board
for you know for an application and to
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of try to secure that permitting in
that particular municipality and so that's
[SPEAKER_00]: an example you know that that's an example
of a challenge that that many many folks
[SPEAKER_00]: are facing which is okay now we have a
process in play which is also not
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily a well-oiled machine in these
municipalities because they've never
[SPEAKER_00]: permitted these businesses and so trying
to scramble and put together their best
[SPEAKER_00]: effort to apply through what is a very
expensive incredibly voluminous incredibly
[SPEAKER_00]: complicated local permitting process we've
run some of these numbers for folks just
[SPEAKER_00]: in terms of what is it going to take to
get through local permitting process state
[SPEAKER_00]: licensing let's say you rent your property
and build a and blah blah blah you know
[SPEAKER_00]: kind of depending on the license type but
we're seeing you know from 750,000 to 5.6
[SPEAKER_00]: million I mean now we're talking about
like volatile manufacturing but you know a
[SPEAKER_00]: lot of my role these days is having real
honest conversations with folks about what
[SPEAKER_00]: all of this actually involves financially
and otherwise because I want and I want I
[SPEAKER_00]: want us all to make good decisions for our
lives and really the only way we can do
[SPEAKER_00]: that is if we have accurate information
and there's a lot of information that's
[SPEAKER_00]: not knowable and there's a lot of
inaccurate information out there so you
[SPEAKER_00]: know really just again as as as I spoke
about at the beginning of this
[SPEAKER_00]: conversation taking the time to really
understand in detail what does this
[SPEAKER_00]: process involve to get to the regulated
market what does that involve for the
[SPEAKER_00]: legacy grower
you you you you you
