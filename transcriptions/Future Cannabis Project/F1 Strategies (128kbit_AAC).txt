[SPEAKER_00]: All right, so today I wanna talk about F1
strategies, breeding F1s, why,
[SPEAKER_00]: and then what F1s really are meant for in
agriculture, and that is production.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I think the ideal F1 plan is
expressing a combination of its inbred
[SPEAKER_00]: parental lineage from both sides.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that can vary a lot in terms of,
you know, you can be selecting for
[SPEAKER_00]: specific traits and try to get that trait
locked down so that all the offspring
[SPEAKER_00]: share that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're trying to understand the dominant
and recessive traits, and then that will
[SPEAKER_00]: also impart some strategy into the F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: But essentially, you know, all the
cannabis F1s aren't really real F1s at
[SPEAKER_00]: this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, this one's pretty uniform
in that it's uniformly very productive and
[SPEAKER_00]: very similar in structure.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the main differing component is one
has the white stigmas and one has the pink
[SPEAKER_00]: stigmas.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the coffee berry F1 made with the
F5 generations of both coffee and pinkel
[SPEAKER_00]: berry, with the coffee being the mother.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so what we're seeing is an expression
of really both plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: We have not seen anything else affect the
coffee as much as the pinkel berry.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's also, we don't have anything
else that inbred.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, what that tells me is
that the further you get your lines
[SPEAKER_00]: worked, the more predictable they become
and the more vigorous their offspring when
[SPEAKER_00]: crossed become.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, and then to breeding F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you really like the
combination or if there is a pheno,
[SPEAKER_00]: because there are going to always be a
couple of phenos in the F1 generations
[SPEAKER_00]: with the lines not having been worked very
much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so there is going to be a slight
variation.
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't mean there's tons of different
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: As long as it comes out smelling similar
and growing similarly and finishing at
[SPEAKER_00]: similar times, then it's a very,
you know, effective use for agricultural
[SPEAKER_00]: purposes.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we've got this pink hair,
we've got the white hair, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got a little bit in between all
that, some with a little bit of pink.
[SPEAKER_00]: This would I say is coffee leaning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you're going to breed an
F1, you breed it back to one of its
[SPEAKER_00]: parents or at least parental lineage.
[SPEAKER_00]: In our case, I don't use last year's
plants or last year's generation to
[SPEAKER_00]: evolve.
[SPEAKER_00]: I cross them to this year's generation
parental lineage to make a back cross and
[SPEAKER_00]: solidify whatever parent I choose to put
on it as the main influence on the
[SPEAKER_00]: combination of the two genetics.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that's, you know, that's a strategy
for using F1s for back crosses,
[SPEAKER_00]: but also, you know, creating double poly
hybrids for maximum ability to make
[SPEAKER_00]: selections in the next generation by
putting other F1s on F1s to bring out a
[SPEAKER_00]: whole slew of potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then to try and stabilize the
potential that you've created by then
[SPEAKER_00]: inbreeding with that double poly hybrid
until you're getting what you want
[SPEAKER_00]: expressed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, if you're growing from
seed and we grow all from seed here,
[SPEAKER_00]: we always have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so our breeding programs are designed
to create seed that we can utilize in the
[SPEAKER_00]: market reliably.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so making F1s is really the focus.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, I keep hearing it being
said in the communities, in the cannabis
[SPEAKER_00]: communities that F1s are really unstable.
[SPEAKER_00]: Then they're not really true F1s in terms
of.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when I talk stability, I'm meaning
predictability.
[SPEAKER_00]: And some people use the term stability in
terms of intersecting.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when I say stability, I just mean it's
worthy of breeding with because I know
[SPEAKER_00]: what's going to come down the line through
that genetic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you have any variety, regardless of
what F it says, if it is strong from one
[SPEAKER_00]: side or another and passes on a reliably
predictable genetic, you can utilize that
[SPEAKER_00]: in a really effective way like it's an
inbred line, even though it may not be
[SPEAKER_00]: necessarily.
[SPEAKER_00]: But the only genetic that you're seeing it
pass on are predictable enough to consider
[SPEAKER_00]: it that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It gets more and more complex the further
I dive into this stuff and think about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, from an F1 standpoint,
it's like if you're growing from seed for
[SPEAKER_00]: production for the market, F1s are
definitely your choice.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inbred lines tend to get smaller as you
further inbred them and less productive.
[SPEAKER_00]: But you can always maximize production by
simply plant spacing as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: So inbred lines are really nice for
uniformity as well as F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: But, you know, then when it gets to like,
you might not choose to put your F2s or
[SPEAKER_00]: your double poly hybrids out in a
production field because a double poly
[SPEAKER_00]: hybrid might limit your ability to take
things at the same time and just makes the
[SPEAKER_00]: commercial side of things more
challenging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes more of a, you know,
craft type of thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It becomes more of a scenario where you
have to pick some of the plants,
[SPEAKER_00]: you have to harvest some at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: The double poly hybrids, just that's what
you're seeing.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you've got an F1 that's expressing
seven different potential phenos,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's not an F1.
[SPEAKER_00]: And like I said, there really just aren't
even that many real F1s.
[SPEAKER_00]: Ours are F1ish.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're going F1ish with our fifth
generations.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here you got that one seeded.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can see that one.
[SPEAKER_00]: I pollinated that one and the one right
next to it is not.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see the stigmas die back.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so when I'm seeding this variety,
I'm crossing back to the coffee F6.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this is going to be the coffee berry
back cross that I'm selecting for these
[SPEAKER_00]: really magenta hairs.
[SPEAKER_00]: To bring into a coffee like growing
structure and budding structure and resin
[SPEAKER_00]: making.
[SPEAKER_00]: But let's leave it at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: F1s, it's where it's at when we're talking
production for the market.
[SPEAKER_00]: Inbred lines, it's where it's at if you
really want to be making seeds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, keep furthering your
lines if you're a breeder and hold your
[SPEAKER_00]: breeding lines separate and use those to
make next year's seeds if you're going to
[SPEAKER_00]: then also not just be a breeder but a
production grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And or you just want seeds to go to people
with reliable production potential.
[SPEAKER_00]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: F1s, have a good day.
