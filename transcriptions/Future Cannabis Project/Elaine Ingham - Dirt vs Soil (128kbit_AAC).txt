[SPEAKER_01]: So what is losing?
[SPEAKER_00]: Losing means starving.
[SPEAKER_01]: As a plant, that translates to dying.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we're all in a slow death,
it just leads to death.
[SPEAKER_00]: What kind of joy can there be?
[SPEAKER_01]: So how about we don't lead to that?
[SPEAKER_01]: How do we start?
[SPEAKER_00]: We have to get that biology back in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say there's one more step.
[SPEAKER_01]: We've got to teach people the difference
between dirt which is death.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can play in dirt.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like playing in dirt.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's great to get dirty and grimy and
muddy.
[SPEAKER_00]: But it's not growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's go get dirty, but then come back and
grow stuff.
[SPEAKER_01]: And to do that, what do you have to do?
[SPEAKER_00]: That biology back into that dirt,
which means knowing what the crop is that
[SPEAKER_00]: you want on it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to make it even more simple.
[SPEAKER_01]: What crop?
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, 95% of them all pretty much like the
same thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: More or less right around 0.75 ratio of
bacteria up to 1 to 1, maybe 2 to 1.
[SPEAKER_00]: So almost everything is right in that
range.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's called counting.
[SPEAKER_01]: And most people don't realize that
scientific speak is like 2 to 1.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just like your THCVD ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: 1 to 2 ratios.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, how do we find that out?
[SPEAKER_01]: And there's an expectation that we have to
go buy something to do that.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can actually learn how to do that
yourself.
[SPEAKER_01]: For free.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you have time.
[SPEAKER_00]: If you have the price of a microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: About $300 for that microscope.
[SPEAKER_00]: You learn how to use it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you can do all of your own testing at
that point.
[SPEAKER_01]: But why would I want to do all my own
testings?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why would I want to pay someone a lot of
money to take my soil sample to tell me if
[SPEAKER_01]: it's healthy or not?
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you learn a lot faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: Exactly what you need to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: You can get things done faster.
[SPEAKER_00]: How fast?
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes you 20 minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: What?
[SPEAKER_01]: It takes you 20 minutes to look through a
microscope?
[SPEAKER_01]: Why are you doing it so slowly?
[SPEAKER_01]: Hey, there's some fungi!
[SPEAKER_01]: Right?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you still want to look at a
representative number of... But the
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis community, the normal person
who's not a true soil nerd, they literally
[SPEAKER_01]: just want to know if there's the right
stuff in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: How can we help the plant be more of what
it wants to be?
[SPEAKER_01]: Do we do anything?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or do we just work with the microbes that
do all the work?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's our job to put those microorganisms
back in.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to reverse the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to turn that dirt back into
soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, if we want to do it at human
speed, and we're very impatient,
[SPEAKER_00]: we've got to have everything's got to get
fixed yesterday, and if we want to do it
[SPEAKER_00]: that speed, we're going to have to take it
into... A lot more responsibility for
[SPEAKER_01]: healing it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to be the ones who come back and
the time span that we require.
[SPEAKER_00]: Mother Nature will get it back.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't fuss.
[SPEAKER_00]: But she could take 10,000 years to get it
done.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I don't really have that time.
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I don't either.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to stay alive.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd like my children to stay alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: That would be awesome, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: For the next hundred.
[SPEAKER_00]: I would like to still be around next year.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sometimes I worry.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to put that... Take it to a
heavy place.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to put that biology back into
the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the sooner the better, because then we
can start taking that elevated carbon in
[SPEAKER_00]: the atmosphere and putting it back into
the soil from whence it came.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's just start.
[SPEAKER_01]: What can I do tomorrow to make the changes
that we have to make?
[SPEAKER_00]: Start making some... Compost.
[SPEAKER_00]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Tea?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I'd like to start with the compost.
[SPEAKER_01]: So just allowing organic materials to
break down in a beneficial way.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We want to make certain that it's
selecting for the right microorganisms in
[SPEAKER_00]: there.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to be aerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Those are the good guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to be growing diseases or
problem organisms.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't want to be putting anything
toxic.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's got to stay aerobic.
[SPEAKER_01]: Quick question about that.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because most people have a perspective of
who wins, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: The fight, the battle between good versus
bad bugs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Why does an aerobic environment win out
over the negative microbes for our benefit
[SPEAKER_01]: and our plants' benefit?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, plants are obligate aerobes.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have to maintain aerobic conditions
around that root system, around any part
[SPEAKER_00]: of the plant in order for that plant to be
able to perform its function of
[SPEAKER_00]: reproducing, making fruit.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because what do we actually eat?
[SPEAKER_00]: All of that good reproductive tissue that
the plants are making.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to make certain that it stays
aerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that means having organisms that will
build structure in your soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's a major component of what
microorganisms do, aerobic microorganisms
[SPEAKER_00]: do for you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anaerobic microorganisms don't build
structure because they don't want to build
[SPEAKER_00]: airways and passageways to allow oxygen to
move into their habitat.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they thrive in a bad habitat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, bad from our point of view.
[SPEAKER_01]: Bad from anaerobic or aerobic.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, bad from the point of view of
producing food.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's kind of an important view.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've got to make certain that we
maintain that habitat around the root
[SPEAKER_00]: systems of the plant and the above-ground
part of the plant so that that plant will
[SPEAKER_00]: thrive.
[SPEAKER_00]: We've got to convert the nutrients which
are in our soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's already there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's already there.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't need to buy 55 pounds worth of
gypsum.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or lime or inorganic nitrogen fertilizers
or phosphate fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or sulfur fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if I haven't put the bag of that
product on the soil, how did it get there?
[SPEAKER_00]: How did it get there?
[SPEAKER_01]: Gypsum or all these nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: The 42 necessary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or more than that actually.
[SPEAKER_00]: Now that we really start getting into it.
[SPEAKER_00]: It always gets to be more.
[SPEAKER_00]: I always love it when you go back in time
and you look at back in the 1950s there
[SPEAKER_00]: were only three major nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: That if you put NPK on, you were going to
be just fine.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's all you had to worry about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it got to be a couple more.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then next thing you knew it was eight
essential nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was 12.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was 18.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was 24.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then it was 30 something.
[SPEAKER_00]: And now if you talk to certain plant
people, they're going to be saying it's
[SPEAKER_00]: 42.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I like the number 42 because it's the
answer to the universe.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm a huge fan of the Hitchhiker's Guide
to the Galaxy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Me too.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have kind of a selfish farmer question
to ask while I have this golden moment.
[SPEAKER_03]: What do you think the best kind of clay to
grow cannabis is to feed the microbes,
[SPEAKER_03]: the best microbial food for cannabis?
[SPEAKER_03]: And can you talk about Montmorillonite
clay or the best kind of clay for?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't think there's really a best kind.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to recognize what kind of
clay you've got.
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your sand?
[SPEAKER_00]: What's your clay?
[SPEAKER_01]: Remember, clay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Clay is a mineral differentiation,
just like sand and silk.
[SPEAKER_01]: So clay does not grow anything.
[SPEAKER_03]: But it has the minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how do we access the minerals?
[SPEAKER_03]: But some clay is better than others.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Different things have different minerals.
[SPEAKER_01]: No, not really.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just have to understand why is that
clay red.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's telling you about past history.
[SPEAKER_00]: The reason why clay is red is it went
anaerobic at one time.
[SPEAKER_00]: And under anaerobic conditions,
your iron is going to be converted into a
[SPEAKER_00]: highly reduced form.
[SPEAKER_00]: When oxygen comes back into that system,
then as that highly reduced iron is
[SPEAKER_00]: oxidized, it turns into a completely not a
plant usable form of iron.
[SPEAKER_00]: So of course, then we think that this is
horrible clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is really bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: Get some iron.
[SPEAKER_03]: It can.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm referring to Montmorillonite clay
specifically.
[SPEAKER_03]: If you look at the MSDS breakdown,
it has every trace mineral on it,
[SPEAKER_03]: like gold, cadmium, lead, arsenic,
and everything that I can think of.
[SPEAKER_03]: Plutonium and everything, basically.
[SPEAKER_03]: But I see the difference in my plants when
I use it.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think it's really good stuff because
you can eat it.
[SPEAKER_03]: To its livestock feed.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I don't know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I'm really curious about using the high
mineral clay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And really, when you look at any soil,
which the mineral component in any soil is
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be the sand, the silt,
the clays.
[SPEAKER_01]: It literally is only three.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all size fractions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all we're really talking about
when we're dealing with the difference
[SPEAKER_00]: between clay and silt and sand.
[SPEAKER_01]: What's helping your plants grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: They do it all.
[SPEAKER_01]: They really do, man.
[SPEAKER_01]: How do the microbes break down clay?
[SPEAKER_01]: I love this answer.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have enzymes that they make.
[SPEAKER_00]: And they pull out of the crystalline
structure of that clay, the nutrients.
[SPEAKER_01]: Explain it to my six-year-old in a way
that would make him laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: That would make him laugh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you know, a sense of humor a
little bit.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the bacteria and fungi, at the
direction of the plant, are going to do
[SPEAKER_00]: exactly, yeah, they're told what to do.
[SPEAKER_00]: And golly, they go do it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because the plant is giving them cakes and
cookies in order to do the work that the
[SPEAKER_00]: plant requires.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the plant can't move, people.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's kind of just like your mom,
you know, luring you to clean your
[SPEAKER_00]: bedroom.
[SPEAKER_00]: She offers you cakes and cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then you go ahead and do that work
because it makes mom happy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you know the name of the clone
originator?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm trying not to give the name away.
[SPEAKER_01]: For all these indoor grows, we call them
mothers.
[SPEAKER_01]: So literally the mothers are communicating
into the soil ecosystem what they need.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when they don't need it, they don't
need it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you don't have to add whatever mineral
the store says you have to add.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, because you don't need to.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, mom is already taking care of
herself.
[SPEAKER_01]: If we let her.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to stop interfering and pretending
like we know better.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we go in there and we interfere with
all this stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: And all it does is destroy the biology
that would have done the work for us if we
[SPEAKER_00]: had just let things go the way they're
supposed to.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that amazing?
[SPEAKER_01]: Makes sense to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because we don't understand what
we're doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why did the green revolution happen?
[SPEAKER_00]: It wasn't really because we needed to be
putting those nutrients into the soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's because we had piles and piles of
leftover munitions.
[SPEAKER_01]: I would say the community knows a lot
about the byproducts of war.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we're still picking up the pieces too.
[SPEAKER_01]: But instead of picking up the pieces and
ending up with a bunch of poisons and
[SPEAKER_01]: nitrates, you said ammonium nitrate and
nobody even flinched, but that's the same
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff that'll blow up a building.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, you have to have the proper
combination of nitrate and ammonium.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I can have a truck full of soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not going to blow up.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a weapon of mass germination.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Mass prosperity.
[SPEAKER_01]: I love selfish farmer questions because
farmers share.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you talk about the dance between the
two most common polymers in nature,
[SPEAKER_03]: the cellulose and the chitin?
[SPEAKER_03]: How can we intentionally produce large
amounts of chitinase to use as a pest
[SPEAKER_03]: deterrent and activate the pest deterrent
abilities of plants the best way,
[SPEAKER_03]: you know?
[SPEAKER_00]: Do I need to add all that to my soil?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's growing there all by itself.
[SPEAKER_01]: So why would I add anything to it except
for the required organics and microbes
[SPEAKER_01]: that access everything?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you think about the plant is
going to be putting out cakes and cookies
[SPEAKER_00]: to get those bacteria or fungi to do the
decomposition of the exoskeletons of the
[SPEAKER_00]: dead insects or the structural cellulose
in the plant material.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll explain why most people think they
need to add it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're talking about full or full,
beautiful, organic, true holistic growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of people need to add things because
they're growing in a pot in a basement.
[SPEAKER_01]: At which point, of course, there's nothing
for the one worm or whatever to eat
[SPEAKER_01]: because it's not a complete ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're lacking a whole bunch of
microorganisms to help that earthworm stay
[SPEAKER_00]: alive.
[SPEAKER_01]: And like you explained earlier,
when you send your soil in to be tested,
[SPEAKER_01]: gosh, this is the misnomer, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: And they come back and say, look at all
this horrible stuff.
[SPEAKER_00]: Or they say, you don't have an adequate
amount of the soluble inorganic nutrients.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you're going to have to put more in
there.
[SPEAKER_01]: That translates into plant accessible.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what makes the plants have access to
it?
[SPEAKER_00]: The microorganisms are going to do the
conversion of that material from plant not
[SPEAKER_00]: available into plant available.
[SPEAKER_01]: On whose terms?
[SPEAKER_00]: On the plant's terms.
[SPEAKER_00]: The plant is getting what it wants.
[SPEAKER_01]: Are you ready?
[SPEAKER_01]: Here we go.
[SPEAKER_01]: Your plant tells the soil food web what it
needs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Done.
[SPEAKER_01]: End of statement.
[SPEAKER_00]: All we as human beings have to do is make
certain the full diversity of all the
[SPEAKER_00]: organisms are present in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: The bacteria, the fungi, the protozoa,
the nematodes, the micro arthropods,
[SPEAKER_01]: earthworms, spiders, voles, the insects.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have dead insects,
you don't have chitin.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the insects, everything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now, this is the fear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, then how the hell are my plants
going to grow?
[SPEAKER_01]: If all these other things are in my
garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'd like you to explain, because I'm a
California grower, and I grow plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: With all my background, I didn't know the
simple truth of the reason ground
[SPEAKER_01]: squirrels and gophers will not eat your
plants, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: How many of us wrap our root balls in
wire?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we're trying to protect them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're doing our best to protect them.
[SPEAKER_01]: We don't understand.
[SPEAKER_00]: But all those gophers, the voles,
the shrews, the things that eat your root
[SPEAKER_00]: systems, they're there because Mother
Nature told them to go there and make
[SPEAKER_00]: certain that they build structure in the
soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pathways.
[SPEAKER_00]: For the bacteria and the fungi,
protozoa and nematodes to get into that
[SPEAKER_00]: soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they're breaking up.
[SPEAKER_00]: The gophers are breaking up the compaction
that's not supposed to be there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So we let the gophers eat our plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, until you fix your soil,
until you get rid of that compaction
[SPEAKER_00]: layer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's what these guys are seduously
helping you.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the compaction layer is the kicker.
[SPEAKER_01]: If the ground squirrel's hole,
or the mole hole, or gopher depends,
[SPEAKER_01]: cannot support itself open, it collapses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That tells the animal, which is probably
part of the soil food web, you don't want
[SPEAKER_01]: to live here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You've done your job.
[SPEAKER_00]: Move along.
[SPEAKER_01]: So they will literally turn around and not
go into your garden because it's a truly
[SPEAKER_01]: healthy ecosystem.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not kidding, dude.
[SPEAKER_01]: Did I tell you?
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nature knows what she's doing.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's just us human beings that keep
screwing up because we pay no attention to
[SPEAKER_00]: the information that Mother Nature is
sticking right in front of my face.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't pay attention to it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we think we know better.
[SPEAKER_00]: Poor little Mother Nature, she needs our
help.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so we're going to come along.
[SPEAKER_01]: As we sit in a redwood grove that no one
planted these trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had been growing here just fine all by
themselves.
[SPEAKER_00]: No inorganic fertilizers.
[SPEAKER_00]: No pesticides.
[SPEAKER_00]: Blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's the 55 pound bag of gypsum?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And these guys are putting more carbon
into their bodies every year.
[SPEAKER_00]: Than any crop that you want to be growing
and carrying that off the market.
[SPEAKER_01]: Now you're talking about global warming,
climate change.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are called carbon sinks?
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: These trees put on more carbon every year.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if we want to affect global warming,
have cleaner air, blah, blah, blah.
[SPEAKER_01]: All the things people whine about.
[SPEAKER_01]: We should just let things grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop tearing them down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stop harvesting them and turning them
into...
[SPEAKER_01]: Especially mature ecosystems.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because they may take 10,000 years to
truly develop.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: It takes a while.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a special place.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because if you tear down these trees and
you till the soil and you wipe out all the
[SPEAKER_00]: biology, it's going to be a thousand
years, 10,000 years for you even to get to
[SPEAKER_00]: the point where these trees could possibly
grow again.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they've got to have all of this
development of the soil to even be able to
[SPEAKER_00]: germinate and get established here.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when do you start growing?
[SPEAKER_00]: When do I start growing?
[SPEAKER_01]: My answer is when do I stop?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Why would I ever... My garden is growing.
[SPEAKER_01]: There's currently no cannabis planted in
it, but there's everything else.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm building soil every second that we're
sitting here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I usually... So this is a fun one.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much compost tea?
[SPEAKER_01]: I make a five gallon bucket of fungal rich
and bacterial dense every week,
[SPEAKER_01]: even in the off season.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I brew it outside so that the microbes
that are grown are the microbes that are
[SPEAKER_01]: thriving at that temperature range because
that's what I'm going to put on my plants
[SPEAKER_01]: because they're at that temperature range.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not that hard.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that difficult.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's just outside.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 10 gallons.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's 10 gallons of love a week.
[SPEAKER_00]: You should have a pretty good food web in
that soil.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, it's so beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going bumper crops.
Here's the funny part.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have dicots that haven't even popped
split with nine inch roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_00]: Very good.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because the food web is feeding because it
hasn't really started even
[SPEAKER_01]: photosynthesized yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So who's feeding that plant?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because it's too young to even make cakes
and cookies really.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean, it is a little bit, but you see
the food web is literally saying,
[SPEAKER_01]: oh, we know what to do with you.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come here.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're going to need some this.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: And because that little plants should be
already tuned into the below ground
[SPEAKER_00]: network, those mycorrhizal fungi are
already colonizing those roots.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so we're talking about three to six
months.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when you have a good functioning food
web in that soil, the root systems of that
[SPEAKER_00]: baby plants are going to be colonizing
immediately within hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: So not three to six months, literally
instantaneous, but we just don't see the
[SPEAKER_01]: effects for maybe hours.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_01]: So sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: We are having we're growing a really
healthy plant right from the very
[SPEAKER_00]: beginning.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never realize that it would have
otherwise been stunted.
[SPEAKER_00]: And limited and unhappy and no fertility
and sick and diseased because it's been
[SPEAKER_00]: because it started out right from the very
beginning.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you know how much I spend on my
compost tea, a couple of dollars.
[SPEAKER_01]: I bought it.
[SPEAKER_01]: I got a twelve dollar bubbler and I've
been using that for a long time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it runs two hoses.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's where one for each bucket.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's, you know, the electricity that
you're so a little bit electricity,
[SPEAKER_00]: a little bit for the the start,
the materials that you put into that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I collect offsite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's your time.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's all it is.
[SPEAKER_01]: So how much is my time worth?
[SPEAKER_00]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_00]: Twenty five dollars an hour.
That's reasonable.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here's the question.
[SPEAKER_01]: How much how much how much does someone go
and spend at the store?
[SPEAKER_01]: Or you can just hang out with your plants
for an hour max.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's doing good things for you to hang
out with your plants.
[SPEAKER_00]: Sounds good to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd rather be outside, putting around
in my garden than doing than go into the
[SPEAKER_00]: store and buying toxic chemicals and then
having to figure out how I'm going to
[SPEAKER_00]: spread them.
[SPEAKER_01]: And do you ever walk through a hardware
store anywhere like that and just walking
[SPEAKER_01]: near that aisle makes your skin like you
feel the toxins in the air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like you're like, that's not healthy.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Come here, children.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're like, what are they being exposed
to in my garden?
[SPEAKER_01]: Nothing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Except goodness.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Good, breathable air.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's that come from?
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's start out from that tidbit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Where's good, breathable, healthy air come
from?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, from anything that photosynthesizes,
because they're taking that carbon dioxide
[SPEAKER_00]: and pulling the carbon off and blowing off
that oxygen.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's where good breathable air comes
from.
[SPEAKER_01]: So instead of standing in front of like a
air purifier in my office, I should maybe
[SPEAKER_01]: just have a plant on my desk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, you should have a couple of plants.
Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, if you just have a couple of
plants in your office that you're taking
[SPEAKER_00]: care of and they're healthy and they're
happy, they're going to provide you all
[SPEAKER_00]: the oxygen you need for the whole entire
year.
[SPEAKER_01]: And are you talking about just breathable
air or maybe a little sole air too?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, because those plants are pretty good
comfort.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, they brighten your day.
[SPEAKER_00]: They will eventually flower.
[SPEAKER_00]: And well, that's positivity.
[SPEAKER_01]: The flowers are.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
