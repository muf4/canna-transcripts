[SPEAKER_01]: Metric is seed-to-sale tracking.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the concept of that is what it sounds
like, that every bit of cannabis in the
[SPEAKER_01]: commercial cannabis chain, supply chain,
is going to be tracked from seed to sale
[SPEAKER_01]: once that system is onboarded.
[SPEAKER_01]: That means that when a seed is grown,
a clone is made, those start with,
[SPEAKER_01]: they get a UI ID, which is a unique
identifier, they're tagged.
[SPEAKER_01]: At that level, they get to be tagged in
lots of a hundred plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then there's a hundred tags reserved
for which of those plants make it into the
[SPEAKER_01]: next line of the chain.
[SPEAKER_01]: And from that point, that unique
identifier is going to follow that product
[SPEAKER_01]: through the life of that plant.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's manufactured into a manufactured
product, it's still going to be related to
[SPEAKER_01]: that original UI ID.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it moves to a distributor,
they're going to know which batch,
[SPEAKER_01]: which lot, which unique identifier is
related to those products.
[SPEAKER_01]: And when it goes to retail and is sold to
a consumer, we're going to know exactly
[SPEAKER_01]: that product contains cannabis from this
or these plants.
[SPEAKER_01]: If there's multiple plants that are
aggregated into a product, those UI IDs
[SPEAKER_01]: are going to get combined.
[SPEAKER_01]: And all of that history will be captured
in the Track and Trace system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every bit of waste has to be documented in
the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every change of the disposition of a plant
has to be tracked in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it goes from clone to immature plant
to flowering plant to when it's harvested
[SPEAKER_01]: to if it's disposed to if it's
manufactured, any change of state,
[SPEAKER_01]: those are all checkpoints in Track and
Trace where it has to be logged.
[SPEAKER_01]: So once people are logged, they're
onboarded onto the system, the entire
[SPEAKER_01]: history of every bit of cannabis and every
bit of product it becomes is going to be
[SPEAKER_01]: recorded in that system, which is pretty
amazing when you think about it.
[SPEAKER_01]: But it's also a monumental task to get all
of that information in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's where a lot of my questions of
how this process is really going to work
[SPEAKER_01]: come up because we have this difficulty
now of you have operators operating under
[SPEAKER_01]: a temporary license.
[SPEAKER_01]: With a temporary license, you're not able
to get onto Track and Trace yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: Only with the issuance of annual licenses
would an operator get to take the training
[SPEAKER_01]: for Track and Trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then they have 30 days to onboard all
of their in-progress product into Track
[SPEAKER_01]: and Trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have this 30-day period of time where
you're going to do a massive inventory and
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to represent everything that you
have in Track and Trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: After that 30-day period, everything
starts with seed after that.
[SPEAKER_01]: You do not get to bring in any in-progress
products at that point that aren't
[SPEAKER_01]: represented in the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: The challenge that we're going to have is
you're going to have different operators
[SPEAKER_01]: at different places on the supply chain
getting their annual license at different
[SPEAKER_01]: times.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the huge challenge that the agencies
are facing is how do you onboard everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: at the same time?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because if not, you're going to have a
cultivator who isn't on Track and Trace
[SPEAKER_01]: still using their temporary license and
giving paper manifests and documentation
[SPEAKER_01]: to a manufacturer who is on Track and
Trace who's going to have to input all
[SPEAKER_01]: that stuff into their system creating it
within the Track and Trace system who may
[SPEAKER_01]: be selling to a distributor who may be or
may not be on Track and Trace so then they
[SPEAKER_01]: couldn't complete the electronic transfer
of that system and then that distributor
[SPEAKER_01]: could sell those products to multiple
retailers who may or may not be on Track
[SPEAKER_01]: and Trace yet.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that I think is going to be one of the
huge challenges of onboarding is how are
[SPEAKER_01]: they going to complete the life cycle of
these products in Track and Trace when
[SPEAKER_01]: there's inconsistent adoption of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I don't know how that's going to be
rectified.
[SPEAKER_01]: Unless they put everybody on even with
temporary licenses to get all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: products in there so that you can have a
consistent supply chain on Track and Trace
[SPEAKER_01]: or they wait on the issuance of annual
licenses until you have a real critical
[SPEAKER_01]: mass of license types that represent
enough of the supply chain to have
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody onboard in that same 30-day
period of time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But I think that's going to be one of the
big challenges that we see is how that
[SPEAKER_01]: onboarding works and what the liabilities
are or whose responsibility it's going to
[SPEAKER_01]: be to input that information when you're
working with some people on the system and
[SPEAKER_01]: some people who aren't on the system.
[SPEAKER_01]: What a lot of people may not be aware of
is that even before Track and Trace
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes active as an operator you are
still required to fulfill all of the
[SPEAKER_01]: record keeping requirements of what will
be on Track and Trace.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those record keeping requirements are
really extensive.
[SPEAKER_01]: Even before Track and Trace the shipping
manifest has already been published by the
[SPEAKER_01]: CDFA and other agencies to say here's the
shipping manifest you should be using when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're transferring product between
licensees.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean those if you think about when you
look at the record keeping requirements
[SPEAKER_01]: for Track and Trace it does say that at a
minimum you have to be keeping these
[SPEAKER_01]: things on paper on invoices that you can
have a spreadsheet but you have to have
[SPEAKER_01]: your records maintained in some way that
you could give them to the agencies upon
[SPEAKER_01]: request either in hard copy or electronic
form is the way they put it in the
[SPEAKER_01]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_01]: So pretty much if you think about every
one of those checkpoints where you're
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to be doing reconciliations of
physical inventory every 14 days you're
[SPEAKER_01]: supposed to have really detailed
information on any sales invoice when
[SPEAKER_01]: you're transferring before between
licensees.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to be keeping contracts
with your distributors on file.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're supposed to have really detailed
inventory records in terms of there's
[SPEAKER_01]: columns of here's the information that
constitutes an inventory.
[SPEAKER_01]: And what I've been working with a lot of
people on is going over those record
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping requirements because much like
with the transitional period and everybody
[SPEAKER_01]: feeling shocked and surprised by the
packaging requirements when that day hits
[SPEAKER_01]: and they issue your annual license and a
clock starts ticking and you have five
[SPEAKER_01]: days to complete the training and then 30
days to onboard all of your products into
[SPEAKER_01]: Track and Trace those record keeping
requirements are in effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: So if you don't have that information to
onboard your products you're gonna be in
[SPEAKER_01]: this huge crush of having to suddenly
create systems and protocols and
[SPEAKER_01]: checkpoints and keeping of records and
where do you weigh it and training your
[SPEAKER_01]: staff in terms of all of these different
moments of transition.
[SPEAKER_01]: And if you as an operator haven't set up
that culture of compliance and system of
[SPEAKER_01]: record keeping yet it's gonna derail a lot
of businesses.
[SPEAKER_01]: And right now there's a little bit of work
in the wiggle room with keeping your paper
[SPEAKER_01]: records with how long you have to
reconcile your inventory.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have a little bit more flex when that
is being logged in a government system
[SPEAKER_01]: that is going to reflect every single time
that your inventory doesn't line up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every single time that the weight isn't
right.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has requirements of reconciliations for
different business types every 24 hours.
[SPEAKER_01]: Every so many days.
[SPEAKER_01]: Notification requirements.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's when it is critical that you have
developed these processes and have already
[SPEAKER_01]: enough of a handle on how to keep these
records and how to make sure that you're
[SPEAKER_01]: ensuring the accuracy of the information
that you're inputting so that your
[SPEAKER_01]: business can continue to run.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because there's different states they
handle it different ways.
[SPEAKER_01]: In some states when your Track and Trace
goes off and if it's not synced up with
[SPEAKER_01]: your physical inventory or your POS system
your system shuts down.
[SPEAKER_01]: And you can't transfer anything until you
reconcile where did this go.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's one of the systems too is you
can't just say I don't know where it went.
[SPEAKER_01]: We lost a pound of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have no idea.
[SPEAKER_01]: You have to be able to explain everything
that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I would think that most operators in
the cannabis space in California are not
[SPEAKER_01]: used to that level of rigor and oversight
on every single activity and every single
[SPEAKER_01]: thing that happens.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it's going to be a learning experience
for the agencies as well.
[SPEAKER_01]: Because I don't know if they know out of a
hundred clones how many really get lost
[SPEAKER_01]: and how much waste is created and how much
weight shifts between states and you lose
[SPEAKER_01]: water weight at this point.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I think that we're going to see a lot
of changes with taxation with what's
[SPEAKER_01]: expected in terms of how products
transform and how the supply chain really
[SPEAKER_01]: works.
[SPEAKER_01]: But that stuff's going to take time and
unfortunately the early licensees and the
[SPEAKER_01]: early adopters are going to be the guinea
pigs in that process of creating the data
[SPEAKER_01]: that they need to see how this system
really works.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it seems like if you were walking into
a brand's office or a dispensary and they
[SPEAKER_00]: haven't started anything would basically
be like you know have a point person who's
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be like your metric guru.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Don't have it be one person because if
they leave your company then you're
[SPEAKER_00]: screwed.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Have multiple people.
[SPEAKER_00]: But like basically it's going to be a full
time or like half day job for some
[SPEAKER_00]: company.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I was to be working with or consulting
with a brand that has none of this ready
[SPEAKER_01]: or thinks they have some of it ready and
maybe it doesn't line up all the way.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean some of the first things to do
there's a part in the regulations that I
[SPEAKER_01]: say should always strike fear into any
licensees heart which is that more or less
[SPEAKER_01]: to paraphrase the actions omissions or
failures of any employee are taken as the
[SPEAKER_01]: actions omissions of failures of the
licensees themselves.
[SPEAKER_01]: So that is the huge justification in case
for employee training and for why it is so
[SPEAKER_01]: important that your entire staff
understands the necessity and consequences
[SPEAKER_01]: of this culture of compliance.
[SPEAKER_01]: I mean compliance is like the big buzzword
right now in terms of cannabis because
[SPEAKER_01]: it's that it's what makes the engine run.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's such a we're entering into I mean
we're not entering we're here into such a
[SPEAKER_01]: regulated environment that this this
aspect of record keeping or inventory
[SPEAKER_01]: management is not one person's job.
[SPEAKER_01]: We're used to say well I have it is my
inventory manager and that's his job and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's and it's really it becomes
everybody's job because so much of the
[SPEAKER_01]: activities that used to be you know
completely acceptable you know at the
[SPEAKER_01]: retail level for example is totally normal
in so many cases for for a bud tender to
[SPEAKER_01]: say oh well we're out of this product so
I'm just going to sell it as this product
[SPEAKER_01]: because here it is in the POS and it is
the same amount and I can't find this
[SPEAKER_01]: where that becomes utterly unacceptable at
this point because if you have you know
[SPEAKER_01]: your your software data that goes out of
sync with your physical inventory that
[SPEAKER_01]: goes out of sync with your track and trace
those are really difficult reconciliations
[SPEAKER_01]: to back track and figure out what happened
and and that's like some of what
[SPEAKER_01]: everybody's awakening to is that now
suddenly a lot of people you go from
[SPEAKER_01]: maintaining one inventory or two that was
your physical inventory and what's in your
[SPEAKER_01]: POS to now you have three different
inventories that you're trying to keep in
[SPEAKER_01]: sync at all times which is the physical
inventory your POS or ERP whatever you're
[SPEAKER_01]: using your in-house system and then the
track and trace system and all of those
[SPEAKER_01]: have to match and all of those have to be
reconciled on a daily basis and you're not
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want them to get too out of sync
and and there's a lot of challenges
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's a lot of POS companies
that are saying like you'll never have to
[SPEAKER_01]: log into track and trace and we'll handle
everything and we'll just do it all and in
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the things you're gonna want to log
into track and trace occasionally because
[SPEAKER_01]: you don't want to discover two weeks later
when you do your 14-day reconciliation
[SPEAKER_01]: that things have gone out of sync and then
you got to be a forensic archaeologist to
[SPEAKER_01]: figure out what happened you know and go
back and reconcile each of those instances
[SPEAKER_01]: of where did this gram go so those aspects
of and and I will say for a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: operators it really helps to bring in a
compliance person or to have somebody come
[SPEAKER_01]: and kind of drive home that this is not
just some crazy stuff that that the bosses
[SPEAKER_01]: are making up to make your job horrible
and to make you do a lot of extra work
[SPEAKER_01]: it's a real necessity and I think some of
the you know the creativity and
[SPEAKER_01]: opportunity of this moment is to figure
out how do you use these requirements of
[SPEAKER_01]: the regulation to actually help to improve
and inform your business and give you
[SPEAKER_01]: better data and give you the ability to
make better business decisions and give
[SPEAKER_01]: you the ability to you know feel more
comfortable and confident with your staff
[SPEAKER_01]: because there's been a lot of operators
who have fear of theft and in diversion
[SPEAKER_01]: and other issues where this just kind of
introduces a lot more kind of checks and
[SPEAKER_01]: balances to help everybody to to do their
job and to help to maintain inventories in
[SPEAKER_01]: a more cohesive way but it is but I think
that there is no underestimating how big
[SPEAKER_01]: this onus of record keeping is when you
look at the regulations across the
[SPEAKER_01]: different agencies and see how many
instances there are of where that record
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping obligation is and how many things
are supposed to be keeping already and
[SPEAKER_01]: that you have to maintain all these
records for seven years you know that this
[SPEAKER_01]: becomes an enormous part of your business
is is how you're going to maintain these
[SPEAKER_01]: records make sure that they're accurate
and like it's the responsibility of the
[SPEAKER_01]: operators to enter accurate information
into track and trace and make sure your
[SPEAKER_01]: employees are entering accurate
information in the track and trace and and
[SPEAKER_01]: just again that that obligation of that
record keeping doesn't start with track
[SPEAKER_01]: and trace it it started back in January
the employee training is going to be a
[SPEAKER_01]: huge part but in order to train those
employees you're going to have to have
[SPEAKER_01]: some really clear SOP's protocol best
practices I call it I'm a big checklist
[SPEAKER_01]: geek so I call it like flight checklists
like for any activity as simple as it
[SPEAKER_01]: seems there should be a checklist to help
your employees to help the managers go did
[SPEAKER_01]: you do X Y & Z you know when you're
conducting a sale did you get this
[SPEAKER_01]: information when you're receiving a
product did you check and log all of these
[SPEAKER_01]: things when we're transferring a product
did we do all of this when you're when if
[SPEAKER_01]: you're a cultivator and the plant is
changing state did you log all of this
[SPEAKER_01]: information did you issue the right
certificates did you you know log the
[SPEAKER_01]: things in the correct place and then
update track and trace accordingly there's
[SPEAKER_01]: so many discrete checkpoints for these
things like I have so many checklists
[SPEAKER_01]: because every activity that you do as an
operator you know it kind of has these
[SPEAKER_01]: emergency flight checklists of if you
don't do these five things you know we're
[SPEAKER_01]: going to have some critical errors down
the road and and some of that stuff I
[SPEAKER_01]: always think with like with checklists
with pilots it's not to be insulting to be
[SPEAKER_01]: like you don't know how to fly a plane so
you have to use this checklist it's
[SPEAKER_01]: because in these in the most mundane
activities is kind of where we go dead
[SPEAKER_01]: sometimes and we think we know these
things and we think we do them by rote or
[SPEAKER_01]: we think I know this person I don't have
to check their ID or whatever it is that
[SPEAKER_01]: there's kind of the more support you can
give people by just having these you know
[SPEAKER_01]: easy peasy little a few-step checklist to
make sure that those critical points are
[SPEAKER_01]: being handled correctly is is really
important and then and then some of it is
[SPEAKER_01]: just knowing the regulations because I
think that some still there's so many of
[SPEAKER_01]: them they change you know we just got a
new set of emergency rags we're gonna get
[SPEAKER_01]: the language of the full regulations and
to really understand and go through them
[SPEAKER_01]: to see what those record-keeping
requirements are and I also think it's
[SPEAKER_01]: critical for operators to know that not
all of the regulations that impact their
[SPEAKER_01]: business are in the cannabis regulations
the cannabis regulations reference many
[SPEAKER_01]: other regulations and you have to know
what's in those and what record-keeping
[SPEAKER_01]: requirements or other requirements may be
contained in these other you know codes
[SPEAKER_01]: and public resource things that affect
your business and then just the normal
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff I mean the normal stuff of any
business because I think that's where you
[SPEAKER_01]: know for a lot of the operators in this
space it's a whole new world of suddenly
[SPEAKER_01]: you go from having volunteers at your
collective to now you're a commercial
[SPEAKER_01]: cannabis business you have to contend with
all of these regulations you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: contend with all of the HR and labor code
regulations of California which isn't easy
[SPEAKER_01]: you have to contend with OSHA you have to
get like any of these things that impact
[SPEAKER_01]: any business are now the onus of any
cannabis operator regardless of the size
[SPEAKER_00]: of your business so what percentage of
brands retailers and cultivators do you
[SPEAKER_00]: think have made significant progress on
their understanding and implementation of
[SPEAKER_01]: best practices related to track-and-trace
I'm not sure how many California operators
[SPEAKER_01]: are prepared for the reality of
track-and-trace state there's some brands
[SPEAKER_01]: in California that that have come to
California from other states that are kind
[SPEAKER_01]: of fully adept and conscious of you know
the requirements of that system so I think
[SPEAKER_01]: they they come with a very different
perspective but that's a small percentage
[SPEAKER_01]: of operators for what you call it like the
legacy operators of California who have
[SPEAKER_01]: been you know in the collective model for
a long time or cultivating kind of outside
[SPEAKER_01]: of the regulated system for a long time
it's the ones that I'm working with it's a
[SPEAKER_01]: real rude awakening in many ways to
suddenly see just how many things that
[SPEAKER_01]: they have to do and in some ways it's a
real disruption to you know their natural
[SPEAKER_01]: organic processes that they have a way
that they've been doing things for decades
[SPEAKER_01]: at this point and and that that I mean
that's why I try to tell people as much as
[SPEAKER_01]: possible when I'm working with them like
to start practicing these new requirements
[SPEAKER_01]: these checkpoints these where you have to
weigh things and when you have to report
[SPEAKER_01]: things and when you have to notify the
agencies of certain things to start
[SPEAKER_01]: practicing that as much as possible before
track-and-trace kicks in because just when
[SPEAKER_01]: track-and-trace when it's active the
stakes are higher the the logging is more
[SPEAKER_01]: permanent and and it's harder to backtrack
it's harder to change things at that point
[SPEAKER_01]: and in that you're kind of on this this
real ticking clock at that point so it's
[SPEAKER_01]: not as easy to test new systems and adapt
and be like oh well let's try it this way
[SPEAKER_01]: or maybe this person would be the best to
do it like all of those changes after
[SPEAKER_01]: track-and-trace require notifications to
the agency of who's your track-and-trace
[SPEAKER_01]: manager and like you see you can't just
make those pivots as swiftly or
[SPEAKER_01]: organically as you could now so I think
that you know as much as possible for the
[SPEAKER_01]: operators to really start practicing that
as much as possible before they get their
[SPEAKER_01]: annual license and and that happens is
really critical I mean I couldn't venture
[SPEAKER_01]: a percentage of who's who's ready but I do
think I do think you're going to see a lot
[SPEAKER_01]: of changes in you know for POS companies
you know what their advertising points are
[SPEAKER_01]: because right now there's been a lot of
stuff that's about like user experience
[SPEAKER_01]: and you know that it's cool for this or it
looks really good on the iPad or how it
[SPEAKER_01]: manages you know front-facing inventory
but I do think a big shift you're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: see with with the release of
track-and-trace is what the selling points
[SPEAKER_01]: are for POS systems and that people and
making sure people understand what
[SPEAKER_01]: compliant means with it with a
track-and-trace system I mean with the POS
[SPEAKER_01]: system many POS systems will say you know
oh we're approved we have the API for
[SPEAKER_01]: track-and-trace we interact with
track-and-trace but what they mean is that
[SPEAKER_01]: at the end of the day you can download an
Excel spreadsheet and you can physically
[SPEAKER_01]: rearrange the the columns and upload it to
track-and-trace yourself and that 90% of
[SPEAKER_01]: the time it's going to fail and then
you're going to sit there in the middle of
[SPEAKER_01]: the night you know ticking clock you have
24 hours to upload your information for
[SPEAKER_01]: the day and you're going to freak out and
and try to get it to talk to
[SPEAKER_01]: track-and-trace and maybe there'll be
errors and maybe they won't so so the POS
[SPEAKER_01]: systems that are going to have an actual
true automated real-time update of
[SPEAKER_01]: track-and-trace are going to be preferable
in some ways but I've still seen operators
[SPEAKER_01]: who are like well do I want real-time
because what if it makes a mistake and
[SPEAKER_01]: then I have to fix it and it's like
understanding like it's it's like it's
[SPEAKER_01]: it's like operating inside of an x-ray
machine like like anything you do that's a
[SPEAKER_01]: mistake they're gonna see they're gonna
see it's gonna be logged and it's okay to
[SPEAKER_01]: make mistakes in some ways there's there's
a process for doing it but you just have
[SPEAKER_01]: to report every thing and if you're making
50 mistakes a day then that's not going to
[SPEAKER_01]: look good on the system so so that's why
there's going to be this real demand for
[SPEAKER_01]: precision and accuracy and you know
inventory management and those aspects are
[SPEAKER_01]: going to become critical in the operation
of businesses which is I think just for a
[SPEAKER_01]: lot of the operators in California like I
said a level of rigor that they are not
[SPEAKER_01]: used to one of the realities that
operators should be aware of is that even
[SPEAKER_01]: now the agencies could come and at audit
your records to say you should have been
[SPEAKER_01]: keeping paper records of every transfer
every receipt of product from a licensed
[SPEAKER_01]: from a licensee all of your contracts with
distribution with license distribution
[SPEAKER_01]: that all should have been happening since
January so they're anticipating that
[SPEAKER_01]: you've got all these paper documents for
every record-keeping requirement that's
[SPEAKER_01]: that's sitting in your cabinet that they
could at their discretion come and say
[SPEAKER_01]: like hey let's check out where did this
product come from where's your shipping
[SPEAKER_01]: manifest to which licensed you know
manufacturer provided this product like
[SPEAKER_01]: they could do that when your annual
license is issued you have five days to do
[SPEAKER_01]: the track and trace training and then you
have 30 days to onboard all of your
[SPEAKER_01]: product during that 30 days you still have
to be keeping all of your records on
[SPEAKER_01]: product that's coming in and out but
that's just a time span that you have to
[SPEAKER_01]: represent in the track and trace system
every single product that you have at
[SPEAKER_01]: whatever level of production it's at so if
you're a cultivator you're inputting how
[SPEAKER_01]: many immature plants do you have what's in
your canopy right now what's drying and
[SPEAKER_01]: harvest that you got 30 days to put it all
in after that 30 days you can't put any
[SPEAKER_01]: more in progress you can't go back and be
like oh I found you know a hundred more
[SPEAKER_01]: clones we forgot about over here and we
want to put them in the system now
[SPEAKER_01]: actually that's a bad example because
clones technically you can put them in
[SPEAKER_01]: from the clone level but you can't be
found like a mature plants and we're like
[SPEAKER_01]: actually there's more canopy than we
thought then you can't bring them into the
[SPEAKER_01]: system at that point after those 30 days
anything that wasn't represented in your
[SPEAKER_01]: system starts at a seed or a clone and
then and then you follow it through the
[SPEAKER_01]: system so we're going to have a bunch of
onboarded products that will be in
[SPEAKER_01]: progress so you may be a distributor at
that point that's receiving an already
[SPEAKER_01]: made product from a manufacturer that got
onboarded into track and trace up until
[SPEAKER_00]: definitely July 1st because there were no
permanent license or annual licenses but
[SPEAKER_00]: now as I so I get my license I get my
annual license on July 1st up until now I
[SPEAKER_00]: just have to keep records here at some
point and so this is my question at what
[SPEAKER_00]: point and is it 30 days after I get my
annual license do I proactively have to
[SPEAKER_00]: get on a computer and enter data and
submit it into the government metric
[SPEAKER_01]: system versus just keeping it on yeah okay
so once you get your annual license and
[SPEAKER_01]: you have that 30 days to onboard your
product from that point on everything that
[SPEAKER_01]: happens is communicated to the government
agencies through track and trace that
[SPEAKER_01]: every activity that you participate in
anything you receive anything you send
[SPEAKER_01]: anything you do anything internal
everything is recorded into track and
[SPEAKER_01]: trace and there and for different
operators there's a different timeline of
[SPEAKER_01]: how long you have from the time of the
activity to notify the system in in in
[SPEAKER_01]: track and trace and that can be anywhere
from 24 hours for certain activities to
[SPEAKER_01]: three days for certain activities that
that you have these timelines that are
[SPEAKER_01]: established in the regulations of from the
moment this thing happens you have this
[SPEAKER_01]: long to to report it in track and trace
and if those activities go out of sync and
[SPEAKER_01]: things are not represented in track and
trace where suddenly a mature plant
[SPEAKER_01]: appears that wasn't tracked from clone or
suddenly a manufactured product appears
[SPEAKER_01]: that doesn't isn't connected to a UID from
from a seed or a clone you have a problem
[SPEAKER_01]: because every everything from that point
on once once people are on track and trace
[SPEAKER_01]: and those products are being tracked from
seed to sale has an entire history that's
[SPEAKER_01]: embedded into its its unique identifiers
and it's going to get a lot harder to
[SPEAKER_01]: bring in products that are not part of the
license system because it will because
[SPEAKER_01]: there will be no way for it to be inserted
into those systems without those
[SPEAKER_01]: identifiers that after that onboarding
period start at seed so the takeaway for
[SPEAKER_00]: me is once you onboarded and you're in
kind of your steady state operating mode
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll pretty much be almost daily
entering system and entering data into the
[SPEAKER_00]: metric system and hitting the submit
button and that data is going to go from
[SPEAKER_00]: your computer to the government servers
and they will now have access to your
[SPEAKER_00]: information and if you get lazy on that
there will be consequences like you can't
[SPEAKER_01]: fall behind on that data entry yeah from
the time that operators complete that
[SPEAKER_01]: onboarding onto metric onto track and
trace I mean there's going to be a new job
[SPEAKER_01]: at your facility which is your track and
trace manager you know somebody has that
[SPEAKER_01]: job and and it's in the regulations that
you have to select somebody to fulfill
[SPEAKER_01]: that role and that they are you know
fulfilling the obligation of monitoring
[SPEAKER_01]: all of these requirements and everything
that has to be entered and then the system
[SPEAKER_01]: in fulfilling one of the things too is
fulfilling system notifications the trip
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not just you telling the track and
trace system they're going to tell you
[SPEAKER_01]: stuff too and if you get a notification
from the track and trace they're going to
[SPEAKER_01]: say how long you have to respond to
whatever the request was and whatever the
[SPEAKER_01]: notification is from track and trace and
that's something that that person has to
[SPEAKER_01]: stay on top of and I think that that's a
new reality that that very few people are
[SPEAKER_01]: prepared for in California of having this
relationship with this you know direct
[SPEAKER_01]: channel to the state government who's
going to be monitoring every activity that
[SPEAKER_01]: every operator in the cannabis chain
conducts so if I am a track and trace
[SPEAKER_00]: manager in Washington State or Colorado
I'd probably have a lot of job offers if I
[SPEAKER_01]: came to California today yeah I would
imagine I would imagine that we're gonna
[SPEAKER_01]: see a lot of a lot a hot job market for
people in other states who have a lot of
[SPEAKER_01]: experience dealing with track and trace
who are those track and trace account
[SPEAKER_01]: managers from other states for businesses
that have not been you know audited failed
[SPEAKER_01]: or penalized are going to become kind of
like hot properties for California of
[SPEAKER_01]: really wanting to tap people who have the
expertise of dealing with these systems
[SPEAKER_01]: and who who really understand the demands
and the scope and the rigor of what it is
[SPEAKER_01]: to communicate and keep these systems
synced with your your physical operations
[SPEAKER_01]: one of the one of the biggest shortcomings
I've found in all of the audits that I do
[SPEAKER_01]: and all of the ongoing compliance work
that I do with people is this
[SPEAKER_01]: record-keeping piece where I think that I
mean it's very difficult I have a great
[SPEAKER_01]: deal of empathy for operators in terms of
the fact that it's impossible to comply
[SPEAKER_01]: with every single regulation that's put
out there right now and and I think that
[SPEAKER_01]: they move through them you know in in you
know prioritizing them in a certain way
[SPEAKER_01]: and some of the stuff that operators have
to do is just to survive to pay their
[SPEAKER_01]: bills at this point and to make sure that
their businesses don't collapse and go
[SPEAKER_01]: under while they're trying to deal with
all the costs of becoming a compliant
[SPEAKER_01]: operation and that in that this piece the
the record-keeping piece is kind of so far
[SPEAKER_01]: down the line of what's forward-facing for
your business they're like I don't yeah I
[SPEAKER_01]: mean that it doesn't it doesn't you know
hold that much water for them right now
[SPEAKER_01]: but I think that that profoundly changes
as the specter of track and trace and
[SPEAKER_01]: metric come closer because you start to
review okay well when I go into track and
[SPEAKER_01]: trace what am I what is it that I'm
putting in there and then you see how many
[SPEAKER_01]: points of contact there are and how many
representations there has to be in that
[SPEAKER_01]: system and how necessary it is that
there's nothing I mean that the product
[SPEAKER_01]: can't move from location to location with
a distributor without going into metric
[SPEAKER_01]: and doing a shipping manifest and
receiving that shipping manifest in metric
[SPEAKER_01]: so my understanding is even POS companies
that are like you'll never have to touch
[SPEAKER_01]: metric it's not true because you have to
go in there for certain activities such as
[SPEAKER_01]: the the sending and receipt of the
shipping manifest for any transfer or
[SPEAKER_01]: product so and it's in part of it too is
you know like I keep saying is that the
[SPEAKER_01]: the big trick is to figure out how to not
make the this process for cannabis
[SPEAKER_01]: operators just a horrible experience of
stuff that's happening to them to be like
[SPEAKER_01]: oh god and to actually you know really
confront these things really dig into
[SPEAKER_01]: these regulations and see how you can make
them serve your business because because
[SPEAKER_01]: few people would argue that having super
accurate inventory is a terrible thing for
[SPEAKER_01]: businesses so and then when you see it
that way and see that that's all really
[SPEAKER_01]: that that is the function of track and
trace is to make sure that everything
[SPEAKER_01]: stays in the supply chain and that you're
not losing product and that your employees
[SPEAKER_01]: aren't stealing from you and that you know
if something's going terribly wrong and
[SPEAKER_01]: you're losing a huge percentage of your
plants what's happening like that it gives
[SPEAKER_01]: you these opportunities to to you know be
a business and see like how can I improve
[SPEAKER_01]: my efficiency and how can I make this
system work and in and then that way you
[SPEAKER_01]: know it's not that scary I mean the only
the scariest thing about metric is that
[SPEAKER_01]: it's kind of like looks like software from
the 90s I think that's where it's like
[SPEAKER_01]: it'd be nice if it was like a little more
you know 2.0 we'll see so it's kind of
[SPEAKER_00]: like telling my three-year-old daughter to
eat her zucchini yeah there's a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: in this which is you'll be big strong and
healthy yeah definitely definitely metric
[SPEAKER_00]: you'll have insight into your inventory to
what's selling what's not selling yeah I
[SPEAKER_01]: think the cannabis industry is definitely
having an eat your vegetables moment like
[SPEAKER_01]: you know this is this is how the industry
the licensed industry the regulated
[SPEAKER_01]: industry distinguishes itself from an
illicit market is all of these things that
[SPEAKER_01]: feel horrible in some ways are absolutely
necessary it is absolutely necessary that
[SPEAKER_01]: we have rigorous testing of products it is
absolutely necessary that we fulfill
[SPEAKER_01]: packaging and labeling requirements what
those are can be changed and adapted and
[SPEAKER_01]: evolved you know to hopefully have less
impact on the environment it's in but it
[SPEAKER_01]: is absolutely necessary that we have
standards for for this industry and it's
[SPEAKER_01]: absolutely necessary you know and in
effect you know we're we're part of a
[SPEAKER_01]: crazy paradigm shift we're part of a
change in cultural consciousness about the
[SPEAKER_01]: attitudes towards cannabis and the
attitudes towards a lot of different kinds
[SPEAKER_01]: of things in in part of our job as the
cannabis industry is to help people
[SPEAKER_01]: confront their fears and to help eliminate
those perceptions of what they think the
[SPEAKER_01]: market is so it's you know it's tough
times for us to have to go through it and
[SPEAKER_01]: be so over-regulated and and rigorous
about things but what we get to do in that
[SPEAKER_01]: process is demonstrate that this is a
business like other businesses and and
[SPEAKER_01]: it's not some crazy free-for-all where
every operator is feeding the illicit
[SPEAKER_01]: market and we're all doing this you know
by onboarding onto track and trace by
[SPEAKER_01]: showing the life of a product by show like
helping to educate the agencies and the
[SPEAKER_01]: government in terms of how this stuff
really works that's the ways that we
[SPEAKER_01]: actually influence the policy and the
direction of the industry and help to
[SPEAKER_01]: relax some of those unfounded fears and
some founded fears about how this industry
[SPEAKER_01]: can be wrangled and seen.
