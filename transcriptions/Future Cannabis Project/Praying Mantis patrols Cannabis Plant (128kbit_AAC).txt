[SPEAKER_00]: Here, give me the top.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright, come over here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Alright.
[SPEAKER_00]: We pulled a bug off the... Okay,
here, give it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: Give it to me.
[SPEAKER_00]: I got it, I got it, I got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Watch.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's upside down.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So watch, here's the praying mantis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh damn.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's right there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Whatever doesn't need it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Come on praying mantis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just took it, it just took it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is it gonna eat?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, it's gonna eat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, the mantis just took it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that awesome?
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, is he eating it?
[SPEAKER_00]: He sure is.
[SPEAKER_00]: Does it not look yummy and delicious?
[SPEAKER_02]: No.
[SPEAKER_02]: I would not eat it.
[SPEAKER_02]: You wouldn't.
[SPEAKER_00]: The mantis likes it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's now, it's the domesticated mantis.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's just gonna expect us to hand feed it
every day.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we do it a little bit more?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, why?
[SPEAKER_00]: It can only eat one thing at a time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Can we give it another one?
[SPEAKER_00]: No baby, look at you.
[SPEAKER_00]: You just want to feed the mantis bugs,
huh?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay, so look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: That is a good...
[SPEAKER_00]: It doesn't even care that we're here.
[SPEAKER_00]: Isn't that cool?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look how big that mantis is.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's totally eating this bug that
wants to eat our plants, right?
[SPEAKER_00]: And do we like bugs that eat our plants?
[SPEAKER_01]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not so much.
[SPEAKER_00]: We don't dislike them, but we don't mind
them when they're just a couple of them.
[SPEAKER_00]: But when they bring all their friends to
the plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, it is.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, no, it's not water.
