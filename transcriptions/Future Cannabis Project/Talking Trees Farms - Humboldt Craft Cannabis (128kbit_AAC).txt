[SPEAKER_02]: All right, we're here with Craig from
Talking Trees and also from Satori.
[SPEAKER_02]: Craig, how's it going?
[SPEAKER_00]: It's going great, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: How about yourself?
[SPEAKER_02]: Pretty good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm doing pretty well.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks for coming out today and talking.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, thanks for having me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, basically, let's dive into your
background.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you've got a pretty diverse range
of business that you're managing.
[SPEAKER_02]: What got you into cannabis originally?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where did that start?
[SPEAKER_00]: Skateboarding got me into cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I started skateboarding when I was nine
years old.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: Skateboarding brought me to San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I'd already been like I grew up in
the Atlanta area.
[SPEAKER_00]: So just do like skateboarding and my older
brothers got into cannabis and my teens,
[SPEAKER_00]: late teens, not too early.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And yeah, when I came to San Francisco,
some skater guys and you were like,
[SPEAKER_00]: we got to go to Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: They have the best weed.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was like, all right, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's go.
[SPEAKER_00]: Is it pretty flexible?
[SPEAKER_00]: Funny story is actually real quick is the
first day I landed in Arcata.
[SPEAKER_00]: I came up to Humboldt was after the first
Lee Perry show that was in San Francisco.
[SPEAKER_00]: We went straight from that show.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is late 90s, I think 98 or 99.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we landed at the Arcata skate park at
like 7 a.m.
[SPEAKER_00]: Get out.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're super tired.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, let's skate the park.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cops come and give us a ticket for not
wearing a helmet at like 7.20 in the
[SPEAKER_00]: morning.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're like, all right, welcome to
Humboldt.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I don't know about this place.
[SPEAKER_02]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: Then I never really left.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's funny.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you got Satori started.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, we had started Satori about a year
before that in 1998.
[SPEAKER_00]: OK, so yeah, it must have been about 99.
[SPEAKER_02]: And that all developed then.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you've been doing talking trees
for how long?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, talking trees became a brand in
2013.
[SPEAKER_02]: OK, right on.
[SPEAKER_02]: And of course, you have your dispensary
that you're running to.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, pretty, pretty, pretty big plate
there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's what it's cool watching it happen.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you why do you farm cannabis?
[SPEAKER_02]: What draws you to that?
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, in the beginning was just,
you know, the mystique of like growing
[SPEAKER_00]: your own plant.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it was just fascinating, you know.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so I was around like 1998 when I got
to grow or witness and like was in the
[SPEAKER_00]: fold of friends that were like starting to
grow.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was just fascinated by it.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so it's like and the person that
really like mentored me in growing was
[SPEAKER_00]: like a super passionate grower.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like I just learned everything the
right way from the start.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it just inspired me to like continue
to try and just connect with the plant and
[SPEAKER_00]: grow good cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to talk a little bit about
talking trees farms, like what what your
[SPEAKER_02]: farm's about, what makes it unique,
you know, something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, totally.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, you know, it's just been an
evolution always trying to make it better.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, we're off grid, you know,
so there's, you know, natural.
[SPEAKER_00]: Natural challenges there for me.
[SPEAKER_02]: Natural challenge with all those trees
coming down.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, I have like literally over 200
trees, 200 trees over the audience.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't know we had a massive snowstorm
at the end of December that wiped out
[SPEAKER_02]: Willow Creek for power for like almost two
weeks in some places.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, it was.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so to you said 200 trees came down
about 200 trees across the road across.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's a lot of fun.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we've been just cutting, you know,
chainsaws nonstop all day.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: And luckily didn't get like too much
damage to like infrastructure.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, just a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it never ends.
[SPEAKER_02]: But yeah, like with farm management,
like you do you do anything that's like
[SPEAKER_02]: unique or you find like helps,
you know, with, you know, your flower
[SPEAKER_02]: production that you think is unique.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, for me, it's always just been like
keep it simple.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, don't get too complicated with
things.
[SPEAKER_00]: We try to avoid liquids as much as
possible because I hate plastic bottles
[SPEAKER_00]: piling up.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I relate.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just believe in like keeping simple,
you know, like look at things like from an
[SPEAKER_00]: earthly perspective.
[SPEAKER_00]: We didn't have all this technology and
whatnot.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so like nature always knows how to
reproduce itself and and do the best job.
[SPEAKER_00]: So try to mimic that as much as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: Of course, like we're trying to get two
and three harvest a year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So like, you know, the ethos is to try and
be as natural and organic and sustainable
[SPEAKER_00]: as possible.
[SPEAKER_00]: And of course, you know, we have to do
what we have to do to produce,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, good product multiple times a
year.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, we're just trying,
you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many strains do you guys grow?
[SPEAKER_02]: I shouldn't say strains.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: We're not saying strains anymore.
[SPEAKER_02]: Strange is out.
[SPEAKER_02]: How many cultivars?
[SPEAKER_00]: Flavors, flavors, varieties.
Oh, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: So many.
[SPEAKER_00]: Way too many.
[SPEAKER_02]: You got a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Hundreds.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you feel like hundreds?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, OK.
[SPEAKER_02]: So because I feel like that maybe someone
in your position having a dispensary,
[SPEAKER_02]: too, you know, it's like you can create
these small batches of different unique
[SPEAKER_02]: flavors that people can, you know,
cycle through more rapidly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: You feel like that's benefited you?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: You know, I'll take like two steps back on
this answer because in 20 or 1920,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, I grew a lot of strains,
tried to do like three per greenhouse.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're trying to like come out as a brand,
have variety.
[SPEAKER_00]: And, you know, it worked.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good.
[SPEAKER_00]: But then I saw like the bulk market when
you're, you know, independently owned,
[SPEAKER_00]: struggling farm, dealing with all the pain
in the butt of surviving in California
[SPEAKER_00]: market.
[SPEAKER_00]: I saw this bulk market last year,
like thriving people, like doing great in
[SPEAKER_00]: selling bulk flour.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I was like, I kind of missed that
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: So next year, this last season,
so 21, I was like, all right, we'll grow
[SPEAKER_00]: less strains, more bulk of the strains so
we can get some cash flow package.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it totally backfired.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm like, I'm not selling any bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like store it well.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got to package it, market and move it
because that was, you know, I knew that
[SPEAKER_00]: was coming, but I didn't think it was
going to come and crash so hard so fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, it was pretty gnarly.
[SPEAKER_02]: I didn't think it was just going to be
over night season.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, speaking of storing, how harvesting,
I think, I mean, it's kind of half the
battle.
[SPEAKER_02]: In some ways, almost like you have any
interesting, you know, things you do for
[SPEAKER_02]: just like nice climate controlled systems,
you know, harvesting methodologies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yep, for sure.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, always try to harvest either early
in the morning or late in the evening.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're wanting to like harvest right in
the middle of the heat of the day.
[SPEAKER_00]: I feel that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm trying the biggest thing that I think
is overlooked a lot of times, but trying
[SPEAKER_00]: to like address and control is even while
it's still growing and you're doing that
[SPEAKER_00]: first run of depth and it's like middle of
July and super hot.
[SPEAKER_00]: Trying to shade the greenhouses early
while they're still in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just trying to cut those temps down and
preserve the turps.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, you know, it's extra work.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the crew like is pulling two turps a
day basically, but you know, that's an
[SPEAKER_00]: effort just to like control and,
and that goes back to like when we were
[SPEAKER_00]: trying to hide the hoops and had to remail
over them.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was like a real like paper type thin
substance that like, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: defer transfer translucency.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so you would get more of an indoor
look on those depths because you're not
[SPEAKER_00]: like just getting away too much sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because you're kind of out of tune with
the seasonal way the plant would grow
[SPEAKER_00]: anyway, because you're doing depth.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so that was one thing that we've added
to try and like kind of keep those first
[SPEAKER_00]: run depths from not getting like that too
burnt.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's true.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The summer, I don't, people probably don't
know our Willow Creek summers can get
[SPEAKER_02]: really hot, easily triple digits,
like consecutive days.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, yeah, no, it makes a lot of sense in
that like little diffusion of heat
[SPEAKER_02]: probably helps and just affects the turps.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Turps don't burn off as fast.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They don't fall.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's interesting.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then, you know, just trying to create
a good climate control building,
[SPEAKER_00]: which is, you know, taking a lot of work,
especially being off grid and you have to
[SPEAKER_00]: run a generator.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I just saw that the board of
supervisors are trying to like tighten
[SPEAKER_00]: that up even tighter.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I was like, I texted my supervisor last
night, like come to the farm, like,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, you're in support of full sun
grown only cannabis, but we still need
[SPEAKER_00]: generators to do that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, we're out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like we need power to cure and dry the
cans properly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in a lot of instances, we might need
it to get the nursery starts going.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so, you know, it's just one of those
things that has to be part of the process.
[SPEAKER_00]: And if you're doing it well, there's no,
it's no, it's no more detrimental than
[SPEAKER_00]: just using PG&E power.
[SPEAKER_02]: What elevation are you guys at?
[SPEAKER_00]: Top is 1600.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: And the lower end is about 1200 foot
elevation.
[SPEAKER_02]: So do you have, do you have plants on both
tiers?
[SPEAKER_02]: You do.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you find any, I mean, it's maybe not a
silly question, but any difference in
[SPEAKER_02]: micro climate within those two levels?
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you have any deal with anything or do
you feel like it's pretty similar?
[SPEAKER_00]: A little bit of difference.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not too much.
[SPEAKER_00]: And cause same slope, same aspect.
[SPEAKER_00]: They just don't get as much sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's actually so many different spots
because there's two, I have two properties
[SPEAKER_00]: there, but they're set up.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like legacy growth.
[SPEAKER_00]: So you never wanted everything in all in
one spot.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's like two miles back to this
patch, one mile to this one.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they're all kind of, so they're all
their own somewhat little micro-climates
[SPEAKER_00]: within that 1200 to 1600 foot elevation.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, we can talk about a lot of
things, but one of the things that I was
[SPEAKER_02]: interested in is all of these packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, let's go, let's go with the
packaging first, since we're on that tip.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are really interesting.
[SPEAKER_02]: You just came out with these and they're a
hundred percent compostable packaging.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're not out yet, but they're coming
next month.
[SPEAKER_02]: So these are the tests.
[SPEAKER_02]: These are the, basically the pilot.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a production run.
[SPEAKER_02]: Production run.
[SPEAKER_00]: Just waiting on the bulk.
[SPEAKER_00]: We had a few samples FedEx just to make
sure they.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: And what is the, the ink is like soy or
something, something like that.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's pretty wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's water-based.
[SPEAKER_02]: Water-based, right.
[SPEAKER_02]: A hundred percent compostable packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you've got these for your eights.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you also have this, which is a
pre-roll packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's also a hundred percent compostable.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So this part right here is this
biodegradable packaging, which is pretty
[SPEAKER_02]: dope.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm pretty stoked on that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't see that too often at all in the
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: So kudos to you, my man, for, you know,
taking the time and money and energy to
[SPEAKER_02]: work towards this.
[SPEAKER_02]: We all need this in the industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I hope a lot of people take your lead
and follow through with us.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The funny thing about that is to develop
that, what I did is I went to the co-op
[SPEAKER_00]: and took one of their.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, the bags.
[SPEAKER_00]: Their bags.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was going to ask for that.
[SPEAKER_02]: I cut it up.
[SPEAKER_00]: It sent pictures to my packaging factory
and was like, well, this is what I want to
[SPEAKER_00]: do.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's so funny because when I,
in the back of my mind, I didn't want to
[SPEAKER_02]: say it because I didn't want to feel like
no one knew what I was talking about,
[SPEAKER_02]: but I was literally thinking this feels
just like the co-op bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: So that's really funny to me that you said
that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, that's where I cut it out.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's hilarious.
[SPEAKER_02]: All right.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're moving on to your flowers here.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: This is the garlic cookies.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the loud trees box means it's like an
indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cool.
[SPEAKER_02]: Very exciting.
[SPEAKER_02]: The garlic cookies.
[SPEAKER_02]: The only other person that had garlic
cookies was Hannah and I know it's a
[SPEAKER_02]: really hard strain to grow.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not necessarily hard, but it just
takes a long time.
[SPEAKER_02]: So very few growers I know actually are
taking the time to.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's one of those strains that you could
just, it never looks like it's finished.
[SPEAKER_00]: It just keeps wanting to go and go.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it smells so good.
[SPEAKER_02]: I love that smell.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like the garlic, mushroom,
onion, rubber turp smell.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Beautiful.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it always hits really high on the
potency.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's amazing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I think it has that on the, on the actual
packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you, is this, so you have your little
indoor line.
[SPEAKER_02]: Is that also at talking trees at the same
place?
[SPEAKER_00]: No.
[SPEAKER_00]: Different location.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: The loud trees is on the coast.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, loud trees.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, that's just separate.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So loud trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Got it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Loud trees is our indoor flower and then
talking trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the GMO is 30% THC, minor CBD.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got limonene, karyophylline,
mercine, humuline.
[SPEAKER_02]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a, that's really cool, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We, we test or we test for terpenes on all
our smokeable products, but we list the
[SPEAKER_00]: top three on all the packaging.
[SPEAKER_02]: So, wow.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're really growing GMO.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's even a greater fee growing,
growing garlic cookies indoor.
[SPEAKER_02]: Cause of the time.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I guess it stretches a lot.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you don't have to veg as long.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you not veg it as long?
[SPEAKER_02]: Or do you?
[SPEAKER_00]: No, I mean, it doesn't stretch incredibly
that much.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: We just actually pulled a room over today.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was looking amazing actually.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: So now, now we're moving on to the lemon
Royale, lemon Royal.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Lemon Royale is a special one.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's a 35% THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's like our, our talking trees.
[SPEAKER_00]: Do you know that we hunted out of the
swamp boys seed?
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, nice.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: When did you get this?
[SPEAKER_02]: It was just like random seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: He just like picked them.
[SPEAKER_00]: We got them at probably the Emerald Cup
two, three years ago, three years ago,
[SPEAKER_00]: I would say.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the good thing about being a vendor
at the Emerald Cup.
[SPEAKER_00]: You're there early enough where you can
like get to the seed lines you want before
[SPEAKER_00]: the crowds get there.
[SPEAKER_00]: I know what you mean.
[SPEAKER_00]: My having me do that this year is funny.
[SPEAKER_00]: During setup, you just go and make the
rounds.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was when we picked in there.
[SPEAKER_00]: We picked a fino out of the seeds and that
one is amazing.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like sharp.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's got, it's pretty like, it's hard to
describe exactly.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's like, it almost has, I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: What is that smell?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's very, it's kind of like, you know,
it's not sitting in the car for a minute.
[SPEAKER_02]: No, it's got like a, it's like a sharp
kind of like loud.
[SPEAKER_02]: What's that smell?
[SPEAKER_02]: It almost has like a hint of, I don't
know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Can't quite put my finger on it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, piney.
[SPEAKER_02]: My nose isn't the best right now,
but yeah, a little pine.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's the pine or something.
[SPEAKER_02]: The limonene maybe.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's always high in turps too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then you're, these are for sale at the
dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: A lot of different dispensaries.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: A lot of different dispensaries.
Okay.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: So you're not just doing, you're all,
you're all over the state.
Cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Close to 300 stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: 300 stores.
[SPEAKER_02]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Another aspect, the distribution side of
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's a lot of work.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_02]: Right.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's wild.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I mean, speaking of like that
distribution and like technical side,
[SPEAKER_02]: one of the questions we've been asking all
the farmers is like, what do you think if
[SPEAKER_02]: you had to change one thing in the
industry, whether it's education or
[SPEAKER_02]: regulation relating to production or
distribution or whatever, what do you
[SPEAKER_02]: think, what would be the more impactful
thing that you would change?
[SPEAKER_00]: State cultivation tax.
[SPEAKER_02]: State cultivation tax.
Yeah.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: The taxes have been pretty hot today.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's kind of ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, it's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, you know, and even on a local level,
I see the stop measure S and I don't mind
[SPEAKER_00]: paying local taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's good for our local community.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not that bad.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's that state cultivation tax per pound
or per ounce.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's, it's, it's killing us.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's done even before you sell the
product.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's, it's taxed.
[SPEAKER_02]: Once it's like in manufacturing.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It comes due.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Which is crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: That's insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's absolutely insane.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's mind blowing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Because even if you had a great business
or you have a great business and you want
[SPEAKER_00]: to do things and do education as part of
marketing, whatever, you just,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's all going to the government.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all they've taken everything.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: They've just funneled off everything.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like when the, when the bulk price of
pounds are going for $400 and you're
[SPEAKER_00]: giving $160 in tax.
[SPEAKER_00]: Right.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you grow it in or get it manicured
for less than $240?
[SPEAKER_00]: That's crazy.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not, it doesn't work.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's not feasible.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it doesn't exist in any other
agricultural commodity besides cannabis.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's just ridiculous.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know.
[SPEAKER_00]: So yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's California.
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, you probably know where and I
would, I haven't been up on the other
[SPEAKER_02]: state's laws or regs, but is California
kind of dropping the ball more than other
[SPEAKER_02]: states?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like I heard Colorado is better.
[SPEAKER_02]: Like it's like taxed at the end at the
sale point of sales.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, there's two, I mean, there's two
ways to look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think California is a great model for
business.
[SPEAKER_00]: The worst model for taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I think other States have maybe not
the best models for business.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're catered to like big mega
corporations, but the taxes are way low.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's two ways to look at comparing it
to different States.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we're the worst on taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we're probably one of the best on
entry and availability to people to get
[SPEAKER_00]: into the market, but it doesn't really
help if you kill them all.
[SPEAKER_02]: I know, man.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's crazy.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, this is just me talking politics,
but I mean like really like truthfully,
[SPEAKER_02]: like what does it take for people,
for a community to change this policy?
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, it's like, does it come to you
and me running for district supervisor or
[SPEAKER_02]: Senate, you know, like, or is that even,
you know, I mean, do you have to overthrow
[SPEAKER_02]: the governor to do this?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like where do, where do you think it
really lies?
[SPEAKER_02]: Like collectively collective union,
like a union.
[SPEAKER_02]: What do you think?
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I, you know, I sent an email to
Natalie on HCGA.
[SPEAKER_00]: She asked that question, like,
can the governor just like do a,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, executive action?
[SPEAKER_00]: Like, this has to change like ASAP,
like in tomorrow, like I'm trying to
[SPEAKER_00]: survive here.
[SPEAKER_00]: And she said, cause of the way prop 64 was
passed, it's a legislative, you know,
[SPEAKER_00]: I might not word it all right,
but it's a legislative thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: It has to go through like assembly and
voting and nothing's going to happen for
[SPEAKER_00]: at least six months.
[SPEAKER_00]: The earliest that it could change would be
July of this year.
[SPEAKER_02]: It would have to be almost like a
collective of voters putting pressure on
[SPEAKER_02]: individual legislators, enough pressure to
where they feel like it's worth them
[SPEAKER_02]: changing something like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then I think also the communication
with the people that are getting that tax
[SPEAKER_00]: money, because that's another point that
someone else made to me is that like,
[SPEAKER_00]: there's a lot of money going to a lot of
different organizations because of the
[SPEAKER_00]: state taxes.
[SPEAKER_00]: And so they don't want to lose that money
that they're getting.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like, well, you want to get a lot now
and nothing in five years or let's balance
[SPEAKER_00]: this out.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's like make sense of it.
[SPEAKER_00]: So there's longevity and sustainability in
it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Cause it's not sustainable the way it's
set up right now and it won't last.
[SPEAKER_00]: And everybody's going to lose,
including those people that are getting
[SPEAKER_00]: the money.
[SPEAKER_00]: So it's like something has to change.
[SPEAKER_02]: Something has to change and quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: You heard it here from Craig.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's been in the business.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's got his clothing company,
dispensary and farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: He's pretty well versed in business.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah, I would take his advice.
[SPEAKER_00]: So, all right, bro.
[SPEAKER_00]: Let's get it to the governor.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, I think that pretty much wraps it
up.
[SPEAKER_02]: So thanks for coming out and wrapping with
us and enjoy the time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So awesome.
[SPEAKER_02]: Have a good one.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
