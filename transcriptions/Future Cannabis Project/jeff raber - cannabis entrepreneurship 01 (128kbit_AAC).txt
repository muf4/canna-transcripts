[SPEAKER_00]: I've always been a scientist and an
entrepreneur, kind of that little bit of
[SPEAKER_00]: the lemonade stand, but in college
actually started an internet service
[SPEAKER_00]: provider and was always interested in
being on the cutting edge of technology
[SPEAKER_00]: and making change that would be positive
for society.
[SPEAKER_00]: Went on to graduate school out here in Los
Angeles, California because it was a big
[SPEAKER_00]: place for opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: The advisor that was doing research at USC
was doing some really interesting things
[SPEAKER_00]: and environmentally and friendly fashion,
making non-natural amino acids and other
[SPEAKER_00]: types of building blocks that could be
useful in the pharmaceutical industry.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was trained to think about
environmentally friendly methods of
[SPEAKER_00]: production, trained to think of how you
can do things to better improve society,
[SPEAKER_00]: making molecules, do kind of more of what
you would like, turn them into materials,
[SPEAKER_00]: turn them into food ingredients,
turn them into pharmaceuticals or fine
[SPEAKER_00]: chemical building blocks for things that
we use as fuels and other stuff like that.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'd always thought chemistry could use
those types of skill sets and
[SPEAKER_00]: understandings to be an entrepreneur and
make a big positive impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I thought, yeah, that was a great
place to start.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'd always had an interest in working
towards helping people medicinally.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I had always had that type of mindset
to go out there and be involved in
[SPEAKER_00]: research and help make medicines and try
and change people for the better.
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we understand?
[SPEAKER_00]: What can we learn and how can we produce
things at low cost for people?
[SPEAKER_00]: Graduate school taught me environmentally
friendly methods, how to think about your
[SPEAKER_00]: economic and environmental impacts of the
processes that you perform to produce
[SPEAKER_00]: these things at scale.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you scale them up in a safe fashion
ways that we won't hurt the people that
[SPEAKER_00]: are performing those processes?
[SPEAKER_00]: How do you not leave residues in the
products and how do you become really good
[SPEAKER_00]: at making things in an efficient and
effective manner for both yourself and the
[SPEAKER_00]: environment?
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working as an entrepreneur.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was working in a lot of different areas,
fine chemical manufacturing, ways of
[SPEAKER_00]: producing chemicals in different means.
[SPEAKER_00]: When my brother came to me and said he was
at a construction company and he was asked
[SPEAKER_00]: to build out a storefront dispensary.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was around the end of 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: So building a dispensary, I said,
dispensary for what?
[SPEAKER_00]: I have no idea what you're talking about.
[SPEAKER_00]: And he told me it was for medicinal
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: My first impression was, is that legal?
[SPEAKER_00]: I can't believe that that would be legal
in any way, shape or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: But turns out I moved out here in 1997.
[SPEAKER_00]: And in 1996 is when the voters passed the
initiative, was not very politically
[SPEAKER_00]: interested or activated in any way,
shape or form.
[SPEAKER_00]: I was focused on school, science and
getting my degree and doing my thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: But this kind of woke me up to say,
wow, there's voter initiatives.
[SPEAKER_00]: There's laws that can be put in place by
the people and they think things should be
[SPEAKER_00]: done in certain fashions.
[SPEAKER_00]: And sure enough, Prop 215 existed.
[SPEAKER_00]: SB 420 was already enacted at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is the end of 2008.
[SPEAKER_00]: In the beginning of 2009 when President
Obama said, you know, patience,
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm not going to come after you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm really worried about drug dealers and
cartels.
[SPEAKER_00]: I thought, well, maybe they're an
opportunity.
[SPEAKER_00]: I certainly was going through my own
physical ailments as well.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had had bouts with an irritable bowel.
[SPEAKER_00]: They had given me lots of antibiotics to
the point where my face swelled up and I
[SPEAKER_00]: had adverse reactions from that.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nothing seemed to be working.
[SPEAKER_00]: They kind of get to that definition when
they've tried everything else,
[SPEAKER_00]: done all the tests and still don't know
exactly what's going on.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, it's a really large nervous system.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when my brother said this stuff can be
used as medicinal means, I started to look
[SPEAKER_00]: at cannabis from a very medicinal
standpoint.
[SPEAKER_00]: Had understood that it was around and
certainly was, you know, aware of the
[SPEAKER_00]: topic in a recreational type of sense,
which I think medicinal and recreational
[SPEAKER_00]: are two different labels for tax purposes
at this point.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all for physiological impact.
[SPEAKER_00]: Look at those studies that have been done,
kind of take an approach like the
[SPEAKER_00]: Schaeffer Commission and really start to
look how safe is this molecule or sets of
[SPEAKER_00]: molecules?
[SPEAKER_00]: What makes this very medicinally
beneficial to so many people and how
[SPEAKER_00]: harmful might it be?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you look at all of the research
that had been done even up to that point,
[SPEAKER_00]: it's pretty easy for me to see as a
scientist.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is one of the most effective types of
compounds we can find.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's very benign to the human body because
it's offered in a whole plant type
[SPEAKER_00]: fashion.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we really don't know a great deal
about all the therapeutic benefits,
[SPEAKER_00]: but all of these early studies are saying
it has benefits for numerous number of
[SPEAKER_00]: ailments or physiological responses.
[SPEAKER_00]: And you come to find out that the
endocannabinoid system was really only
[SPEAKER_00]: discovered in the early 90s, natural
molecules.
[SPEAKER_00]: Anandamide and endocannabinoids were only
found in the early 90s.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we haven't really gotten a good handle
on being able to research, understand,
[SPEAKER_00]: and fully appreciate that whole type of
system.
[SPEAKER_00]: We now know it's a good system for
regulating balance within the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it seems like that is key to so many
different things that are causing the root
[SPEAKER_00]: problems of the ailments, from
inflammation to all sorts of other,
[SPEAKER_00]: you know, irritations.
[SPEAKER_00]: And how can I sleep better?
[SPEAKER_00]: My mood could be improved.
[SPEAKER_00]: And then fundamental physiological
problems could be improved.
And I think that's one of the most
important things that we need to think
[SPEAKER_00]: about when we're looking at these types of
processes like cell growth, blood cell
[SPEAKER_00]: growth, and things of that type.
[SPEAKER_00]: So when I looked at this and said,
wow, there's like this enormous amount of
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity and potential, botanicals
offer this ability to be very friendly and
[SPEAKER_00]: healthy and very easy on the body.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's not a single molecule.
[SPEAKER_00]: You see a lot of people with handfuls of
pharmaceuticals, and that's because,
[SPEAKER_00]: well, one, solved the problem that I
thought you had, but caused side effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I needed to give you three other
things to mitigate some of the side
[SPEAKER_00]: effects.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're trying to mimic a plant in some
respects.
[SPEAKER_00]: Like if I can give you four or five or ten
different things, you can find your state
[SPEAKER_00]: of balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: So cannabis impacting with the
endocannabinoid system in the body's
[SPEAKER_00]: homeostasis and balance.
[SPEAKER_00]: Looking at this body of science,
I just thought to myself, this is really
[SPEAKER_00]: going to be good for me.
[SPEAKER_00]: CBD, cannabidiol, other types of,
you know, non-psychoactive cannabinoids
[SPEAKER_00]: could be very beneficial.
[SPEAKER_00]: Irritations of the bowel, things like
Crohn's disease.
[SPEAKER_00]: I had talked to other people that were
benefiting from the use of THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: And CBD was, you know, very, very rare to
find.
[SPEAKER_00]: So in the beginning of 2009, the idea was,
wow, like you could really make a very
[SPEAKER_00]: positive impact with cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: How would you do that?
[SPEAKER_00]: And when you start to go to dispensaries,
you would see no one understands their
[SPEAKER_00]: supply chain.
[SPEAKER_00]: No one knows which products they have.
[SPEAKER_00]: And are they possibly contaminated?
[SPEAKER_00]: So plant has been bred a lot for high THC.
[SPEAKER_00]: How do we find the other cultivars like
CBD or CBG, THCB and other things only
[SPEAKER_00]: when a laboratory exists, could you start
to direct cultivation efforts and breeding
[SPEAKER_00]: efforts to other types of plants?
[SPEAKER_00]: Only when you're there could you start to
protect against pesticide exposures,
[SPEAKER_00]: microbiological contaminations,
and really protect public health and
[SPEAKER_00]: safety.
[SPEAKER_00]: So our thought was, there's not a lot of
scientists out here in the game.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm seemingly getting some somewhat of a
green light to say, if you think you can
[SPEAKER_00]: help people and really do this the right
way and usher this into society in a safe,
[SPEAKER_00]: effective fashion, that would be of
interest.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we will kind of tolerate that and let
that go at that point.
[SPEAKER_00]: So the calculation was, this is an
enormous risk, probably throwing away a
[SPEAKER_00]: career path down the pharmaceutical path.
[SPEAKER_00]: Not really sure what this means,
but I think that there's enough of an
[SPEAKER_00]: opportunity to help so many people to be a
good scientist and really make a positive
[SPEAKER_00]: impact in an environmentally and
ecologically friendly way that it was
[SPEAKER_00]: worth that potential risk, that we could
go out there.
[SPEAKER_00]: People would want to hear from educated,
intelligent, sophisticated scientists and
[SPEAKER_00]: make sure that we were able to do what we
wanted to do and inform and educate many
[SPEAKER_00]: people.
[SPEAKER_00]: So without understanding formal education
or formal knowledge base about what's in
[SPEAKER_00]: the products, what's going on with the
products, what people are actually being
[SPEAKER_00]: benefited by which products, we can't
really further develop and utilize this
[SPEAKER_00]: plant to the best of all of our abilities
and to the maximum utility that it has to
[SPEAKER_00]: offer.
[SPEAKER_00]: And when lawmakers, state regulators,
or other people have to make decisions
[SPEAKER_00]: about what the people wanted and what they
voted on, they need to be informed and
[SPEAKER_00]: they can't go to school for seven years
and find an education that's going to help
[SPEAKER_00]: them understand each of those sections.
[SPEAKER_00]: I mean, they just don't have that kind of
time.
[SPEAKER_00]: So they have to look towards informed
experts in that kind of sense.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we thought that would be a great part
of our service would be to provide
[SPEAKER_00]: educational information to anyone that
would want it, whether it's a lawmaker,
[SPEAKER_00]: regulator, law enforcement type people,
individual patients, doctors, and just the
[SPEAKER_00]: general public at large.
[SPEAKER_00]: How can we help most people understand
what's going on with this plant or science
[SPEAKER_00]: in general and really start to introduce
people to things that I hear now.
[SPEAKER_00]: They're like, well, I really kind of
didn't pay that much attention to science
[SPEAKER_00]: in school, but I wish I would have because
it's really interesting to me now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I really have a great interest in
seeing how this is impacting things.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're not going to understand things
until the scientists get involved.
[SPEAKER_00]: So we thought at that point, if we're
going to help catalyze change in the best
[SPEAKER_00]: possible direction, it would be good to go
ahead and start some sort of service
[SPEAKER_00]: entity that provided at least testing to
begin with.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that was kind of how we went.
[SPEAKER_00]: So thank you very much.
Thank you.
Thank you.
