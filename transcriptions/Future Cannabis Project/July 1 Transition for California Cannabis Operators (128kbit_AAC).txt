[SPEAKER_01]: But now that we're looking at eight months
into the legalized regulated market,
[SPEAKER_01]: and I know from the Bureau's perspective,
for each part of the supply chain,
[SPEAKER_01]: we've had our own challenges in
regulating.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I wanted to get your perspective on how
it has been for you the last eight months
[SPEAKER_01]: in being in this regulated market,
and especially how have you continued to
[SPEAKER_01]: deal with the changes that come down?
[SPEAKER_01]: Because we always talk about the
regulators, you know, we keep changing
[SPEAKER_01]: things on you.
[SPEAKER_01]: And so I'm curious how you've dealt with
that.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know, you have to stay nimble.
[SPEAKER_04]: You have to be on top of it.
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the worst thing you can do is
refer to lawyers to interpret the
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations for you instead of as a
business operator being engaged in them in
[SPEAKER_04]: a line-by-line fashion.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I think that's where some people have
been caught unawares at times,
[SPEAKER_04]: where they're relying on others to
interpret for them rather than,
[SPEAKER_04]: as I say, as operators actually being
fully engaged in the text of the
[SPEAKER_04]: regulations.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I think some of the biggest challenges
have been to, on the lab side,
[SPEAKER_04]: is the marketing, right, of the
regulations is to help guide people
[SPEAKER_04]: through things they feel are unreasonable
or things they don't feel like they should
[SPEAKER_04]: have to do and help explain and understand
to them that this path forward represents
[SPEAKER_04]: one where we're taking some extraordinary
measures around the protection of consumer
[SPEAKER_04]: safety because we lack a certain body of
data.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think one of the biggest challenges
has really been to communicate to the
[SPEAKER_04]: people who are the users of lab testing in
this current market maybe why some of the
[SPEAKER_04]: things that are in place are there.
[SPEAKER_04]: In terms of being able to react to the
changing regulations, mostly you have to
[SPEAKER_04]: anticipate.
[SPEAKER_04]: When you get an initial draft of
regulations, you need to take them almost
[SPEAKER_04]: as if that's what's going to be.
[SPEAKER_04]: Because if you wait until the end of a
comment period implementation,
[SPEAKER_04]: then you'll find yourself probably too far
behind.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think one of the struggles that
people have had is, well, I don't want to
[SPEAKER_04]: spend money.
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't have to, right, in case this thing
changes.
[SPEAKER_04]: Let's say there's no heavy metals
requirement, for example, right?
[SPEAKER_04]: I don't want to buy an ICPMS if I don't
have to.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I think making those decisions in
anticipation of what could be while trying
[SPEAKER_04]: to manage cash flow and capital has been
challenging as a business owner.
[SPEAKER_03]: Absolutely all those points.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think probably the top level thing I
would say is the ultimate goal is to
[SPEAKER_03]: transition people from the black market to
the regulated market.
[SPEAKER_03]: And as a whole supply chain enterprise,
such as Grupo Floor, it's frustrating
[SPEAKER_03]: talking, for example, to dispensary owners
explaining to them that the packaging we
[SPEAKER_03]: have actually does comply with the law and
then getting into fights with them about
[SPEAKER_03]: why it does or does not.
[SPEAKER_03]: And that gets very tiresome.
[SPEAKER_03]: So there's a lot of unknown.
[SPEAKER_03]: I was actually mentioning to you,
Laurie, before the event, there's a lot of
[SPEAKER_03]: distrust politically.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's also a lot of distrust in our
industry towards the politicians.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I think that the more we can connect
and demystify a lot of both ends of that,
[SPEAKER_03]: that would be really useful for us to see
a larger rollout.
[SPEAKER_03]: I think this has been less explosive
rollout than we had anticipated.
[SPEAKER_03]: So a lot of people spent a lot of money
and a lot of energy to gear up for not a
[SPEAKER_03]: lot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so that's been very frustrating.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I hope to see that evolve.
[SPEAKER_05]: Well, interesting.
[SPEAKER_05]: You mentioned the packaging relationship
with retailers.
[SPEAKER_05]: But before I get to that, I would say on
an overall 30,000 foot view of this has
[SPEAKER_05]: been the educating and talking to both the
vendors and the public.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because we have both basically to deal
with.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the public has been very frustrated
with the rising prices and the taxes and a
[SPEAKER_05]: lot of the education around that
component.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then also talking to the vendors.
[SPEAKER_05]: And some of us were talking about before,
everybody has their own interpretation on
[SPEAKER_05]: what's compliant and what's not.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it comes down to making a
determination within the business of where
[SPEAKER_05]: you're going to draw the line and what you
believe is going to be the right thing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Because ultimately, I think if the intent
is there and you're trying your best to be
[SPEAKER_05]: as compliant as you can in your own
capacity, then you're doing as well as you
[SPEAKER_05]: can.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just been a balancing act and
making sure.
[SPEAKER_05]: I think the July 1st transition was
fascinating.
[SPEAKER_05]: That's a good way to put it.
[SPEAKER_05]: It was inevitable.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think that we're a really
interesting place in California being the
[SPEAKER_05]: largest cannabis market in the world.
[SPEAKER_05]: And having just one chief overseeing the
largest cannabis market and trying to fit
[SPEAKER_05]: all the supply chains in together and
having everybody talk to each other and
[SPEAKER_05]: making sure that it's working and that we
all are on basically the same page.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it is a heavy lift, but I'm really glad
that it's happening.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I think if it's done right,
if people stay diligent, then it can be
[SPEAKER_05]: done.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's not entirely impossible, but there's
always going to be challenges and always
[SPEAKER_05]: going to be issues.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's also the working with the
local jurisdiction I think has also been a
[SPEAKER_05]: challenge.
[SPEAKER_05]: And that seemed to bring out a lot of
players that had never traditionally come
[SPEAKER_05]: out to challenge anything regarding
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: BPG has been around for almost 20 years
and most of the community members seemed
[SPEAKER_05]: fine with it.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then all of a sudden, January 1st,
there was this outpour of interest groups
[SPEAKER_05]: that were completely opposed.
[SPEAKER_05]: And it was shocking because nothing really
changed other than who we let in the door
[SPEAKER_05]: and tweaking security measures.
[SPEAKER_05]: So that was kind of a challenge.
[SPEAKER_00]: I agree with much that has been said
already.
[SPEAKER_00]: And to not repeat any of that,
I would say that it really does feel like
[SPEAKER_00]: we've all got our map on how to try to
succeed.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we're each interpreting those words
slightly differently as we make our way
[SPEAKER_00]: through this dark forest, because there's
no path.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's follow the map.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that's been the challenge is my
impression or my understanding of what
[SPEAKER_00]: these words say is a little bit different
than maybe somebody else's.
[SPEAKER_00]: And we've got to do business together.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that creates complexities.
[SPEAKER_00]: And at the same time, to make a separate
different point, I think that we're all
[SPEAKER_00]: able to understand and measure the success
of this growing regulated market.
[SPEAKER_00]: But we're not able to measure the health
and wellness of the illicit market that
[SPEAKER_00]: we're trying to deconstruct.
[SPEAKER_00]: And that presents a challenge to me,
because I can only understand whether
[SPEAKER_00]: we're making progress as a regulated
market, but not whether or not we are
[SPEAKER_00]: gaining ground on the illicit market.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so I think that's a lot of really good
lead into what cultivators are facing,
[SPEAKER_02]: especially existing cultivators,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a cultivation system that breaks
cultivators into sizes and scales them,
[SPEAKER_02]: right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So your 2,500 square feet or you're below
5,000 or you're below 10 or 22 or if
[SPEAKER_02]: you're outdoor, you can have up to an
acre.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so California has a 20-year-old
cannabis industry that's trying to wrap
[SPEAKER_02]: regulations around a very robust existing
industry.
[SPEAKER_02]: This has not been done before,
right?
[SPEAKER_02]: In most states, statute is passed,
regulations happen, and an industry is
[SPEAKER_02]: birthed, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: So here in California, we have a whole new
paradigm where these regulators are trying
[SPEAKER_02]: to figure out how to fit a multi-billion
dollar industry into a linear regulated
[SPEAKER_02]: box, so to say.
[SPEAKER_02]: So for existing cultivators, we're having
a lot of struggles.
[SPEAKER_02]: We didn't build our cultivation based on
500 square foot increments or 5,000 square
[SPEAKER_02]: foot increments.
[SPEAKER_02]: We built them a lot of times where they
fit in the landscape.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so what we're really struggling with
are these challenges around how to have
[SPEAKER_02]: 12,000 square feet when the licenses are
10,000 or 22, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: Economically, you don't fit into 22,000
square foot license and you don't really
[SPEAKER_02]: fit into 10,000 because you have 12,000.
[SPEAKER_02]: So a lot of our members and the existing
cultivators, especially the seasonal
[SPEAKER_02]: cultivators, I find are really struggling
with how to fit their existing operations
[SPEAKER_02]: into a regulated model that doesn't have
flexibility, right?
[SPEAKER_02]: It's really linear.
[SPEAKER_02]: And the issues around shared facilities,
if I have to have two licenses because I'm
[SPEAKER_02]: 12,000 square feet, I now can't share a
processing or a propagation area.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we have lots of providers that have
been working diligently to provide
[SPEAKER_02]: medicine for patients over the last 20
years that don't necessarily have the
[SPEAKER_02]: funding to build new facilities nor do
they have the space or necessarily the
[SPEAKER_02]: land use opportunities because of being
located rurally and they're on ag lands
[SPEAKER_02]: and not on commercial lands or industrial
lands.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we're kind of constantly trying to
figure out how to fit into a system after
[SPEAKER_02]: years and years of engaging and being
involved in Proposition 215 and SB 420 and
[SPEAKER_02]: feeling kind of really pulled in a
multitude of ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So it's a little bit of a kind of
quicksand scenario for a lot of our
[SPEAKER_02]: stakeholders and members.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
