[SPEAKER_01]: So, it's some granimals.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's animal cookies and you said grape,
grape, ape?
[SPEAKER_00]: Animal cookies and grape pie.
[SPEAKER_01]: Grape pie, sorry about that.
[SPEAKER_00]: And who grew it?
[SPEAKER_00]: Sun Kiss Gardens, I grew it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, you grew it?
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the man himself, yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's all craft cannabis from Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's super fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: Growing in the sun.
[SPEAKER_00]: Super fresh.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hold on a second.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's the granimals.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right, so tell me about it.
[SPEAKER_00]: This cannabis is grown organic from
Mendocino.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's finest cannabis tissue culture.
[SPEAKER_00]: So this started off in a petri dish.
[SPEAKER_00]: And I grew it and I veged it and I gave it
love and love and love and I cut her down
[SPEAKER_00]: perfectly.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is where I'm at right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: And this is some of the finest product I
have.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so, is that all you grow or do you
grow?
[SPEAKER_00]: I grow 22 strands this year.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm down to six strands.
[SPEAKER_00]: And it's all small batch, craft cannabis,
organic, hippie cannabis.
[SPEAKER_05]: So you're growing like raised beds?
[SPEAKER_00]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: We're doing living soil.
[SPEAKER_00]: We do pots.
[SPEAKER_00]: We love what we do.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's my heart and my soul.
[SPEAKER_00]: But yeah, this stuff right here is unreal.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's unreal.
[SPEAKER_05]: And how long are you in LA for?
[SPEAKER_00]: Actually, we do all over California.
[SPEAKER_00]: So I'm spontaneous about where I'm at.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to Sacramento.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to San Bernardino.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go to Oakland.
[SPEAKER_00]: I go everywhere.
[SPEAKER_00]: And actually, I'm on my way to catering
weddings.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's my goal.
[SPEAKER_00]: To have a dab bar and pre-rolls for
weddings in wine country.
[SPEAKER_05]: Okay, so that's what we're pressing.
[SPEAKER_00]: Stupid good.
[SPEAKER_00]: Granimals.
[SPEAKER_05]: Nobody has that right now.
[SPEAKER_00]: Nobody has that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's from the real Coronado and Colorado.
[SPEAKER_00]: He's the guy that made it.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm the one that grew it though.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then here we've got some prepared.
[SPEAKER_01]: And my own proprietary preparation method.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of companies will do BTS or bottle
textile.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a variation on that.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a little more efficient.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a chopped bottle.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is a, let's see, 90 micron bag,
courtesy of the Press Club.
[SPEAKER_01]: So far, they are my favorite company.
[SPEAKER_01]: In terms of bags, you can press bagless,
but only really small amounts.
[SPEAKER_01]: And it tends to not be as clean.
[SPEAKER_01]: You still have particulate in there.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I like going with bags.
[SPEAKER_01]: And we'll see how it comes out right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm also pressing this at a lower temp at
185.
[SPEAKER_01]: Press, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yes, correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a DIY rosin press.
Correct.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm using dab press plates on here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Shout out to them too.
[SPEAKER_01]: They're another really great company.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can go with a build that's much more
do-it-yourself than this, but I still had
[SPEAKER_01]: to come up with something that fit my own
style and budget compared to other
[SPEAKER_01]: companies that are out there.
[SPEAKER_01]: There are some great players in the rosin
press market or industry, but a lot of the
[SPEAKER_01]: presses out there are pretty pricey for
the average Joe Schmo who's just starting,
[SPEAKER_01]: wanting to press a little bit,
see how it goes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Not everyone's got a thousand bucks to
spend on experimenting for a bud,
[SPEAKER_01]: right?
[SPEAKER_01]: But these machines, I have two of them,
they cost way less than that to build.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I'm all about the DIY and trying to
empower the average guy or gal.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm gonna push it in a little bit further.
[SPEAKER_01]: Preparation is key.
[SPEAKER_01]: I am kind of fiddling with it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, this one's hand, but you could go
with electric, with a pump.
[SPEAKER_01]: A lot of it you use in your senses.
[SPEAKER_01]: You're going by what you see, what you
hear.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people, it's kind of loud here,
but some people listen for a sizzle.
[SPEAKER_01]: I like using my eyes.
[SPEAKER_01]: Once you see the oil start draining out,
that's usually when I start my time as
[SPEAKER_01]: well.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you look online or if you ask somebody
who presses, they'll have a long
[SPEAKER_01]: explanation about the best temperature,
the best time to leave it in.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, it's preferential.
[SPEAKER_01]: It depends on what I'm pressing.
[SPEAKER_01]: Right now I'm at 185, which is not the
lowest.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people press at like 170,
but I think the 80s are pretty good for
[SPEAKER_01]: getting a nice butter and preserving a lot
of turps, but also getting a good yield.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, I mean, a lot of people press,
what, in like the low 200s?
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually a range is 170F to about 220.
[SPEAKER_01]: But if you go into the 200s, even though
you end up getting a nice yield,
[SPEAKER_01]: you've sort of burnt off or destroyed some
of the turps.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it tends to come out a lot darker.
[SPEAKER_01]: And since there's less turps, it's not
really wet or saucy.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's more like shattered.
[SPEAKER_01]: I tend to prefer the batters.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's got more flavor.
[SPEAKER_01]: So when I start seeing a lot seeping out,
that's usually when I start my time.
[SPEAKER_01]: But again, I kind of play it by eye and by
ear.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going two and a half minutes.
[SPEAKER_01]: If my time runs out and it's still flowing
out a lot, I'll put an extra minute maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: If I hear it still sizzling, meaning
there's still oil sort of boiling out of
[SPEAKER_01]: the plant matter, then I know there's a
little more and I'll leave it a bit
[SPEAKER_01]: longer.
[SPEAKER_05]: So in terms of different cultivars and how
they yield, once we finish this,
[SPEAKER_05]: you kind of tell me how this stream does.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: What your thoughts are on what you just
pressed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Fair enough.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, this has a little bit longer to go.
[SPEAKER_01]: So in the meantime, let me just show you
something you can see there.
[SPEAKER_01]: Speaking of other cultivars, these are
some other presses I've done recently.
[SPEAKER_01]: This here is purple tangy, which was from
Stay High LAX.
[SPEAKER_01]: I don't believe they cultivated it,
but it was just some really nice bud.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's a sativa dominant hybrid.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one buttered up on the paper.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's completely stable.
[SPEAKER_01]: You can touch it.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's not sticky at all.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just smells like a fruit basket.
[SPEAKER_01]: It just punches you in the nose.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from Josh Wax.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is his Sea Biscuit A3, which I think
has won some competitions of its own,
[SPEAKER_01]: actually.
[SPEAKER_01]: This was just pressed, let's see,
two days ago.
[SPEAKER_01]: And left to cure for a little bit.
[SPEAKER_01]: Completely buttered up.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just extremely fragrant.
[SPEAKER_01]: Pressed at a low temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then on the other end of the spectrum,
[SPEAKER_01]: for personal use, I press a lot of hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these are hemp rosins, high CBD rosins.
[SPEAKER_01]: So these give you a lot of anti-anxiety,
anxiolytic relief, anti-inflammatory
[SPEAKER_01]: relief.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's going to help a lot of pain you
might have from old injuries or arthritis
[SPEAKER_01]: or whatever you have.
[SPEAKER_01]: Some people find it helps them sleep
better or recover from workouts faster.
[SPEAKER_01]: For me, honestly, it just helps with
anxiety and muscle pain.
[SPEAKER_01]: I have back pain, so.
[SPEAKER_01]: Scoliosis.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this one's almost ready, and I can just
tell by how it looks, it's starting to
[SPEAKER_01]: butter up already.
[SPEAKER_01]: See that frothiness?
[SPEAKER_01]: Once I take it out and get it on the cold
plate, it's going to butter up.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's our time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Just want to dry this off, make sure
there's no condensation.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a budget cold plate.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is a, this is a baking tin,
and you know, just a quick, yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's like 10 bucks compared to a
professional cold plate, which is like 80
[SPEAKER_01]: to 100.
[SPEAKER_01]: So.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, we don't have smell-o-vision,
but not yet, right?
[SPEAKER_01]: You know, when smell-o-vision finally
comes around, it's going to be stoners who
[SPEAKER_01]: really make the most use out of it.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to dab.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want to dab.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: We also got some corks.
[SPEAKER_01]: If, as long as someone's got a torch,
I don't have a, I'm out of butane.
[SPEAKER_01]: But yeah, the corks would be the best.
[SPEAKER_01]: These guys are hot already though.
[SPEAKER_01]: Or if someone's got a puffed dough or
something.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Here, let's.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I was going to do, I was going to do a
second press so I could really track the
[SPEAKER_01]: weight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Do you mind?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll be quick though.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's cool.
[SPEAKER_00]: Here, I want you guys to smoke on this
later too, okay?
[SPEAKER_00]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_00]: This is my head stash, so.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: I appreciate it.
[SPEAKER_00]: Definitely get in there.
[SPEAKER_05]: Can I get some too?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh yeah, it's all you guys.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah, follow my Instagram.
[SPEAKER_05]: I actually brought some Ziploc bags.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yes.
[SPEAKER_00]: As far as I'm concerned though,
this press very nicely.
[SPEAKER_00]: My Grand Canyon cannabis.
[SPEAKER_00]: Well, I could have got some cheaper stuff,
but this is my favorite.
[SPEAKER_00]: Awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that's a, that looks nice.
[SPEAKER_00]: That's a big yield for flower.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: And this is just the first press.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_01]: You said it was six and a half?
[SPEAKER_00]: Six and, yeah, 6.4.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, that gives me a cannabona.
[SPEAKER_00]: If I find my gelato 45 hash, it's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's over.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, my bubble hash is dabble bowl.
[SPEAKER_00]: So if you hit it on a high heat,
you get dabs all day.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_00]: Put love into it, man.
[SPEAKER_00]: Hey, they've no, they pressed my grand
animals.
[SPEAKER_00]: My, my, my head stash.
[SPEAKER_00]: He said 6.4.
[SPEAKER_05]: And what do you expect to get out of the
first and the second?
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm thinking total will be about one and a
half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Usually four grams of pretty good bud or
25% brings back a gram of rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: Cause the weight is about a quarter gram
per gram of flour.
[SPEAKER_01]: And that's assuming we can extract a
hundred percent of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: And realistically I'm getting in the
nineties.
[SPEAKER_01]: When you're done pressing, you typically
end up with these called rosin chips.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, some people will break the weed out
and try to smoke it, but I wouldn't
[SPEAKER_01]: recommend that because it's very harsh and
it doesn't have that much in it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's, you know, it's, you're going to
be smoking a lot for the effect.
[SPEAKER_01]: You'll get what I, exactly.
[SPEAKER_01]: You could soak it in alcohol, a high,
um, high proof, like ever clear or vodka,
[SPEAKER_01]: or I actually make it in a coconut oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: I cook it or you can do butter and there
you have edibles, can oil.
[SPEAKER_01]: But my point is there's no waste,
at least with the way I do it.
[SPEAKER_01]: So this is the second one.
[SPEAKER_01]: It's, uh, I don't usually leave them for
as long because it's already hot.
[SPEAKER_01]: It has a heat from the first round.
[SPEAKER_01]: I just want to quickly push out whatever
didn't come out the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then again, here's the strain.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh, whoops.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like diamonds.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'll let this out.
[SPEAKER_01]: And again, you can make presses or there
are presses that are much more compact
[SPEAKER_01]: than this, um, for, uh, six tons of
pressure, but a lot of them are very,
[SPEAKER_01]: very costly or, uh, just, just not as DIY,
I guess, is this one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, that smells pretty good.
[SPEAKER_01]: So the second presses are usually darker,
a little oilier.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, in some cases you start burning the
oil and that's why it's darker.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I'm going at a pretty low temp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So I think this is just getting to the
limits of the oil in this amount of weed.
[SPEAKER_01]: Eventually, if you keep cranking,
you'll get a really dark oil and that's
[SPEAKER_01]: actually, um, not even a cannabinoids
anymore.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's like a chlorophyll and you're
getting plant oils that you don't really
[SPEAKER_01]: want.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: The good stuff tends to come out in the
first two presses and that's what we've
[SPEAKER_01]: got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, beyond that you're, you're getting out
stuff you don't really want to be smoking.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna make it harsher.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: These are some presses I did, uh,
right before you got here.
[SPEAKER_01]: I showed you this one, but you can kind of
see it.
[SPEAKER_01]: This is from some hemp.
[SPEAKER_01]: So it's got a much more glassy shatter
kind of look to it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, usually hemp I press at a higher temp
so I can get a better yield out of it.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I got a lot the first time.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm going to weigh it right now.
[SPEAKER_01]: I know this is another hemp strain.
[SPEAKER_01]: Oh, that other one was super haze and this
is a lifter OG.
[SPEAKER_01]: So those are the presses I've done
tonight.
[SPEAKER_01]: Like I said, for myself, I do a lot of,
uh, uh, CBD pressing, CBD rosin.
[SPEAKER_01]: If you don't have a cold surface,
the scrape is, uh, really tedious and
[SPEAKER_01]: really annoying.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, you really want to use a cold surface.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, if you're at home, obviously something
like the freezer or, you know,
[SPEAKER_01]: maybe put a plate in the freezer for a
second to get cold.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, I like using the little entryway to
the freezer.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, there's usually going to be a nice
little flat platform, depending on how
[SPEAKER_01]: your doors open, if they open out sideways
or if you have the vertical stack ones.
[SPEAKER_01]: But, um, point is you need a cold surface
granite countertop.
[SPEAKER_01]: Uh, it can work pretty well too.
[SPEAKER_01]: And I'm leaving behind these little plant
bits because obviously we don't want those
[SPEAKER_01]: on the nail.
[SPEAKER_01]: This one.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah, look at that.
[SPEAKER_01]: And, uh, when it's really high quality
bud, a lot of times you can mix the first
[SPEAKER_01]: and the second press.
[SPEAKER_01]: For some people it is preferential.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but what I found is if they're done
close together, same temperature,
[SPEAKER_01]: um, it'll all mix together pretty well and
it will all butter up together.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, but I know some companies out there,
they definitely don't mix their first and
[SPEAKER_01]: second runs.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, for flower rosin, I think it's okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: Maybe for hash rosin, you want to,
um, you want to keep that first and second
[SPEAKER_01]: press or run separately.
[SPEAKER_01]: When it's this buttery, I also try to not,
uh, disturb that too much.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm not, not, uh, I want the butteriness
to be, uh, I want you to be able to dab
[SPEAKER_01]: that up.
[SPEAKER_01]: There you go.
[SPEAKER_03]: Look how easy that comes up.
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh,
[SPEAKER_01]: this is as a little piece, little piece.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at the color though.
[SPEAKER_05]: I got the exact same one.
[SPEAKER_01]: You cut me a little square at one of these
from that one maybe.
[SPEAKER_01]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_01]: I had another square a second ago.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_05]: All right.
[SPEAKER_05]: So what was it?
[SPEAKER_05]: 6.2?
[SPEAKER_01]: 6.4.
[SPEAKER_01]: This feels like, uh, a little over a gram
and a half.
[SPEAKER_01]: Um, based on 6.2 or 6.4, if it's 25%,
we should get about one and a half or so.
[SPEAKER_01]: So let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: A little under one and a half,
but that's, uh, let's see.
[SPEAKER_01]: I'm pleased about the quality.
[SPEAKER_01]: So you said 6.4.
[SPEAKER_01]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_01]: My bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: 21%.
[SPEAKER_01]: That's not bad.
[SPEAKER_01]: As long as you're in the twenties,
I think you're good, but, um, I can do
[SPEAKER_01]: better.
[SPEAKER_00]: I have done better before, but,
but in terms of the color and the quality,
[SPEAKER_01]: sorry, you guys aren't coyotes or
anything.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Look at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_01]: Well, here you are, sir.
[SPEAKER_01]: I, uh, let me get you like a jar or
something, but I ran out, but I'll get
[SPEAKER_01]: some more in a sec for my buddy.
[SPEAKER_01]: And then you can try some out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Brand new.
[SPEAKER_00]: I just got, I just harvested.
[SPEAKER_00]: I'm super excited.
[SPEAKER_01]: All right.
[SPEAKER_01]: Let's do this.
[SPEAKER_00]: It tastes like raisin bread.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh my God.
[SPEAKER_00]: Thank you.
[SPEAKER_00]: One love.
[SPEAKER_00]: Oh, I'm in pain, but it's a good thing.
[SPEAKER_00]: You heard a bigging.
[SPEAKER_00]: It's like bigging in my throat.
[SPEAKER_00]: Wow.
[SPEAKER_00]: It was awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are awesome.
[SPEAKER_00]: I love the energy.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are great.
[SPEAKER_00]: You guys are awesome.
