[SPEAKER_03]: I want to thank everyone for being here,
and I'm just wondering how many out there
[SPEAKER_03]: are home growers?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many of you are planting seeds?
[SPEAKER_03]: All right, great.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, thank you for coming.
[SPEAKER_03]: Really excited that you could be here
today.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, we're being joined by Nick from
Green Sores Gardens.
[SPEAKER_03]: Welcome.
[SPEAKER_03]: And we have Daniel here from Heart Rock
Mountain.
[SPEAKER_03]: And Forrest is joining us from Covillo.
[SPEAKER_04]: Sunroots Farm.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunroots.
[SPEAKER_03]: Sunroots Farm.
[SPEAKER_04]: In Covillo.
[SPEAKER_03]: In Covillo.
[SPEAKER_03]: Nice.
[SPEAKER_03]: So I'd like to just know a little bit
about your, from each one of you,
[SPEAKER_03]: just a brief introduction about your farm,
about the size of your farm, a little bit
[SPEAKER_03]: about what you have growing there.
[SPEAKER_03]: And a little bit also with your genetics
program.
[SPEAKER_06]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I'm Nick from Green Sores Gardens.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are up in just outside of Wolf Creek,
Oregon, southern Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're in the like foothills that begin the
makings of the Cascades.
[SPEAKER_06]: So the southwest beginning foothills of
the Cascades, I guess.
[SPEAKER_06]: They're mountains, but they're definitely
smaller.
[SPEAKER_06]: We live on a mountain that is called Post
Mountain.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're at 22,000 feet and 42 degrees
latitude.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the mountain that I live on is really
close to a really big mountain in the area
[SPEAKER_06]: that affects the climate in a wetter way.
[SPEAKER_06]: We're on the wet side of that mountain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Full sun, southern slope on this mountain
called Post Mountain.
[SPEAKER_06]: Hidden from the agricultural lands,
which is nice for breeding purposes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we grow all kinds of stuff.
[SPEAKER_06]: We are really interested in naturalized
perennials.
[SPEAKER_06]: Things that don't take a whole lot of
effort.
[SPEAKER_06]: And integrating those kinds of plant
cultures into production gardens is the
[SPEAKER_06]: way I believe we increase the water
infiltration.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's a big thing that we're doing
there, is working on the increased water
[SPEAKER_06]: infiltration of the upper watershed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then from a genetic standpoint,
cannabis-wise, I've been collecting a lot
[SPEAKER_06]: of genetics over the years.
[SPEAKER_06]: And every year I make a lot of seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I grow all from seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: So even for the production commercial
Oregon market, I grow everything from
[SPEAKER_06]: seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so I've had to really dive deep into
that process and how to make that
[SPEAKER_06]: available to the market in a way that the
market would receive it well.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so that's just taken me on a journey
of kind of specializing seeds in
[SPEAKER_06]: directions of all different types.
[SPEAKER_06]: But really looking at acclimating seeds
through that process as well as finding
[SPEAKER_06]: the dank that is easy to move on the
market and has to be that way at this
[SPEAKER_06]: point because it's super squeezed up there
in Oregon.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of producers and a lot of
retailers and not that many people.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's kind of the gist.
[SPEAKER_06]: In terms of projects, maybe we'll get into
that later.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have so many different directions and
ways that I'm going that I'll just leave
[SPEAKER_06]: it at that.
[SPEAKER_02]: Thanks, Nick.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm Daniel, and I'm in Heart Rock Mountain
Farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we're in Potter Valley.
[SPEAKER_02]: I was born on that farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: My dad started growing there in 77.
[SPEAKER_02]: He did a crop before that in Santa Cruz in
76.
[SPEAKER_02]: And 10 years before that in 1966,
he kept his first seeds that he found in
[SPEAKER_02]: the bottom of a bag.
[SPEAKER_02]: Now we have a 10,000 square foot
cultivation license.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have a nursery license that we've been
doing for two years.
[SPEAKER_02]: We use it just for seed production.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: I grew over 600 photo period plants that
were three foot to six foot tall for seed
[SPEAKER_02]: production this year and the year before.
[SPEAKER_02]: We have over 350 seed lots and five Otto
flowers.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm a bit of a crazy person because I just
keep making more.
[SPEAKER_02]: And just heritage strains that... And then
we interbreed them with designer genetics
[SPEAKER_02]: and just keep playing around.
[SPEAKER_05]: Hi, my name is Forrest.
[SPEAKER_05]: I'm born and raised in Covillo,
California in the mountains.
[SPEAKER_05]: And now I have a 10 acre farm in the
valley.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have animals and fruit trees and all
sorts of other things growing on the farm.
[SPEAKER_05]: The varieties that we grow are passed down
from my family for a while.
[SPEAKER_05]: And they've been climatized to the region.
[SPEAKER_05]: And we grow really big plants in full sun
that just showing their full expression
[SPEAKER_05]: each year throughout the season.
[SPEAKER_03]: Those are some big plants you grow.
[SPEAKER_03]: What were you saying?
[SPEAKER_03]: 20 pound plant?
[SPEAKER_03]: Really?
[SPEAKER_05]: We grow some big plants in Covillo.
[SPEAKER_05]: Not just my farm, but a lot of farms
around me.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wouldn't mind growing one of these big
plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Can you just give... And for these home
growers out there, I mean, come on,
[SPEAKER_03]: six 20 pound plants.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay, let's hear it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just a little some tips on how to grow
some big plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's all about timing.
[SPEAKER_05]: Having really good seed is really like the
first thing that you have to really think
[SPEAKER_05]: about.
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you growing?
[SPEAKER_05]: What are you growing for?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you brace them at all?
[SPEAKER_03]: What's that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you use braces or like kind of... Oh
yeah, I triple cage my plants throughout
[SPEAKER_05]: the growing season.
[SPEAKER_05]: You have to or else the wind will pick up
and take your whole plant down.
[SPEAKER_05]: So when they're small, I put a little
small cage.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then as soon as they start growing,
I'll put four fence posts around and put
[SPEAKER_05]: another seven foot cage, two feet up.
[SPEAKER_03]: So they have... Do they take a lot?
[SPEAKER_03]: I mean, you think to grow a plant that
big, it must use a lot of water.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is that what you found?
[SPEAKER_05]: We're really blessed where we are.
[SPEAKER_05]: We have a huge aquifer underneath the
valley and the wells that we use.
[SPEAKER_05]: They're only 50 feet deep right into some
really sweet water.
[SPEAKER_05]: I can just pump them all day and whatever
the plants don't use, it just goes right
[SPEAKER_05]: back into the water table.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I don't really feel bad about overusing
water.
[SPEAKER_05]: And the way we water our plants,
we use little spaghetti tubes every foot.
[SPEAKER_05]: So there's dry spots and wet spots.
[SPEAKER_05]: So the plant takes what it wants,
what it needs.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you breed for big plants too?
[SPEAKER_05]: Oh, absolutely.
[SPEAKER_05]: I want big plants.
[SPEAKER_05]: I really enjoy growing full season and
seeing how big they get.
[SPEAKER_05]: My brothers like to grow big plants too,
so it's really nice.
[SPEAKER_05]: We're a little competitive family.
[SPEAKER_05]: Who grew the biggest plant this year?
[SPEAKER_04]: Speaking of that, your family is pretty
prolific and known in the area.
[SPEAKER_04]: Maybe talk about some of the genetics that
have come through you and your family.
[SPEAKER_05]: The Jogu, that's one of my brother Mike's
strains that he crossed over 15 years.
[SPEAKER_05]: Collaborated with his good friend Noel.
[SPEAKER_05]: Probably a lot of people know Noel here.
[SPEAKER_05]: Since then, we've just been taking those
seeds and I've been just breeding what I
[SPEAKER_05]: like into them.
[SPEAKER_05]: I like a Skywalker goo.
[SPEAKER_05]: I crossed that with the goo and now I have
a Skywalker goo.
[SPEAKER_05]: And then there's the velvet perps that I
grow.
[SPEAKER_05]: I've crossed that into a lot of the other
ones that I grow now.
[SPEAKER_05]: So it's just really fun to see what comes
out of all the seeds because you never
[SPEAKER_05]: really know.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's so much fun to see what comes out of
all the seeds.
[SPEAKER_04]: One of the coolest things about doing the
Regenerative Cannabis Farm Award and doing
[SPEAKER_04]: the site visits is getting to connect with
people on all the different levels from
[SPEAKER_04]: the soil building.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the genetic aspect gets me really
excited.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've been obsessive for 20 years on this.
[SPEAKER_04]: And yeah, to see the work that you're
doing for a very specific thing.
[SPEAKER_04]: What do you want for your outcome is
always interesting.
[SPEAKER_04]: Working backwards and you want monster
plants and you're in the perfect place to
[SPEAKER_04]: do it and you have the perfect water
source to do it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And these are legitimately 20 pound
plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: I've seen them.
[SPEAKER_04]: Normally I'd be like, bullshit.
[SPEAKER_04]: You know how big a 10 pound plant is?
[SPEAKER_04]: And the flowers are flawless all the way
through too.
[SPEAKER_04]: But there's a lot of selection work going
on to make that happen.
[SPEAKER_04]: And what I really love too is seeing the
genetic sharing and then that cultural
[SPEAKER_04]: sharing, the background.
[SPEAKER_04]: Stories of these different genetics and
how they came to different places.
[SPEAKER_04]: And the first time I met Nick,
I was with my buddy Ryan who does Humboldt
[SPEAKER_04]: seed organization as well.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we gave him some seeds, some black dog
and some cherry, sorry, glazed cherries.
[SPEAKER_04]: And he's made like five F generations off
of those as well as amazing back crosses.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I get to see, and even those two
combined as well as all kinds of things.
[SPEAKER_04]: So I get to see stuff from so long ago
turn into all these other things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And every year we exchange a few other
things.
[SPEAKER_04]: We get to see cool things and we just did
the same.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I love seeing the sharing between
everyone.
[SPEAKER_04]: And like Daniel as well, just tons of
people's stuff all put together.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I see your stuff like at Moon Gazer
and all over the place.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like it's just really cool to see the
sharing between the Regen farms when it
[SPEAKER_04]: comes to genetics as well as all the
information.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Nick, do you want to tell maybe some
stories on some crosses and kind of
[SPEAKER_04]: sharing?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh yeah, maybe a little bit about your,
that amazing, that pink, what's that?
[SPEAKER_06]: Pinkleberry.
[SPEAKER_03]: Didn't that originate from Covolo
originally?
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, originally most of my backbone
genetics come from Covolo.
[SPEAKER_06]: So definitely.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so now kind of some of the things I
focus on, so there's this glazed cherries
[SPEAKER_06]: that I get that's just like the dank.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we all know what the dank is.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's why it's so good these days is
because everybody who grows has an eye for
[SPEAKER_06]: the dank.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the dank could mean many things,
but generally it involves a lot of resin
[SPEAKER_06]: and a lot of nose.
[SPEAKER_06]: And it's always that special one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And those are the selections we as
breeders are always hunting to make.
[SPEAKER_06]: But what I'm trying to do now is
understand kind of the technical
[SPEAKER_06]: components of breeding.
[SPEAKER_06]: I grew a lot of vegetables and I still do,
but I really just do it for the homestead
[SPEAKER_06]: and for my community and sharing and not
selling vegetables anymore.
[SPEAKER_06]: And focusing specifically my work on the
cannabis.
[SPEAKER_06]: But we have inbred lines, we have F1s,
and we have polyhybrids.
[SPEAKER_06]: And to understand these different
terminology is really important for a
[SPEAKER_06]: breeder, right?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I grow all from seed, so I'm really
interested in uniformity.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not so much, I've never grown a clone,
so I'm obviously not that interested in
[SPEAKER_06]: it.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, there is some benefits to having
some uniformity and as I go further with
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding, I look into this stuff and I do
some research and I try to understand how
[SPEAKER_06]: come the catalogs that you buy your
vegetables from are F1s and then they're
[SPEAKER_06]: super uniform and they have their own
name.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the reason that is is there's a
technical way to go about that process.
[SPEAKER_06]: And in cannabis you get an F1 and it might
express wildly and then it's not really an
[SPEAKER_06]: F1.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like we have to start
understanding the language and how we're
[SPEAKER_06]: saying, here's this, it's an F1 even
though both cuts that were used to make it
[SPEAKER_06]: were both polyhybrids, not really an F1,
so you're not going to get that
[SPEAKER_06]: uniformity.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I've been working on trying to
stabilize and inbred further lines and
[SPEAKER_06]: that just means generationally sibling
crossing these plants with the selections
[SPEAKER_06]: that I make to further whatever it was
called when I got it and whether it was
[SPEAKER_06]: truly what it was when I got it or not,
it's hard to say in this culture.
[SPEAKER_06]: However, the further we do continue to
inbred those lines and then use those
[SPEAKER_06]: inbred lines as our breeding stock to
create commercial production lines that
[SPEAKER_06]: are more about hybrid vigor.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's when we're coming into like,
okay, I want to grow all from seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, I want to grow F1s if I'm doing this
for the market just because it's from a
[SPEAKER_06]: business standpoint the most efficient
from seed type of seed to be running in
[SPEAKER_06]: your production field.
[SPEAKER_06]: But I need to maintain these inbred lines
and of as many varieties as possible so
[SPEAKER_06]: that I can continue to create new F1s and
now those F1s become the things that you
[SPEAKER_06]: name and then you have a lot of work to
stabilize that new variety into its own
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding stock.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you might change the name of something
with the F1 cross in order to because the
[SPEAKER_06]: further inbred you go, the more
predictable the traits in which you're
[SPEAKER_06]: breeding with become.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so two inbred lines that are stable
and I don't even really work with deeply
[SPEAKER_06]: inbred lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm talking F4, F5, F6 and I only grow
outdoor and I don't use light
[SPEAKER_06]: manipulation.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not running multiple generations in
a year and hurrying that process along.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the further inbred you go,
the more reliable real F1 you get.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I think in agriculture it's like you go
to F9 before you create an F1.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so you go to F9 with two very
different things and that cross of those
[SPEAKER_06]: two F9s becomes a new variety that's an
F1.
[SPEAKER_06]: And now you could stabilize that and make
that a different variety.
[SPEAKER_06]: But how many generations you got to go?
[SPEAKER_06]: A bunch.
[SPEAKER_06]: Like F9 in agriculture.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just want to share this information
as I learn it in the process, help you
[SPEAKER_06]: guys understand what you're looking at
when you see these and ask your breeders
[SPEAKER_06]: more in depth questions about what are you
talking about when you say back cross?
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm trying to get to bottom of this.
[SPEAKER_06]: What does that mean?
[SPEAKER_06]: It seems to mean something different to
everybody.
[SPEAKER_03]: How many plants are you talking about?
[SPEAKER_03]: When you're going back, how many plants do
you see?
[SPEAKER_03]: How many seeds are you planting?
[SPEAKER_03]: And how many plants are you looking at to
make these determinations from?
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm not working with huge populations,
but I have a 20,000 square foot production
[SPEAKER_06]: canopy and I pop about 100 seeds per
variety each year.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's a pretty good sift as far as I'm
concerned in comparison to what it has
[SPEAKER_06]: been.
[SPEAKER_03]: And also in terms of just observing and
what you can see.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have a question for Daniel as we're
talking about this and that is the
[SPEAKER_03]: intuitive side.
[SPEAKER_03]: And now we could just run a bunch of
numbers and also go that route,
[SPEAKER_03]: but then there's also just luck.
[SPEAKER_03]: There's just the intuitive side of okay,
it's there, it's going to show up.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's going to show itself.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm curious how you work with
intuition in breeding.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's also because my older brother was
the numbers guy.
[SPEAKER_02]: And he read every book there was and he
knew like, okay, I'm going to take this,
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm going to cross it with that,
I'm going to get this, I'm going to bring
[SPEAKER_02]: out this trait.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I'm just like, what do you want to be
pollinated with plant?
[SPEAKER_02]: But like Nick, I'm learning the science
now.
[SPEAKER_02]: And it's fun.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I've always considered myself to be a
plant whisperer.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you're the science people out there,
learn how to talk to the plants.
[SPEAKER_02]: And if you're the plant people,
learn the numbers.
[SPEAKER_02]: So we've been just making seeds,
but it was like a branch or two.
[SPEAKER_02]: We were harvesting pollen maybe from eight
males, pre-legalization.
[SPEAKER_02]: And now it's 50 different males,
multiple plants, 75 different males.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I only see maybe 10% of growing out 10
to 40 plants per seed lot and finding one
[SPEAKER_02]: or two out of those that is worthy of
pollen.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, because each year when you back
cross, the expression is a little
[SPEAKER_03]: different.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so one thing is just librarying and
holding on to some because then a few
[SPEAKER_03]: years down the road, you're like,
God, you know, that one year, that was the
[SPEAKER_03]: year that was really good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And thank goodness I got some seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: I can go back and plant those again.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, yeah, that was in taking your lines
different ways.
[SPEAKER_02]: So if you get down here to F6 and it's not
good, you have a couple other options to
[SPEAKER_02]: work with, especially with something
special that you like.
[SPEAKER_02]: You might want to try multiple directions.
[SPEAKER_03]: There are so many things that we could be
crossing all the time.
[SPEAKER_03]: And maybe like how do you stay focused?
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't know.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just go for it, you know.
[SPEAKER_02]: But it's also, you know, like Kelly from
Dragonfly Earth Medicine, she uses her
[SPEAKER_02]: like dowsing rod over the pendulum over
the seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: But I'm just hoping actually to get more
space so I, you know, don't have to pick
[SPEAKER_02]: and choose.
[SPEAKER_02]: I can just start them all.
[SPEAKER_04]: Dan really goes for it, by the way.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like I was walking through those plants.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like there's so much variety.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's so much.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like hard to like fully take it in.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I'm a total whirlwind with all that
insanity, too.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I have an exceptional memory,
like an elephant.
[SPEAKER_04]: Well, proper labeling is really important.
[SPEAKER_04]: So like when you realize there's something
like from four years ago and you just had
[SPEAKER_04]: those right numbers and letters on there
to know that it was the one that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: looking at.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can't have any doubts.
[SPEAKER_03]: Label, label, label.
[SPEAKER_03]: One mishap on a label.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh yeah, I'm starting to map out the
family tree as it, you know, before it
[SPEAKER_02]: gets away from me.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_03]: Forrest, do you want to answer or respond
to the question as well?
[SPEAKER_05]: So my breeding, I don't do it very
scientific either.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's more of just what I like in the
garden.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I kind of just go with my gut and see
where it leads me.
[SPEAKER_05]: And so far, it's been, it's worked out.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_05]: I don't crack so many seeds every year.
[SPEAKER_05]: The most I crack is probably like 500.
[SPEAKER_05]: And I usually don't even plant that many
because I don't need that many.
[SPEAKER_05]: So my breeding isn't as vast, but I still
have a lot of good stuff to breed with.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I just go with what I feel really.
[SPEAKER_03]: And for you, Nick, how do you find that
balance between intuition and numbers?
[SPEAKER_06]: I think they're both extremely valid.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we all probably have started from more
of an intuitive place and just like
[SPEAKER_06]: selecting the dank.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's no way a single breeder would like
walk around and be like, look at that
[SPEAKER_06]: crazy resin monster and be like,
nah.
[SPEAKER_06]: So, you know, that's the intuitive piece
is like, we all know what that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: If we've been growing, you, you'll know if
you haven't grown, you should grow some
[SPEAKER_06]: and you'll see one that stands out and
you'll be like, well, that's the one.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's what we make seeds with,
or that's what we'll focus on really elite
[SPEAKER_06]: lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe that's what the elite line is.
[SPEAKER_06]: You pop 40, four of them are amazing.
[SPEAKER_06]: Those are your elite lines.
[SPEAKER_06]: You're going to want to make seed with
those.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've just been doing that for a while now.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like from seed, I could pretty reliably
get a pretty, and I've got, I can get just
[SPEAKER_06]: good numbers.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can, you know, and the COAs have been
helpful for that.
[SPEAKER_06]: So like this whole marrying science and
intuition it's really, and like Daniel
[SPEAKER_06]: said, you know, if you're super
scientific, you should focus on balancing
[SPEAKER_06]: that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you're super intuitive,
you should focus on balancing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cause somewhere in the middle is where the
real magic really starts to come together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because even as I've gotten more say into
the language and terminology of breeding,
[SPEAKER_06]: it's really made a difference from how I'm
doing it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So it's like, you know, it, I am a
producer production farmer and I do
[SPEAKER_06]: provide for the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there is a certain pressure of test
results, maintaining a certain level.
[SPEAKER_06]: Well, if I get a multi-feno batch tested,
I get a good understanding of the potency
[SPEAKER_06]: of that genetic.
[SPEAKER_06]: I might not know what every single plant
is in terms of its quantity of
[SPEAKER_06]: cannabinoids completely, but I know that
within that genetic, I'm seeing this,
[SPEAKER_06]: this range of, of potency.
[SPEAKER_06]: And, and then there's this important
component where you go out of work with
[SPEAKER_06]: the ones that aren't that dank,
but have unique characteristics because
[SPEAKER_06]: those are the ones that you're going to
want to take and work with those really
[SPEAKER_06]: elite things to bring new, completely new
expressions around.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so if you're buying IBLs or inbred
lines for your seed stock, just understand
[SPEAKER_06]: those are probably bottlenecked pretty
good and have gone in a less vigorous
[SPEAKER_06]: direction, but they're probably more
uniform and stable to some extent to cross
[SPEAKER_06]: the board.
[SPEAKER_06]: But don't expect as much from them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you really want to be expecting
commercial viable uniformity that act
[SPEAKER_06]: similarly to each other and have similar
structure, then look at the F1s.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's just in general how agriculture
has been working.
[SPEAKER_06]: So open pollinated varieties and F1s are
what you see in seed catalogs.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you see, nobody sees F2, F3,
F4 on beets.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's not something that generally gets
brought to market.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's something that's being worked into
something that ends up bringing to market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cannabis right now, polyhybrids though are
really important.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're just growing to find an elite
cut that you want to just keep as a clone,
[SPEAKER_06]: get polyhybrids and they should be
cheaper.
[SPEAKER_06]: People aren't working that hard unless
they really have put time into some,
[SPEAKER_06]: but I'm like, if it's a polyhybrid or a
double polyhybrid or there's multiple
[SPEAKER_06]: parents on one side, multiple on the
other, like unless you were the one that
[SPEAKER_06]: created those parents, you didn't do that
much work to make it.
[SPEAKER_06]: Because any of us can buy some seed from
you and some seed from you and then mix
[SPEAKER_06]: them and make some incredible cannabis and
we should all be doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's really seed preservation work is a
lot of people doing that.
[SPEAKER_06]: We can sort it all out any time in the
future if we have the seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's the work that we can go further
into doing.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I just encourage everybody to buy
seeds, grow seeds, and make seeds and then
[SPEAKER_06]: our future should be more secure.
[SPEAKER_03]: It's really cool.
[SPEAKER_03]: Just one of the things is there's now that
we've entered this age of commercial
[SPEAKER_03]: cannabis, there's kind of this wanting to
just hold on to what you have and not
[SPEAKER_03]: share it and whatnot.
[SPEAKER_03]: And this culture of sharing that we have
is important.
[SPEAKER_03]: And I'm just wondering what your thoughts
are moving into the future into this,
[SPEAKER_03]: just into capitalism and also we're
sharing, but then also how do we balance
[SPEAKER_03]: sharing as well as making a profit?
[SPEAKER_02]: Well, it's interesting in the cannabis
industry now, people go, oh, big business
[SPEAKER_02]: and cannabis, what a shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: I'm like, no, big business, what a shame.
[SPEAKER_02]: The whole world over and we're definitely
on the brink of destruction because of
[SPEAKER_02]: predatory capitalism.
[SPEAKER_02]: But sharing seeds with your friends and
selling your best seeds to the community
[SPEAKER_02]: you're gonna take something and go a
totally different way than I'm gonna take
[SPEAKER_02]: something.
[SPEAKER_02]: And there's so much creativity within a
seed that you can really go any direction
[SPEAKER_02]: with it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah, I feel the same.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah, I really feel like sharing is the
direction that we need to go.
[SPEAKER_05]: I just got some seeds from BioVortex and
then I just crossed them and gave them
[SPEAKER_05]: back.
[SPEAKER_05]: Great names too.
[SPEAKER_05]: He gave me the Voltron and then I crossed
it with my Velvet Perps and now he's got
[SPEAKER_05]: Velvatron.
[SPEAKER_04]: And we're all stoked.
[SPEAKER_04]: Both Voltron and Velvetron are in the
calendar.
[SPEAKER_04]: There's Velvet Perps.
[SPEAKER_04]: And then there's Voltron.
[SPEAKER_04]: Grown by high water farms, dry farms too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Full circle.
[SPEAKER_03]: The sharing is also important because I've
heard stories from other farmers of how
[SPEAKER_03]: they've lost genetics because they did not
share them.
[SPEAKER_03]: And then years down they come back later
and they're like, wow, you've been growing
[SPEAKER_03]: this for all these years?
[SPEAKER_03]: Oh my God, there's that genetic that I
thought I lost.
[SPEAKER_03]: And so those are some pretty, yeah,
it's good to share and follow your heart
[SPEAKER_03]: and find partners that share the same
values.
[SPEAKER_02]: In California on production scale of it,
I can't make enough of one cultivator to
[SPEAKER_02]: make a difference.
[SPEAKER_02]: I got some Velvet Perp seeds from forests
and I'm gonna grow a batch of it out for
[SPEAKER_02]: production and it's not gonna mess with
his bottom line at all.
[SPEAKER_02]: It's gonna help him get his name out there
because I'll give him credit for it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And I crossed that with my Otto Flower
genetics and I'm gonna be happy the day I
[SPEAKER_02]: can hand them back on Otto Flower Velvet
Perps.
[SPEAKER_06]: So hold on, I wanna just jump on that.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just cause the question is just that this
whole weird place where it's like valuing
[SPEAKER_06]: your work, being supported and sharing and
then the fear that comes in that people
[SPEAKER_06]: have about, oh, if my seed ends up here.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm like, if somebody's supporting you by
purchasing and they take your seeds and
[SPEAKER_06]: make more seeds with it, that's like the
biggest honor.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we should all be doing that and nobody
owns it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm tired of this greedy eyeballs over
genetics.
[SPEAKER_06]: But at the same time, we need to value the
genetics that are being given all this
[SPEAKER_06]: work.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so we have to understand how to
support that process too because not
[SPEAKER_06]: everybody's as obsessed maybe as some of
us up here around how much time we spend
[SPEAKER_06]: with pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So there's a lot of tricks around that
too.
[SPEAKER_06]: And all the techniques to maintain less
pollen drift and to still have a viable
[SPEAKER_06]: crop within a production zone for the
market.
[SPEAKER_06]: All this stuff comes into consideration as
you're breeding and you realize,
[SPEAKER_06]: wow, man, there's a few seeds over here,
whoops.
[SPEAKER_06]: It happens, but I've never gotten a single
complaint in the market.
[SPEAKER_06]: Everybody's only giving me positive
feedback when they found seeds,
[SPEAKER_06]: but nobody owns the seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: We just take care of them and help them.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the power is through nature.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what designed them.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what created them.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we're just here to help them along.
[SPEAKER_03]: And the seeds too, they're not in track
and trace.
[SPEAKER_03]: So share them.
[SPEAKER_03]: You're home growers.
[SPEAKER_03]: You can have your seed production going on
as home growers and sharing amongst
[SPEAKER_03]: yourselves.
[SPEAKER_03]: So yeah, the seeds are there.
[SPEAKER_03]: They're free.
[SPEAKER_04]: So in the regenerative cannabis calendar
that we do, I get to feature all these
[SPEAKER_04]: farms and get different information from
them too.
[SPEAKER_04]: I share my own.
[SPEAKER_04]: But Nick wrote this really cool thing on
regenerative breeding points.
[SPEAKER_04]: But the quote we have here is,
somewhere something incredible is waiting
[SPEAKER_04]: to be known.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just the potential inside of seeds is so
amazing.
[SPEAKER_04]: The value that comes out of a seed blows
me away.
[SPEAKER_04]: To see something you worked on years ago
all over the world and to see it on
[SPEAKER_04]: beautiful farms with polyculture and to
see that sharing with other people.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's one of my favorite things.
[SPEAKER_04]: It warms my heart as an artist and a
human.
[SPEAKER_04]: But I want you to read these regenerative
points if you could, because they're
[SPEAKER_04]: really, really thoughtful.
[SPEAKER_04]: And I appreciate you putting that
together.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah, so this is just, when I think the
term regenerative breeding, I'm like,
[SPEAKER_06]: what is, that's such an interesting term,
right?
[SPEAKER_06]: Like, we're all trying to figure out what
that is.
[SPEAKER_06]: And we all realize we're striving for
regenerative and not really there yet.
[SPEAKER_06]: As a culture, as a people, we've got a few
generations before we end up in this
[SPEAKER_06]: regenerative space that we all want to be
in, just based on the infrastructure of
[SPEAKER_06]: society and capitalism.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if you get involved in selling things,
you got packaging trail that's pretty long
[SPEAKER_06]: and pretty much offsets all your potential
regenerative qualities.
[SPEAKER_06]: But regenerative breeding points,
I say, grow plants in the natural light
[SPEAKER_06]: cycle.
[SPEAKER_06]: That's all I do.
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't manipulate the light.
[SPEAKER_06]: You don't have to start them inside under
lights, wait until April.
[SPEAKER_06]: They want to wake up later.
[SPEAKER_06]: If they don't start outside, it's because
it's too cold.
[SPEAKER_06]: You manipulate their light cycle,
you don't know what they do naturally.
[SPEAKER_06]: So for me, regenerative is about natural
processes.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I'm only really interested in how they
work naturally with the earth and my
[SPEAKER_06]: climate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I just give myself to that whole
point.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's a natural process.
[SPEAKER_06]: And even though it's hard and not
everything works, it's worth it.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when we're talking regenerative,
yeah, is that the best technique in the
[SPEAKER_06]: world for specific things?
[SPEAKER_06]: Maybe not, but we're talking regenerative.
[SPEAKER_06]: Make intentional breeding selections by
setting goals for desired outcomes,
[SPEAKER_06]: like mold and disease resistance,
structure, color, aroma.
[SPEAKER_06]: Have a goal.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you're breeding, have some kind of
goal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It might be to make polyhybrids,
and then you don't need to be that
[SPEAKER_06]: specific.
[SPEAKER_06]: You meet your goal, you might make another
goal.
[SPEAKER_06]: And at some point it changes.
[SPEAKER_06]: And so just as long as you have a
direction you're going, you can at least
[SPEAKER_06]: be making a selection that's not just
like, I think this one.
[SPEAKER_06]: Use multiple males when collecting pollen
to strengthen the gene pool.
[SPEAKER_06]: This is important in the long-term seed
making of inbred lines especially.
[SPEAKER_06]: Many males gives you some more genetic
diversity.
[SPEAKER_06]: And after you've bottlenecked,
you want to try to, which is just reducing
[SPEAKER_06]: to say one male, one female, you might
start selecting more males, and you might
[SPEAKER_06]: start selecting similar-looking males,
but more males is better than fewer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So increasing that male population as it's
possible.
[SPEAKER_06]: The legality of all this cannabis stuff
puts a lot of restrictions on our
[SPEAKER_06]: methodology in terms of what we can and
can't do.
[SPEAKER_06]: So I wish I could save a lot more males
than I do, but such is the case someday.
[SPEAKER_06]: I say pollinate females mid-August to
mid-September.
[SPEAKER_06]: Getting past mid-September, you're
starting to run into that moldy time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So seeds aren't going to mature before
they start molding, so you just have less
[SPEAKER_06]: viable seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, you could still get some seeds,
and for a home scale that's great,
[SPEAKER_06]: but if you're wanting to make seeds,
you got to pollinate that with like five
[SPEAKER_06]: to, you want five to six weeks of
post-pollination.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you don't have that, then you just end
up with a bunch of immature seeds,
[SPEAKER_06]: and if you pollinate too late,
you have a bunch of seeds on the outside
[SPEAKER_06]: of the bud that are immature.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not ideal.
[SPEAKER_06]: It always sucks when you're cleaning seeds
and only three or four of the thousand you
[SPEAKER_06]: made are good.
[SPEAKER_06]: We've probably all done it.
[SPEAKER_06]: I have.
[SPEAKER_06]: Lower south-facing branches tend to be the
best.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, just full sun, best conditions,
less mold.
[SPEAKER_06]: And the north side of the plant and the
seeds make the buds tighter when they're
[SPEAKER_06]: really well seeded.
[SPEAKER_06]: So you run into more mold on seeded
branches, and so keeping those in the more
[SPEAKER_06]: sunlight is going to be a better place to
get more seeds.
[SPEAKER_06]: Clean seed and low, oh, this is important.
[SPEAKER_06]: So when you're packing your seeds or
making seeds for packs and you're just
[SPEAKER_06]: saving seeds, you know, manage your
climate.
[SPEAKER_06]: Low humidity.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you pack up a bunch of seeds in 85%
humidity, they're probably not going to be
[SPEAKER_06]: viable for very long because they're
trapped in some plastic or something that
[SPEAKER_06]: doesn't breathe, and the humidity is too
high in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: So just make it a point to run your
dehumidifier when you're packaging your
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds so that when you package them and
put them in that sealed container,
[SPEAKER_06]: those things are good when they open up.
[SPEAKER_04]: A point to that, too, if you're using
glass and you're refrigerating or freezing
[SPEAKER_04]: it, like, you need to make sure that that
container comes to room temperature and
[SPEAKER_04]: that room is dry before you open it
because it will just suck all that
[SPEAKER_04]: moisture in.
[SPEAKER_04]: Same's true with flowers and hash,
too, but just be mindful of it coming to
[SPEAKER_04]: room temperature.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you store them in the fridge,
which I do, pull them out and let them sit
[SPEAKER_06]: for five hours.
[SPEAKER_04]: Actually, keeping a dehum on before you
even open the fridge is good, too,
[SPEAKER_04]: so no moisture goes in when you open the
door.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then final, just, like, you want to
store your seeds for long-term viability.
[SPEAKER_06]: One, make sure they're packaged or they're
stored in low humidity, and then they'll
[SPEAKER_06]: remain that way for a long time.
[SPEAKER_06]: Cool temperatures are great.
[SPEAKER_06]: You can freeze.
[SPEAKER_06]: Not a big deal.
[SPEAKER_06]: I wouldn't be getting into the process of
freezing, thawing, freezing, thawing too
[SPEAKER_06]: much, but freezing is probably the longest
term.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you wanted to put, like, I want this
seed bank to be available in 50 years,
[SPEAKER_06]: it'll likely be just fine after 50 years
if it was put in the freezer dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: Now, for me, I'm mostly storing most of my
seeds just in a refrigerator and making
[SPEAKER_06]: sure that they were packaged right before
they go in there.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I've changed my packaging over the
years and been playing with that.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then the final tip is just breed every
year.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's really important because right now
the climate is changing rapidly.
[SPEAKER_06]: There's a lot of information that comes
through the seeds every season.
[SPEAKER_06]: If you just, like, keep one seed stock and
are always working off of that,
[SPEAKER_06]: that's fine.
[SPEAKER_06]: You might find, but, man, what about the
evolution of cannabis?
[SPEAKER_06]: That's what I'm really interested in.
[SPEAKER_06]: I rarely am jumping back into my old banks
and being like, man, I'm going to go back
[SPEAKER_06]: and hit that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm, like, way more excited about all
these projects and all the information
[SPEAKER_06]: that came with the season that's wrapped
up in that seed.
[SPEAKER_06]: And then that's the medicine when we smoke
gives us the information that we need from
[SPEAKER_06]: the planet in current time.
[SPEAKER_06]: So we're trying to get our updates from
our plants as evolved as possible and
[SPEAKER_06]: especially with the changing climate to
continue that evolution as much as we can.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's some breeding.
[SPEAKER_04]: That's fantastic.
Yeah.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a good joint's a great tool for
breeding, too.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just knowing the flavor and the effects.
[SPEAKER_06]: Oh, and a spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_06]: A spray bottle for pollen collectors.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just spray yourself off or to mess with
pollen because I'll be in and out of the
[SPEAKER_06]: garden.
[SPEAKER_06]: And if I don't spray myself down,
then everything gets a little bit of seed.
[SPEAKER_02]: I just have one thing to add to that.
[SPEAKER_02]: We noticed, you know, going from making a
branch to seeding whole plants that,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, just like a mom carrying a baby,
they needed more food.
[SPEAKER_02]: And so seeds for seeds, we sprout barley
or, you know, you could do sunflower,
[SPEAKER_02]: whatever you have, you know, and about two
ounces of sprouted seeds, blend it up,
[SPEAKER_02]: add it to five gallons of water,
and you feed it to your heavily seeded
[SPEAKER_02]: plants and they will mature top to the
bottom quicker, you know, on either side
[SPEAKER_02]: of the plant and shadier parts of your
farm.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, so just give them those
prenatals, you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: You want to add forest to that?
[SPEAKER_03]: Just some techniques?
[SPEAKER_05]: I usually just pollinate one branch at a
time.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I'll just select like the best plant
that I like and pollinate just one little
[SPEAKER_05]: branch.
[SPEAKER_05]: So I'm not pollinating a whole,
you know, big tree.
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay.
[SPEAKER_03]: Well, I do want to open it up to questions
from the audience.
[SPEAKER_03]: But before we do, I was going to have
Daniel read us a poem.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, so this is my ode to Luther Burbank,
who is a local Sonoma County legend and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, probably worldwide, you know,
plant botanist, not with cannabis,
[SPEAKER_02]: but, you know, he's done amazing things.
[SPEAKER_02]: And this poem is called Love Shapes the
World.
[SPEAKER_02]: Apart from scientific knowledge,
love accelerates evolution, Luther
[SPEAKER_02]: Burbank.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you know how he made the spineless
cactus?
[SPEAKER_02]: Listen to his words and I will tell you.
[SPEAKER_02]: I often spoke to the plant to create a
vibration of love.
[SPEAKER_02]: You do not need your defensive thorns,
I would tell them.
[SPEAKER_02]: I will protect you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And gradually, one generation,
the useful plant of the desert emerged in
[SPEAKER_02]: a thornless variety.
[SPEAKER_02]: Do you see just how love shapes the world?
[SPEAKER_02]: Someday, the future we will inherit is
shaped by our collective thoughts and
[SPEAKER_02]: actions.
[SPEAKER_02]: So speak wisely, step tenderly,
and love without measure.
[SPEAKER_02]: And someday, when we are kind enough,
gentle enough, and every thought and
[SPEAKER_02]: action is imbued with such love,
this world will drop its thorns.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there some questions from the
audience?
[SPEAKER_03]: You can come to this mic here if you have
a question.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah, I mean, you have to, when you
harvest it from the mail, you want to pull
[SPEAKER_02]: out the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: You want to pull out the plant matter or
any bugs and, you know, store it.
[SPEAKER_02]: I don't like to take mine in and out of
the fridge, you know, but it's only good
[SPEAKER_02]: for a couple months and then you can
freeze it.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then it's only good once and usually
you got like 20 minutes on there and,
[SPEAKER_02]: you know, keep it not cold.
[SPEAKER_02]: And yeah, I used over 45 different types
of frozen pollen on my auto flower project
[SPEAKER_02]: this summer.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you dry it just a little bit?
[SPEAKER_02]: I mean, yeah, it dries, yeah, a little
bit, yeah.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because you don't, before you input it,
I put it in jars with moisture packets
[SPEAKER_02]: because, and then, you know, you'll find
out if you didn't, if it wasn't dry
[SPEAKER_02]: pretty, you know, pretty quick.
[SPEAKER_02]: Because it cakes up and it's no good.
[SPEAKER_03]: And it's going to mold.
[SPEAKER_02]: Yeah.
[SPEAKER_06]: Pollen similar to seeds, if it's humid
out, you probably don't want to collect it
[SPEAKER_06]: and, you know, and store it.
[SPEAKER_06]: But if it's dry out, you're likely going
to have a better storage result.
[SPEAKER_06]: So also letting the pollen fall naturally
from the flowers and then making sure you
[SPEAKER_06]: get the flowers out.
[SPEAKER_06]: Of the pollen.
[SPEAKER_06]: So waiting for it to drop on its own is a
really important step.
[SPEAKER_06]: I mean, I know when I was really excited
and starting, I would like, be like,
[SPEAKER_06]: there's a flower and I'd start milking
that stuff out of there.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's not the way to go.
[SPEAKER_04]: Growing in a wet environment too,
like you really see how the males,
[SPEAKER_04]: they choose their time to release just
right.
[SPEAKER_04]: Like they pay attention.
[SPEAKER_04]: It's like, okay, it's about to be warm and
dry.
[SPEAKER_04]: We're about to get a breeze.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just paying attention to it.
[SPEAKER_04]: And a lot of times they're just like,
no, we're holding on to all this pollen
[SPEAKER_04]: because it just would immediately be
wasted.
[SPEAKER_03]: And on a hot day, we definitely want to be
watching them.
[SPEAKER_03]: They will pop on a hot day.
[SPEAKER_01]: I was just wondering if there's too dry
for seed storage.
[SPEAKER_01]: Is it okay to get it super duper dry?
[SPEAKER_06]: I don't know if too dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm always like go drier, but maybe you
know some more about that.
[SPEAKER_06]: I would just go drier.
[SPEAKER_06]: Dry.
[SPEAKER_06]: I've never seen anything dry not be a good
thing in the seed department, but I've
[SPEAKER_06]: seen moisture ruin seeds.
[SPEAKER_03]: How about your pollen drift just in your
garden?
[SPEAKER_03]: If you're in the commercial market and you
get some seeds in your buds, are you
[SPEAKER_03]: separating that okay?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or how is that going?
[SPEAKER_06]: Pollen drift, you have to be like,
if you're actually bringing your flower to
[SPEAKER_06]: shelf, there definitely needs to be a
series of checks on its way into your
[SPEAKER_06]: final bag and on its way to the retailer.
[SPEAKER_06]: And that's increased for us more as we've
done it longer.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that's important.
[SPEAKER_06]: We do, you know, that gets caught likely
in the trimming room.
[SPEAKER_06]: But the way to prevent that is to
understand when to pollinate.
[SPEAKER_06]: And maybe that's more crucial information
really is like, you're pollinating,
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm pollinating in the morning in calm
weather.
[SPEAKER_06]: And I used to do the evening, but I've
kind of like, it seems like the mornings
[SPEAKER_06]: are nice and still.
[SPEAKER_06]: So that seems to be the time that I've
been working with it.
[SPEAKER_06]: And get away with less pollen drift.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm also, again, the spray bottle.
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't encourage and emphasize enough.
[SPEAKER_06]: Just the spray bottle mentality.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a freak about spraying myself now
because of pollen drift in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is there a question back there?
[SPEAKER_02]: Where my farm at in Potter Valley,
you know, we're the end of a dirt road and
[SPEAKER_02]: there's a cattle ranch and the national
forest.
[SPEAKER_02]: And we get, you know, we're close enough
to the coast where we get the prevailing
[SPEAKER_02]: westerly.
[SPEAKER_02]: So the males are way up there and the
flowers are over here.
[SPEAKER_02]: And diligence too.
[SPEAKER_02]: You know, you're checking your males in a
hot day.
[SPEAKER_02]: You're checking them two, three times a
day.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then once they open, or start to open,
or right before they open, I'll cut them,
[SPEAKER_02]: jar them, and take them inside.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or they still get some light and they'll
finish flowering and drop a lot of pollen.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then I get up early in the morning and
now they've got the weather apps too.
[SPEAKER_02]: So I'll get up and I'm pollinating the
winter.
[SPEAKER_02]: The wind picks up.
[SPEAKER_02]: I check the weather app.
[SPEAKER_02]: Oh, it'll be still in an hour.
[SPEAKER_02]: And sure enough, the wind stopped.
[SPEAKER_02]: Or, you know, check the weather app the
night before.
[SPEAKER_02]: Four mile an hour winds, no thank you.
[SPEAKER_02]: And then when you get on the still morning
and there's no wind and you dip your
[SPEAKER_02]: paintbrush into the pollen and you can tap
it, you can literally see the pollen just
[SPEAKER_02]: fall straight down on the plant.
[SPEAKER_02]: And, you know, it doesn't go anywhere but
right there.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we live in the valley where we do get
some drift from other gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: It's kind of inevitable.
[SPEAKER_05]: So we do find some seed here and there but
it's really not that big a deal.
[SPEAKER_05]: One year it was a little bit more than
others but most of all it's been pretty
[SPEAKER_05]: good.
[SPEAKER_05]: For my pollen production, I usually just
keep my males like off to the side smaller
[SPEAKER_05]: and then just bring them in side right
before they pop so I don't get that drift.
[SPEAKER_05]: So keeping them separate and maybe
downwind from the prevailing wind is
[SPEAKER_05]: important.
[SPEAKER_04]: Having a good like wall of like plants or
foliage around or just any kind of block
[SPEAKER_04]: pollen is actually static in charge so it
actually wants to cling to things.
[SPEAKER_04]: And so just a lot of like trees or
branches and or walls like will actually
[SPEAKER_04]: stop a decent amount.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do either of you use the the biodynamic
calendar?
[SPEAKER_03]: Like do you maybe pollinate more often on
a flower moon?
[SPEAKER_03]: Have you seen that you use the the
biodynamic calendar?
[SPEAKER_03]: Or do you use moon?
[SPEAKER_05]: We do go by the biodynamic calendar for
some things but for pollination I haven't
[SPEAKER_05]: done it yet but maybe I will this year.
[SPEAKER_03]: I have in the past.
[SPEAKER_03]: In this year I slipped a little bit.
[SPEAKER_03]: I wasn't looking at the calendar as much
as I usually do.
[SPEAKER_05]: Definitely works for seed starting I've
found out.
[SPEAKER_05]: Like I planted one of my gardens.
[SPEAKER_05]: I have two 5,000 square foot gardens and
one of them I planted on a root day and
[SPEAKER_05]: one of them I planted on a flower day and
the ones that I planted on a flower day
[SPEAKER_05]: were just started to shoot up really quick
and had no you know they weren't just
[SPEAKER_05]: sitting there for a month where the other
garden was actually sitting there for a
[SPEAKER_05]: whole month before they even like started
growing so and the whole garden that whole
[SPEAKER_05]: garden was like predominantly larger than
the other one.
[SPEAKER_03]: The biodynamic calendar it looks at
different astrology and the signs so a
[SPEAKER_03]: flower is your is your air signs your your
Gemini and your Libra and Aquarius and so
anyway that's kind of the idea.
[SPEAKER_04]: Just part of the idea is the pushing and
pulling forces too that are happening at a
[SPEAKER_04]: certain moment like a certain variety
that's going to have be grown for roots or
[SPEAKER_04]: being grown for a green leaf to eat or for
a flower at the end that the pushing and
[SPEAKER_04]: pulling forces that are happening all the
time you know I mean we have our tides and
[SPEAKER_04]: everything there's all these things that
are affected by these pushes and pulls but
[SPEAKER_04]: to pay attention to you know what the
seeds do Maria Toon did a lot of work on
[SPEAKER_04]: paying attention to radishes and
documenting it and just showing that
[SPEAKER_04]: certain days you just get a completely
different production so it's as good to
[SPEAKER_04]: observe you know the different days that
you crack something and write that down
[SPEAKER_04]: and see what you know you can learn from
it and look what other people had learned
[SPEAKER_04]: from the biodynamic calendar.
[SPEAKER_06]: Yeah and it can give you a real basic
sense of just like how to stay in tune
[SPEAKER_06]: with the moon you know so you might make
practices that aren't maybe following the
[SPEAKER_06]: exact calendar but you're at least in tune
with how the calendar functions off of the
[SPEAKER_06]: moon cycle so understanding the greater
cosmic cycles gives you a chance to not
[SPEAKER_06]: need to write everything down because your
calendar is working with the calendar of
[SPEAKER_06]: nature so the moon is growing I'm planting
seeds the moon is waning I'm not planting
[SPEAKER_06]: seeds and I'm harvesting those are like
real general terms that aren't super
[SPEAKER_06]: specific biodynamic but come from that
mentality around how to do things.
[SPEAKER_03]: Are there any more questions here?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah?
[SPEAKER_03]: Okay the question that she asked was about
the creation of seed banks.
[SPEAKER_06]: It's happening.
[SPEAKER_06]: Anytime you make seeds you're making a
seed bank.
[SPEAKER_06]: I'm a big advocate of everybody making
their seed banks and the actual business
[SPEAKER_06]: of seed banks I think needs to be you know
yeah like a genetic preservation where you
[SPEAKER_06]: can access open source that is happening
yeah you'll have to look into it there's
[SPEAKER_06]: definitely people around with those ideas
and and it's an interesting one you know I
[SPEAKER_06]: just say keep your eyes real open on what
it's all coming from but I would say that
[SPEAKER_04]: the farming community like this
regenerative community like a lot of the
[SPEAKER_04]: people that you've seen here through the
weekend like that is a seed bank like Nick
[SPEAKER_04]: was saying like breeding storing seeds
you're storing a seed bank and these are
[SPEAKER_04]: people that are sharing with each other
and creating stuff in the generations and
[SPEAKER_04]: now it's in multiple different places
instead of just one and all of us have
[SPEAKER_04]: some of our genetics in each other's
library and you know just keeping growing
[SPEAKER_04]: like that I think is the way to get
through it because stuff like that can get
[SPEAKER_04]: kind of messy sometimes there's a lot of
bureaucracy and sharks and strangeness but
[SPEAKER_04]: I think the really just keeping it
community is a really great way to
[SPEAKER_04]: preserve genetics and seeds.
[SPEAKER_02]: So yeah I just want to share a story from
our farm this spring and summer we did for
[SPEAKER_02]: the first time at scale of open
pollination auto flower seed garden and
[SPEAKER_02]: the honeybees just went wild for the male
pollen and it was and their population was
[SPEAKER_02]: stronger all summer and it was just so
much fun to witness that happening I mean
[SPEAKER_02]: we have we have a lot of flowers just you
know we're Dragonfly Earth medicine but
[SPEAKER_02]: the they the cannabis pollen they were
swarming for it and and also like in my
[SPEAKER_02]: neighborhood no one does early summer
depths so I didn't have to worry about you
[SPEAKER_02]: know messing anybody's stuff up but it was
really beautiful to see that.
[SPEAKER_04]: A lot of times people ask like oh is the
honey better from pollen from the you know
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis but it's the nectar that goes
into the honey but but the pollen is a
[SPEAKER_04]: great source we just had Aidan with do the
regeneration of the honeybee and talking
[SPEAKER_04]: about the qualities of pollen and like you
know it's over 50 percent protein and it
[SPEAKER_04]: energizes you it's a food source and you
can collect it off bees in the hives when
[SPEAKER_04]: they like go into the hive and knock it
off but be kind of curious to eat some
[SPEAKER_04]: cannabis pollen though.
[SPEAKER_02]: Well yeah I actually sent some to the
company down in L.A.
[SPEAKER_02]: I've met him he does like the and other
things like floor wellness they do like
[SPEAKER_02]: the cannabis aphrodisiac oil and he wanted
research for pollen for you know like a
[SPEAKER_02]: male supplement you know I think pine
pollens like what a natural male
[SPEAKER_02]: testosterone booster and yeah so I think
we'll probably see cannabis pollen as a
[SPEAKER_02]: superfood in the future.
[SPEAKER_00]: I think we have a question.
[SPEAKER_00]: Yeah I just wanted to comment too on
something we recently learned together is
[SPEAKER_00]: when we're preserving seeds to not just
preserve the seeds but also maybe just
[SPEAKER_00]: like you press a flower preserve the
flower because that when you are thinking
[SPEAKER_00]: of starting a seed bank if you go to
different types of seed banks they're
[SPEAKER_00]: going to have a sample of the actual
flower that is so you can see the
[SPEAKER_00]: qualities for yourself so there is ways to
press a nug.
[SPEAKER_04]: Yeah so herbariums are a basis for botany
to understand a plant and to know like
[SPEAKER_04]: it's morphology and you're actually
preserving the genetics so it's just
[SPEAKER_04]: making a pressing on quality paper keeping
it dry and put some weight or pressure
[SPEAKER_04]: onto it and those get stored in an
herbarium so it's like a resource but that
[SPEAKER_04]: is a great way to kind of preserve the
information from something that you're
[SPEAKER_04]: working on.
[SPEAKER_04]: Canador is here and they that's something
that they work on as well as genetics.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah and then also you could store just
making some hash from that and the hash
[SPEAKER_03]: will store for quite some time and you can
go back and reflect on those flavor
[SPEAKER_03]: profiles later.
[SPEAKER_03]: Do you have any more questions?
[SPEAKER_03]: Yep in the back.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah yeah so he's asking about full yes
he's talking about the value of making
[SPEAKER_03]: your seeds outdoors with one crop under
the natural cycles.
[SPEAKER_06]: Look for it from your breeder if they're
doing that they should be letting you know
[SPEAKER_06]: because that's the nuance and difference
that we need so I don't know how many
[SPEAKER_06]: people are doing it in that strict of a
methodology but I am and that's green
[SPEAKER_06]: source garden so you know I try to make
available and I think it's everybody every
[SPEAKER_06]: farms responsibility to make available
literature trail or information that helps
[SPEAKER_06]: you understand the ethos of that farm so
you can resonate with something that you
[SPEAKER_06]: believe in and kind of follow that so as
farms producing and in the in the market
[SPEAKER_06]: we got to do the best we can to be
mission-driven and ethically forward and
[SPEAKER_06]: transparent about our practices and that
way you get what you read on the package
[SPEAKER_06]: and not just a bunch of corporate
bullshit.
[SPEAKER_03]: Is do Daniel or Forest do you use mix
light at all in your genetics program?
[SPEAKER_02]: No but with the ruderalius I did something
first for the first time this year I made
[SPEAKER_02]: an f1 and then the f2 in the same summer
which was fun and and we're also in a
[SPEAKER_02]: little bit of a banana belt there.
[SPEAKER_02]: Last December I harvested Panama red seeds
on the 15th and some other land-raised
[SPEAKER_02]: stuff in a greenhouse you know but no no
mix light.
[SPEAKER_05]: Yeah we don't use any mix light either I
feel like it's really important for all of
[SPEAKER_05]: us to if we can breed do it make more seed
share the seed and you know.
[SPEAKER_03]: I do in my in my home grow I do a mix
light because I get excited about my new
[SPEAKER_03]: cross so then I want to plant the seeds
right away so I'm gonna go home from the
[SPEAKER_03]: animal cup and plant my seeds and start
fino hunting and maybe I'll get some
[SPEAKER_03]: cuttings for the for the next season but
yeah I will kind of just because I want to
[SPEAKER_03]: see what what the different just what the
expression is and I can only do a few it's
[SPEAKER_03]: very limited in space but it's fun.
[SPEAKER_04]: You should tell us a little bit about your
cultivation practices and she dry farms
[SPEAKER_04]: and tell a little bit about it.
[SPEAKER_03]: Yeah I dry farms I kind of have this
philosophy of do nothing farming and do
[SPEAKER_03]: nothing farming is really based on looking
at nature to to guide me in in what I do
[SPEAKER_03]: and I don't want to say I'm lazy but maybe
that's a part of it too but um I do I also
[SPEAKER_03]: do a few I make some crosses and yeah I
have a home grow where I explore some it's
[SPEAKER_03]: like my research garden and so I'll do a
few things in there and I'll do some some
[SPEAKER_03]: winter gardening and it's also temperate
so I don't have to worry about heat and
[SPEAKER_03]: whatnot I just but yeah so that's just I
I've been seeing over time that some some
[SPEAKER_03]: things do better with the dry farming when
well when you first plant there's some
[SPEAKER_03]: things that will take better and I also I
don't use like greenhouses I just put the
[SPEAKER_03]: plants under the sky and the stars in the
rain and and in the nursery phase and I
[SPEAKER_03]: feel that that helps them because they're
right next to the garden because the
[SPEAKER_03]: greenhouse adds a lot of different
stressors and different things and they
[SPEAKER_03]: start needing more nutrients and so
without that they just seem to to grow
[SPEAKER_03]: grow better but yeah I'm located on the in
the Eel River Valley in across from from
[SPEAKER_03]: Shively where there's some amazing dry
farmers over there and my friend Jane from
[SPEAKER_03]: organic medicinal she is the one who
turned me on to dry farming and I just
[SPEAKER_03]: thank her very much for it because it's
through that that I really found myself as
[SPEAKER_03]: a farmer and Bill Reynolds too oh yeah
Bill Bill Reynolds was a big I'm still I
[SPEAKER_03]: grow all of his veggies the dark star
zucchini and the melon and anyway but
[SPEAKER_05]: we're coming here to the end did you find
any varieties that like do better in dry
[SPEAKER_03]: farming have you found yeah but they are
everything takes pretty well a lot of it
[SPEAKER_03]: is just getting a natural expression of
the land and just seeing what the genetics
[SPEAKER_03]: are with as little inputs and interference
on my part all right well we're at the
[SPEAKER_03]: close here and is there any more closing
remarks which you'd like to make some
[SPEAKER_02]: closing remarks just yeah more love more
seeds you know power to people yeah
[SPEAKER_06]: I can't express enough like it really is
the most viable seed bank is with us all
[SPEAKER_06]: and so if we're connected to that source
the future is looking good but if you're
[SPEAKER_06]: disconnected from that and relying on
other people to make all that it's it's
[SPEAKER_06]: not as secure for you so you can go in
this direction where it's like it doesn't
[SPEAKER_06]: have to be a ton of seed and it doesn't
have to be cannabis it just needs to be
[SPEAKER_06]: this act of participating in humanity
that's been doing this for so long so
[SPEAKER_06]: let's reconnect with our ancient selves
and become close to this earth once again
[SPEAKER_02]: and take care of it yeah you know that
this really could be the Garden of Eden
[SPEAKER_05]: that's if I think we have to clean it up
first though yeah and keep making seed and
[SPEAKER_04]: keep sharing seed yeah thank you and do
things with love just do the things that
[SPEAKER_04]: you care about with love interact with
your community with love breed with love
[SPEAKER_04]: put that into it you know like Luther Burr
fake just saying like it's powerful what
[SPEAKER_03]: what that can lead to it's it's it's like
it's a connection of of love that it's
[SPEAKER_03]: it's the guidance of nature and our in our
connection with love that makes this
[SPEAKER_03]: beautiful nature that we're learning from
every day
